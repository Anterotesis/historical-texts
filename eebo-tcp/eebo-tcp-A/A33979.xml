            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>COURTEOUS READER,</head>
            <p>ALthough where the queſtion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> or <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of any action, the pleading of <hi>Antiquity</hi> be a great <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency;</hi> and if the <hi>Plea</hi> be true, it can riſe no higher than a <hi>preſumptive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and be ſo far from a <hi>demonſtration,</hi> that it is not a good <hi>Topick</hi> (for there is no <hi>preſcribing</hi> to error). So that nothing can incline the <hi>ſcale of Conſcience,</hi> in which every one is obliged to weigh every Propoſition relating to his practice, but his <hi>apprehenſion of the revealed will of God,</hi> either from the <hi>letter,</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>Holy Writ;</hi> yet becauſe every one is not thus <hi>ſpiritually inſtructed,</hi> and it makes a great noiſe to hear men talking, That <hi>the Church in all ages,</hi> all <hi>the Fathers judged</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61196:3"/>
               <hi>otherwiſe than theſe men;</hi> and if it were true in any caſe, it ought highly to oblige all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> again and again to examine thoſe arguments upon which they have founded their <hi>particular practical judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I (who know the world too well to believe all that I read in mens Books) have thought it reaſonable to examine what Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Pelling,</hi> have ſaid to prove the pretended <hi>antiquity of forms of prayer as generally uſed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be uſed by Miniſters in their publick Miniſtrations as to Prayer.</hi> I the rather did it, becauſe truly Mr. <hi>Falconer</hi> hath ſaid as much as hath been ſaid on that argument, or as that Cauſe will bear. The <hi>Reader</hi> will find Mr. <hi>Pelling</hi> hath added little but words. I muſt profeſs to my <hi>Reader,</hi> there appears to me no ſhadow or pretence of proof of the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Boniface's</hi> time, more than 600 years after Chriſt; nor do I believe any can be made to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any inquiſitive man. I leave it to thee to judg, whether I have not given a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>anſwer</hi> to any thing brought by theſe
<pb facs="tcp:61196:3"/>
two, and ſhewed that they have made no proof that can ſatisfie the conſcience of any man of any reaſonable underſtanding, and thinks the <hi>thing is unlawful;</hi> if indeed it were a thing granted <hi>indifferent,</hi> theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flouriſhes might do ſomething; but the conſcience of a good man judging a thing unlawful, from grounds of <hi>Scripture and Reaſon,</hi> cannot be diſpoſſeſſed of that <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by any thing but by <hi>Scripture and Reaſon:</hi> and though the <hi>general judgment of the Church might ſtumble him,</hi> if his <hi>opinion were contrary;</hi> yet that <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgment</hi> muſt be proved, not meerly talkt of, and plainly proved too, before it can have any operation at all. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either of theſe Authors have done this, I leave thee to judg. The one of them is very confident, and can ſpeak nothing of this nature, in a lower ſtile than with <hi>queſtionleſs, doubtleſs, without all doubt.</hi> The other, though much <hi>more modeſt,</hi> yet poſſibly hath ſome <hi>freer</hi> and <hi>ſmarter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> in his Pages on this Argument than in any other part of his Book. But my humour is always to ſuſpect a ſoft place in
<pb facs="tcp:61196:4"/>
that part of any Book, where I meet with moſt <hi>confidence</hi> or <hi>paſſion. Reaſon</hi> is ſo beautiful and noble a thing, that it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the ſervice of <hi>paſſion,</hi> or <hi>paint of confidence.</hi> It commends it ſelf to the next rational ſoul it meets with, without any ſuch <hi>black patch,</hi> or <hi>foot-boy</hi> at its heels. I will freely tell thee my <hi>opinion</hi> about <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> in publick Miniſtrations, not impoſing upon thee with any ſuch thing, as <hi>queſtionleſs,</hi> and <hi>without doubt.</hi> I do believe that <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> are very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; that is, that there were by ſome good and pious men <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> made, both for their own publick uſe, and for the private inſtruction of others, and teaching them to pray <hi>without forms.</hi> I do think that our Saviour Chriſt made the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> for the temporary uſe of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, not ſo as to oblige them to uſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to uſe that <hi>Sillabically,</hi> but to pray for thoſe things either in thoſe words, or other words, and that they might for a time uſe that very form <hi>particularly</hi> until his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> after which I believe they were obliged to a more
<pb facs="tcp:61196:4"/>
particular mention of his ſacred name. I believe that <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> were much more in uſe before the <hi>pouring out of Gods Spirit</hi> in the days of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> than after; for although the effects of that <hi>effuſion of the Spirit</hi> were ſome of them peculiar to the Apoſtles (ſuch as <hi>ſpeaking with Tongues, Miracles, Healing,</hi> &amp;c.) yet from that day to this I believe from <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. there hath been a more full effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>ſpirit of grace and ſupplication</hi> upon all, both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> than ever was before generally. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, in regard that until men come to believe, and be Chriſtians indeed, they have not the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and even then the Spirit of God works in them by the uſe of means, I do believe there were many <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> made by good men, teaching <hi>beginners</hi> in <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> how to <hi>pray,</hi> and what to pray for. I am not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to believe that many both Miniſters and people in thoſe days might make uſe of ſuch forms till their exerciſe in Scripture, and in the ways of God, rendred them as to them needleſs, and turned what were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:61196:5"/>
               <hi>helpers,</hi> into <hi>hinderances of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But I believe it cannot be proved that for more than 400 years after Chriſt, any one <hi>Church</hi> commanded her Miniſters <hi>generally</hi> to uſe <hi>ſuch,</hi> and <hi>no other,</hi> in any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part of their publick miniſtration; though poſſibly ſome particular men that had not the <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> or at leaſt feared themſelves, or ſuſpected they had it not, might uſe ſome <hi>forms</hi> made before by themſelves or ſome others. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great (who is commonly call'd the <hi>worſt of all that went before him,</hi> though the beſt of all the <hi>Popes</hi> that followed him) I believe was the firſt that <hi>commanded</hi> the <hi>general</hi> uſe of <hi>forms of Prayer</hi> by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in their <hi>publick Miniſtrations. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> ſaith thus of him, <hi>What ſhould I ſpeak more of this moſt holy man? for all the ordering of the Eccleſiaſtical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, eſpecially the old one, was by him invented and approved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haec in Canonem redegit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Platina. There were ſome free forms up and down, and ſome particular orders in ſome Churches</hi> (none forced;) <hi>but he</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61196:5"/>
               <hi>brought them into a Canon.</hi> Platina (who was a later Popes Secretary) ſaith, he came not to be <hi>Pope</hi> before 619.</p>
            <p>Yet it plainly appears by <hi>Pope Gregories</hi> anſwer to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the <hi>Monks</hi> queſtions which he ſent to him out of <hi>England,</hi> that he did not tye all to the uſe of his Miſſal. <hi>It pleaſeth me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citouſly make choice of what you find in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> France, <hi>or any other Church, which may beſt pleaſe God, and infuſe it into the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Church, which is yet young in the faith, particularly inſtructing it in things which you can gather out of many Churches; for things are not to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for places, but places are to be loved for good things. I therefore out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches pick out what things are pious, religious and right, and do you accuſtom your</hi> Engliſh <hi>mens minds to theſe things collected in a bundle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some years after, by <hi>ſucceeding Popes</hi> it was <hi>enforced;</hi> and by <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> about 800, if we may believe <hi>Durandus.</hi> The <hi>Popes</hi> were then at ſuch an heighth, as
<pb facs="tcp:61196:6"/>
they could not expect that they and their <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould be quiet, if they had a <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> conſiſting of men of <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>piety;</hi> they therefore ſuffered any <hi>ignorant ſottiſh perſons</hi> to fill the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> who (ſo they might be gratified in their luſts and <hi>lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>) would fawn upon the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of thoſe times, and humour their <hi>ſuperſtition, pride,</hi> and <hi>luxury,</hi> and <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,</hi> provided they would humour them in <hi>ſparing their luſts,</hi> and their <hi>pains;</hi> the latter of which was eminently done by enjoining all Miniſters to uſe the ſame <hi>Miſſal,</hi> and laying all <hi>Religion</hi> in the uſe of it, and making <hi>Preaching</hi> a rare and almoſt uſeleſs thing, or a <hi>Lecturing</hi> out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and the <hi>Legend,</hi> and this was the whole trade till the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1516. Nor can I think this would have ſo generally been ſwallowed by <hi>people,</hi> but for another unhappy accident. About this time <hi>Latin</hi> was the common language of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and in that language their Divine ſervice was; but the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> and other <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> over-ran theſe Countrys, and poſſeſſed
<pb facs="tcp:61196:6"/>
them for many years, which corrupted the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, ſo that it was underſtood no where ordinarily, though the <hi>Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> languages are manifeſt <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects</hi> of it; but ſtill the <hi>Maſs-book</hi> was not altered. Thus came in the <hi>Latin</hi> ſervice, uſed in <hi>Popery</hi> till the <hi>Reformation,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by very few of them that heard it. So the <hi>Papiſts</hi> worſhipped <hi>they knew not how;</hi> and being <hi>ignorant,</hi> were very <hi>tame.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Reformation</hi> began in <hi>Germany</hi> 1517; in <hi>England</hi> not to ſpeak on, till <hi>Edward the Sixths</hi> time, 1547; and had a preſent interruption of five years, after it had been on foot ſeven years; then began ſomething more to purpoſe with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1558; in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi> it was ſooner 1535.</p>
            <p>It is true, our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> both in King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time, thought fit to compoſe a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or rather to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> what was uſed in <hi>Popery,</hi> leaving out the idolatrous and highly ſuperſtitious part of the <hi>Maſs-book.</hi> Yea, they thought fit to command the univerſal uſe of it, under <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,</hi> which may charitably be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:61196:7"/>
to prevent a <hi>Popiſh Clergy,</hi> or a <hi>Clergy</hi> newly reform'd from <hi>Popery,</hi> uſing their old <hi>Mumpſimus.</hi> Nor indeed in that face of things was it reaſonable to expect that any number of Miniſters ſhould be able to pray as they ought in publick; and if they were not, they might for a time law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe <hi>forms.</hi> Yet whoſo will read the Book called, <hi>The troubles at Francfort,</hi> will find that even then all godly Miniſters and people did not judg it lawful; which much more appeared in the ſucceeding years of the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Ch. I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time it muſt be agreed, many both <hi>learned, godly,</hi> and <hi>worthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> did thus perform their <hi>Miniſterial</hi> acts in <hi>ſolemn publick prayer,</hi> and ſo do many now, which ſpeaks them to judg it <hi>lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miniſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts in <hi>England,</hi> all thoſe in <hi>New-England</hi> judg otherwiſe; and we believe many hundreds that <hi>conform</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> think it <hi>juſt lawful,</hi> not <hi>eligible;</hi> only a thing may be <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to, rather than lay
<pb facs="tcp:61196:7"/>
down their Miniſtry. If this be not as to matter of practiſe, the true ſtate of the caſe as to <hi>Forms of Prayer to be univerſally enjoined or uſed,</hi> I muſt confeſs I do not underſtand it, and ſhould gladly learn of thoſe that are wiſer. But let us now enquire what is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Falconer,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Pelling.</hi>

That it muſt be a raſh ſentence to condemn Forms of Prayer as evil and ſinful, which were embraced by the ancient Church whiles it retained its ſoundneſs, and before the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtempers of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>took place, and by the Proteſtant Churches ſince their recovery therefrom.

            </p>
            <p>Leſt ſome leſs judicious perſon meetingwith
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61196:11"/>
this, ſhould think us ſtrange perſons, I have thought it reaſonable to review the premiſes of that <hi>Section</hi> upon which this <hi>concluſion</hi> is raiſed. I ſhall only deſire the Reader to conſider, that little of this doth concern the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who are perfectly of the mind expreſſed in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſheets.</p>
            <p>1. For they do not condemn Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as <hi>evil and unlawful,</hi> they do believe them good in their kind and uſe; they believe them <hi>good</hi> to be uſed for the <hi>inſtruction of people,</hi> and to help them in the acquiſition of the gift; and poſſibly they do think that <hi>John</hi> might thus <hi>teach his diſciples to pray,</hi> giving them <hi>Forms,</hi> from which they might learn the <hi>ſum</hi> of what they were to ask of God; and many of them will yield, that the <hi>Lords-prayer</hi> was by <hi>Christ</hi> given to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, not to be uſed by them all their lives time in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, but as a <hi>Summary</hi> of what things they ſhould ask of God, in what words they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>2. For <hi>Devotion:</hi> the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> will grant that men and women, (yea ſuch as the Church (for want of better) may be forced to uſe in the Miniſtry) may pray by the <hi>preſcribed Forms of others.</hi> They indeed do not think this to be <hi>that prayer</hi> which God requires of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; but they think thus the <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>people</hi> too may pray <hi>mentally;</hi> and thoſe who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61196:12"/>
join with another perſon miniſtring in prayer, never do more.</p>
            <p>§. 2. For what this Author ſaith,—<hi>Which were embraced by the ancient Church, whiles it retained its ſoundneſs, and before the corruptions and diſtempers of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>took place, and by the Proteſtant Church ſince its recovery there-from.</hi>—We will by and by examine how far that is true, and upon what grounds he ſpeaks it.</p>
            <p>But what doth he mean by the <hi>Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God himſelf under the Old Teſtament, and our bleſſed Saviour in the New?</hi> If it be any thing to the purpoſe, it is not eaſie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Doth he mean that either God under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> or our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> under the <hi>New,</hi> hath determined, that it is <hi>lawful</hi> for ſome particular men, be they Archbiſhops, or Biſhops, or any other, to compoſe <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> to be uſed <hi>by all Miniſters in the Church,</hi> and that it is <hi>lawful for them to uſe them,</hi> and to <hi>perform their Miniſterial acts in prayer by the uſe of them?</hi> ſo one would think the words ſound; but he hath not ſpoken a word to prove this. This indeed would determine the buſineſs. Or doth he mean that God by preſcribing ſome Forms himſelf, or inſpiring ſome Prophets and holy men to do it; or that Chriſt by preſcribing a <hi>Form of prayer</hi> to be uſed by his Diſciples, hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61196:12"/>
determined, That <hi>Forms of prayer</hi> are not like <hi>forms of blaſphemy,</hi> which <hi>God himſelf cannot make lawful,</hi> being in their own nature evil; but ſuch things as his command may make law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or neceſſary. This none ever denied: The queſtion is, <hi>Whether they be not ſuch things</hi> as with reference to ſome men in <hi>ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nothing but the command of God can make lawful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the ſame things may be <hi>ſinful</hi> as to <hi>ſome men,</hi> which may be <hi>lawful,</hi> yea and neceſſary to others. It is lawful, yea neceſſary, for thoſe who cannot otherwiſe avoid burning with luſt, to marry; it may be ſinful for others who are <hi>Eunuchs</hi> by nature; and lawful for ſome to make themſelves <hi>Eunuchs</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom of heavens ſake;</hi> expedient for others for the <hi>preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.) The having, or not having the <hi>gift of continence</hi> makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; as in the preſent caſe the having, or not having the <hi>gift of prayer</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>§. 3. God or Chriſts immediate command may make things of this nature neceſſary, which have no eſſential and inſeparable evil in them; ſo that whatever is ſaid of Gods preſcribing <hi>Forms of prayer</hi> ſometimes, and Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a Form, ſignifies juſt nothing; nor can poſſibly amount to more than this: <hi>Therefore Forms of prayer are not in their own nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61196:13"/>
               <hi>abſtractly from Gods will revealed in his word, ſinful.</hi> Or, <hi>therefore God may, or Chriſt may command us Forms of prayer now to be uſed in our Miniſtry;</hi> or <hi>may commiſſionate others to do it.</hi> Now all this will be granted. Only the queſtion is, Where it doth appear that God hath commiſſion'd any thus? what direction is there in any leaf of Scripture for <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> or any perſons, to compoſe <hi>Forms of prayer</hi> to be ordinarily uſed by all Miniſters?</p>
            <p>§. 4. I have been amazed, that thoſe who are ſo zealous in this point, have not ſeen that the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> hath fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the only <hi>medium</hi> in nature to prove this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, in his <hi>Rationale</hi> on the Common-Prayer, <hi>pag.</hi> 8, 9, 10. viz. <hi>That God hath commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome to preſcribe a form of the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Upon which <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> what he there ſaith is indiſputably true: <hi>That the publick Worſhip of God preſcribed by thoſe to whom he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven commiſſion, is the only true and right publick Worſhip; and all other Forms and methods offered up inſtead of that, though never ſo exactly drawn, are ſtrange worſhip, becauſe not commanded.</hi> The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> moſt freely agree, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Worſhip is not commanded by God, or whatſoever Worſhip is offered up to God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that which he hath commanded, is ſtrange Worſhip. Now for any <hi>Forms of prayer</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61196:13"/>
uſed in any Church (ſetting aſide the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Forms which may make part of them) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, nor Chriſt, nor any Prophets, or Apoſtles, by authority from God, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. So then the ſenſe of this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate muſt be, <hi>That God hath commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Biſhops, Paſtors, or chief Miniſters of the Church, to preſcribe Forms of Worſhip, publick Worſhip, and univerſally to impoſe them.</hi> Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this, we agree, all other praying is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. God hath commanded another way of praying, by commiſſionating chief Paſtors in his name and ſtead to draw up the only Forms in which Miniſters in publick may ſpeak to him in prayer.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Propoſition</hi> which our Brethren ſhould ſpend their pains to prove; and as I ſaid before, I think to be the only <hi>Medium</hi> on their ſide; if we could apprehend this to be true, or it could be ſo evinced to us, we ſhould never ſpeak a word more about <hi>conceived</hi> prayer, or <hi>praying by our own gifts.</hi> We ſhould all ſtrike ſail to a command of God made out to us. If God or Chriſt hath commanded us the conſtant uſe of any form or forms in his Word, if his Prophets or Apoſtles have enjoined us any ſuch, we alſo agree our ſelves bound to uſe them. But we are not patient of theſe trifling arguments: <hi>If the uſe of Forms of prayer, preſcribed by God himſelf, or by Chriſt, or by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61196:14"/>
               <hi>either for a time to be uſed, or to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uſed, be lawful for all; then the uſe of Forms of prayer, neither made by God, nor by Chriſt, nor by his Prophets or Apoſtles, is alſo lawful. 2. If Forms of prayer be lawful, then they are lawful for all under all circumſtances. 3. If they be good for inſtruction,</hi> and may be ſo lawfully uſed, then they may be uſed in <hi>Devotion,</hi> &amp;c. 4. <hi>If they may be lawfully uſed even in devotion by ſome, or under ſome circumſtances, then they may be lawfully impoſed on all under any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. But yet though if it were true, that God by himſelf immediately, or Chriſt, or the Apoſtles, or Prophets, did preſcribe the people of God in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> ſome <hi>particular forms,</hi> from which they muſt not vary, nothing could be concluded in our caſe; yet for diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-ſake let us examine how well our Reverend Biſhop hath proved this: He beginneth <hi>pag.</hi> 99. with Chriſts <hi>preſcription of the Lords prayer;</hi> from whence he ſaith, <hi>Iſiodor. Hiſpalenſis,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Church took its pattern for Liturgies. Iſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Hiſpal.</hi> lived more than 600 years after Chriſt, about the time <hi>Liturgies</hi> began to be in common uſe, and 200 years before they were any thing generally impoſed. But the buſineſs is not what the Church in his time did, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61196:14"/>Admit the <hi>Lords-prayer</hi> was directed by Chriſt as a <hi>Form of prayer;</hi> By what authority did the Church after the <hi>effuſion of the Spirit,</hi> do what Chriſt did? By the ſame authority as I preſume they made ſeven <hi>Sacraments,</hi> becauſe Chriſt made two.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> thinks it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manifeſt, that the <hi>Lords-prayer</hi> was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a form. 1. Becauſe of the Text, <hi>Luk. 11. 2. When you pray, ſay.</hi> 2. Becauſe of the ground of the Diſciples requeſt, <hi>Teach us to pray,</hi> to which this is an anſwer. 3. From the manner of the compoſure. 4. From the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches acknowledging and uſing it as a form; for which he quoteth <hi>Cyprian, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Reverend Brother knows that many great Divines have doubted it, and do doubt it, ſome thinking it only a <hi>direction</hi> for the <hi>matter,</hi> others for the true <hi>method</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Nor doth any thing our Brother ſaith conclude in the cauſe; he knows that <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 9. it is only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Pray on this manner;</hi> and whereas he ſaith that it ia ſo in the <hi>Seventy, Numb. 6. 23. On this manner bleſs you;</hi> yet thoſe words have been taken for a conſtant invariable form of bleſſing, and was uſed ſo by <hi>Luther,</hi> and at <hi>Geneva.</hi> Who have taken them ſo I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, but I am ſure it cannot be proved that the Prieſts never varied from that form;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61196:15"/>
and I do know one or two great Divines that have thought the Prieſts only tyed to the ſenſe, not to thoſe Numerical words or ſyllables. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s uſe proveth it not, I hope; but yet we think we may lawfully uſe any form of Gods preſcription: the queſtion is, Whether we may uſe no other; nor that, with the leaſt variation.</p>
            <p>Our Brother's ſecond <hi>argument</hi> is yet weaker, <hi>The Diſciples ſaid, Lord teach us to pray as John taught his Diſciples.</hi> What then? was it not an appoſite anſwer for him to tell them, That now they muſt call God <hi>Father,</hi> and pray that his <hi>Name might be ſanctified, his Kingdom come, his will be done,</hi> &amp;c. unleſs he ſet them a form of words to which they might not add, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh? The Diſciples did not ſay, <hi>Lord tell us what words, and no other, we muſt uſe in prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> (ſaith our Brother) our Saviour gives in the <hi>phraſe of prayer;</hi> but doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude? ſo do we ſometimes give our Children forms which we deſire not they ſhould uſe as <hi>forms,</hi> but directions to ſpeak to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For <hi>Cyprian, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> who lived 300, 400, 800 years after Chriſt, they were not like to know Chriſts intention in this, more than we; and for their uſe of it as a form, We do not think it unlawful to uſe thoſe intire words and phraſes as a part of our prayers, nor indeed any other <hi>Scriptural forms</hi> of words
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61196:15"/>
that are proper. But on the other ſide, are they not two great preſumptions that our Saviour never intended it as a form, 1. <hi>That we never read in Scripture that it was ſo uſed afterward.</hi> 2. That the <hi>name of Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>whoſe name</hi> (Joh. 16.) <hi>we are commanded to pray,</hi> is not in it (unleſs by implication) as it hath been in all prayers of the Church ſince the <hi>Aſcenſion of Christ;</hi> the prayers concluding <hi>for the ſake of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To compremiſe this buſineſs, I believe it was as a <hi>form</hi> given to the Diſciples, being then but children, and not perfectly inſtructed to the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> and they might or might not uſe it as a form, until they ſhould be more fully inſtructed and inabled, but not with any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon them, or the Church after them, neceſſarily to uſe thoſe <hi>numerical words</hi> in that order; nay, that after Chriſts Reſurrection it was their duty to add ſomething more to their prayers, asking plainly and expreſly in the name of Jeſus Chriſt: For he tells them, <hi>Joh. 16. 24. Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name;</hi> how could that be true, if they had uſed the <hi>Lords-prayer</hi> till then, and the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there had been ſo put up in the name of Chriſt, as appears to have been his will now? <hi>verſ.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>Our Brothers next inſtance is <hi>pag.</hi> 103, 104, 105. from the example of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61196:16"/>
here he tells us, <hi>That the Jews did uſe prayers with their ſacrifices;</hi> and had their <hi>hours of prayer.</hi> Theſe things he proveth well from <hi>Lev. 1. 10. Act.</hi> 3. 1. and that <hi>Aaron</hi> was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſins of the people over the live-goat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. What is all this to the purpoſe? none doubts but that <hi>Prieſts and people</hi> prayed under the Old Teſtament as well as the New. But the queſtion is, Whether by ſtated forms or no? 2. He tells us there are evidences in Scripture of ſuch <hi>forms, 2 Chron. 29. 30. The King commanded the people to praiſe God with the words of David and Aſaph;</hi> That is, with ſuch and ſuch portions of <hi>holy writ;</hi> do not all men grant that ſome parts of holy Writ may be ſung in publick Worſhip? The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> will allow no other; he inſtanceth in <hi>Joel 2. 17. Hoſ. 14. 2. Deut. 21. 8. Deut.</hi> 26. 3, 4, 5, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>It is true, in all theſe Texts there are ſome ſhort, very ſhort <hi>forms of prayer</hi> (as they lye before us they are ſo.) But 1. can our Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end Brother think ſo ſhort phraſes or ſentences as ſome of them are, were ever uſed as the only ſolemn prayer uſed at that time? 2. Is there any Record that they were ever ſyllabically uſed? 3. Is it ſaid, you ſhall uſe theſe words and no other? 4. Is it not ordinary for us in our Sermons, directing people only to what ſenſe to pray, in our Sermons to ſay, <hi>Go to God and ſay,</hi> &amp;c. and then give them a ſhort pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61196:16"/>
which we never intend they ſhould uſe as a form. 5. Is it not reaſonable to think this was all intended in theſe paſſages, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>length and ſolemnity</hi> of the Prayers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture of <hi>Solomon, Ezra, Daniel, Hezekiah, Jehoſhaphat?</hi> For the practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in later days,</p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſay this: 1. That he knows how little credit is to be given to any teſtimony of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and what time the earlieſt writings of theirs appear'd. 2. How ill their <hi>practice</hi> can be pleaded, who our Saviour ſaith worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God vainly, <hi>teaching for Doctrines the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men.</hi> 3. That I obſerve, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 16. that when our Saviour at <hi>Nazareth</hi> went into the Synagogue, the Clerk did not bring him any <hi>Common-prayer-book,</hi> but the book of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaias,</hi> which he made uſe of.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Let us now leave theſe pretences of more ancient proof, and come to conſider what hath indeed been the <hi>practice of the Church</hi> ſince the Apoſtles times; for our <hi>Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> thinks it probable, that while the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts of the Spirit continued, <hi>Prayer was performed by them.</hi> For the time ſucceeding the Apoſtles, it muſt be divided into three periods:</p>
            <p>1. The firſt is the <hi>purer period</hi> of it before the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> got fully into Saddle; this as to Doctrine held to a great degree for 500
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61196:17"/>
years; but as to <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ſcarce half ſo long, as we ſhall poſſibly ſhortly ſhew.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond is the <hi>depraved</hi> period of it, which was for a 1000 years as to Doctrine, 1200 and more as to ſome matters of <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Reformed period of it, which was from the year 1516, and is yet going on.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe <hi>Periods</hi> we have not ſo full and clear an evidence of what was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, as we could deſire.</p>
            <p>For though it was after the year 600 that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> got the Title of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;</hi> and ſome years after that, before the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was furniſhed with all her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent accoutrements, and 1200 before <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> was ſetled: Yet betwixt that and 1500 they had time enough to burn all the Writings of the Ancients, from which the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> might appear to us; or ſo to correct them and interpolate, that we might ſee little or nothing that could be made uſe of to ſhew the Novelties of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice; yet <hi>Bernardus non vidit omnia;</hi> ſome things ſcaped their eye or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of which our Divines make good uſe. Let us ſee what our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> produceth for the firſt 300 years, which all Divines ſay was the moſt pure times of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61196:17"/>It is not our part to prove the <hi>Negative;</hi> it lyeth upon our <hi>Brethren</hi> to prove that there were <hi>forms univerſally impoſed on all Miniſters.</hi> There might be forms for <hi>inſtruction;</hi> ſome men might at their pleaſure compoſe forms for their own <hi>devotion</hi> and uſe them; but that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning part of the Church did in thoſe years make <hi>forms,</hi> and require all men to uſe them, and Miniſters and Chriſtians then generally thought it lawful; this is to be proved: for we will yet allow a lawful uſe of forms of prayer for <hi>inſtruction,</hi> and in ſome caſes for <hi>devotion,</hi> and if they did no more, we agree with them.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> hath, <hi>pag.</hi> 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118. taken notice of ſome proofs brought by Divines of our mind, to make it very probable that in thoſe years there were no ſuch forms made for general uſe, no ſuch forms generally uſed, much leſs enjoined to all to be by them uſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed about the year 160, who ſays the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſent forth prayers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our Brethren tranſlate it, [<hi>as they were able,</hi>] this Reverend Author will have the ſenſe to be with <hi>all his might.</hi> I do not think that any thing can be infallibly concluded on either ſide from it; the words may ſignifie either, or both; and ſo one thing in one part, another thing in another
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61196:18"/>
part of the ſame <hi>Apology,</hi> ſo as that debate is never like to be ended.</p>
            <p>The next is that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived about 200 years after Chriſt, who ſaith the Chriſtians did pray <hi>Sine monitore quia de pectore,</hi> without a <hi>monitor,</hi> becauſe from their heart. Our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> thinks <hi>ſine monitore</hi> can in no propriety of ſpeech be underſtood of a <hi>form;</hi> and why? becauſe a <hi>form muſt be a perſon.</hi> And was not that other perſon who compoſed the form a perſon, think we? and his <hi>monitor</hi> who prayeth by his form? nay are there not <hi>mute</hi> as well as <hi>vocal monitors?</hi> May not the <hi>bell</hi> which calls us to a publick aſſembly, be called our <hi>monitor,</hi> becauſe it is no perſon? Is it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual a figure to give the name of the <hi>office of a perſon to the thing that doth that work as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally?</hi> for his peculiar ſenſe of that Text, I ſee no need of it, but leave it to <hi>criticks.</hi> Beſides, the words are not <hi>cum pectore,</hi> but <hi>de pectore;</hi> the words of the Chriſtians prayers flowed from the heart, conceived there.</p>
            <p>He takes notice of no more brought on our ſide within the firſt 300 years. But I ſhall mind him of another, and that a ſhrewd one, the Reader ſhall find it in <hi>Socrates Scholaſticus, Hiſtor. l. 5 cap.</hi> 21. in theſe words,—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Every where and in all worſhips of Prayers, there</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61196:18"/>
               <hi>are not two to be found that ſpeak the ſame thing.</hi> This cannot be underſtood as to matter, but as to words, which could not be if they prayed in all Churches by the <hi>ſame forms of words.</hi> As to matter, it is unqueſtionable falſe. It is true, <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> lived in the fifth <hi>Century;</hi> but he relates the Hiſtory of the <hi>Centuries</hi> before him as well as his own; what need we any further witneſs for near 500 years after Chriſt? Let us now hear what our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> hath to ſay in proof of his aſſertion.</p>
            <p>He produceth in the ſecond Century, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Juſtine Martyr;</hi> but what ſay they? one of them ſpeaks of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the other of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>Common-prayer.</hi> But muſt the Miniſter himſelf needs uſe a preſcribed form, becauſe his Prayer is common to the people? I wonder how a Miniſter can in a Congregation make any other prayers than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Common prayers.</hi> Surely the term of <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer</hi> is too much an <hi>Angliciſm</hi> to be expreſſed, eſpecially in <hi>Greek</hi> in that manner.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third Century</hi> our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> produceth <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian.</hi> What ſay they? <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith they often ſaid in their prayers, <hi>O Almighty God, give us a part with thy Prophets:</hi> and doth not many a Miniſter who uſeth no form ordinarily, ſay in his Prayers, <hi>O Lord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins;</hi> and, <hi>O Lord bring us to thy everlaſting Kingdom.</hi> Shall theſe common Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61196:19"/>
prove a hundred years hence, that theſe men prayed by ſet-forms? For his other paſſage out of <hi>Origen,</hi> I have not the Book to weigh it; but am ſure thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is not ſo much as a good <hi>Top<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck,</hi> much leſs of a Demonſtration of <hi>Liturgies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſaith <hi>Cyprian?</hi> he teſtifieth, That they uſed to ſay, <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> lift up your hearts; and the people ſaid, <hi>Habemus ad Dominum,</hi> we lift them up to the Lord. So many a Miniſter that prayeth by no forms, begins his Prayer with <hi>Let us pray. Let us lift up our hearts to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all the proof this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> brings for 300 years after Chriſt; let any fair Reader judg the force of it, and whether the proofs of the Negative be not more probable and ſtrong, eſpecially when we are aſſured by <hi>Socrates</hi> 150 years after this, <hi>That there were not two to be ſound that uſed the ſame words in prayer.</hi> And truly what proof he can bring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 300 years, is not much valuable; for I ſhall ſhew that in thoſe ages, worſer things than Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies were crept into the Rituals of the Church.</p>
            <p>§. 7. His next inſtance is that of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> which muſt be betwixt the year 306 and 324; <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he made godly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the uſe of his Soldiers;</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61196:19"/>
this a very admirable thing in him. Certainly if true, ſo it was. But doth not this argue that there was then no <hi>publick Liturgy?</hi> for certainly if there had, his Chaplains would have uſed it, as now our Chaplains do to <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Ships? Euſebius</hi> calleth theſe <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted prayers;</hi> But by whom? by <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> For whom? for his Soldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not for his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Doth any one think <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had generally the <hi>gift of prayer,</hi> and were able to expreſs themſelves properly to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe of his army? This argues that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did not think fit his Legions ſhould be without all Worſhip of God; nor did he think <hi>forms unlawful</hi> for thoſe who could not pray without them; he therefore wrote down ſome prayers in a Book, ordered them to be read to them; and himſelf ſometimes read them, or pronounced them. What is all this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? we adviſe the like to all Houſholders, who have not ability of themſelves to pray in their families: For <hi>Euſebius</hi> his ſaying this <hi>was after the manner of the Church.</hi> If it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood for the Miniſter of the Congregation to make prayers for his own Church, it is what we plead for; if it be meant that he kept a courſe of prayer in his army as is in the Church, it proves nothing for forms, unleſs it could be done no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61196:20"/>§. 8. For what our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> ſaith next (for I take his Quotations as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect order of time, not as they lye in his Book) <hi>p.</hi> 106. he ſeems to me as if he would a little impoſe upon us: for he tells us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—<hi>That forms of prayer were of uſe in the Church about 1300 years ſince is acknowledged by them who plead moſt againſt them,</hi> from Concil. Laod. cap. 18. 3 Carthag. c. 23. Concil. Milevit. cap. 12. <hi>and that they have continued from that time downward cannot be denied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there were <hi>forms of prayer</hi> before this, we will not deny; that ſome particular perſons might uſe ſome, we will not deny: <hi>But that they were univerſally impoſed upon any conſiderable part of the Church for more than 400 years after this, we will deny.</hi> Nor do the <hi>Canons</hi> mentioned prove any ſuch thing. Let us try if we cannot prove it.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was in the year 364, ſome ſay 315. All that this <hi>Synod</hi> decreed was, that the ſame order of Prayers ſhould be uſed morning and evening; for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not neceſſarily ſignifie <hi>form;</hi> beſides, in Liturgies, Mattens and Evenſong uſe to differ. And <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi> makes the title of the Canon only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>daily prayers,</hi> and the ſubſtance of it, <hi>That prayers ſhould be made in the Church morning and evening;</hi> beſides, this was a very ſmall part of the Church; <hi>Caranza</hi> ſaith there were but 22 Biſhops there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61196:20"/>The Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> rather determines the contrary; for it decreeth, <hi>That if any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter compoſed any prayers for his own uſe, he ſhould not uſe them till he communicated them with his abler Brethren.</hi> So then he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe prayers by his <hi>own gifts.</hi> This was 395.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Canon of the Council of <hi>Mela</hi> is plainly reſtrictive of Miniſters liberty; but it was made upon a ſpecial occaſion, upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prevailing of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrine in that Province, and reached no further. And they in their Canon plainly ſet down the reaſon of it, <hi>Leſt (Pelagianiſm</hi> being ſo rampant there) <hi>ſome phraſes through careleſneſs or ignorance ſhould be put in contrary to the faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. And now we are come to 400 years and more after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not paſs over here what our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 118, 119, 120, where he telleth us, that theſe <hi>Councils did not give the original to ſet forms of Prayer, but only eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſanctions about them.</hi> We are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring about the <hi>original of forms of prayer,</hi> nor do believe that theſe Councils gave the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to them; but we are enquiring into the original of Biſhops, or Church-officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the ſame forms of prayer to be uſed by all Miniſters ſubject to their juriſdiction; and commanding Miniſters to perform their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61196:21"/>
               <hi>Miniſterial acts of Prayer, either wholly, or in the greateſt part, not by their own gifts, but by forms which others had made for them;</hi> and we ſay, the Council of <hi>Mela</hi> in St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time was the firſt record we have of that, and that but in that Province, and upon a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> is mentioned by <hi>Caranza,</hi> and by <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> but it is not to be found in the ancient account of Councils wrote before the year 900 in <hi>Greek,</hi> and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by Dr. <hi>Pappas,</hi> and printed at <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> 1621.</p>

               <hi>Juſtellus</hi> in his <hi>African Code</hi> hath no ſuch Canon as this is. <hi>Juſtellus</hi> in his Notes, <hi>Praef<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p.</hi> 35. will not deny but that there was ſuch a third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as <hi>Caranza</hi> gives us an account of; becauſe <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Balſamon,</hi> and his own Collection (which was, he ſaith, a moſt ancient Manuſcript of <hi>Nic. Faber</hi>) menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuch a Synod, but he ſaith it made but 21 Canons, not 50; and the other Canons aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to that Council, the reſt belong to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil held at <hi>Carthage,</hi> 419, in the time of Pope <hi>Boniface;</hi> which he ſaith is evident from the Acts of the Synod. For <hi>Boniface</hi> was not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop when <hi>Caeſarius</hi> and <hi>Atticus</hi> were Conſuls. We are therefore come to the year 419, when it is ſaid, but with no great certainty, that there was a Council at <hi>Carthage,</hi> where were 44 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61196:21"/>
who made this Canon, <hi>That none in their prayers ſhould name the Father for the Son, nor the Son for the Father.</hi> [How could they do that, if the Church had ſet them their form?] <hi>And when they miniſtred at the altar, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be directed to the Father,</hi> [what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, if their form were ſet them?] <hi>and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever prayers any made for himſelf, he ſhould not uſe them before he had communicated them to his more skilful brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot underſtand ſenſe, if this <hi>Canon</hi> doth not prove, that Miniſters were at this time at liberty publickly to pray by the uſe of their own gifts; for if they were tyed to a certain form made by others, there was no fear of their uſing the name of the <hi>Father</hi> for the <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>name of the Son for the Father;</hi> or that they ſhould not direct their prayers to the Father, that being the ſenſe of the Church, whoſe forms they were tyed to; to ſay nothing of the latter part of the Canon, which apparently giveth Miniſters liberty to make prayers for their uſe, only obligeth them to take the advice of their more experienced brethren (in that erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and moſt dangerous time) before they publickly uſed them. So that I conclude, this Canon is a full proof, there were no ſtated forms at this time, which was 419 years after Chriſt, uſed or injoined in the <hi>African</hi> Church. Whereas our Brother ſaith, (very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61196:22"/>
critically) <hi>That tranſcribing</hi> (properly here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) <hi>ſuppoſeth a form.</hi> I anſwer, the words are <hi>deſcribit ſibi</hi> in <hi>Caranza.</hi> Our Author knows that <hi>deſcribo,</hi> in a hundred inſtances might be given him, ſignifies no more than to <hi>write down. Hoc quam vehementer ad me pertineat in iis quas tibi illi reddent literis deſcripſi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully,</hi> who did not uſe to tranſcribe his Letters out of other mens copies. Beſides, admitting our Brothers <hi>criticiſm,</hi> yet the form might be his own, and he only write a fair, out of a foul copy. What he ſaith further about the words in the former part of the Canon, from which we conclude no form was then in uſe, at leaſt not enjoined, he yields the caſe, in ſaying, <hi>That there were various forms then uſed in that Church, ſome made by hereticks.</hi> Then there was no one form enjoined and uſed; nor doth the Canon ſay they ſhould uſe none but the ſtated forms appointed by that Church; it only ſaith, That in their prayers they ſhould not name the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Son, nor the Son for the Father; and that all prayers (which was the will of Chriſt) ſhould be directed to the firſt perſon in the Trinity, to the Father.</p>
            <p>§. 10. Our Author triumpheth in the Council of <hi>Mela,</hi> or <hi>Milevis</hi> (as he calls it) that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaith, <hi>declared againſt the uſe of any other forms than thoſe eſtabliſhed by the Council.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61196:22"/>
It doth ſo indeed, but not then thoſe eſtabliſhed by the Church. That Council conſidering the ſtate of their Province at that time, thought fit to order ſome forms, and ſeems to tye up the Miniſters of that Province at that time to the uſe of them, and no other ſo much is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but whereas our Author ſaith, <hi>That we may as well conclude from our Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as from theſe Councils, that they gave the firſt original to forms of Prayer, becauſe they are thereby eſtabliſhed.</hi> We anſwer,</p>
            <p>If in <hi>England</hi> we had not had the uſe of forms of Prayer eſtabliſhed by the Canon-law in times of <hi>Popery,</hi> and by <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> under favour we think we might have concluded, that the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> 1662, had given the firſt <hi>original</hi> to ſuch an <hi>impoſition or uſe.</hi> And till our Author (which he hath not yet done) can bring us any Canon of ancient date that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſuch an univerſal uſe of forms of Prayer in any conſiderable part of the Church, we hope we may conclude, that this was the <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of ſuch commands or uſage; and this was in the fifth <hi>Century</hi> when the truths in matter of Doctrine, as well as <hi>Rites,</hi> were in a great meaſure corrupred, as I may poſſibly ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But for this Council too,</p>
            <p>It is true, there was a Council held at <hi>Mela</hi> 402 years after Chriſt in the time of Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61196:23"/>
the firſt; if we may believe <hi>Caranza, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus,</hi> and others, it was held when <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> were Emperours. That Province was (as to the Miniſtry) unmeaſurably tainted with <hi>Pelagianiſm;</hi> their eight firſt Canons are againſt his Doctrine; it will not be amiſs to give the <hi>Reader</hi> the ſum of thoſe Canons, from whence he may judg, That it was reaſonable, that until the Church could be purged of that leaven, conſidering the great corruption of the Miniſters, ſuch a reſtriction ſhould be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Miniſters of that Province as to their publick prayers.</p>
            <p>Can. 1. <hi>It pleaſed all the Biſhops met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Synod to ordain what things were defined in this Synod,</hi> That whoſoever ſhall ſay that the firſt man Adam was made mortal, ſo as whether he ſinned or no, he ſhould die, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the merit of ſin, but from a neceſſity of nature, Let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can. 2. <hi>It alſo pleaſed them,</hi> That if any ſhall deny that young Infants are to be baptized, or ſhall ſay that they are baptized for the remiſſion of ſins, but they draw no ſuch original ſin from <hi>Adam</hi> which ſhould be waſhed away in the laver of Baptiſm, from whence it followeth that in them the form of Baptiſm [<hi>for the remiſſion of ſin</hi>] is not tru', but falſe, Let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what the Apoſtle ſaith can be no otherwiſe underſtood, than as the Church hath always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61196:23"/>
it: <hi>Rom. 5. By one man ſin entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and death by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſin, and ſo death paſſed over all men becauſe all had ſinned.</hi> For by reaſon of this rule of faith, little ones who have actually committed no ſin, are therefore truly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the remiſſion of ſins, that the filth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by Generation, may be cleanſed away by Regeneration.</p>
            <p>Can. 3. <hi>It alſo pleaſed them, &amp;c.</hi> That if any one ſay that the Grace of God by which we are juſtified by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, was only of force for remiſſion of ſins which are committed, and not alſo for our aſſiſtance againſt future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, he ſhould be <hi>Anathema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can. 4.</hi> If any one ſhall ſay, That the grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt doth no further help us againſt ſinning, than as it revealeth to us, and openeth our underſtanding to underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, that we may know what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and to avoid; and that it is no effect of grace to enable us to love, and to do what we know we ought to do, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Knowledg puffeth up, Charity edifieth,</hi> It is impious to believe that there is a word of the grace of God for that which puffeth up, and none for that which edifieth, both being the gift of God, both to know what we ought to do, and to love to do it, that through the edifying of love our knowledg may <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>knowledg;</hi> ſo it is alſo written, <hi>Love is from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can. 5. <hi>It alſo pleaſed them to Decree,</hi> That if any ſhall ſay that we are therefore juſtified by Grace, that we may more eaſily by Grace fulfil what we are commanded to do by the power of our own will; although if grace were not given, though it would not be eaſie, yet it would be poſſible to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the commands of God, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For our Lord ſpeaketh concerning obedience to Gods commandments, when he ſaith, <hi>Without me you can do nothing:</hi> He doth not ſay, Without me you cannot without difficulty do any thing.</p>
            <p>Can. 6. <hi>It alſo pleaſed them,</hi> &amp;c. That whereas St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us;</hi> whoſoever ſhall ſay this is the ſenſe, That out of humility we ought to ſay we have no ſin, Let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For it followeth, and is added by the Apoſtle, <hi>But if we confeſs our ſins, he is juſt and righteous to forgive them, and to purge us from all iniquity.</hi> From whence it is plain, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of <hi>ſpeaking in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but ſpeaking in truth. For the Apoſtle might have ſaid, If we ſay we have no ſin, we extol our ſelves, and there is no humility in us.

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61196:24"/>Can. 7. <hi>It alſo pleaſed them,</hi> &amp;c. That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould ſay that the Saints in the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> praying, <hi>Forgive us our ſins,</hi> do not ſpeak it for them, for it is not for them neceſſary, but for other ſinners in the congregation; and therefore the ſeveral Saints do not ſay, <hi>Forgive me my ſins,</hi> but forgive us our ſins, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man might be underſtood not to put up that petition ſo much for himſelf as for others, Let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For St. <hi>James</hi> was holy and <hi>righteous,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> Why doth he ſay all, but that his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence might agree with that in the Pſalm, <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, O Lord, becauſe in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> And that in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>There is none that liveth and ſinneth not.</hi> And that in <hi>Job, He ſealeth up the head of all men, that every man might know his infirmity.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which holy and righteous <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaking in his Prayer in the Plural Number ſaith, <hi>We have ſinned, we have done wickedly, &amp;c.</hi> What he ſpeaketh there, he ſpeaketh both truly and humbly; and that none might think as ſome now do, that he did not ſpeak of his own but of his peoples ſins, he afterwards ſaith, <hi>When I pray'd, and confeſſed my ſins, and the ſins of my people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the Lord our God:</hi> He would not ſay, <hi>our ſins,</hi> but <hi>my ſins, and the ſins of my people,</hi> as a Prophet foreſeeing, there would be ſome ariſe as now, who would ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61196:25"/>Can. 8. <hi>It alſo pleaſed them, &amp;c.</hi> That if any ſhould ſay, That the words of the Lords Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our debts,</hi> are only uſed by the Saints to ſignifie their humility, not to expreſs a truth, Let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For how can one be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in prayer to lye, and that not to men, but to God, with his lips deſiring that his ſins might be forgiven him, when in heart he thought he had no ſins to be forgiven?</p>
            <p>I have been a little more large in this ſtory, becauſe I am pretty confident and dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all our adverſaries to give us but one proof, that any part of the Church before this time aſſembled in any Council, took upon them to impoſe <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> to be uſed by all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters within their Juriſdiction. If ſome men made themſelves Forms, and uſed them, they yet ſerved God in their Miniſtry in the uſe of their own gifts; this ſignifieth juſt nothing to our caſe, who have known divers worthy men do the like.</p>
            <p>We have now the <hi>caſe;</hi> here was a Council of worthy men, all relating to the Province of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who met at <hi>Mela.</hi> The occaſion of their meeting was the woful ſpreading of the Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who denied <hi>Original Sin, Aſſiſting Grace;</hi> or that <hi>juſtified perſons could ſin,</hi> or need <hi>beg the pardon of ſin.</hi> Many, if not the greateſt part of their Miniſters were taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61196:25"/>
with theſe Opinions. In this diſtreſs to ſtop the diffuſing this venom, and that the people through the error, ignorance, or careleſneſs of their Miniſtry, might not be without any to go before them in publick prayers, who could or would put up due confeſſions or neceſſary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for them; having firſt in eight Canons condemned the Doctrines of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> they make their twelfth Canon in theſe terms:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It alſo pleaſed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. <hi>That thoſe prayers, or Maſſes, or Prefaces, or Commendations, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of hands, which ſhall be approved in the Council, be uſed of all; and that no other be uſed in the Church, but what ſhall be treated on, and approved in a Synod, leſt perhaps ſomething ſhould be compoſed contrary to the true faith, either through ignorance or careleſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I obſerve, 1. That this Canon extends to all <hi>Miniſterial ſervices,</hi> not to prayers only; as to all, they were limited to forms.</p>
            <p>2. That it was not to any forms that before this time had been enjoined or uſed in this or in any other Church, but ſuch as ſhould firſt be treated of and approved in a Synod or Council.</p>
            <p>3. That it was done in a caſe of <hi>woful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,</hi> when the Miniſters were known to be ſo corrupted in their judgments, that they could neither put up ſuch confeſſions, or ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they ought, they could not confeſs <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61196:26"/>
               <hi>ſin,</hi> nor pray for <hi>aſſiſting grace,</hi> nor for <hi>pardon of ſins, renewing after Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I obſerve, this was in the <hi>fifth Century;</hi> and if we will believe <hi>Voſſius,</hi> it muſt be after 505, for he ſaith, <hi>Hiſtor. Pelag. l. 1. c.</hi> 3. that in that year (<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> being in baniſhment, and near his death) he firſt ſpread his Doctrines. Others make it 402. It muſt be in the Popedom of <hi>Innocent</hi> 1. (who was not Pope 18 months) for <hi>Aurelius</hi> was Preſident there in the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Legate.</p>
            <p>Take this ſtory in its <hi>circumſtances,</hi> it's far from a juſtifiable authority to maintain that it was the judgment of the Church in the purer ages, <hi>That forms of prayer might be lawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined all Miniſters,</hi> whether under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances or no.</p>
            <p>Their ends were, that the poor people might have due prayers put up for them, and be taught the Doctrine of <hi>Original ſin, the impotency of mans will to what was ſpiritually good;</hi> the need <hi>of aſſiſting grace;</hi> that <hi>they ſin ſeven times a day, and had need beg pardon.</hi> That <hi>original ſin</hi> might in prayer be confeſſed, and the <hi>impotency of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature to that which is truly good,</hi> with their <hi>daily renewing ſins,</hi> that ſo <hi>pardon might be beg'd</hi> for them, and aſſiſtance of <hi>Divine grace</hi> againſt them, and unto <hi>ſpiritual duty.</hi> How ſhould this end have been obtained in that corrupted ſtate, but by <hi>ſet-forms of Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61196:26"/>
too? Should they on the ſudden have turned out all theſe Miniſters, it is not probable, they on the ſudden could have found enough fitted for the work. Becauſe in this exigent this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil judged it lawful, ſhall it therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the judgment even of thoſe few Biſhops in that Council, That it is lawful for any in any ſtate of a Church to do the like? Beſides, what hindred but that according to this Canon every Miniſter might compoſe his own prayers, and bring them to be approved in a Council.</p>
            <p>§. 11. The truth is, this proved a ſad preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; all know how long <hi>Peldgius</hi> his Doctrine ſpread a very great part of the Church, how many Councils aſſembled againſt it. 'Tis very probable other Churches followed this Canon not in force of it, for it could oblige none but the Province of <hi>Numidia;</hi> but as thinking it lawful: till at length, as the <hi>Grandieur</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops required a pack of ignorant and ſottiſh Miniſters, of which there was a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able plenty in the ſixth and ſeventh age, it crept into a cuſtom, and a piece of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Common Law. But we ſhall hereafter ſhew that the practice of the viſible Church after 400 years in Rituals, is not very imitable by thoſe that will make the word of God a light to their feet; but we muſt go back a little to

conſider what our Author inſinuates, <hi>p.</hi> 105. of the Liturgies which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have invented, (in all probability) and intituled St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> too; as alſo thoſe which they have intituled, St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>§. 12. For the former, our Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaketh thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 105. <q>And I yield it moſt probable (though even Proteſtant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters herein differ) that the ancient <hi>Roman, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Offices, were called the Liturgies of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> becauſe of their certain early uſe in the Churches where they preſided, though it is not certain they were compoſed by them; this being mentioned by no ancient writer of the firſt <hi>Centuries.</hi> Nor do I doubt but the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy or <hi>Anaphoca</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and that of the twelve Apoſtles, are ſuppoſititious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which I obſerve, 1. That if during the time that the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt laſted, the Miniſterial Services were by the Apoſtles performed by them, it is very abſurd to ſay <hi>Peter, James, Mark</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who all were poſſeſſed of them, prayed by preſcribed forms.</p>
            <p>2. I obſerve, our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> (I hope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly) hath granted here the <hi>Papiſts</hi> a great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61196:27"/>
point, That <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> for he calls <hi>Rome</hi> the Church where he reſided (for we know <hi>James</hi> reſided at <hi>Hieruſalem, Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi>) this is both a liberal and groundleſs grant—<hi>Magni hoc mercentur Achivi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Did Saint <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> themſelves uſe them? No, ſaith our Author, that is <hi>incertain;</hi> it is falſe, and our Author yields it, in ſaying they miniſtred by their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts.</hi> Now we read of no Liturgy came down in the days of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> was it by others that came after them? who, or how long after? becauſe he ſaith they were of <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain early uſe in thoſe Churches;</hi> how doth that appear? doth he account 450 years after (when <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us there were not two to be found ſpeaking the ſame things in their prayers) early?</p>
            <p>4. He acknowledgeth he ſpeaks without proof, and by gueſs, for he hath no writer in the firſt <hi>Centuries</hi> that mentions them.</p>

ſaid is taken. Nor do I ſee how it can be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but if <hi>Peter, Mark</hi> and <hi>James</hi> were the Authors of theſe pretended Liturgies, they muſt be of equal authority with the Scriptures, as that Noble Lord ſaith. And being things of no better reputation than they are, though our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> hath ſaid little for them, yet he hath ſaid a great deal too much for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo valuable a judgment, and learning, and ſobriety, to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>§. 13. We ſhall come now to hear what he ſaith to the pretended Liturgies of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> They all flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed above 350 years after Chriſt; <hi>Baſil</hi> in the year 370, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> about the year 374, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> about the year 398; <hi>Baſil</hi> died 379, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> 407, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> 397; all theſe are ſaid to have had Liturgies, or <hi>Forms of prayers;</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> can ſhew us the <hi>copies</hi> of them, they ſay. But this is nothing to us, unleſs it can be proved that they were uſed by any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yea and that not voluntarily (that might be out of ſome Miniſters ſenſe that they had not gifts fit to pray with) but at the command of ſome Council, or of theſe Biſhops. But let us hear what our Author ſaith in <hi>Libertas Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtica,</hi> pag. 106, 107.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are ſo many Teſtimonies, that St.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, <hi>St.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>and St.</hi> Baſil, <hi>were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61196:29"/>
               <hi>of Liturgses, that I do not ſee how any can rationally doubt thereof; but that theſe Liturgies have undergone divers alterations is both appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and is very reaſonable to be imagined. And he who ſhall compare the Greek copy of St.</hi> Baſil's <hi>Liturgy with the</hi> Syriack, <hi>or its Verſion, both which are repreſented together by</hi> Caſſander, <hi>will find them ſo vaſtly different from each other, that he muſt either conclude great alterations to have paſt upon them, or that they never were originally the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all that he ſaith of them. That <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Baſil, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others, might ſet themſelves in order for reading the Scriptures, and compoſe prayers for their perſonal uſe, may be true for ought any body can tell. Divers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that we have known have done the like. That divers Miniſters might out of a reverence to theſe perſons, and diſtruſting their own gifts, uſe the forms which they had made, may be true too. We have ſeen Mr. <hi>Shutes,</hi> Dr. <hi>Holdſworths,</hi> and many others forms of prayer which they ordinarily uſed before their Sermons. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome out of reſpect to them may have made uſe of them; whether they did what they ought, is the queſtion, That the <hi>Liturgies</hi> now extant, and that go under their name, as they now are to be ſeen, were none of theirs, is out of queſtion.</p>

He chargeth them all for counterfeits, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proves it. He ſhews that in thoſe Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies <hi>there were prayers for the dead, prayers to the Virgin Mary.</hi> There is the Hymn called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not known in the Church till more than an hundred years after their time. In <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s, the Prieſt is brought in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the <hi>Crucifix</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (all know the worſhipping Images came in long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter), <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and many other Saints are invoked in his Liturgy, who lived many years after <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was dead. There is in it a prayer for the Emperor <hi>Alexius,</hi> and the Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Biſhop Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who both lived 700 years after <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was dead. It is true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> adoring theſe <hi>Liturgies,</hi> we make uſe of them againſt them to prove that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was uſed to be given in both kinds, and that there were no private <hi>Maſſes;</hi> but theſe pretended <hi>Liturgies</hi> were moſt certainly made many hundreds of years after their times who are made the Authors. If they were not, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have more to ſay for their <hi>Holy-water,</hi> their Paganiſh <hi>Incenſings,</hi> and <hi>Wax-candles</hi> burning at <hi>noon-day,</hi> their <hi>Croſſings</hi> and <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes,</hi> their <hi>Invocation</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> than Proteſtants ever thought they had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61196:30"/>But our <hi>Author</hi> will allow them to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone <hi>divers alterations.</hi> We thank him for that; but how ſhall it appear to us that they were not intire new compoſitions made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years after Chriſt, that by them the <hi>Papiſts</hi> might juſtifie their <hi>Maſs-book,</hi> their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies?</hi> Or how ſhall it appear that any Miniſters in <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s, <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s, or <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Dioceſſes, were required by them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Miniſterial acts in prayer? We chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any one to make that good. And the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of forms, of the particular uſe of them by thoſe that made them, or the voluntary uſe of them by other Miniſters who diſtruſted their own abilities, or the requiring of the uſe of them in a time of general corruption of the Miniſters, will not prove the lawfulneſs of the uſe of them by all Miniſters under no ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Canon of the Council of <hi>Mela,</hi> limiting their Miniſters to ſuch prayers as ſhould firſt be approved in ſome Synod, is a ſtrong preſumption, that they knew of no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> for they would then have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſome of them, and reſtrained their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the uſe of them, or ſome of them; and not ſtill have ordered the making of more; or rather given their Miniſters liberty to make
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61196:31"/>
their prayers themſelves, but not to uſe them till they had been debated and agreed in ſome Synod (which I take to be the trueſt ſenſe of that Canon) nor needed the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> to have ordered their Miniſters to confer about their prayers with their more experienced brethren, if ſeven or eight Liturgies had been then known, and ſo authentick.</p>
            <p>§. 14. But yet we muſt find it more than 300 years after this before any <hi>Church or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate took upon them under penalties to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Miniſters to miniſter not by the uſe of their own gifts, but by the preſcribed forms of others.</hi> Let us but in the caſe hear <hi>Durandus,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt</hi> high enough, ſpeak, and that in a book which he called, A <hi>Rationale</hi> of Divine Offices, <hi>l. 5. cap.</hi> 2. his words are theſe:</p>
            <p>Theodoſius <hi>(who by the way lived 380) intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope</hi> Damaſus, <hi>that ſome Eccleſiaſtical office might be made by ſome Eccleſiaſtical Catholick perſon; upon which</hi> Damaſus <hi>commanded Saint</hi> Hierome <hi>who was then in</hi> Bethlehem <hi>with</hi> Paula Euſtochium, <hi>and ſome other Virgins, to abide there and to make a Liturgy for the Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was well skilled in</hi> Hebrew, Greek, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, <hi>and</hi> Latin, <hi>which he obediently did; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing how much of the</hi> Pſalms <hi>ſhould be read each day of the week; and ordering the reading of the</hi> Goſpels <hi>and the</hi> Epiſtles <hi>out of the Old and</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61196:31"/>
               <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> [Where note, this is all that moſt ſuperſtitious Ritualiſt could find that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> did.] <hi>It was approved by Pope</hi> Damaſus, <hi>and made a rule.</hi> Gelaſius <hi>(who was Pope, and lived 400), and</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great (who lived 600 years after Chriſt) added</hi> Prayers <hi>and</hi> Hymns, <hi>the</hi> Leſſons <hi>and the Goſpels;</hi> Ambroſe, Gelaſius <hi>and</hi> Gregory, <hi>ſaith he, added the</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualia, Tractus Hallelujah, <hi>other Doctors of the Church added other parts.</hi> Thus far <hi>Durandus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeemeth to be much of the truth. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> in the life of <hi>Damaſus</hi> tells us, that he firſt ordered <hi>Hierome</hi>'s Tranſlation to be read in the Churches. That the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſhould be read <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalim,</hi> part by the Miniſter, part by the people. <hi>That Glory be to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſhould be repeated at the end of every <hi>Pſalm;</hi> and the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>celebration</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> was alſo ordered by him. Now when was this? It was above 380 years after Chriſt. Nor have we yet any record of a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but an order by <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> preſcribed for <hi>reading the Scripture,</hi> and a Confeſſion before the Sacrament, made by Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and <hi>Gloria Pater</hi> by him added to every Pſalm. The next Pope to him was <hi>Siricius,</hi> (that learned man, who in great paſſion urged, <hi>That Prieſts might not marry,</hi> becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us. <hi>Thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi>) The next to him was <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61196:32"/>
he (ſaith <hi>Platina</hi>) ordained the Prieſts <hi>ſtanding up at the Goſpel. Innocent</hi> the firſt ſucceeded him, who ſpent his time about preſerving the Faith againſt <hi>Pelagius.</hi> I do not find that <hi>Soſemus</hi> the next Pope added much, but he ſent <hi>Fauſtenus</hi> and two Presbyters to the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> to let them know they ought to do nothing without the conſent of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſaith <hi>Platina). Boniface</hi> after him did little: the next, which was <hi>Coeleſtinus,</hi> ordered <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms to be ſung by turns before the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> (ſo was the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> now called). The next Succeſſor <hi>Sixtus</hi> 1. his ſuperſtition evaporated in buildings, and adorning them. I find not that the four next Succeſſors, <hi>Leo, Simplicius, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> or <hi>Faelix</hi> did any thing as to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> nor indeed is much ſaid of any till we come to <hi>Gregory</hi> Anno 600; <hi>Pamelius</hi> ſaith, he made a <hi>Lectionary,</hi> directing the order for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be read an <hi>Antiphonary;</hi> directing ſome <hi>Reſponds,</hi> and an order for adminiſtring the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi> but he could command no further than his own Church: for it was five or ſix years after this before the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſet up as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop</hi> (a title which <hi>Gregory</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed) by <hi>Phocas,</hi> who killing his Maſter had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the Empire. Yet little was done for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 200 years after this; the continual ſtirs cauſed by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> giving the Emperour no reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61196:32"/>About the year 800, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperour, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> moveth him to eſtabliſh a <hi>Liturgy</hi> by a Civil Edict, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; and <hi>Durandus</hi> telleth us that Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> Liturgy was it.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>Charles</hi> the Great compelled all Miniſters by threatnings and puniſhments; and this is the firſt <hi>authority</hi> we have for any thing of this nature: From whence we obſerve, That the firſt impoſing of a Common-Prayer Book was in favour to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and began with a perſecution.</p>
            <p>Nor after this was it glibly ſwallowed; for Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> amongſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>Durandus</hi> amongſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> tell us a pleaſant ſtory of one <hi>Eugenius</hi> complaining to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> at the impoſing of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Common-Prayer Book, (it ſhould ſeem he liked ſome other, poſſibly that which went about for St. <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> better) but it ſeems the complaint ran ſo high, that ſome Fathers juſt come from a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil met again to decide the matter, ſpent a night in prayer (having firſt laid both the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer Books, that of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and that of <hi>Gregory</hi> on St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Altar) to deſire of God by ſome ſign to ſhew which of thoſe <hi>Liturgies</hi> he would have univerſally uſed. In the morning they went in and found that of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his place, that of <hi>Gregory</hi> torn in pieces, and ſcattered up and down. From whence they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61196:33"/>
concluded that it was the will of God that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Office ſhould lye ſtill, and be uſed only in his own Church, <hi>Gregories</hi> ſhould be ſcattered over the world. And thus the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs-book (which is one point in which we differ from the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) was confirmed by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle too.</p>
            <p>He that asked the queſtion, <hi>By what Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer book the Fathers prayed that night when both their books were lockt up?</hi> Might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that we have heard of a <hi>Liturgy</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, only one would think that if he had been Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> he might have been angry to have ſeen his <hi>Liturgy</hi> thrown out, and one brought in patcht up by ſo many hundred years his <hi>Juniors,</hi> eſpecially having ſo much <hi>ſuperſtitious ſtuff</hi> in it, which he never owned. It may be it was for this he cauſed it to be torn ſo that night, not enduring ſuch traſh ſhould lye upon his Altar; but then the Fathers were miſerably out in their judgments upon the cauſe. This is the truth as to the pretended antiquity of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and as to the <hi>impoſition</hi> of them, by Canon-law from 600 to 800; by Canon and Civil Laws 800 years after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§. 15. In further proof of this, I ſhall but offer what the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee in <hi>Print,</hi> and what I know to be true.</p>

               <hi>thoſe that are extant may be interpolated, yet ſuch things as are found in them all, cenſiſtent to Catholick and Primitive Doctrine, may well be preſumed to have been from the firſt, eſpecially ſince we find no Originals of thoſe Liturgies from ancient Councils.</hi> This is all they ſay.</p>
            <p>What was replyed to this, is too large to tranſcribe, the Reader may read it in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Printed <hi>Account of the Proceedings,</hi> p. 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83. But becauſe every <hi>Reader</hi> may not have that book at hand, I ſhall add a few words.</p>
            <p>We know none will deny, but that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men might even from Chriſt's time have by them <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> either of their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, or other mens; but that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning all Miniſters in any Church were tyed to them, that we deny, nor can it be proved. It cannot be proved, that in the firſt 400 years there were any entire forms of Liturgy; that the Miniſters might before they began to pray, ſay, <hi>Surſum Corda,</hi> Lift up your hearts; or <hi>Dominus Vobiſcum,</hi> The Lord be with you; and the people of courſe ſay, <hi>And with thy Spirit;</hi> are far from proving, that there were any books directing them ſo to do. It is known that the <hi>Doxology, Glory be to the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> was not in any general uſe for more than 300 years after Chriſt; In the whole Anſwer
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61196:35"/>
there is nothing to prove, that for 500 years after Chriſt, there were any <hi>ſuch forms</hi> as <hi>all Miniſters in any one Church or Province, were commanded to uſe, and to perform their Miniſtry in prayer by,</hi> without varying from it. But the <hi>Reader</hi> may at his leaſure read much more in the <hi>Judicious Reply</hi> made by the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> on the other ſide. And if more could have been ſaid upon this argument, for the <hi>Antiquity of Liturgies,</hi> it is not probable it would have been omitted by 12 Biſhops, and ſo many learned men beſides, ſeveral of which have ſince that time been made Biſhops, and ſome of them are ſo at this day.</p>
            <p>§. 16. Our Reverend Brother talks therefore at a great deal too high a rate, when he tells us <hi>p.</hi> 110. of <hi>Forms of prayer embraced by the ancient Church, whiles it retained its ſoundneſs, and before the corruptions and diſtempers of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>took place;</hi> if by <hi>embraced,</hi> he means uſed generally by all Miniſters, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo to be uſed—and of <hi>our oppoſing our judgment againſt the concurrent judgment and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of Chriſt, in ſo many ſeveral Ages and Nations, and againſt the determination of God himſelf under the Old Teſtament, and our bleſſed Saviour under the New.</hi> Theſe words are not the words of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Soberneſs,</hi> nor do they ſavour of that <hi>ſpirit of Truth</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61196:35"/>
which we always had thought did dwell in our Brother; For if he means that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all ages have thought it <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>expedient</hi> to draw up <hi>forms of Prayer,</hi> that by <hi>them</hi> the <hi>weaker</hi> might be <hi>taught to pray;</hi> nay, that thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>People</hi> who have not attained that gift, may uſe them (ſtill covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and labouring for that gift) until they have attained it; none will deny it. But all this is nothing to the purpoſe; I know no <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi> will deny it, but ſay, <hi>Let them be in the Church,</hi> and <hi>for that uſe</hi> ſtill. The <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> in their Debates upon his <hi>Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> would never have tendred ſome <hi>Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Liturgy</hi> to the Biſhops, much leſs a <hi>new Liturgy or form,</hi> if they had been of this mind. But if our Reverend Brother means that they have been in the <hi>Church</hi> required to be uſed by <hi>all the Miniſters</hi> in their publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, in all ages, or in thoſe ages before the <hi>Corruptions, Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> crept in; there is not the leaſt proof made, either by our <hi>Reverend Brother,</hi> or any elſe that we could ever ſee, of a word of truth in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Let us now take a view of the State of the Church, from the year 500, to the year 1500; and ſee whether the Church was then in ſuch a State, that we may conclude all lawful
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61196:36"/>
that was, during that time, admitted in practice. All <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will deny it, eſpecially from the year 700. But let us examine a little.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>5th Century,</hi> they had got <hi>Images</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Churches at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nople:</hi> The <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Manger</hi> (which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> complains of) and of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nicephorus</hi>): they had got <hi>Altars</hi> alſo (<hi>Auguſtine, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Salvian</hi> often mention them); they had alſo got in <hi>Candles;</hi> uſing holy Water in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> they had alſo got in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and the cuſtom of giving the <hi>Lords Supper to children after Baptiſm;</hi> together with the wearing of a <hi>white garment after that Sacrament.</hi> They in many places mingled <hi>water</hi> with the <hi>wine in the Supper. Exorciſms</hi> were alſo crept in, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> tells us, <hi>lib. 20. de Civ. Dei. Lent</hi> alſo crept in, in this age, as we learn from <hi>Auguſtine, Cyril, Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Maximus. Nicephorus</hi> tells us alſo of abundance of <hi>Reliques</hi> now in faſhion. <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Monasteries</hi> began in this age to be very thick. The Doctrine of the Church was miſerably invaded by <hi>Pelagius.</hi> They began in this age to put only ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into Miniſtry in the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> as we may learn from the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> and <hi>Leo.</hi> They had now alſo brought in many new orders of Miniſters, <hi>Acolecthi, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcists, Subdeacons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61196:36"/>From the year 500, to the year 600, we ſhall yet find a ſtranger face of the Church; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Freewill, Justification by works, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the dead, Satisfactions for ſin, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> &amp;c. were in this age preached. In this age came in the Dedications and Conſecrations of Churches; the <hi>Conſecration of Wells</hi> for <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> the <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Chryſm;</hi> the <hi>Conſecrations of Altars, Cups, Corporals;</hi> the <hi>Maſs, offerings for the dead;</hi> the <hi>ſeven Letanies, Rogations;</hi> the <hi>ſeven Canonical hours;</hi> In ſhort, almoſt the whole fardel of the Popiſh Superſtitions.</p>
            <p>It is no great charge to any conſcientious man, to ſay he differs in ſome things from the Ruling part of the Church 5 or 600 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and that he judgeth it both inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and <hi>unlawful</hi> for him to do what they did in 40 particulars. We muſt now take our leave of the Romiſh Synagouge, from whoſe practices at this time, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the world differ in a multitude of things, both as to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> we muſt go ſeek for the <hi>true Church</hi> the next 1000 years in the <hi>Valleys of Piedmont,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the Provinces of <hi>Languedec, Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphiny,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> the <hi>poor people of Lions,</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> indeed moſtly in the <hi>Valleys</hi> of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> where we ſhall find them coopt up in the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, after St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> had fired him to engage <hi>Simon Montford,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61196:37"/>
with the <hi>French</hi> Kings leave, to deſtroy ſome hundred thouſands of them; thoſe that eſcaped, went to their <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Valleys of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> ſome of them, poſſibly, got into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Taborites, Piccards,</hi> &amp;c. Nor could I ever meet with any that could give me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any <hi>Liturgies</hi> they uſed, or which were impoſed on them, or by them; nor do I remember that the <hi>Piccards,</hi> when they came to <hi>Luther</hi> about 1520, or the Deputies of thoſe of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> when they came to adviſe with <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> 1530; though they gave him an account of their <hi>Faith, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> yet ever mentioned any thing of <hi>Liturgy;</hi> yet theſe two bodies of people are the only <hi>viſible Church</hi> we can give any account of, retaining any Degrees of Purity in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip</hi> or <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> for a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> which is double the time that the Church kept any degrees of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity after Chriſt. We will freely grant, that after the year 600, the <hi>Maſs-book</hi> was (<hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically</hi>) impoſed by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and within 200 years more by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the <hi>Valleys</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Prieſts generally both uſed that, and after 1200, made their Maker, worſhipped Images, prayed for the Dead, and prayed to Saints, ſaid their Service in <hi>Latin.</hi> But I hope it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any Proteſtant, that he owns no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church that did ſo for a thouſand
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61196:37"/>
years together, and doth ſo ſtill. And now our Reverend Brother ſees what his concurrent teſtimony of the Church in all ages comes to, till the year 1520, or thereabouts; for ten of thoſe fifteen ages we hope our <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> agreeth with them no better than we; and if he will leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and follow the Woman into the Wilderneſs, where God hid her for 1260 days, he will find no <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſhe carried with her, or commanded all her Miniſters there to uſe.</p>
            <p>If our <hi>Brother</hi> will reſolve to abide with the <hi>Red Dragon,</hi> that hath <hi>ſeven heads,</hi> and <hi>ten horns,</hi> and ſeven crowns, after he hath with his tail drawn down the third part of the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; we mean no more than keep his eye only upon the <hi>ſtately company at Rome,</hi> that after the year 600, call'd themſelves falſly the <hi>true Church,</hi> the only <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> we cannnot help it. We believe, that all along God had his number of hidden ones, within the challenged Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Church; but for the <hi>viſible govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part</hi> of them, we leave them ſoon after <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>'s time, believing them far more like a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan,</hi> than a <hi>Church of God,</hi> whoſe <hi>practice</hi> ſhould be any thing of a <hi>law</hi> or <hi>preſident</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have delivered our ſelves from the <hi>vulgar,</hi> and indeed no other than a poor popular prejudice of a diſſent from the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgment of the Church in all ages. We
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61196:38"/>
conſent with the five firſt ages, and for the ten latter, we alſo agree with the pure Church of God in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> for ought we could ever hear proved, relating to their practice. For other Churches; no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Churches</hi> this day in the world, but thinks twenty things unlawful, which both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches in thoſe ages practiſed.</p>
            <p>§. 17. We have but one prejudice more to deliver our ſelves from, and that is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reformed Churches ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. To try which, let us but again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what we ſay.</p>
            <p>We ſay <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> are in themſelves good and lawful, <hi>Good</hi> as means of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>lawful to be ſo uſed;</hi> yea, and alſo for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> until men have obtained an ability with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them fitly to expreſs their minds to God in Prayer; or when though they have that gift, yet, through the hand of God, in ſome natural inability they are hindred from the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>We ſay alſo, that where in a Nation or Church there is a multitude of Miniſters needful, ſo that it cannot be expected that a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould be found ſo competently qualified as they ſhould be; it is reaſonable there ſhould be <hi>forms made,</hi> which Miniſters may uſe, or not uſe, according as they find their abilities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61196:38"/>But we ſay it appeareth to us <hi>unlawful</hi> for thoſe to uſe them, to whom God hath given ſuch an ability, for the reaſons before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Now let us ſee how much in this we in judgment differ from any Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>The firſt Reformed Churches were in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Switzerland;</hi> whether thoſe to whom <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was the head, or the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> were the firſt, is hard to ſay: They by degrees abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the <hi>Maſs:</hi> they would have done it at firſt if they could. But alas! their people were newly come out of <hi>Popery,</hi> and they muſt drive the pace they would go.</p>
            <p>Let our Author, if he can, ſhew us that any of the Churches adhering to <hi>Zuinglius</hi> (whoſe Reformation was the pureſt) had any ſuch <hi>form of Prayers,</hi> as no Miniſters might vary from, or was enjoyned to uſe under a penalty. The <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Ritualis</hi> he ſpeaks of in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the <hi>Agenda</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he will find to be no more than a <hi>general Directory</hi> and Order, no preſcription of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phraſes.</hi> Let any one read <hi>Scultetus</hi> his <hi>Annales Rerun Evangelicarum,</hi> he will find the <hi>Agenda</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Nordlingen, Walſhat, Strasburgh, Zurich;</hi> let him ſee if he can find any thing of a form of Prayer, excepting the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> nor that impoſed, but ordinarily uſed.</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>Luther</hi> and his party were a little <hi>laxer,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> made a <hi>Maſs-book,</hi> correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61196:39"/>
much in the <hi>Popiſh Miſſal,</hi> but leaving in too much, to the great offence of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> as may be learned from another place of <hi>Scultetus.</hi> I know not but they might <hi>impoſe</hi> (for <hi>Luther,</hi> (though a great man) yet was too much of a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and for every one to conform to his humors); but yet I no-where have read that he did command his <hi>Miſſal</hi> to be read by all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that adhered to him. And for what he did as to his compoſition of a <hi>Miſſal,</hi> it was rather judged to croſs <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> and others, and uphold his notion of the <hi>Corporal preſence of Chriſt,</hi> than for any other reaſon. Next to this was the Reformation of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> For <hi>Geneva,</hi> what Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgment was, I cannot tell (I have not his Epiſtles by me to examine Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s Quotation); but however he was but one man, though a great one, it ſhould ſeem by the ſettlement there; if it were his judgment when he wrote to the <hi>Protector,</hi> it is like it was altered, or his <hi>Colleagues</hi> were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, or he only approved it for a time, in regard of the State of the Church, being newly crept out of <hi>Popery;</hi> for in the <hi>French Liturgy</hi> there is no tying up Miniſters to the <hi>uſe of their forms,</hi> though indeed they propoſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſome forms; it ſaith—<hi>The Miniſter ſhall make ſuch prayers as ſeem good to him, fitting for the time and matter he is in his Sermon to treat of.</hi> In another place—<hi>The form is according to the</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:61196:39"/>
               <hi>diſcretion of the Miniſter.</hi>—In a third place, <hi>They uſe this, or ſome like it.</hi> In a fourth place, <hi>He prayeth after this manner.</hi> What their practice is, I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>The work of our <hi>Reformation</hi> was ſlow, ſo as <hi>Scotland</hi> got the ſtart of us, though we ſet out firſt. <hi>Dioclavius</hi> tells us, <hi>Alt. Damaſc.</hi> p. 613.</p>
            <q>We have indeed in our Church <hi>Agenda,</hi> and an Order to be obſerved in our publick Devotion, but none is tyed either to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Exhortations in our Liturgy; they are propoſed for Examples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all the 13 years (ſaith he) that I exerciſed the Miniſtry in that Church, I never, neither at Sacrament, nor in other parts of my Religious Serivce, uſed either the Prayers or Exhortations in our book, nor did many more; every one was at liberty; and it ſeems child-like to me to do otherwiſe.</q>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> we uſed onother method, more conformable to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Reformation, than to that of <hi>Switzerland, Strasburgh, France</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or what was afterwards in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Countrey was wholly <hi>Popiſh,</hi> our <hi>Prieſts</hi> zealous for them; our common people ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that their <hi>Prieſts</hi> might have perſwaded them, that it was their duty to eat <hi>Hay</hi> with an Horſe; not an <hi>Engliſh Bible</hi> to be found in the Nation, until the middle of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61196:40"/>
Reign. The Reformation went on under the Conduct of a <hi>Popiſh King</hi> till <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> came to the Crown. Our <hi>Reformers</hi> did not think fit at once to aboliſh all the <hi>Popiſh traſh;</hi> Though therefore they firſt turned much of the <hi>Popiſh Maſs-book</hi> into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> leaving out much <hi>Idolatrous and Superſtitious ſtuff,</hi> yet they left in it too much, which cauſed a <hi>ſecond Common-Prayer-book</hi> to be made in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. though his whole Reign was but ſeven years; then came Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and deſtroyed all; and the <hi>zealous Proteſtants</hi> went out of the Nation, fixing ſome at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> ſome at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> &amp;c. At <hi>Frankfort</hi> the Miniſters that firſt fixed there, uſed no preſcribed forms in their publick worſhip, till at length Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> came amongſt them with the <hi>Common-Prayer book,</hi> made in <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. time, which made that woful ſtir, of which we have an account in the book called, <hi>the Troubles of Frankfort.</hi> In ſhort, Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> got the Magiſtrate on his ſide, and forced the reſt away to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other places. When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Throne, all know how great a man Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> proved. By his means, and ſome of his ſtamp, the <hi>Common-Prayer-book</hi> was again reviſed, and publiſhed; all Miniſters enjoyned to uſe it: but what a diſſent was from it, both all her Reign, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, all King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, is too ſad a ſtory to repeat. Whereas had it pleaſed God
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61196:40"/>
ſo to have moderated the ſpirits of our <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the beginning of her Reign, that they had only compoſed a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and left <hi>Miniſters to a liberty</hi> (as in all other Reformed Churches it is) all had been quiet. It is very like that the moſt of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> at that time being very little practiced in Praying, or in Preaching, would have uſed, and been ſtudying to pray without it; and long ere this we might have had flouriſhing Church ſhining in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with a Miniſtry that needed no book to have told them the words and ſyllables they muſt put up their prayers to God in. When, on the other ſide, theſe conteſts about this thing have carried ſome few into great extremes on both ſides. <hi>Some on one ſide thinking that there is no true Prayer, but by the Liturgy,</hi> at which they are very devout; but ſtudying to ſhew all manner of ſlight and irreverence at other prayers (believing them no true worſhip of God), no whole-faced Son of the Church muſt uſe any prayer in his family; no <hi>Lady</hi> or <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> any other prayer in her Cloſet, but this <hi>Common-prayer.</hi> It was a great objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a perſon of great <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> appearing for <hi>Knight of the Shire</hi> in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though he conſtantly attended publick prayers, and <hi>received the Sacrament</hi> as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that he uſed fanatick Prayers in his family,</hi> that is, <hi>his Chaplain there prayed not by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61196:41"/>
               <hi>forms at all times.</hi> This madneſs (not to ſay profaneneſs) by the way is to us a ſufficient argument againſt our uſe of any <hi>ſet publick forms</hi> in our <hi>Devotion;</hi> we ought not to nurſe up peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theſe moſt <hi>erroneous conceptions,</hi> to ſpeak no worſe of them. If people will adore <hi>humane conſtitutions at this rate,</hi> they muſt be to us <hi>Nehuſhtan.</hi> On the other ſide, this madneſs hath run ſome to that exceſs, that they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no <hi>forms</hi> to be <hi>lawful</hi> of any uſe, in any time, for any perſons; their children muſt not learn the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> nor a <hi>form of Catechiſm;</hi> none muſt hear a form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the number of theſe is very ſmall, and their judgment is as invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Forms of prayer are lawful,</hi> uſeful, many a good man learns to pray by a form, as Scholars learn to write by their Maſters firſt guidance of them, and holding their hand: They are uſeful and lawful <hi>for Devotion,</hi> for perſons that have not an ability, yea for Miniſters in that caſe. The people always pray by the form of him that miniſtreth. The Miniſter doth <hi>well, if he can do no better;</hi> he conducts the people that they may in faith ſay, <hi>Amen;</hi> he guides himſelf. But if he have an ability otherwiſe to do, we cannot think he doth his duty; and we are ſure every Miniſter ſhould have an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from himſelf both to pray and preach. How hard it is to keep out of extremes! I challenge any to ſhew me how our judgment
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61196:41"/>
thus ſtated and opened, diſſents from the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Will of God in Scripture, or of any valuable perſons in the Church of God in any age.</p>
            <p>§. 18. It is an eaſie thing for men to talk of <hi>all the Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Church in all ages;</hi> but it is an hard thing for thoſe that talk at this rate, to prove what they ſay in any tolerable meaſure. A man is right in his own cauſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him out.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61196:42"/>
againſt the <hi>plainer letter,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> this were to ſet up one <hi>higher</hi> than the <hi>higheſt;</hi> no, nor to practice any thing upon the recommendation of men, or in <hi>obedience</hi> to them contrary to what our <hi>conſciences</hi> tell us is the Will of God in <hi>Scripture.</hi> This were not to ſet up man above God poſſibly, but above <hi>Gods Deputy</hi> in our ſouls. All the Reverence we can owe to <hi>man</hi> in that cauſe, is to <hi>examine</hi> our <hi>opinion</hi> to the utmoſt, again and again, to <hi>compare things ſpiritual with things ſpiritual:</hi> But if after all our <hi>Conſciences</hi> ſay, <hi>It is not lawful</hi> to the utmoſt we can diſcern, it is not <hi>lawful:</hi> Though as to the reality of the truth of the notion, it is not all one; yet as to our <hi>practice,</hi> it muſt be all one; as if God ſaid from Heaven, <hi>It is not lawful for you.</hi> But in the preſent caſe, there is no other <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> appears againſt us from the judgment of the Church in former ages, than what was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>whole Proteſtant Religion</hi> objected by <hi>Harding. [It is not probable that God would leave his Church in Errors a thouſand years].</hi> We confeſs the judgment of what the <hi>Papiſt</hi> calls the Church for a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> is in a great meaſure againſt us.

in. We make the like challenge as to this point of the <hi>lawfulneſs of forms of prayer to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally uſed by Miniſters, or impoſed upon them.</hi> It certainly robbeth God of the moſt natural, proper <hi>Calves of our lips,</hi> and makes our <hi>lips</hi> but Miniſters to offer up <hi>others</hi> ſacrifices, when we have a <hi>male</hi> in our own flock.</p>
            <p>§. 20.

And this I take to be enough to have ſpoken on this <hi>Argument,</hi> until I hear what will be ſaid againſt any thing here ſpoken.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61196:43"/>
               <p>WHen I had finiſhed this diſcourſe, I had an intimation given me of ſomething ſpoken upon this Argument by one Mr. <hi>Pelling,</hi> Chaplain to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> in a book called <hi>The good old way.</hi> Though I was pretty well ſatisfied, that I could find in it nothing <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>words</hi> and <hi>confidence;</hi> yet for the ſatisfaction both of my ſelf and my <hi>friend,</hi> I procured the book in all haſte, and read it with as much <hi>greedineſs,</hi> though with no great <hi>expectations,</hi> as thinking it a <hi>barren ſubject,</hi> out of which little <hi>Reaſon</hi> would <hi>grow,</hi> but what we before had <hi>reapt,</hi> and proved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>fallacy</hi> and <hi>falſhood,</hi> and for which little <hi>varniſh</hi> of <hi>authority</hi> could be procured, but what we had waſhed off with a cloth <hi>wetted</hi> in a very ſmall degree of <hi>learning.</hi> I read it from the firſt to the laſt line upon this Theme.</p>
               <p>I at firſt obſerved, that <hi>all</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, was, That <hi>forms</hi> have been <hi>allowed</hi> and <hi>uſed,</hi> which may be granted, without the leaſt damage to our cauſe, who do not argue all <hi>forms</hi> unlawful, no nor all <hi>forms of prayer</hi> unlawful, no nor the <hi>uſe of forms of prayer</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; nor the uſe of <hi>all forms of prayer in praying unlawful;</hi> but <hi>the uſe of forms of prayer for all men, ordinarily, and that in publick ſolemn</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61196:43"/>
                  <hi>prayer.</hi> To prove which, he hath not ſaid a word; but yet ſeeing he will not ſpeak to what he ſhould (if he intended to ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe) let us conſider what he hath ſpoken to his <hi>own purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He will prove he ſaith, <hi>p. 49. That ſet-forms of Divine Service were of uſe amongſt the Jews. 2. That ſet forms of Divine Service were of uſe alſo amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians. 3. That after our bleſſed Lords aſcention, in that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val betwixt the burial of the Synagogue, and the ſetling of the Chriſtian Church, ſet-forms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service were allowed alſo, even by the holy Apoſtles.</hi> Three great undertakings.—<hi>Et quae non viribus iſtis—conveniunt.</hi> But if they were all proved, would no more prove, <hi>That it is lawful for all men ordinarily to perform their Miniſterial Acts in Prayer, by the preſcribed forms of others,</hi> than it would prove, that it were <hi>lawful,</hi> or not <hi>lawful,</hi> for all particular men and women, to <hi>marry,</hi> or not to <hi>marry,</hi> becauſe <hi>marriage</hi> was <hi>lawful</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and in the <hi>interval</hi> he talks of; or that it was not <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for ſome perſons to <hi>marry</hi> in all thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; both which Propoſitions are true. But let us ſee how he proves what he propounds to prove, be it what it will.</p>
               <p>And here we might have expected a <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proof</hi> for the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> of his <hi>periods,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61196:44"/>
and the <hi>third</hi> too (at leaſt the greater part of it) falleth within the time, of which the holy Scripture giveth us an account. But alas! of this we have very little, and what we have of another nature is <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> and proves nothing but to ſuch credulous ſouls as will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing which they read in any <hi>trifling Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. As to his firſt <hi>Period, from the beginning of the world till Chriſts time,</hi> I admire at the confidence of the <hi>Author,</hi> to urge the <hi>Jewiſh worſhip</hi> as a <hi>pattern to Chriſtians,</hi> when he knows that <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> were the two things which Chriſt came to <hi>alter;</hi> and although he retained <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> (parts of natural worſhip) and <hi>Exhortations,</hi> which were all uſed amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet we find no <hi>forms of words</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> uſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the retaining of which he directed: Nor did he uſe or retain <hi>inſtruments of Muſick</hi> in the worſhip of God; nor did the Primitive Chriſtians, for <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Qu. &amp; Reſp.</hi> 107. tells us, <hi>That they looked upon the uſe of muſick as a childiſh ſervice of God;</hi> and <hi>therefore uſed it not, only plain ſinging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It lies upon him to prove, that no <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Levite in the Jewiſh Church,</hi> might uſe <hi>any forms of prayer, or bleſſing, but thoſe he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth in their ordinary publick Service;</hi> and when he hath done that, we will take the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61196:44"/>
and prove, That neither the Diſciples did, nor any Chriſtians ought to uſe any Prayer but the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>When you pray, ſay,</hi> or pray <hi>after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Admit they <hi>did not;</hi> this will only prove, either that we muſt uſe no other, or that we may uſe <hi>forms of prayer</hi> directed by <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> or <hi>by his holy Prophets,</hi> or <hi>other Penmen</hi> of Scripture. But it will not prove, that all men either muſt uſe, or may uſe <hi>forms of prayer</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſcribed by God, nor <hi>by any men to whom God had given authority to make forms of prayer</hi> or <hi>praiſe</hi> for his Church. Surely it is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If we muſt, or may uſe a form of prayer or praiſe directed by <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>David, Aſaph, Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. then we muſt, or may uſe <hi>forms of prayer</hi> made by <hi>Pope Gregory, Pope Boniface,</hi> or by St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> or <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> and it is impoſſible but men of learning muſt ſee the inconcluſiveneſs of this Argument, only they muſt ſay ſomething, and <hi>ad populum phateras,</hi> any thing will ſerve thoſe that underſtand not. None that I have met with will ſay, that <hi>we muſt in praying, or bleſſing,</hi> uſe the <hi>forms of prayer</hi> and <hi>bleſſing</hi> uſed in Scripture, and <hi>no other.</hi> So then they only ſay <hi>we may uſe them.</hi> It is granted, and what wonder is it, if we may uſe <hi>ſuch forms of words in prayer,</hi> as are directed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>thoſe ſervants of his</hi> whom he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61196:45"/>
appointed to <hi>write the Holy Scriptures for us,</hi> which is the rule of all our <hi>Actions,</hi> and contain all that we are to <hi>believe,</hi> to <hi>pray for,</hi> and <hi>to do;</hi> though we judg it yet <hi>ſinful</hi> for <hi>all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> to tye themſelves to <hi>forms of prayers</hi> made by <hi>men</hi> that could never pretend to ſuch an authority to <hi>guide the Church</hi> as to what is to be <hi>believed, prayed for,</hi> or <hi>done,</hi> but only to rule it, by ſeeing the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have given, put in <hi>execution;</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whoſe proper offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it was to direct all things of lawful and neceſſary uſe in the Church, ever did any ſuch thing. But after this, <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> comes up, and he (forſooth) thinks it fit to enjoyn ſuch a thing: Or admit it were <hi>Baſil</hi> or <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> 200 years before him (which we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve), the caſe is the ſame, though not ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. I ſhall have done with what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith, as to his <hi>firſt period;</hi> only minding him, this is ſhooting at <hi>rovers,</hi> and will never hit any mark but that which is in very <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and <hi>childiſh</hi> perſons heads: It is an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the ſame power for the <hi>Governours of Churches</hi> ſince Chriſts and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, to <hi>ordain</hi> in <hi>matters of Worſhip,</hi> which they had; which is the ſame argument the <hi>Papiſts</hi> bring for their <hi>unwritten Traditions.</hi> If I had a mind to diſcover mens infirmities, I could
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61196:45"/>
take notice of many miſtakes of our Author in this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> but this is not my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>2. I proceed to his ſecond <hi>Period;</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>That preſcript forms of worſhip have been eſtabliſhed for above theſe 1200 years laſt paſt, no learned man can deny;</hi> he delivereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this bold aſſertion, in ſafe terms, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forms of worſhip:</hi> truly that I will not deny. I believe that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ordained, that men ſhould <hi>worſhip God</hi> by <hi>Prayers, Praiſes, Exhortations,</hi> and <hi>adminiſtring the Sacraments;</hi> this <hi>form of worſhip,</hi> yea, and that they ſhould <hi>Baptize in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (and were not theſe forms of worſhip?) theſe have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed 1600 years, he means more, though he either hath not worded it well, or had a mind to ſpeak ſafely, though he did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his <hi>Reader,</hi> and ſay nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If he means, <hi>That forms of words to be ordinarily uſed by all Miniſters ordinarily in their publick Prayers, were eſtabliſhed in the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>generally uſed,</hi> or <hi>required to be uſed</hi> in the <hi>univerſal Church, or any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of it theſe 1200 years,</hi> though I for once run the hazard of my repute for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this great <hi>Dictator,</hi> I ſhall deny it, yea and further challenge him and all his friends to prove any ſuch thing before <hi>Six hundred</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61196:46"/>
                  <hi>years after Chriſt,</hi> when <hi>Popery</hi> came in with a full <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tide.</hi> Let us hear his proof to the contrary of this aſſertion. He tells us,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is now 1312 years ſince the Council at</hi> Laodicea; <hi>and then it was decreed, that the Choriſters ſhould ſing by book, and that the ſame prayers ſhould ſerve for noon, and for Evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, for every Aſſembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſhould any Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be read, but what were received and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, having been delivered to them by their fore fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are three things aſſerted, 1. That this Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was held in the year 368. 2. That they made ſuch a Canon. 3. That this is the ſenſe of that Canon, <hi>That all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould uſe forms of prayer compoſed by others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture tells us in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, (which was more than two hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this) the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was a very <hi>lukewarm Church,</hi> neither <hi>hot,</hi> nor <hi>cold,</hi> ready to be <hi>ſpued out of Gods mouth, wretched, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, poor, blind, naked,</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> knowing not her own corruptions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. If ſuch a Church as this did make ſuch a <hi>Canon</hi> (which concerned only their own Province) it hath nothing in it, either of a <hi>juſt pattern</hi> to imitate, or of a <hi>juſt proof. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus</hi> tells us, that there was a Council held <hi>Anno</hi> 364; but there is not the leaſt mention
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61196:46"/>
of it in the <hi>Synodicon,</hi> publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> out of a <hi>M. S.</hi> wrote before the year 921. which yet giveth us an account of all <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> held from the <hi>Apoſtles time,</hi> to the <hi>8th Council</hi> held upon the union of <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Pope John. Caranza</hi> hath it, with 59 <hi>Canons</hi> it ſhould make; He ſaith there were but 22 Biſhops at it, of which the 18 Canon <hi>Caranza</hi> gives thus: <hi>De eo quod ſemper ſupplicationes Orationum ad horam novam &amp; veſperam oportet celebrari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That prayers ſhould be made both at 9 in the morning and evening;</hi> but whether <hi>conceived prayers,</hi> or <hi>by a form,</hi> it ſaith not; how <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamon</hi> reports it, I cannot tell; but it is more than I know, if <hi>Caranza</hi> is not to be believed as ſoon as <hi>Balſamon,</hi> and the <hi>Synodicon</hi> publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Pappas</hi> before them both. <hi>Balſamon</hi> dyed 1203, his Works came not out till long after, when the <hi>Papiſts</hi> publiſhed them, and all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> know there is no great credit to be given to their <hi>Editions</hi> of any <hi>ancient Authors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The upſhot then is this.</p>
               <p>1. It is very incertain whether there were ever ſuch a Council yea or no.</p>
               <p>2. If there were, there were but 22 men at it, and it concerned only a part of <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 It was a Church corrupt enough, and indeed he that reads the pretended Canons, will find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61196:47"/>4. This Council, according to <hi>Caranza,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed Prayers <hi>morning and evening,</hi> but did not preſcribe words.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Balſamon</hi> ſpeaks any thing which the late <hi>Papiſts</hi> had a mind to, who made him ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of their Father <hi>Gregory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. However this was 368 years after Chriſt, when the Church had as to worſhip loſt her Purity.</p>
               <p>His next proof is the <hi>Council of Carthage,</hi> which he ſays was 1284 years ago, that made a Canon, <hi>That if any man did compoſe any prayers, he ſhould not preſume to uſe them, till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the moſt knowing men in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The intent of which decree</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>was, That none ſhould have the liberty to uſe what forms of prayer he pleaſed, but that ſuch only ſhould be ſaid, as had been ratified by due autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ancient cuſtom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not like dictating. How doth this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor know that this <hi>Canon</hi> was made by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Carthage</hi> 1284 years ago? Firſt, if it were ſo, it was 396 years after Chriſts time, when as I ſaid before, the Church was corrupted enough in <hi>Rituals.</hi> But what will he ſay if that <hi>Council</hi> never made any ſuch <hi>Canon?</hi> I can ſhew him a good Author to prove it, that is <hi>Juſtellus,</hi> who publiſhed the <hi>African-Code.</hi> In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to it, <hi>p.</hi> 35. he ſpeaks thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61196:47"/>
                  <q>Whereas they ſay, that there was a third Council held at <hi>Carthage,</hi> when <hi>Caeſarius</hi> and <hi>Atticus</hi> were Conſuls; I the leſs refuſe it, becauſe <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Balſamo</hi> atteſt it, and the <hi>Africane</hi> Collection mentioneth it; but they are miſtaken who aſcribe 50 <hi>Canons</hi> to it, there are but 21 which were made by it, all the reſt were made 22 years after, in the time of <hi>Pope Boniface,</hi> in the year 419: and this is proved by the words of the 47 Canon; for <hi>Boniface</hi> was not <hi>Pope</hi> when <hi>Caeſarius</hi> and <hi>Atticus</hi> were <hi>Conſuls,</hi> but was ordained 418 when <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now this was Canon 23; ſo as it was not made before the year 419. But as to what this <hi>Canon</hi> ſaith, it is as material, and nothing to this Authors purpoſe: but for that I refer my Reader to what I have before ſaid in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Falconer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next proof is from the <hi>Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Milevis;</hi> as to which, I have fully ſpoken before, and only ſhall add this: That this pretended Canon is not to be found in the <hi>African-Code,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Juſtellus,</hi> where it ought to have been, if any ſuch had been made, and not been a temporary conſtitution. But for a fuller anſwer, I refer my Reader to what is before ſaid, having nothing to add to it. He goes on, and ſays, <hi>It was one great</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61196:48"/>
                  <hi>reaſon, amongſt many others, why publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies were compiled of old, that they might be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories of ſound Doctrine, and Preſervatives of the Catholick Faith.—Theſe were Antidotes to keep Chriſtians from being poiſoned with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and rotten Principles, as our Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is at this day an excellent Amulet againſt the infection from Papiſts, Socinians, Pelagians, and other modern ſeducers, and perhaps this is the Grand reaſon why the Belweathers of faction hate our Common-prayer-book,</hi> &amp;c. As is the man, ſo is his truth, ſo is his ſpirit. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have had <hi>Liturges</hi> theſe 1000 years, by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, they are the moſt <hi>orthodox people;</hi> and it would be enquired in <hi>England</hi> at this day, whether there be more <hi>Socinians, Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> amongſt thoſe that <hi>adore the Liturgy,</hi> or amongſt thoſe <hi>who have no kindneſs for that or any other.</hi> Let but the underſtanding Reader judg of all the reſt he ſaith, by the truth of this.</p>
               <p>In the next place he ſaith, it <hi>cannot be denied</hi> but <hi>Liturgies were in uſe</hi> in St. <hi>Baſils</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtomes time generally, who were about 380 years after Chriſt:</hi> and why cannot this be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied? becauſe he ſaith <hi>Liturgies are extant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their names.</hi> This learned argument will prove that there were alſo <hi>Liturgies</hi> in St. <hi>Marks,</hi> St. <hi>Peters,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews</hi> time, for there are <hi>Liturgies</hi> out alſo under their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61196:48"/>
names; yet this is all this Author hath to ſay why no body ſhould deny what he ſaith, as if there were not 100 books extant under the names of the Ancients, which not only <hi>Rivet</hi> and <hi>Cocus</hi> amongſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but <hi>Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Sixtus Senenſis, Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> amongſt the Papiſts have denied to be theirs, men all as learned as our Author.</p>
               <p>I have before ſhewed that the <hi>Liturgies</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under their names, could not be theirs. The noble and learned <hi>Lord of Mornay</hi> (whom our Author ſometimes ſpeaks highly of), <hi>l. 1. de miſſa,</hi> cap. 6. ſaith, <hi>Liturgies</hi> has <hi>omnes falſi poſtulo.</hi> I charge all theſe Liturgies as falſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Though we do not think that theſe are the very ſame which they uſed, becauſe later ages have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced them, and foiſted many heterogeneous things into them, yet 'tis Ridiculous to imagine that St.</hi> Baſil <hi>and St.</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>did not compile</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61196:49"/>
                  <hi>any, or that nothing of theſe was of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what if they did compile ſome? doth it therefore follow, that they required all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in their Dioceſſes to uſe them? But the truth is, this is a <hi>ridiculous argument</hi> to prove they compiled any, becauſe <hi>ſome go under their names;</hi> and a <hi>ridiculous</hi> anſwer to men, proving the forgery of thoſe pretended <hi>Liturgies</hi> from the uſe of <hi>terms</hi> not known in their Ages, of <hi>rites</hi> mentioned in them, which confeſſedly came not in of hundreds of years after they were dead; and of Prayers found in them for a <hi>Pope</hi> and an <hi>Emperor</hi> that lived 500 years after they were dead: I ſay it will appear, to anſwer all this, a moſt <hi>ſilly and ridiculous trifling,</hi> to tell us, <hi>It is true, ſome things are foiſted in ſince, but 'tis manifeſt they made Liturgies, and ſome parts of thoſe Liturgies.</hi> How is it manifeſt?</p>
               <p>Good Reader, obſerve what poſſibility of proof there is, that theſe men made <hi>no ſuch Liturgies;</hi> if this will not, it lyes upon them to prove they did make ſome: They produce Copies, divers Copies; we peruſe them, and find, 1. That no two of them agree each with other. 2. That the Doctrine in the Copies, is contrary to the Doctrine of thoſe times. 3. That there is in them Prayers for men that lived 500 years after they were dead. 4. That there are in them many rites and modes of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61196:49"/>
worſhip, not known of hundreds of years after they were both dead. But yet, ſaith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, 'tis. <hi>Ridiculous to think theſe Fathers did not make Liturgies, or that nothing of theſe was of their compoſing;</hi> yea 'tis <hi>ridiculous</hi> to aſſert any thing in them <hi>was of their compoſing,</hi> for what is there to prove it? Thoſe parts which the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, are foiſted in, come to us upon the ſame <hi>Tradition</hi> that the other parts do. What one thing is there in any of theſe <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which none but <hi>Baſil</hi> or <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> could be the Author of? If others might be the Authors, and that 500 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how doth it appear that <hi>Baſil</hi> or <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> muſt? we are ſure they were no Authors of a great part; what but a fooliſh fancy can make us believe they were the Authors of any part of them. But the truth is, this is the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer. My Lord of <hi>Morney</hi> quotes <hi>Eſpenceus de miſſa privata,</hi> p. 220.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It was (ſaith the Jeſuit) <hi>Leo Thuſcus</hi> that wrote the <hi>Scholion</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating alone, he lived in the year 1170, and was Secretary to <hi>Emanuel</hi> the Great, <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> and Interpreter to <hi>Trithemius</hi>—(Did not he make the whole Liturgy?) and had reſpect rather to his own times than <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomes?</hi>—Which (ſaith he) I mind you of, not that I think that <hi>Miſſal</hi> unworthy of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> or the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> or do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61196:50"/>
ſuſpect it, but think it began and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a moſt holy man, and enlarged by putting in many things, according to the variety of times.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As much might be ſaid for the Antiquity of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in which are many things of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive truth,</hi> though <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath put in a world of <hi>fooleries and wickedneſs;</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the whole is of no <hi>Primitive authority,</hi> though there be much <hi>Primitive truth</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>From hence our Author riſes higher, to tell us of St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Marks</hi> Liturgies, and <hi>Clements Conſtitutions;</hi> for the two firſt, I have ſaid enough before. For <hi>Clement,</hi> chuſe <hi>Reader</hi> whether thou wilt believe the D. of <hi>Somerſets</hi> Chaplain, or <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Hierome,</hi> who lived above 400 years after Chriſt, and knew of no ſuch book as <hi>Clements Conſtitutions;</hi> ſee <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, l. 3. cap.</hi> 32. See alſo what <hi>Morney</hi> ſaith of this, <hi>l. 1. de miſſa, p. 46. cap.</hi> 2. He that will believe all in <hi>Bibliotheca patrum,</hi> hath more faith than I have, or any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can have. But he will at laſt come to <hi>authentick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> that will ſatisfie any <hi>indifferent man,</hi> p. 56. <hi>if compared with the Liturgies</hi> (that is, with the forgeries) <hi>aforementioned, that ſuch and ſuch forms were uſed by Chriſtians in the firſt ages; and ſo that in all probability they were directed by the Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical men. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſed</hi> is not enough, if he could prove it; they muſt be <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi>

                  <hi>uſed,</hi> or <hi>required</hi> to be univerſally uſed. But let us hear what proof he hath.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>ſolemn Offices [ſolemnibus adimpletis]</hi> that muſt be underſtood of cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary forms of Prayer—and why?—becauſe he elſewhere hath <hi>ſurſum corda, Lift up your hearts.—We lift them to the Lord.</hi>—In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he ſaith—they prayed for ſeveral things <hi>continually</hi> and <hi>earneſtly;</hi> and theſe he ſaith, no doubt, were charitable forms, uſed in Morning and Evening-Service. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith they uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prayers; <hi>Origen</hi> quotes a form of three lines.—Queſtionleſs this was in the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirian</hi> Liturgy <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions, <hi>Dominica ſolemnia,</hi> and tells us of four parts of it, <hi>Reading the Scripture, Singing of Pſalms, Prayers</hi> and <hi>Adlocutions.</hi> Theſe he will have to be <hi>Biddings of Prayer;</hi> the <hi>Deacons</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Let us pray;</hi> then telling them what they ſhould pray for.</q>
               <p>So then, <hi>Preaching</hi> was no part of the <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Service,</hi> which I ſhould rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>Allocutiones,</hi> conſidering that there is a book called <hi>Dies Dominica,</hi> ſo abundantly proves it, and we have ſuch plentiful proof of it from <hi>Chryſoſtome, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But a thing never thought on by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, <hi>Bidding of Prayer,</hi> that (forſooth) muſt be made one of the parts of the <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice.</hi> Moſt ridiculous!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61196:51"/>But in all this, good Reader, conſider what little of proof there is, beſides the Authors <hi>Queſtionleſs,</hi> and <hi>without doubt. Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>ſolemn things</hi> [Offices he puts in], and are there no ſolemn things but <hi>Prayers made by forms?</hi> He hath <hi>ſurſum corda.</hi> And do not thoſe who pray by no forms, ordinarily begin with, <hi>Let us lift up our hearts to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith they pray <hi>continually</hi> and <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi> and might they not do ſo without a book? <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith they uſed <hi>Prayers appointed;</hi> but doth he ſay the words they ſhould uſe in thoſe prayers were alſo ſet and appointed them? <hi>Origen</hi> reciteth a <hi>form</hi> of three lines, and he might for ought we know, or ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, both make it and uſe it: but is it proved that the Church generally uſed that form? His interpretation of the <hi>Petitions</hi> mention'd by <hi>Tertullian</hi> as part of the ſolemn Service of the Sabbath, to be <hi>Collects,</hi> is a new whimſi of our Authors, and I think his Expoſition of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians ſine Monitore</hi> is as new and precacious; for, <hi>Tertullian's preces delegatae,</hi> they ſignified all the prayers which the Congregation put up to God, by their Miniſters delegated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to ſpeak to God in the name of all the people; who upon this account, by <hi>Greg.

                  </gap>, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome, Homil.</hi> 36. in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> That is, <hi>There ought never to be but one voice in the Church. He that readeth, readeth alone, and the Biſhop</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in the mean time ſilent. He that ſings, ſings alone; and when all ſing together,</hi> 'tis all as <hi>one voice,</hi> &amp;c. Our <hi>Author,</hi> in the laſt place, ſpends much <hi>Paper</hi> upon a quotation from <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi> It is too long to tranſcribe. <hi>p.</hi> 62. he comes to his <hi>Collections</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>1. He ſaith <hi>the Catechumeni were taught to pray, the congregation of believers praying with them; he would have them taught to pray by the Deacons, admoniſhing them to pray.</hi> Admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom? did they think we admoniſh thoſe not admitted yet into Church, to pray in the ſolemn Aſſembly of the Believers? Surely the latter; and they told them the general matter of Prayer. This certainly concludes they had no ſtated forms of words which they uſed, and might uſe no other. So fair a proof is this.</p>
               <p>2. In the next place he collecteth, that the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> did in a <hi>form make confeſſion</hi> of their <hi>faith.</hi> What is this to the purpoſe?</p>
               <p>3. In the third place he gathers from <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> that the <hi>Catechumeni were brought from the water to the congregatiou; and Sermon ended, they went jointly to prayer.</hi> So then they had a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> after it; but how
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61196:52"/>
doth it appear this was by a <hi>form of words</hi> from which they might not vary? <hi>Queſtionleſs,</hi> ſaith our Author: it is pretty that he ſhould think his <hi>Queſtionleſs</hi> ſhould make a good argument. But he hath found <hi>the form</hi> in <hi>Clements Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> a book not heard of 300 years after <hi>Clements</hi> death, out of what hole ſoever it is now come. All he ſaith elſe, is no more to the purpoſe, than that <hi>Prayers</hi> being ended, <hi>they ſaluted one another with an holy kiſs, they received the Sacrament, and prayed again, and praiſed God in a copious and large manner</hi> (by their Miniſter). And theſe prayers being concluded, the people jointly cryed out, <hi>Amen.</hi> What proof there is for <hi>forms of prayer,</hi> comes out of the forged <hi>Conſtitutions of Clement,</hi> and this <hi>Authors ſtrong fancy,</hi> not out of <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr:</hi> and our Author <hi>p.</hi> 62. confeſſeth <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us no ſuch things; but yet he ſaith, <hi>They did it,</hi>

                  </gap>. The <hi>Cyril</hi> he talks of as ſo ancient, was an Author lived near 500 years after Chriſt, and was not like to know ſo exactly what was done in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> time. Any writer now would be lookt on to give a very incertain account of what was done in <hi>England Anno</hi> 1200. nor would any give much credit to what he ſhould write.</p>
               <p>It is a great vanity men have, when they are <hi>eager of a thing,</hi> to fancy all they meet with to look that way, if they do but ſee a <hi>word,</hi> or a

                  </gap>, mightily triumphing, <hi>That he had found out Goſpel in the midſt of the law.</hi> The ſenſe of that Commandment was nothing elſe, but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſanctifie the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When, alas, the old Fathers meant no more, than that Chriſt in whom alone is <hi>reſt for our ſouls,</hi> was <hi>typified</hi> by the <hi>holy day of reſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the law; and though <hi>Chriſt</hi> be our <hi>reſt,</hi> our <hi>great reſt,</hi> yet he is not a <hi>day of reſt,</hi> which is that which the Commandment only ſpeaketh of. Juſt ſo I obſerve it is in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
               <p>Some men are ſo mightily zealous for <hi>ſtated</hi> and <hi>univerſally impoſed forms of prayer;</hi> that where-ever in any of the Ancients they meet with the words <hi>Liturgy, Offices, Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Prayers, ſolemn Services;</hi> they preſently think they have a full proof for <hi>forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, compoſed by others to be uſed by all Miniſters.</hi> When as, alas, there's nothing more weak and ridiculous, and theſe arguments ſpeak nothing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61196:53"/>
of reaſon, but only a <hi>fancy</hi> diſturb'd by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable <hi>paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſignifies nothing but an order of <hi>Miniſtration</hi> in holy things, which may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one <hi>form of prayer,</hi> only directing the <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>times</hi> when the Miniſters ſhall pray. <hi>Offices,</hi> in the ancients, ſignifies no more than <hi>Duties:</hi> The approbation of the term <hi>Offices,</hi> to <hi>forms of prayer</hi> to be uſed at <hi>Burials Chriſtnings,</hi> &amp;c. is but a very modern <hi>Popiſh Device</hi> to ſuggeſt to ſilly ſouls, that Miniſters did not do their duties, if they did not uſe their <hi>Miſſals</hi> and <hi>Rituals,</hi> &amp;c. and ſurely <hi>Prayers</hi> and ſolemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices may be without forms, and ſo may <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers</hi> too.</p>
               <p>I am the more confirmed in this by what our Author ſaith next, wherein he undertakes a thing beyond all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> to prove, <hi>That in the Apoſtles times, and in the interval betwixt the burial of the Jewiſh Synagogue, and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the Chriſtian Church ſet-forms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid of <hi>Prayers for all Miniſters) were allowed alſo.</hi>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61196:53"/>
examine what Arguments he hath. 1. His firſt proof is <hi>from the Apoſtles going to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to worſhip and pray,</hi> Acts 2. 46. Acts 3. 2. and (2.) <hi>the Apoſtles juſtifying themſelves,</hi> Acts 25. 8. 24. 12. 28. 17. <hi>that they had nothing againſt the temple, or the law:</hi> and 3. <hi>the Jews tenaciouſneſs of their Rituals:</hi> all which are proved well enough, <hi>p.</hi> 63, 64. But how will our Author prove that the Jewiſh Miniſters in their <hi>Temple-ſervice</hi> uſed any preſcribed <hi>forms of prayer which others had made for them, and enjoyned them,</hi> who were no <hi>inſpired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> or <hi>Penmen</hi> of <hi>holy Writ?</hi> He hath not yet proved this.</p>
               <p>Or how will he prove that the <hi>Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Temples or Synagogues</hi> miniſtred <hi>at any time by ſuch forms:</hi> we will prove they <hi>ſometimes preached there,</hi> but it lyes upon our <hi>Author</hi> to prove they <hi>read prayers,</hi> for that we find not; and we grant they may <hi>hear prayers</hi> that are <hi>forms,</hi> if the matter be good. It is a ſign of an ill cauſe, or a weak <hi>Diſputant,</hi> to pack on <hi>proof</hi> where none needed, but bring none where all the <hi>pinch</hi> and <hi>ſtreſs</hi> lay. Our <hi>Author</hi> here takes it for granted, what is moſt notoriouſly falſe, That the Apoſtles <hi>conſtantly attended</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Service</hi> both in the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Synagognes,</hi> only met together in other places, for the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and <hi>ſuch ſervice as they could not joyn with the Jews in;</hi> but that

is not to our purpoſe, nor yet to examine how well by his <hi>Dial</hi> he hath rectified the Sun, tranſlating <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But he is not ſatisfied that in the <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles times</hi> there were <hi>no manner of forms.</hi> Who ſays there were not?

               </p>
               <p>He comes a little to the point, <hi>p.</hi> 67. His firſt pretended proof, is what divers have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon before him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. we grant him from that Text,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That the ſeveral ſorts of prayers are there mentioned. 2.

But whereas he goes on, and tells us in the third place, <hi>p</hi> 68. <hi>That it is as clear, that the whole Church of Chriſt hath conceived, and taken it for granted in all ages, that the Apoſtle in this place did intend to fix a rule of Devotion, and did order a Platform and Model to be obſerved in all publick Services, and eſpecially at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61196:54"/>
                  <hi>of the holy Communion;</hi> if he means a <hi>plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phraſes not to be varied from;</hi> It is ſo far from being <hi>clear,</hi> that no proof can be brought of it, nor do (as himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) the Apoſtles words inforce any ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, nor his following quotations out of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, Ambroſe,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtine</hi> prove the leaſt of it. All reſts upon the <hi>practice of the Church</hi> ſince, for which indeed much may be ſaid, after 600 years after Chriſt, but nothing of any weight or moment before that time. And for the <hi>Churches judgment</hi> in <hi>Pope Gregory</hi>'s time as to <hi>Rituals,</hi> it is a very ill proof of what was done in the <hi>Apoſtles time</hi> in all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> goes on ſtill, and will not ſay it is demonſtrable; but he tells us <hi>it ſeems very probable, that the Apoſtles themſelves did in their ordinary Miniſtrations obſerve forms of prayer, notwithſtanding thoſe extraordinary aſſiſtances of the ſpirit which they were bleſt with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Strange! the Apoſtles! what men that received not their Miniſtry <hi>of men, nor by men,</hi> but immediately <hi>from Chriſt</hi> (then he muſt give them their forms)! <hi>men</hi> that hath thoſe extraordinary effuſions of the ſpirit! Surely there is <gap reason="foreign">

to accept his Laws, made them believe that he had them from the Goddeſs <hi>Ageria;</hi> Well, but our Author doth not believe <hi>they uſed a book,</hi> (we thank him for that (the <hi>Parchments</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> left at <hi>Troas,</hi> then ſhall not riſe up in judgment againſt us, though his Cloak may), nor doth he think <hi>they tyed themſelves to words,</hi> (but this they muſt, if they uſed forms of words); all that he will aſſert, that they uſed a <hi>certain method,</hi> and the <hi>matter and ſubſtance of their ordinary ſervices, was for the moſt part the ſame.</hi> We thank him for nothing; then <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> uſe <hi>forms of prayer,</hi> as well as <hi>Conformists;</hi> we ſhall never need examine his <hi>reaſons,</hi> when we grant the thing; for if they be ſtrong, it is but to confirm what none doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; if <hi>weak,</hi> it would be but to <hi>expoſe</hi> an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> whoſe book ſeems to be calculated for his <hi>reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far I have examined all the pretended <hi>proof</hi> from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> rather <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and to ſatisfie ſome peoples curioſity, than for any other reaſon. And in the cloſe let me give my Reader a caution againſt this kind of arguing, which I doubt not but will appear very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
               <p>1. The Reader muſt know, that <hi>Printing</hi> hath not been known in the world yet 200 years; before that time, all was in <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:61196:55"/>2. The moſt of the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> were in <hi>Papiſts hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and from them it is that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> came which were printed; indeed, the <hi>Bible</hi> was in the <hi>Jews hands</hi> (as to the Old Teſtament) we were infinitely acurate in preſerving the purity of it, keeping account both of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of lines in pages, and how often the ſame letter was uſed in each line; the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was in the hands of the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> as well as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſo that they could not well deprave that.</p>
               <p>3. That as the Church was <hi>debauching in ſome rituals</hi> before 300 years after Chriſt was expired; ſo ever ſince 600 it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, much in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> more in matters of <hi>Worſhip, Rites, Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That from the year 600, to 1516, the generality of all ancient <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> being in their hands, and that Church all along grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe and worſe, more ſottiſhly idolatrous, ſuperſtitious and ignorant (as to the generality of their Miniſters), they made it their buſineſs to put out, and put in to the Writings of the ancients what they pleaſed, to forge Writings to be theirs, which were not ſo, and ſuppreſs others that were ſo, which is evident from the Writings of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtants. Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Senenſis, Poſſevine, Bellarmine,</hi> were all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſts;</hi> ſo was <hi>Eraſmus. Rivet</hi> and <hi>Cocus</hi> were Proteſtants, they have all books extant to teach
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61196:56"/>
us to diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>true Writings of the Ancients,</hi> and thoſe <hi>pretended to be theirs,</hi> but not ſo. And there is no doubt, but it was through meer careleſneſs, if they left a word or line in the ancients, againſt any <hi>point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> any <hi>way</hi> of Worſhip, any Rite or <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> in credit at <hi>Rome,</hi> or uſed in their Church.</p>
               <p>5. From them came <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Ignatius, Clement, Tertullian, Ambroſe, Auguſtine;</hi> in ſhort, all the Writings of the Fathers we have, (except poſſibly ſome two or three of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers); yet the moſt famous and common Editions of them, are all <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and come out to us with their puttings out, and puttings in what they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>6. From hence will appear, what little credit is to be given to any thing, in any of the books publiſhed under their names, any further than it is agreeable with the Scripture, and bottomed there.</p>
               <p>7. Allow me the <hi>Editions</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have let us have, I hardly know one <hi>Doctrine of Popery,</hi> or one <hi>Idolatrous</hi> or <hi>Superſtitious Practice, Rite</hi> or <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but I will bring as good proof for, as either Mr. <hi>Faulconer</hi> or Mr. <hi>Pelling</hi> have brought for the <hi>Antiquity of forms of prayer generally uſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. From hence it follows, that thoſe who lay ſuch ſtreſs on this point of <hi>Antiquity</hi> in the caſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61196:56"/>
are but doing the <hi>Papiſts work,</hi> laying a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Papiſts to build all their abominable <hi>Doctrines, Idolatries,</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> upon, and he is half a Papiſt that is reſolved to believe all thoſe things true which may be found in the ancient Writings, as we have them. We have ſo much charity for thoſe great and holy men, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they never wrote any ſuch things, though ſome <hi>Popiſh Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> have fathered them upon them.</p>
               <p>9. If any will yet believe what they find in their Works, as we now have them, he ſtands obliged not to do it <hi>raſhly,</hi> but to read, 1. what both Papiſts and Proteſtants have wrote, as to that book of theirs out of which the <hi>Quotation</hi> is. 2. Then to conſider what was the <hi>ſignification of the words, Liturgy, Merit, Offices,</hi> and an 100 more in that age; and whether we have not put a new ſenſe upon them, not known in their times. 3. To conſider how far in the judgment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants the Church was corrupted in the times when thoſe Fathers wrote.</p>
               <p>10. This I take to be a tedious work; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. hath taught me a nearer and ſafer courſe: <hi>To the law, and to the teſtimony: if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> Does any ſay, but how will you know the ſenſe of the Scriptures? I anſwer from my own <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>reaſon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring things ſpiritual, with things ſpiritual, and</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61196:57"/>
                  <hi>hearing the judgments of others,</hi> before I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Will they ſay, but you may be deceived? it is true, ſo might the Fathers: but in things neceſſary, if I uſe <hi>prayer,</hi> I have a promiſe, <hi>The Spirit ſhall lead you into all truth.</hi> I am ſure I can from Scripture be as certain of the Will of God in any caſe, as I can be, that <hi>any one leaf</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> were ever written by them; and if it were, I am ſure they were <hi>fallible men</hi> as well as I, and in many things did err. The preſſing and laying ſo much ſtreſs as men do (ſome men) on <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>antiquity,</hi> is in truth nothing but a <hi>mighty facturing for Popery,</hi> and it is impoſſible but learned men muſt underſtand ſo much. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, not one, often, who talks ſo much of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and <hi>antiquity,</hi> regards what <hi>Edition</hi> he <hi>quotes,</hi> or <hi>makes uſe of;</hi> and all know, that where there is one of the Ancients to be got, ſo much as of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Edition (who was a <hi>Papiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but ſeemeth <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi>), there are ten of <hi>filthy</hi> and moſt <hi>corrupt Popiſh Editions,</hi> where the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> can ſafely truſt nothing. And thus much ſhall ſerve for Mr. <hi>Pelling,</hi> for I am not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to what he ſaith for the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> let it be as fine a thing as it will; if it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to <hi>uſe any</hi> in my <hi>Miniſtration</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is moſt certainly unlawful for me to uſe that, and at that boundary I ſtick, till better reaſon than I have yet met with, removes me from it.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61196:59"/>It is agreed on all hands by the Evangeliſts, that our Saviour at this time prayed but three times; <hi>Luke</hi> mentions but one, <hi>Mark</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons two, <hi>Matthew</hi> mentions three. Here are four forms; how is it poſſible that he ſhould then uſe the ſame <hi>ſyllabical words</hi> twice, and yet uſe all the forms as they lye before us? In earneſt, the <hi>Argument</hi> from this Text is ſuch a trifle, as I am aſhamed to examine it, leſt ſome ſhould think me as ſimple as they that uſe it; for it is as much idleneſs to pelt a Puppet, as to make it. Thoſe who argue from this <hi>Topick,</hi> muſt be acquainted little with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the <hi>Greek,</hi> or with the Scripture; and thoſe that think it militates againſt my Poſition, muſt have as little acquaintance, either with it, or with common ſenſe, chuſe they whether. My <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is unlawful for Miniſters whom God hath furniſhed with the gift of Prayer, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to perform their miniſterial Acts in publick ſolemn prayer, by the preſcribed forms of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No (muſt they ſay) Chriſt did it: Say they ſo? who made theſe forms for him, I wonder? who denies but that a perſon furniſhed with the gift of prayer, may pray by a form compoſed in his own heart? who ſays <hi>forms of prayer</hi> are ſinful in that degree as <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> ſo that God himſelf cannot legitimate them? who ſaith, that when we are to pray for one and the ſame
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61196:59"/>
thing, we may not uſe the ſame words which we have before conceived in our own hearts? Now what doth this Text prove more? If it could be proved that our <hi>Saviour</hi> did uſe the ſame words <hi>ſyllabically</hi> two or three times, which it is plain he did not; if he did not pray <hi>ſix</hi> times inſtead of three (which are all the Evangeliſts mention), yet I hope he made uſe of words conceived by himſelf; and I do not read that he left any order, that his Diſciples, or the Church ſhould afterwards uſe theſe very words, and no other in a ſtate of affliction; if he had, ſurely we ought to have had no other <hi>Collect for ſick and afflicted perſons;</hi> and by his varying four times (or three times), he taught us that we may lawfully vary our words, and yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, pray to the ſame ſenſe, and make the ſame to be the matter of our Petitions. So that thoſe who triumph in this Argument, do not only <hi>triumph before the Victory</hi> (which the <hi>Proverb</hi> makes abſurd), but they <hi>triumph</hi> in the thing by which they are <hi>conquered;</hi> which yet if it be rightly done, is but ingenuous; for we ought to rejoyce when <hi>Truth</hi> (to which all rational ſouls are debtors) prevaileth. By which (Reverend Sir) you may ſee I am very well pleaſed at the news<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that my little book ſhall be anſwered. I do not think it worthy of a man to be afraid of an Anſwer; and profeſs to you rom my heart, that I ſhould be glad to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61196:60"/>
ſee an ingenuous anſwer, to which I ſhould not be able to make a reply <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to my ſelf, or any reaſonable perſons. I will aſſure you it would go a great way to deliver me from the name of a <hi>Diſſenter:</hi> But for a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> to be made a meer <hi>Miniſter of men,</hi> to read, or ſay in his Miniſterial Acts only what men would have them, is what I am ſo far from thinking <hi>lawful,</hi> that I cannot entertain a thought of it with that patience I ordinarily uſe in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which appear to me of a lighter nature: This is my preſent apprehenſion of this matter. I ſeek for <hi>Truth,</hi> and not for <hi>Maſteries,</hi> and ſhall therefore rejoyce if any can inform me better; but you ſee it muſt be with better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments than theſe, though this be as good an argument, I muſt needs ſay, as that from <hi>Hoſea 14. Take unto you words, and ſay,</hi> &amp;c. and many others. But I have enlarged too much upon ſo inconcludent an argument, unleſs (as I hope) it will conclude that I am,</p>
