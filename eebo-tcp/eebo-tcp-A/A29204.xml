         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROV. 28. 13.</bibl>
               <q>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them, shall have mercy.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these Words, two different Ways, which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
take to attain to Happiness, are represented
to us; The one short and broad, but impassable,
by reason of Thieves and Precipices; <hi>He that
covereth his sins shall not prosper:</hi> the other long and
strait, but certain and secure, <hi>Who so confesseth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh
them, shall have mercy.</hi> Or if you will, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Shipwrack, wherein two Planks are presented to
us, to save us from drowning; The one painted, but
rotten, which will undoubtedly deceive us, that is,
the Plank of Dissimulation: <hi>He that covereth his sins
shall not prosper:</hi> The other rugged, but sound, which
will infallibly bring us safe to Land, that is, the Plank
of Repentance; <hi>He that confesseth and forsaketh them,
shall have mercie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or lastly, We may consider herein the Sore, the
Chyrurgery, and the Success: The Store is Sin, the
Course of Chyrurgery is double and different, the
one by healing over, or binding up, the other by inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103291:3"/>
or cleansing out; the one with supple Oyl, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with sharp Vineger; the one by bathing, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by lancing; the one by covering, the other by
confessing. The Success is likewise double, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
proportionable to the two ways of cure; the
one unprosperous, <hi>shall not prosper;</hi> the other prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<hi>shall have mercy. He that covereth his sins shall
not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them,
shall have mercie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sore is spiritual and epidemical, that's Sin,
2. <hi>Chron. 6. When every one shall know his own sore.</hi>
And more emphatically <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 6. it is styled a <hi>putrifying
sore.</hi> So long as our first Parents continued in the
state of Innocencie, Roses grew without Thorns, as
St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> observed. As there was no Sin, so there
was no Sickness; no Sores in the World, either of
Soul or Body. Indeed it was not impossible for them
to sin, so they should have been Gods, not Men; but
it was possible for them not to have sinned, which is as
much as the Angels in Heaven can challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
for many of them fell irrecoverably, because
they found not a Redeemer, and those, which stood,
owe their Conservation, as we do our Redemption,
to the Cross of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. But by the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
the Image of God became defaced in Man, the
Rays of heavenly Light eclipsed, the Sparkles of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace cooled, the Understanding infatuated, the
Will confounded, the Affections disordered, and in
place of these Perfections, Sin entered into the world
as an Hereditary Contagion, a spirituall Leprosie, with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103291:3"/>
the Consequents of it, all manner of Sores and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
both of Soul and Body, which cannot be cur'd
with all the Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> nor cleans'd with all the
Water in the Ocean; but onely by the Blood of
Christ, and in order to that, by Repentance; which
is the Cure commended in my Text.</p>
            <p>Hence all those swarms of Fevers, Catarrhs, Gouts,
Palsies, Apoplexies, and the like, which do infest the
Body of Man more than any other living Creatures:
We may be burned up with Cholerick Distempers,
drowned with Hydropick Humours, choak'd with
the Fumes of a vitious Stomack, and buried quick in
the Grave of Melancholick Imaginations. But the
chiefest Defects are those of the Soul, as 1. Ignorance,
that in so thick a mist of Errours and Sects, we know
not how to finde out the Truth; and that, which tops
up our Folly, is, That we are grown too wise in our
own conceits. 2. Concupiscence, that Pestilence
of the Soul, whose cankered Blossoms are still sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in the most Regenerate Hearts; this weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Power of <hi>Sampson,</hi> infatuated the Wisdom of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> defiled the Holiness of <hi>David.</hi> 3. Self-love,
an hidden Poyson, the Rust of the Minde, the
Moth of Holiness, the Parent of Envie, the Original
of all Vices. 4. Discontent, which makes up prize
what we want, sleight what we enjoy, more sensible
of Sufferings than of Blessings; like little Children,
which for want of some Toy which they affect, throw
away all they have, and fall a crying: we follow
Contentment hard, but as Fools do an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103291:4"/>
always at a distance. 5. Preposterous fear; If we
do ill, we fear Magistrates; if we do well, we fear
Detractors: if we be rich, we fear Thieves; if poor,
Creditors; if we hate, we fear Enemies; if we love,
Corrivals. 6. Distrust; We all say, We trust God,
but for the most part sooner with our Souls, than with
our Estates, and hardly without a Pawn, as Usurers
would trust a Bankrupt. Lastly Hypocrisie: If there
be a Mote in the Eye, there is a Beam in the Heart; if
there be a Beam in the Eye, there is a Stack of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in the Heart: We look one way, and row ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; blow hot and cold with the same Mouth,
and have our Hearts more double than our breath:
We flatter for advantage, and we slander for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
we serve God for advantage, and if need be,
we serve the Devil for advantage. Then since we
have all made shipwrack of Baptismal Grace by sin,
since all without exception do stand in need of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Plank to save them from drowning, it remains
that we make choice of one of the two presented to
us in my Text, Dissimulation, or Conversion; Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Confessing: That's the next part: <hi>He that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth
and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three good covers of sin in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
1. Charity, 2. Conversion, 3. Pardon: The
two first are mens covers, the third is Gods cover.</p>
            <p>1. Charity, <hi>Prov. 10. 12. Hatred stirreth up strife,
but love covereth all sins,</hi> and 1. <hi>Pet. 4. 8. Charity shall
cover the multitude of sins;</hi> Charity thinketh no evil,
Charity suspecteth no hurt, Charity interprets all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103291:4"/>
things in the best sense; Charity doth not aggravate
or exaggerate the faults of men, but seeks to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
them, imputing them to a good Intention, or to
Ignorance, or to Surprize, or to the violence of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation:
Charity delights not in carrying about far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
of Tales and Calumnies, as Pedlars do their Packs,
from House to House, nor to divulge the Faults of
Men, as cursed <hi>Cham</hi> did the Nakedness of his Father;
but to conceal them, and to suppress them, as <hi>Joseph</hi>
was not willing to make <hi>Mary</hi> a publique example:
Charity is not vindictive, to write Injuries in Marble,
but buries them in oblivion. He that wants this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
is an unclean Vessel; He that hath not this wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Garment, is sure to be cast into outer darkness;
but he that hath it is blessed; he shall prosper: <hi>Judge
not, and you shall not be judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second good Cover is Conversion, <hi>Jam. 5. 20.
He that converteth a sinner, shall save a soul, and hide
a multitude of sins.</hi> Just as he converts a Sinner, and
saves a Soul, so he hides sins; not primitively, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivatively;
not principally, but subordinately; not
sovereignly, but ministerially. He converts morally,
but Grace, Physically; he by perswading, but Grace
by renewing. Now Conversion being an infallible
way to Remission, he that helps to convert, helps to
cover sin; that's one way. 2. He that converts a man
helps to amend him, and after amendment the shame
of former sins is covered; the memory of them is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Badge of Honour, than a note of Ignominy;
like the scar of a Souldiers wound, after it is healed.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103291:5"/>
Thus he hides the sins of his Convert. But he hides
his own sin likewise, that is, dispositively he renders
himself more capable of Gods pardon. <hi>Blessed are
the merciful, for they shall finde mercy:</hi> But those bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Bodies, whose Affections are stronger than their
Judgements, who labour with tooth and nail to spread
abroad their erroneous Dreams, must expect no share
in this Blessing: <hi>VVo be to you Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites: for you compass sea and and land to make a
Proselyte, and make him two-fold more a child of Hell,
than your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third kinde of covering of sin is the forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of it. <hi>Psal. 85. 2. Thou hast forgiven their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and covered all their sins:</hi> that is, covered them
from the eye of thy Justice; as a Wound is covered
with a Plaister, to cure it; as a dead Body is covered
in the Grave, to avoid the stench of it; as the Doors
of the Israelites were covered with the Blood of the
Paschal Lamb, to cause the destroying Angel to pass
by them. In the same regard elsewhere the Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins is called a <hi>forgetting of them,</hi> a <hi>casting of
them behinde the back,</hi> a <hi>burying them in the bottom of
the sea:</hi> of all Covers, this is the best, <hi>Psal. 32. 1.
Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, and
whose sin is covered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these are not the Covers intended in my Text,
the first of which is down-right Denial, as <hi>Gehezi</hi>
thought to have out-faced his Master, and <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> St. <hi>Peter. Prov. 30. The harlot eateth and
wipeth her mouth, and saith, What have I done?</hi> Men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103291:5"/>
are too apt to forget the all-seeing Eye of GOD; like
Woodcocks, which thrust their Heads in a Bush, and
think no man sees them, because they see no man. Let
the leprosie of <hi>Gehezi,</hi> let the sudden death of <hi>Ananias</hi>
&amp; <hi>Sapphira</hi> warn us to take heed how we seek to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our faults with lyes; well may it advantage a man
a little for the present, as a lye got St. <hi>Peter</hi> his admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the high Priests hall, but it hath ever a foul end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and within a while forfeits the whole stock of a
mans credit and reputation: Therefore the Scripture
saith, That <hi>a lying Tongue is but for a moment; and to
God it is a very abomination,</hi> Prov. 12. 22. Then tell the
Truth, and shame the Devil: When a Fault is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
discovered, the Amends is half made.</p>
            <p>The second Cover is mincing or extenuating of our
sins, as the Sluggard, <hi>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,</hi>
and <hi>Jonathan</hi> did but taste a little Honey upon his
Rods end: But <hi>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,
a few dead flies cause the oyntment of the Apothecarie to
stink,</hi> Eccl. 11. He that clippeth a little of the Kings
Coyn, is guilty of Treason; every little Sand hath his
weight; and it is all one whether a man be pressed
to death with an heap of Sand, or a Mass of Lead, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Ship be overwhelmed with one great wave, or
drowned with many small Leaks. More perish by
the daily habitual presumptuous practice of lesser sins,
than by one foul act of some greater sin. We detest
that horrid Paradox, That all sins are equal; That he
is as great a Transgressor that kills a Cock-Chicken
without a cause, as he that murthers a Prince. But he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103291:6"/>
that makes light of any sin, when he comes to make
up his account with God, destroys himself; yet this
is often our Condition: <hi>A mote in our neighbours eye,
shews greater than a beam in our own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Cover is that of Excuses. <hi>Saul</hi> pleads
for a Sacrifice to the Lord, to excuse his own Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<hi>Gehezi</hi> pleads the necessity of the Sons of
the Prophets for his Bribery, <hi>Judas</hi> alleageth the poor
to palliate his Covetousness. When the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
invites Men to his great Supper, one hath marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Wife, another purchased a Farm, the third must
go to prove some Oxen; many frame Excuses to
themselves with as much ease as the Spider weaves her
Webs. Every Sin hath its Cloak, Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
pretends zeal of Justice; Willful Murther, I
mean in our Duellists, which cries to Heaven for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
muffles it self up in the Cloak of Honour and
Reputation. These Fig-tree Leaves may serve to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our Sins well enough, whilst it is Vacation; but
take heed of the Term-time when it comes: When
Conscience begins to spit Fire and Brimstone in our
Face, when the Devil pulls off the Hood wherewith
he hath blinded us; then all these painted Excuses va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
away, we hear nothing but Hues and Cries, we
see nothing but evident Destruction.</p>
            <p>The fourth Cover is, Transferring of our sins upon
others; as <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Woman, the Israelites up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Fathers. <hi>The Fathers have eaten sowre grapes,
and the Childrens teeth are set on edge;</hi> as if the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Delinquents did lessen the Offence; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103291:6"/>
the more the Transgressors, the nearer are the
Judgements of God. Others accuse the Times, and
evil Company of their Faults. How should one stick
say it remained unscorch'd in the midst of a flaming
Bundle? 'Tis true, <hi>As fire begets fire, so doth sin; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
manners corrupt good,</hi> though the operation be not
always present: Poyson must have a time of working:
The more our familiarity grows with sin, the less the
deformity thereof appears: After the Musick is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Tune still remains in our Ears. He that
makes Conscience of his Ways, must avoid evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
as he would do Poyson, or an house infected
with the Plague; and write, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us</hi>
on the one Door, as well as on the other. Others
make Satan their Cover, and cast their Sins upon his
Score. The Devil may sollicit us, but he cannot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate
us: He could not thrust the Apple by force
down <hi>Eves</hi> Throat, nor push Christ by violence down
from the Pinnacle: He hath a sleight of perswading,
not a power of compelling: He blows the Coals, but
the Fire is our own: He bites, but it is those which
thrust themselves into his Jaws: <hi>Resist the Devil, and
he will fly from you.</hi> Lastly, Some make GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the Cover for their Sins; of all Covers this is the
worst: So <hi>Adam, The Woman which THOU gavest
me.</hi> Such are they which make all things in the
World, even Sin it self, to come to pass fatally, inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
by virtue of a necessitating Decree of GOD.
Such are they which make their Redeemer their Pack-Horse
(be it spoken with Reverence) to bear their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103291:7"/>
Sins: as if he had shed his precious Blood
to purchase our Liberty, that we might turn Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines:
Deceive not your selves; to whom Christ is
made Redemption; to them he is made Righteousness
and Sanctification. This is the fourth Cover, the
Transferring of our Sins upon Others.</p>
            <p>The fifth Cover is Hypocrisie. This was <hi>Absalom</hi>'s
Cloak for his Rebellion: Such Covers were <hi>Cain's</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<hi>Esau</hi>'s Tears, <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s Fast, the Pharisees Alms,
the Harlots Vow, the Traytors Kiss. The World is
full of such Juglers and Mountebanks in Religion, of
all Sects, who cry, <hi>Great is Diana;</hi> and magnifie the
Image that fell down from <hi>Jupiter;</hi> meaning nothing
but their Profit: Who cry aloud, <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> and
mutter to themselves, <hi>Da mihi fallere, da jus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

to set these up in our Churches. Nothing is more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
unto God, than to make a stalking-Horse of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:

               </gap> woes against Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:

hardly, because he hath converted Conversion
it self into sin. <hi>Such as devour Widdows houses un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a colour of long prayers, shall receive the greater
damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sixth and last Cover is Impudence to defend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103291:7"/>
our Sins, and glory in them, which is used by none
but those who have already gotten one Foot within
the Gates of Hell. <hi>Periisse puto cui pudor periit:</hi> Past
Shame, past Grace. St. <hi>Austin</hi> bewails his Youth, led
in the Streets of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where when he heard his
Companions boasting of their lewdness, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to feign those things he never did, least he should
appear so much more vile, by how much he was more
innocent. That which was his Detestation, is now
the onely Garb for a Gallant: Such a Gallant was
<hi>Cham,</hi> that gloried in the Nakedness of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whilst his more modest Brethren covered it with
their Faces backward: Such another Gallant was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi>
who said, <hi>He liked nothing better in his own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
than his Impudence:</hi> A Voice fitter for a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
than an Emperour. It was the height of <hi>Israel</hi>'s
sin, That she had a Whores Forehead, and refused to
be ashamed: Shamefastness is the praise of Nature,
the Harbinger of Grace, the Ensign of Honesty, the
Seat of Virtue, the Witness of Innocencie. But
glorying in sin is the next Link to Damnation. They
that use such vain Covers as these, shall one day wish
for another cover, even the Mountains to fall upon
them, and the Hills to cover them from the presence
of the Lamb. So unprosperous is this course of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing:
That's the next part, <hi>Shall not prosper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, He shall not prosper in his sin; he shall not
finde that Happiness and Content in it which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.
<hi>Amon</hi> was sick of love until he enjoyed <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103291:8"/>
that moment passed, his Love was dogged with
Hatred and Repentance. What a deal of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
and hearts ease did <hi>Ahab</hi> promise to himself in
<hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard; and the very first time he goes to
take possession of it, he meets there with the Tidings
of the utter ruine of Himself and Family. <hi>Herod</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated
all Laws of God and Man, burthened his
Conscience, waded through a Sea of Blood, all to
settle the Kingdom upon his Son; and he proves an
Unthrift; offers half of it to a wanton Minion for a
Dance. So Goods ill gotten, are like a Coal of Fire
in a thatch'd House. Remember <hi>Herod.</hi> Before
<hi>Judas</hi> had fingered that beggerly sum of thirty pieces
of Silver, his Desires were upon the Rack; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his Duty to God, his Fidelity to his Master, his
care of his own soul. But when he once had it, he could
not indure to look upon it, as being the cause of his
bane; he casts it away as an infectious Rag; he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorgeth
it in the very Temple: his detestation of that
poysonous Morsel, was greater than his reverence to
that Holy Place. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
the fat, they were still no better favoured
themselves. Let us all but look back to our former
Excesses, and unlawful Pleasures, and see if we may
not sighing say with the Apostle, <hi>What profit had we
of those things whereof we are now ashamed?</hi> So he
shall not prosper in his sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He shall not prosper in his Affairs; not
in his temporal Undertakings, <hi>Jer. 22. 30. Write this
man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103291:8"/>
Israel</hi> could not prosper so long as the accursed thing
remained hidden in <hi>Achan</hi>'s Tent. The eleven Tribes
prospered not against <hi>Benjamin,</hi> until they had hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themselves by fasting. <hi>Jonas</hi> prospered not in a
Ship until he had reconcile himself to God; then he
found safety in the Belly of a Whale. Neither shall
he thrive or prosper in spiritual Graces: No Man can
serve both GOD and <hi>Belial:</hi> These hidden Sins do
choak the Seed of the Word; they hinder the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of our Prayers, they make the blessed Sacrament
to become poyson, and our Fasts and Humiliations,
to be meer Mockeries. The Grace of God will not
suffer Mates, to be chamber-fellows, and fellow-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
with her in the same Heart. To ask for which
of our sins things have succeeded unprosperously with
us, were to seek a man in <hi>Athens</hi> at noon day, with a
Candle and a Lanthorn. The Lord sanctifie our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
to us; until then, we cannot prosper in our

            <p>Thirdly, He shall not prosper in his concealment.
God will bring it to light, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 2. Thou didst it
secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  </gap>n:—For nothing is covered, which shall not be
revealed,</hi> Luk. 12. 2. Almost incredible are the ways
which God useth for the Discovery of crying Sins;
especially of Murther. Whilst the Earth is covered
with Snow, the Ditches, and Dunghills, and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
thereof are hid; but by the melting of the Snow
they are discovered: So the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lanous Projects of
Dissemblers are so covered over with a shew of Snow-white
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103291:9"/>
Innocence and Candor, that they are able like
<hi>Zeuxis</hi> his Counterfeit Grapes to deceive a piercing
Eye: But when time shall bring Truth to light, their
horrid ugliness will appear to the Eye of the World:
we may this day observe the footsteps of God's justice,
how he brings the same Troubles home to their Doors
who have been underhand the Contrivers and Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of them among their Neighbours: And now <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi>
begins to shake her bloody Whip among them,
as if God should say, Thou didst it secretly, but I will
do this thing before all <hi>Europe,</hi> and before the Sun.
<hi>Just art thou, O Lord, and right are thy judgements.</hi> So
he shall not prosper in his concealment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He shall not prosper in obtaining pardon
for his sin; and then all his other Advantages are too
much to his cost: <hi>What shall it profit a man to gain the
whole world, and lose his own Soul.</hi> A damned spirit in
Hell may as soon hope for forgiveness at the Hands of
God, as that person who hides and cherisheth his sins
privately in his Heart; this is to make God Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with us in our wickedness and dissimulation: 'Tis
in vain to skin over a sore, whilst dead flesh remains
within; the Weapon must first be pull'd out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wound can be cured: The Medicines of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
profit not a wounded Soul, until the firy darts
of Satan be drawn out by Repentance. So he shall
not prosper in his Recovery.</p>
            <p>Lastly, These Words, <hi>He Shall not prosper,</hi> are
a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and signifie as much as he shall suffer, he shall
smart for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:103291:9"/>
1. He shall suffer in his Conscience, those <hi>Coeca
vulnera,</hi> those blinde blows which no man knows
but he, which feels worse than all the Plagues of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and Botches of <hi>Job.</hi> This made <hi>Cain</hi> a Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
upon the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>2. The Judgements of God shall pursue him both
in this Life, and the Life to come. <hi>Herod</hi> did not
only not prosper in his aim, to entail the Crown to
his Posterity, but the day came that paid for all, such
a conglomeration of unmeasurable Torments, as they
are described by <hi>Josephus,</hi> did hardly ever meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one man, and which is worse, these
were but the fore-runners of greater: <hi>Judas</hi> did
not onely miss his contentment in the thirty pieces of
Silver, but he got thirty Curses; you may finde them
<hi>Psal.</hi> 109. The Money perished, but the Curses
stuck by him until they brought him to an halter.
Envie not a Murtherer that braves it upon the stage
for the first or second Act of a Tragedy, nor an Oxe,
that is fatting for the slaughter, nor a Thief that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in state to his Execution: Have patience and
expect the Catastrophe, <hi>Eccles. 8. Though a sinner doth
evil an hundred times, and the Lord still prolongeth his
days, yet I know it will be well with them that fear the
Lord; but it shall not be well with the wicked.</hi> Thus
every way he shall not prosper.</p>
            <p>And so I leave him lurking under a Net, <hi>treasuring
up to himself wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> to come
to the true Convert in the next Words.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103291:10"/>But he that confesseth and forsaketh them, shall have
mercie.</q>
            <p>Confession, with its Requisites, Contrition and
Amendment of Life, which is here called <hi>forsaking,</hi>
do make up a compleat Repentance. Which some
Fathers style a second Table after shipwrack, others a
Baptism of pains and tears: yea, some of them doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to say, That Confession did loose the bands of
sin, and extinguish the Fire of Hell; that is, not by
way of Merit, but by way of Impetration; not by
paying, but by pacifying the wrath of God, and so
averting his Judgements. No, those blessed Saints
did never dream that the Covenant of Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are admitted by Baptism, was evacuated
by a Lapse into sin; or that any new &amp; different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
was established by Repentance, grounded
partly upon the Merits of Christ, and partly upon
our selves. Let Confession and Repentance have
their due, but let them not thrust Christ out of the
Chair, from whose Grace they flow, from whose Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
they have their Efficacy. Thrice happy
are they which use this Plank aright, to bring them
through the raging Billows of this sinful world, to the
Haven of eternal Bliss.</p>
            <p>Confession is as ancient as our first Parents, whom
God himself did call to the performance of this duty.
It was practised among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> by Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<hi>Num.</hi> 5. 7. By those Jews that repaired to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103291:10"/>
of <hi>John,</hi> Matth. 3. By those Ephesian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
Acts 19. prescribed by St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 5.
<hi>Confess one to another, and pray one for another.</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with such ample privileges, as in the first
Epistle of St. <hi>John, If we confess our sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and just to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from
all unrighteousness.</hi> And here in my Text, <hi>He that
covereth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth
and forsaketh them, shall have mercy.</hi> There is no
better physick for a full stomach than a vomit; nor
for a soul replete with sin, than Confession. Bodily
sores do oftentimes compell a man to put off natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
shamefac'dness, and to expose his less honourable
parts to the view of the Chirurgion. Ought not
every one to be as solicitous for his soul? We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God three ways; by the imaginations of our
hearts; by the words of our mouths; by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of our lives. If we intend to please God,
we must take a clean contrary course; for evil
thoughts of the heart, bring contrition of the
heart; for corrupt speaches of the mouth, bring
Confession of the mouth; for wicked actions of
our life, bring fruits worthy amendment of life.
Buy this means we bring glory to God, and shame
to our selves; and prevent that great confusion of
face, which otherwise must fall upon us at the day
of Judgement, before God and Angels and Men.
A contrite sinner stands not upon terms of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with God, or with his Church. Why
should we be more affraid to confess, than we

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103291:12"/>
abstinence is not the true change of a Christian:
like a Dog that is muzzel'd, or a Thief that is mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled,
which still retain their former dispositions: <hi>When
the unclean spirit returns to his old habitation, and finds
it swept and garnished,</hi> not throughly, but superficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleansed by an outward Reformation, without an
inward Renovation, <hi>he brings with him seven other
spirits, and the latter end of that man is worse than the
beginning.</hi> He that absteins from an old sin not for
Conscience towards God, but for fear of shame or
punishment, is like that Wolf whereof the Father
speaks, which came unto the Sheepfold, to kill and to
devour, the Shepherd waking, the Dogs barking sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him away indeed, but altered not his wolvish na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Lupus venit fremens, Lupus redit tremens; Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
est &amp; fremens &amp; tremens.</hi> So forsakes them, not
forbears them.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Forsakes</hi> them, not conceals them: Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of Bodies, is a Monster in Philosophy: an
Heart inwardly replete with secret sins, hath no room
for Grace: A good Lesson, or a good Motion to it,
is like a Spark of Fire falling into a Vessel of Water,
presently extinguished; or like good Seed falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Thorns, soon choak'd. What fellowship
hath Light with Darkness, or CHRIST with <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In natural Transelementation, there must be some
affinity between the Bodies, as Fire and Air, not Fire
and Water; for the too great contrariety: but in
spiritual Conversion, no disparity can hinder the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103291:12"/>
change: The greatest sins do often produce the most
signal conversions, as it was in <hi>Saul,</hi> changed in the
height of his fury from a Persecutor to an Apostle,
from a Wolf to a Shepheard, from a Pyrat to a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>We cannot live as <hi>Amphibians</hi> in two such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Elements, as a resolved course of sin and of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
such half Converts, who have nothing but a
few idle yawning desires, can expect nothing at the
hands of God, but to be spewed out of his mouth
for their luke-warmness; the mouth of Hell is full of
such vain Wishes and Wishers, which use no serious
means to gain them liberty, but onely thrust their
heads out of the Grate, to look about them. A man
may break all the Commandments of God, and be
guilty of none, if it be against his resolution, if he be
heartily sorry for it: It is not so much Sin, as Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
for which men are damn'd: And on the other
side, he that breaks but one Commandment habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and resolvedly, is guilty of all. I fear this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Conditions, we rather cover our sins, or
forbear them, than forsake them; we desire rather to
make a Truce with God, than a Peace; We do with
our sins, as Servants do with their fires when they go
to Bed, put them not out, but rake them up; so when
we come to reckon with Conscience, and to make up
our Accompts with God, we do not desire to take an
everlasting farewell of our sins, <hi>ab hoc momento in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum,</hi>
as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, but onely a Coverfen, to
hide them in an heap of Devotions, for the present,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103291:13"/>
whilst we are doing some superficial Duties to God,
or whilst the blessed Sacrament doth strike a kind of
Reverence into our hearts, with a purpose to re-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
them upon the first opportunity; as the Serpent
doth her poyson, which she had left behinde her in
her Den. Can any man think that such a fained show
of forsaking our sins, can be acceptable to God? O
no! it is too hollow-hearted. That conversion which
findes mercy, must be serious and sincere: Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
and our forsaking, go still hand in hand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Forgive us our trespasses,</hi> there's the one; <hi>And
lead us not into temptation,</hi> there's the other: <hi>Turn thy
face from my sins,</hi> O <hi>Lord,</hi> there's the former; <hi>And make
me a clean heart,</hi> there's the latter: <hi>Lord have mercie
upon us,</hi> there's forgiveness; <hi>And incline our hearts to
keep thy Law,</hi> there's forsaking: That brings me to
the last Part, <hi>Shall have mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One might ask, Which of all gods Mercies? The
Air we breathe, the Light we behold, the Ground
we tread upon, the Meat we eat, whatsoever we are,
or have, or hope for, it is his mercie: <hi>By it we live,
and move, and have our being: Thou hast crowned me
with thy mercie,</hi> saith <hi>David:</hi> it is a Metaphor taken
from a Garland, which is composed of many and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Flowers. Gods mercie was the onely motive
to our Redemption; his merciful Grace preventing
us and assisting us, is the onely means to apply this
Redemption; the consideration of this mercie is that
which incourageth us to Repentance: As Christ
prayed <hi>Father forgive them;</hi> the poor Thief grew
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103291:13"/>
bold, <hi>Lord remember me.</hi> Mercie is the end of our
Repentance, that we may finde forgiveness: Mercie
is our supporter in all our sorrows for sin, that we roar
not out with <hi>Cain, My sin is greater than that it can be
forgiven;</hi> nor betake our selves desperately, with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
to an halter. Mercie is our onely plea, when we do
repent; we cannot say we have done such and such
good offices for the time past, we are too unprofitable
Servants, we dare not promise of our selves, to be
more serviceable for the time to come, we are too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultory
creatures: Lord forsake not us, least we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
Thee. Mercy is the object of our hopes, the
total sum of our desires; both Grace and Glory do
depend upon Mercy. So mercie is the beginning, the
middle, the end of our happiness.</p>
            <p>But St. <hi>John</hi> will tell us what mercy this is; <hi>If we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins:</hi> This Mercy then is forgiveness of sin. That
which is called <hi>Mercy</hi> here, is called <hi>Justice</hi> there: It
is Mercie to make a gracious Promise, bus it is Justice
to keep it. Without this Mercy of Forgiveness, all
the other Mercies of God are no Mercies, but Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
In this Mercy true blessedness doth consist,
<hi>Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven:</hi> what
confort can a person sure to be condemned have,
without hope of a pardon? The best musick in the
world, is, <hi>Son, thy sins are forgiven thee,</hi> when GOD
shall stretch forth the Golden Scepter of Mercy, that
is, to all those who for his love do mortisie their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
members, and forsake their own Lusts: <hi>For he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103291:14"/>
that hideth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth
and for saketh them, shall have mercie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now among all the means ordained by God for the
obtaining this saving mercy mentioned in my Text,
after Baptismal Grace, there is none more efficacious
than the blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of
Christ, the very conduit-Pipe of Grace to all worthy
Communicants, the Manna of Life and immortality,
the precious Antidote against the sting and infection
of the infernal Serpent, that inestimable Love-token
which Christ at his departure left to his Church, to
keep in remembrance of him; the true pool of <hi>Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
wherein we may be cured of all our infirmities. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of our selves is necessary before the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all holy Duties, but especially before the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament. We ought to repair to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this with as great care and anxiety, as if we
were immediately to depart out of the world. It was
death for an uncircumcised person to eat of the Paschal
Lamb; we must circumcise our eyes, our ears, our hands
and our hearts; and take heed how we come to this
Wedding Feast, without the Wedding Garment.</p>
            <p>O Lord, Be merciful to all those who prepare their
whole hearts to seek Thee, though they be not purged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Purification of the Sanctuary.</p>
