            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The prodigious Discomposures of our Times, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but occasion great thoughts of heart with all sober persons: and it were a most amazing Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, if we who might live together with so much mutual Comfort, should quarrel our selves into common Misery.</p>
            <p>These solemn Fasts may serve as sad Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers to shew us where we lost our way, that we wander so wretchedly no more.</p>

                  <p>The breath of our nostrils, the Anointed of the Lord was taken in their pits; of whom we said, Vnder his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</p>

            <p>OUR Sorrows should always bear some due proportion to the just magnitude of their causes. In most of the troubles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to humane life, a Sigh may suffice; <hi>We should weep as if we wept not</hi>; with a bridle of Restraint and Moderation, wisely laid upon our Affections. But some Calamities being of a far deeper nature, every good man may be allowed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them,<note place="margin">Isai. 22.4.</note> to say as the Prophet, <hi>Look away from me,</hi> for <hi>I will weep bitterly, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.</hi> Both Humanity and Piety oblige us to hang up our Harps, and to sit down as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons astonisht, whose grief is very great.</p>
            <p>The mourning of this day, 'tis upon divers accounts (as they said of the Patriarck <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Funeral) <hi>a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous mourning: England</hi>'s Sorrow, and <hi>England</hi>'s Shame.</p>
            <p>As to the Sanction of it, 'tis (like that of <hi>Nineve</hi>) by the <hi>decree of the King and his Nobles</hi>; blowing the Trumpet in <hi>Zion,</hi> proclaiming this Fast, calling these solemn Assemblies, that the Inhabitants of the whole Land might tremble.</p>
            <p>As to the grounds of it, 'tis an Humiliation for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61139:5"/>
barbarous shedding of Royal Blood, the inhumane par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide of the sacred Father of our Country: An offence so hainous in the just aggravations of it, that we might say as once <hi>Daniel</hi> in another case, <hi>Vnder the whole heavens hath not been done as hath been done here in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>We have risen up, the Feet against the Head, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants against the Lord of the Vineyard; rebelliously saying as those wretches in the Gospel, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> We have been open fighters against God and his Anointed; too far verifying that sad story,<note place="margin">

A specious Profession becomes villainously usurped, to patronize the most horrid actions.</p>
            <p>In this case we must not think hardly of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, if they deal by us as <hi>Moses</hi> by the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>; when they had in that popular tumultuous fit of impatience made that golden Calf,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 20.</note> 'tis said. <hi>He burnt it in the fire, he grownd it to powder, he strew'd it upon the water, and made the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>drink of it.</hi> And this he did upon great deliberation, <hi>ut majorem eis peccati nauseam induceret,</hi> that they might hereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more asham'd and sick of their sin.</p>
            <p>The like penance have our <hi>Moses's</hi> enjoyn'd us this day. These Anniversary Humiliations, they do (as it were) lay the Royal Body of our late slaughtered So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign bleeding afresh before us, accusing us as the Betrayers and Murderers of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61139:5"/>We read of God, he took a far greater notice of <hi>Abel</hi>'s murder than the Murderer himself was willing to do:<note place="margin">Gen. 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>The voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me</hi>; God hears what <hi>Cain</hi> (it seems) would not. Guilt is a sullen froward thing. I am sorry at the angry Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of many against these solemn Fasts, as if they were a needless Reproach continued upon the Land. I hope for our parts we shall rather from year to year (as becoming good Christians, and good Subjects) more ingenuously accept this punishment of our iniquity, acknowledge our sin, and renew the firmest Resolutions that we will offend no more.</p>
            <p>This whole Book is stil'd, <hi>A book of Lamentations.</hi> Our ancient Poets Tragedies seem but Comical Plays, compar'd with the unparallel'd mournfulness of this Scene: A weeping <hi>Jeremy,</hi> a person skilful in Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is chosen to be the Pen-man to these divine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, these pathetick Elegies. He proves the best O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator for God, that speaks from the very heart, that draws the life of his Eloquence from his own internal sense of what he delivers unto others.</p>
            <p>The Church and State, Prince and Priest, Throne and Altar, they are all brought in by the Prophet as cloth'd in mourning.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.10, 11.</note> If the <hi>Ark</hi> be taken in one verse, the same sad story tells us all <hi>Israel</hi> is smitten in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We may humourously attempt to divide; but in all History they live or die together.</p>
            <p>While the Prophet thus weeps over the Calamities of Gods <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem, Graviter gemitus imo de pectore ducens,</hi> he breaks forth into this of the Text, as a memorial of sorrow never to be forgotten by him, <hi>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the verse we have to consider, 1. The person spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, who it is the Prophet here means. 2. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity

into which he fell, <hi>he was taken in their pits.</hi> 3. The honorary Character here given him, <hi>the Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord.</hi> 4. The Jews concern in his weal or woe; <hi>he was the breath of their nostrils, under whose shadow they might have liv'd among the heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The person spoken of, who that should be. I answer, Not <hi>Josiah,</hi> (as some have conceiv'd;) he was already gathered to his fathers in peace, honourably interr'd amongst the royal Sepulchres of his Ancestors, his eyes clos'd with all due Funeral-rites, some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these tragick evils so fatally broke forth.

            <p>Such was the Person, no Plebeian; but one of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Extraction, of the true House and Linage of <hi>David</hi>; and now raised (though in a tempestuous conjuncture of Affairs) to sit on the Throne of his pious Father <hi>Josiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And has our Prophet such tears of Loyalty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to condole this Princes Fall? Certainly, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our eyes must not be dry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If <hi>Israels Zedekiah</hi> fell, 'twas not without great personal blemishes in himself.<note place="margin">2 King. 24.19.</note> 
               <hi>He did</hi> (says the Text) <hi>that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</hi> But our late Soveraign, a person of that stupendious exemplari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61139:6"/>
so amiable in whatever might become him as a <hi>Christian,</hi> in whatever might adorn him as a <hi>Prince,</hi> that his Piety became at last his Crime; his Love to Gods Church, the ground of his Hatred with the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He is ston'd for his good works: He is invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously aspers'd as affected to Popery; yet dies in the professed Communion of this Reformed Church: <hi>The Defender of it, a Martyr for it.</hi> He is odiously upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as designing Arbitrary ways of Empire and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; yet dies, because he could not in conscience give up those great things of Church and State, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Law, our true <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Body of our ancient English Government, to the tumultuous wills of violent and unreasonable men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Zedekiah</hi> fell, 'twas at <hi>Babylon,</hi> above six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles from his own Kingdom. The very place was no less than Exile, and the distance a most certain exposure to all inevitable dangers. But lo here (though under different circumstances) a far sadder story; Our Soveraign, after an Iliad of other prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding indignities, is murdered at his own Royal Gates, in the very face of his Court and Palace. He is first barbarously driven away by rude Tumults, after that forcibly brought back again by bloody Souldiers; full often (as himself so lively expresseth it) did he change <hi>his Keepers and Prison, but not his Captive condition</hi>: And at last the woful upshot proves, (as <hi>David</hi> said concerning <hi>Ishbosheth) Wicked men came upon this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous person, and slew him even in his own house</hi>; the walls and windows being the sad Spectators both of his Fall and our Treason.</p>

            <p>With civiliz'd Nations, the mildness of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is accounted security enough against the irruptions of Violence; where Government is receiv'd, the Laws yield Protection; where the sacred profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion takes place, we are still bound to a far better behaviour of the quietest peacefulness in our places: But alas, all these divine Bands were here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously broken asunder; and then of course, upon the violation of them, this execrable and horrible thing became committed in our Land.</p>
            <p>'Twas not an Enemy that did it; 'twould then have been more easily born: 'Twas the servant who had eat of his Masters bread, that here lift up his heel; 'twas the Subject who had solemnly sworn to bear true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Fealty, that now (<hi>Zimri</hi>-like) conspir'd and slew his Soveraign.

            <p n="4">4. If <hi>Zedekiah</hi> fell, yet we read not of any indecent measures used toward him in matters of Religion. When the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> had carried away <hi>Israel</hi> not long before captive, and had transplanted another people into the Holy Land, we finde he gave express order,<note place="margin">2 King. 17.27.</note> that a Priest from among the Captives should go and dwell at <hi>Bethel</hi> to teach and observe the stated Rites of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion formerly used amongst them.</p>

            <p n="2">II. Concerning the Calamity into which <hi>Zedekiah</hi> fell, 'tis said, <hi>he was taken in their pits</hi>; as the Bird into the Fowlers Snare, as the chased Deer into the Hunters Toil.

            <p>Several Transactions of Remark passed between <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> and our Prophet, during the Siege of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> (as we finde <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.) but the sad issue prov'd, <hi>Hostis habet muros,</hi> the rude Enemy at last entred into the Sanctuary; Gods Holy Temple was now defil'd, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> made an heap of Stones. The Prince himself taken and bound in Chains, carried Prisoner to <hi>Riblah</hi>: where his Children were first slain before his face, then his eyes most barbarously plucked out, and after that his royal person drag'd with all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of scorn as an abject Captive to <hi>Babylon.</hi> So true is that ancient Proverb, The tenderest Mercies of some men are little better than savage Cruelties.

Oh what sore and unexpected measures may even Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty it self meet with from the hands of cruel and blood-thirsty men!

            <p>The same God that has anointed his own Son as our Spiritual <hi>Messiahs</hi> for our eternal Salvation in Heaven, has likewise anointed Princes as our Civil <hi>Messiah</hi> for our temporal Preservation here on Earth.</p>
            <p>This divine Unction, 'twas aromatick and fragrant, rich and costly, significant and instructive; poured forth as a mysterious inauguration, in token of those Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Endowments, in testimony of that transcendent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty which God herewith convey'd.</p>
            <p>'Twas Armour of proof for Safety, a Robe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for Royalty: And there needed no more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak

            <p>'Twas this that swayed so far with <hi>David</hi> while <hi>Saul</hi> was yet alive:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.9.</note> 
               <hi>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lords anointed, and be guiltless?</hi> He speaks as in a holy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as one greatly mov'd at the hainousness of this bold Sollicitation. <hi>Nolo hanc mihi extorqueri obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi>: as if <hi>David</hi> had said, No, no; <hi>Abishai,</hi> thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest my friend, but art my foe: <hi>Get thee behinde me, Satan,</hi> I will never suffer my Loyalty to be thus wrested out of my hands: This fair advantage before me may serve to cleer my Innocence; but it shall never tempt me to Rebellion: <hi>Saul</hi> is the Lords Anointed to me, and I must be a true Liege-Subject to him.</p>
            <p>'Twas this that aggravated the case so highly when <hi>Saul</hi> was soon after slain.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>And David said to him</hi> (that is, to the young man, the <hi>Amalekite) How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lords Anointed? Saul</hi> had fairly spared the <hi>Amalekites</hi> to his own ruine. That very people whom he had so far shelter'd, contrary to Gods express command, even they can now afford the person that shall destroy him. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is wise, will consider it; prudent, and he will lay these weighty Memoires of Holy Scripture seriously to heart.</p>
            <p>The Jewish Writers tell us, this young man was the Son of <hi>Doeg,</hi> that cruel wretch who imbrued his hands in the blood of above fourscore Priests, the Ministers of the Lord that wore a linen Ephod, for no other fault than the innocent discharge of their sacred Function. The very Ministry, and the faithful Services of it, are crime enough in some mens eyes. <hi>Doeg</hi> himself (as divers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61139:9"/>
circumstances seem to imply) was at this time <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer; who seeing the issues of that fatal bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel on Mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> and foreseeing how little favour he could expect from <hi>David,</hi> whom he had so highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; in the depth of despair falls upon his own Sword. But before he thus dies with his Master, he calls his Son to him; he gives him <hi>Saul</hi>'s Crown and Bracelets, that by these Presents he might make his peace with <hi>David,</hi> when he himself was dead and gone.</p>
            <p>But now see, my Brethren! behold and see the wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of divine Vengeance; Lo the severe hand of a just God upon the bloody malicious Family. That terrible Prediction which had hung for some time as a drawn-sword over <hi>Doeg</hi> and his House, was now visibly fulfill'd: <hi>God shall destroy thee for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 52.5</note> 
               <hi>he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place, and root thee out of the land of the living.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.15.</note> God had spoken it, and God made it good: <hi>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go neer, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</hi> Let not man dare to wound, where God anoints.</p>

            <p>We all observe, there is nothing more immediately requisite to this natural life, than our breath.

            <p>When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had seen the unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Royalties, the Order and Administration of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Court, instead of carping with splenetick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, she breaks forth into Ejaculations of the highest joy and praise:<note place="margin">1 King. 10.9.</note>

            <p>The condition of the Jews (under our Text) was through their many provocations against God, brought now very low: that City which had been sometime Princess amongst the Provinces, was now tributary.

            <p>We have been recovered by these <hi>Jerubbaeals</hi> from the corruptions of Popery in our <hi>Church:</hi> They have gone (as our Saviour into the Temple) with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and zeal, casting out the abuses that had crept into Gods house.

            <p>'Tis the Glory of God, that he is able to bring good out of evil. 'Twill be at present our work from the remains of this Text, as far as we can, humbly to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God in so divine an Art, and to make tryal what good improvement we can likewise draw from so horrid, so great an evil; and that shall be twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To make our penitential Lamentation together, for what was this day done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To adjure one another to the utmost Allegiance, Loyalty, and Duty, as our preventives from relapsing into the like Villanies any more. All curious discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may now be very well spar'd; the plainest matter (if truely pertinent) will be to this sad occasion most proper.</p>
            <p>The first and fairest expression of our Piety, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to so unparallel'd a Murder, were plainly this: To bear a due sense of it, and to melt into a truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential sorrow for it. If <hi>David</hi>'s heart so deeply smote him because he had cut off the skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment, how severely then ought our hearts to smite us, who have cut off not the Garment but the person; our Soveraign himself from the land of the living?</p>
            <p>

And 'tis one very hard abodement upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this day, that we are so loth ingenuously to acknowledge our iniquity in this particular.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore, that I may the better promote that great humiliation which the day so earnestly calls for, lay before you these few aggravating considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The violence this day committed; 'twas a most high affront to that Signature of Sacredness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath invested the persons of Princes. He hath said (and certainly he hath not said it in vain) <hi>Ye are God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 82.6.</note> A kind of terrestrial Angels; Heavens <hi>Viceroys,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.23.</note> sitting (as was said of <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>upon the throne of the Lord.</hi> 'Twas <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Throne, and yet <hi>God's:</hi> 'Twas <hi>God</hi>'s Throne, and yet <hi>Solomon</hi>'s. 'Twas <hi>God</hi>'s in way of donation, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s in way of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And this in a true propriety of speech, <hi>Sic om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes throni Principum Dei throni dici possunt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lavator <hi>in locum.</hi>
               </note> Neither was this <hi>Solomon</hi>'s single prerogative. The Thrones of all other Kings, the Thrones of our Kings, they are no less than the Thrones of God; that we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look with the more aweful reverence upon them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, that man in his primitive condition had a bright mark set upon him, which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Pavor,</hi> at the sight whereof all inferiour Creatures stood in awe, and became subject to him: And this upon mans Apostacy, they say, became in a great measure lost. We may safely say this orient Signature 'tis fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visible upon the persons of Princes, that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might fear and tremble before them. Oh let not us by our Rebellions attempt to deface it.</p>
            <p>'Tis of some moment this way, what we finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61139:14"/>
concerning our own <hi>Realm.</hi> If a <hi>Villain</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by his <hi>mean Lord,</hi> could but come and prostrate himself <hi>ad sacra vestigia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plowden.</hi>
               </note> that is, at the Kings <hi>sacred feet,</hi> he was then esteem'd as one safe at Sanctuary, his Pursuer might now trouble him no further.</p>
            <p>And is the <hi>royal presence</hi> such an unquestionable <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylum</hi> to others? Oh then let Reason and Modesty judge how Sacred must the <hi>royal person</hi> it self be to the Consciences of all good men.</p>
            <p>From the deep sense of this Sacredness it is, that the Addresses of religious persons to Majesty, are usually tender'd in Holy Scripture with the utmost lowliness; <hi>As an Angel of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.17.</note> 
               <hi>so is my Lord the King.</hi> The Princes Sphere, 'tis an Angelical Sphere; and in our access to such, we stand before those who are already <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, as the Angels of God.</p>
            <p>Holy men of old were far from contriving the base Artifices how to expose Majesty as cheap in the eyes of the People.<note place="margin">Job 34.18.</note> They thought <hi>not fit to say to a King, Thou art wicked; or to Princes, Ye are ungodly</hi>: Their Language and Carriage savor'd of a far better Spirit. Whether their Affairs went smooth or rough, they were still at this good frame,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.29.</note> 
               <hi>My Lord the King is as an Angel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These impressions were then indelible when tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were most busie with <hi>David,</hi> and all outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances concurrent to have made him (if possible) a bad Kings-man; yet then, even then, he retains his Loyalty and Veneration for his Prince as high as ever. <hi>God forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lords Anointed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This Sacredness of the Soveraigns person was held inviolable in the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> where their express Doctrine was, that <hi>no creature may judge the King, this judgement 'tis left to the holy and blessed God alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61139:15"/>Thus hath God set bounds (as at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) that the people might not rudely break through, or rush with insolencies upon those whose persons he hath made sacred.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The violence this day committed, 'twas a most unnatural breach of that neer connexion wherein God hath knit Prince and People together. The welfare of the one, 'tis the welfare of the other; the distress of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the danger of both. This 'tis the plain language of the Text: He that runs may read it. <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Calamity 'tis all <hi>Israel</hi>'s Lamentation. Any evil befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, 'tis most deeply laid to heart by them.</p>
            <p>We have in the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> an aenigmatical passage of this nature:<note place="margin">Ezek. 19.14.</note> 
               <hi>Fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devour'd her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a scepter to rule: this is a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and shall be for a lamentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets phrase 'tis metaphorical. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and his Sons were now miserably destroy'd and slain; the other Branches of the Royal Family inhumanely cut off. The first part of this dismal Tragedy 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> at <hi>Riblah</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>: The second part wherein fire is said to have gone out of a rod of her Branches, and to have devour'd her fruit, so that she had no strong rod to be a Scepter to rule; this may (possibly) relate to <hi>Ishmael,</hi> mentioned in the 41 of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who being of the Seed-royal, might be not improperly called one of the Rods of those Branches. Sure we are, fire came out from him, and devoured <hi>Gedaliah</hi> and 70 other eminent persons, as that Chapter sadly attests; so that there seem'd now no strong Rod left to be a Scepter to rule.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Prophet so pathetically cries out, <hi>This is a Lamentation, and for a Lamentation.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> so the 70; it is, and it shall be a proverbial mourning,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61139:15"/>
a precedent, a leading case to future Ages. <hi>Ad suos usque nepotes:</hi> as if the Prophet had said, While time, lives, this sorrow will scarce die. 'Tis not, The King is taken away, the Government broken up, and what care we? no, no, the Church resents it with a far dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sympathy: the Funeral may be his, but the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must be ours; both ours, and our Childrens after, us. We must go down sorrowing to the Grave. <hi>The joy of our heart is ceased, the crown is fallen from our head.</hi> May this Piety in Subjects toward their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign live for ever.</p>
            <p>'Tis thus in the <hi>natural body:</hi> He that wounds the Head, endangers the whole man. 'Tis thus in the <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil body:</hi> The smiting of the Shepherd, 'tis the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the whole Flock. We have the brighter side of this Truth, fairly exemplified in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s case; where his Greatness and his Peoples Happiness,<note place="margin">1 King. 4.</note> his Grandeur and their Welfare, went hand in hand kissing and congratulating each other<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> he <hi>reigns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Israel</hi>;<note place="margin">Vers. 1, 21.</note> 
               <hi>and they brought presents and served So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon all the days of his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was <hi>Israel</hi> at all eclipsed by it.<note place="margin">Vers. 25.</note> 
               <hi>And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his Vine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Fig-tree, from Dan to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.</hi> Here needs be no envying: The Princes Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities, they are as <hi>Aaron</hi>'s rich Ointment, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently ran down to the skirts of his Garments; where the Head is thus honour'd, the whole Body shares, and of course rejoyces with it.</p>
            <p>The sadder, the darker side of the Cloud, we see that too fully verified in the unhappy <hi>interregnums</hi> under the Judges.<note place="margin">Judg. 17 6.</note> 
               <hi>In those days there was no King in Israel: but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> Right in their own eyes it might be, but wrong enough in the eyes of God and all good men. Gross Idolatry
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61139:16"/>
in Religion, the most odious Savageness in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Sequele attests. Such are the barbarous products of loose times.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Princes Soveraignty and the Subjects Safety, his Augustness &amp; their happiness (as those wings of the <hi>Cherubims</hi> over the mercy-seat ) they meet and embrace each other. What God has thus exemplarily put together, 'tis pity that man should attempt or dare to put asunder.</p>
            <p>The relative Titles which our ancient Laws with so much sageness use, may further confirm us in this point. <hi>Pater patriae, Medicus, Maritus regni:</hi> The Soveraign is the common Father of the Country: He the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, we the weak Patients; he the Husband, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom his Spouse, betroth'd to him with a solemn <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Ring.</hi> His absence makes us a Family of deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Orphans, an Hospital of languishing Patients, and the whole Kingdom a solitary helpless Widow expos'd to endless Oppressions. Such a Prince did we lose, and such were the Calamities that ensued upon it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, all specious perswasions were us'd to raise that wretched War against the King; nothing but gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Declarations set forth to reform Church and State, to remove evil Counsellors, to redress Grievances, and to secure Liberty and Property to the People. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justum sanctumque videri.</hi> So fair the pretence (it seems) must needs be. But alas, this Angel of Light soon vanished as a personated appearance, and the issue prov'd such, as we have but small joy to relate. A wilde Scepticism in Religion, an utter Subversion of Government, such excessive Taxes and Impositions, such fifth and twentieth parts, such Sequestrations and Decimations, such Views and Reviews, such plundring of Loyal Subjects and illegal sales of their Estates, such vast expence of Bloud and Treasure, as <hi>England</hi> till then had not known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61139:16"/>These sore pressures by degrees fill'd the whole Land with sighings, <hi>Vtinam viveret: Oh that the King were alive and upon his Throne again; for then was it better with us than it is now.</hi> Our sin became our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In the day that we rebelled against our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, in that day we laid violent hands upon our own Happiness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The violence this day committed, 'twas a most open Violation of all Laws both Divine and Humane; whatever may be the sinews of boisterous War, we are sure good Laws are the sinews of all civil Society and Peace; where they fall, we also fall with them: <hi>Plebs sine lege ruit.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>This was that distressed day wherein the beauty of <hi>Israel</hi> was slain amongst us. Ye Daughters of <hi>England,</hi> weep over your murdered <hi>Soveraign,</hi> who clothed you in Scarlet, and put upon you Ornaments of Gold; who crowned the Land with such Riches and Plenty.

            <p>And that the measures of Inhumanity might be full and running over, when it came to our <hi>Soveraign</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment, though divers noble Lords entreated the rights of Christian burial for their Royal Master,<note place="margin">

But we must draw the Curtain (as in <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s case) â€”<hi>Tanto par nulla figura dolori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must greatly blush, as persons who stand ashamed, yea even confounded, that ever so odious an evil was wrought amongst us. Were the several sad circumstances of it gathered together, &amp; laid in order before our eyes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61139:19"/>
we might say as once the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> in another case, <hi>There hath no such deed been done, nor seen, from the day that</hi> England <hi>became a Christian people to this day.</hi> Consider of it, become truly humble under it, and lastly watch with all unfeigned sollicitude against whatever might endanger our relapsing into it.</p>
            <p>Which leads to the second particular mentioned at first. There are divers things of unhappy tendency this way. Give me leave to enter some needful <hi>Caveats</hi> against them, and then I close.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first shall be against erratick disloyal opinions. The Head usually betrays the Heart, and debauches the Life. On the one hand, when Papists shall grow le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd with Jesuitical insinuations, that 'tis a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work to dispatch an excommunicated Prince, and that the Assassinate shall forthwith become a Saint; when Popes shall proudly tread upon the necks of Kings, and take upon them to absolve Subjects from their due Allegiance; when they shall exalt themselves above all that is called God, setting the Crozier above the Scepter: then 'ware Kings and Kingdoms, danger is not far off.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand, when a Fanatical Vertigo shall creep into the heads of others, that the Saints must by all means govern the world<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which Saints are they; the next work is commonly this, Let us kill the Heir, that the inheritance may be ours.</p>
            <p>The late Rebellions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> scarce yet quietly allayed, are too ready an instance of this nature. What influence the extravagant Opinions of some of their former great Kirk-men might give to such bad practices, I shall not here determine. Their Positions have been such as these: <hi>Kings and Governours have their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the People, and upon occasion the People may take it away again.</hi> So one of them, <hi>He that by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61139:19"/>
is cast into Hell, is not worthy to enjoy any life upon Earth.</hi> So another. And when a Party of this humour had taken a very odde way to make the King their own,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Spotswood</hi> History.</note> by a forcible detaining his person at <hi>Ruthuen,</hi> 1582. that they might thereby bring him to their own wills, though the action were Treason by the Law of Nature and Nations, adjudged by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of <hi>Scotland</hi> as <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis,</hi> and the insolence so deeply resented by the King himself,<note place="margin">K. <hi>James.</hi>
               </note> that he cried out he was a Captive, and desired all his good Subjects to procure his liberty; yet the Kirk-Assembly stands up to justifie it, and ordains all to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and subject to further civil punishment, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed not with them herein.</p>
            <p>There is a full, though joyless truth in the common Observation: <hi>Superstition</hi> (whether Popish or Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) <hi>where-ever it takes place, introduceth a new</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile, <hi>which commits a Rape upon the Spheres of the civil World, and puts all into utter Confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus delirous did we also grow in <hi>England</hi>; so far transported with these religious Frenzies, that after many lesser Skirmishes against the innocent Rites of the Church, men drew up at last into open Battalia against the State. The Walls became scal'd &amp; taken; any House of Lords was voted useless; a single Person (that is, the <hi>King</hi>) was voted needless; and the life of our Soveraign traiterously taken away by an infamous Conspiracy of men, pretendedly stil'd an High Court of Justice. Such was the Series; <hi>Wild Opinions led the Van, and open Rebellion brought up the Reer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may and must be a just Argument with us and our Posterity after us, to be sober-minded. There is a chastness, and there is a wantonness of spirit in things pertaining to Religion. The sober Christian chastly consists with the plain Soul-saving Truths of God. The
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61139:20"/>
wanton Professor is fond of every strange face he sees, As <hi>Sampson</hi> in his wandring Amours, none of the Daughters of <hi>Israel</hi> could please him; he must needs have a <hi>Dalilah</hi> from among the uncircumcis'd <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims:</hi> by which means both he and all <hi>Israel</hi> fell with him.</p>
            <p>The case 'tis too applicable to our selves. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Orders of a reformed Church, the mildest Laws of a well-constituted Kingdom, cannot (it seems) please many mens minds; they must needs have some other <hi>Dalilahs</hi> of their own: God forgive it. And I beseech you, my Brethren, hold fast a form of sound words, and labour to steer your whole Conversation by the Spirit of a sound mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A second Caveat I must as heartily enter, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst excentricalness of Carriage. We are almost as many Rulers as ruled: Rather Privy Counsellors, and chief Ministers of State, than ordinary Subjects: Great Agitators, exercising our selves in matters too high for us. This apparently endangers the whole.</p>
            <p>The Locusts mentioned in the Prophet, break not their Ranks, they thrust not one another, they march every one in his Path; but we, like some bad Husbands at home, spend most of our time abroad: mightily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about the Duties of others, but supinely negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in our own.</p>
            <p>These St. <hi>Peter</hi> couples with very coarse company: <hi>Let none of you suffer as a murderer,<note place="margin">1. Pet 4.15.</note> or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busie-body in other men; matters.</hi> The Apostle shakes them all together in the same bag: murderers, thieves, busie-bodies, and evil doers; as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of jayl birds, all of them selons and criminals against the divine Law.</p>
            <p>I shall not compare these sins one with the other, to extenuate here, or to aggravate there. The whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61139:20"/>
will rather say, God of his mercy keep every honest man from falling into any of them.</p>
            <p>'Twere certainly both modesty and prudence, for every man to wash his hands from that pragmaticalness with which this Age is so much defiled.</p>
            <p>Unless some evil Spirit troubles and haunts us, which God forbid, otherwise what hinders, but that we might (according to that Apostolical Counsel) <hi>study to be quiet, and to do our own business</hi>? taking that good advice, of learning every man his own Lesson:
<q>
                  <l>quem te Deus esse Jussit,<note place="margin">Persius.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l> &amp; humanae quÃ¢ parte locatus es in re.</l>
               </q>
When the eye, the hand, and the foot keep steady to
their own proper offices, then is the whole body most
happy and like it self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next thing we have as much cause to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is the instilling of strange false suggestions into the minds of others. Such impressions are easily made. In all History the people greedily receives them, but scarce ever parts with them.</p>
            <p>The evil Spies were very industrious this way: They buz'd such formidable stories up and down, that <hi>Israel</hi> concluded themselves quite undone;<note place="margin">Numb. 14.1.</note> 
               <hi>And all the Congregation lifted up their voice, and cryed; and the people wept that night.</hi> But pray was there any real cause for all these panick frights and fears? Surely no. <hi>Joshua</hi> tells them more comfortably,<note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is with us.</hi> And <hi>Caleb,</hi> to whom God himself gave this high testimony,<note place="margin">Numb. 13.30.</note> that <hi>he had followed God fully,</hi> 'tis said of him, that <hi>he stilled the people.</hi> He did a far better of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Gods account that quieted, than they who thus troubled the peoples minds. If evil surmisings be a fruit of the flesh, we may justly suspect amusing insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61139:21"/>
are the cursed root from whence they grow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Absalom</hi> had perfectly learned this knack of popular wheedling:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>And Absalom said, See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man deputed of the King to hear thee.</hi> Things (it seems) went very bad, and were likely to grow dayly worse: But is there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in such a dangerous conjuncture of affairs? If <hi>Absalom</hi> would but please to speak out, it may be he knows of some expedient that would relieve us; yes he does. And rather than we shall want it, he will be so kind as to expound his mystical Riddle, and tell us what it is.<note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> 
               <hi>And Absalom said, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause, might come to me, and I would do him justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A brave contrivance, well worth his good wishes to the peoples welfare! They must be courted (it seems) into their own ruine. Lord! what a religious cheat is here, to steal away the hearts of the People from their lawful Prince! Yet thus the Scene was laid, and thus a most unnatural Rebellion was soon after rais'd; only a just God brought it severely home upon the heads of the Rebels, the first raisers of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> (it seems) neglects them, <hi>Absalom</hi> is the onely man that takes care for them; 'tis but rising up briskly for <hi>Absalom,</hi> and all is well. Here's the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd Arrow that flieth by day, here's the devouring Pestilence that walketh in the darkness. God preserve us from it.</p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, let us not deceive our selves. False suggestions of this nature, they are as <hi>Brutus</hi> dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s heart; a secret stabbing of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But we are perswaded better things of <hi>England,</hi> and such as may become that gratitude which we all owe to God and our Soveraign, for that Peace and Plenty, that Liberty and Property, those many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61139:21"/>
both for Soul and Body, which we so freely enjoy under his Government.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth thing, as natural for us to take heed of as any of the former, is, a froward murmuring against those whom God hath set over us. This was the great sin of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness:<note place="margin">Exod. 16.2.</note> 
               <hi>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron.</hi> How hard is it to please some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!</p>
            <p>God had brought <hi>Israel</hi> safely out of their House of Bondage with an out-stretched arm; they were now travelling to the Land of Promise, feasted day by day with Angels Food, supplied from the Rock with streams of Living Water, which followed the Camp where-ever they went; directed by a Pillar of Light through their whole Journey; their Cloths still fresh (without any waxing old for forty years together) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their backs; yet they murmur. <hi>So querulous a creature is man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They murmured against <hi>Moses.</hi> Never had man deserved more highly of any people, than <hi>Moses</hi> of them. He had waved all the Honours of the Court and Crown of <hi>Egypt</hi> for their sakes; he had chosen to suffer the sharpest afflictions with them; he had manag'd their affairs with that happy conduct, that they were now brought fairly from the reach and power of their Oppressors; yet they murmur against him with that rage and bitterness, that he mournfully complains to God, He was even weary of his life, and knew not how to bear the burden of this wayward People. It becomes us to be truly faithful to the welfare of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but let no man ever expect that good services should be always duely resented by those for whom they are done.</p>
            <p>They murmur against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> against
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61139:22"/>
Church and State, highly discontented at the posture of things in both.<note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> But says <hi>Moses, What are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.</hi> Take heed, in Gods name take heed; murmurings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> murmurings against Church and State, may be murmurings against God himself.</p>
            <p>He that has said thou shalt not revile the Ruler of thy People, it may be will not take it well at our hands if we shall dare to despise Dominions, and speak evil of Dignities; as if depretiating of Majesty were grown some essential branch of the Subjects Liberty.</p>
            <p>'Twas, no doubt, upon weighty grounds, that the Parliament expressed their sense with so much freedom and plainness to our present <hi>Soveraign</hi> in this matter: <hi>The growth and increase of our late Troubles and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>We find <hi>Corah</hi> a very busie seditious Stickler this way: And because he saw he could effect but little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he draws in 250 Princes of the Assembly, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-men with the people, into his Party; and now both he and they thunder to purpose, Majesty becomes confronted to his very face.<note place="margin">Numb. 16.3.</note>

            </p>
            <p>You King <hi>Moses,</hi> and you Priest <hi>Aaron,</hi> you take
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61139:22"/>
too much upon you. They charge them as plain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders of the Peoples Rights, as persons that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in an arbitrary tyrannical way to set up themselves far above what they ought.</p>
            <p>But there was a still and secret Snake hid in the grass,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jos. ant.</hi> l. 4. c.</note> scarce yet discovered. <hi>Haec Cores videri volens reipublicae curam habere: hoc interim reverÃ¢ agens, ut concitato populo honorem invaderet.</hi> His words were softer than Oyl, yet were they drawn Swords; smooth Pretentions of a Publick Good, but the devillish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe at the bottom (says <hi>Josephus</hi>) 'twas this, how he might attack the Government, and usurp it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>God saw it, and God punisht it. <hi>The ground clave asunder that was under them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 16.31, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>The earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and all that appertained to Corah, and all their goods. And they went down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into the pit, and the earth closed upon them. And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them.</hi> Thus ended that wretched Mutiny; They pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht (says St. <hi>Jude</hi>) in the gainsaying of <hi>Corah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, there is no administration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon the face of the Earth, without many defects. From the Cottage to the Throne, we are all but men: 'Tis the peculiar glory of Heaven, that that place, and that alone, is free from all imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. However, the Mercies we enjoy under our Government, they are many, even to the envy of other Nations. And oh that we did but understand our own Happiness! it might fairly silence our Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and fill our lips with <hi>David</hi>'s praises, <hi>The lines are fallen to us in pleasant places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The last Caveat I shall need to adde, is this: Let us take heed that we with-hold not the due Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Government. A churlish <hi>Egyptian</hi> may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61139:23"/>
demand the full tale of Brick, and yet afford no Straw; but the true Christian, the loyal Subject, cheerfully <hi>renders tribute to whom tribute is due, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to whom custom:</hi> and ingenuously considers, That Government is scarce likely to protect us, that is not duely supported by us.</p>
            <p>'Twere but a low-priz'd kindness, demurely to say, <hi>Be thou warmed, be thou clothed.</hi> For our parts, we wish very well to the Government: But if after all these fair words, <hi>we give not those things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> God may justly ask us, as in that Scripture, <hi>What doth this profit?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.16.</note> All wise and good men know, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium sine vectigalibus retineri nullo modo potest:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero</note> If Government be essential for us, these Supports are as truly essential to that.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was anointed and inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated into his Kingdom, some still despised him, and brought him no presents; But says the Holy Ghost, They were <hi>the children of Belial.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.27.</note> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> indeed wisely overlook'd it, but they nevertheless offended very highly in it; <hi>They brought him no presents, but he held his peace.</hi> In raising the Tabernacle, in supplying the Crown, divine Wisdom thought not the Free-will-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the people any disparagement to either. Nor did God check or obliquely frown upon, but express a very kind acceptance of both. <hi>Moses</hi> with much honour records the one; <hi>And the children of Israel brought a willing offering to the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 35.29.</note> And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the books of <hi>Samuel</hi> makes as respectful men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.32.</note> 
               <hi>Now Barzillai</hi> (that worthy Patriot in his Country) <hi>provided the King of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim.</hi> And I hope in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God of his mercies will ever give a most endeared mutual good understanding between Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongst us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61139:23"/>I must conclude. This day was <hi>our royal Orpheus</hi> and his <hi>Harp,</hi> King and Kingdom, barbarously torn in pieces by furious <hi>Bacchides:</hi> A Theam beyond all expression bad.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sen.</hi> Epist.</note> We read of <hi>Cato, Hunc civitas diu ignoravit, nec intellexit nisi cum perdidit.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age understood not his worth: He was better priz'd, more feelingly lamented, when lost and gone. The like Reflections must we make upon this horrid action: We have rebelliously cut off a Prince of most incomparable Pieties and Vertues; invidiously traduc'd in life, but shining (as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Star) with greater bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness after his death.</p>
            <p>The Devil of Rebellion hath been at length driven out of the Land. He seemeth for present to walk up and down in dry places. God forbid that evil Spirit should ever return and find our hearts (as that house) garnisht and ready again to receive him.</p>
            <p>'Twere but a specious kind of Hypocrisie, to disclaim the execrable Enormities of the late times in words, and yet to abet Disloyalty afresh in our deeds; like those Jews that built fair Sepulchres for the former Prophets, but still went on to stone those that were for present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
            <p>There is one, and but one way before us, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to wash out so foul a stain, and that must be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and practically this: For the wretched Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities thus offered to such a Father, to take all faithful care that we repay a double Loyalty, the utmost Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Duty to the Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which God through his Grace enable us all to do.</hi>
