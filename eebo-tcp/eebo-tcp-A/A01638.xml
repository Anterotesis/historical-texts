            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

him unhappy in his death, who was most happy in his life? That I cannot: He that lived well, certainly could not but die well? Shall I call him unhappy, because he died in a strange Countrie? Nay rather happy in this, because he died for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Shall I call him unhappy in this, because he is taken from me? This were to love my self more then him, and to envie his happinesse. Or shall I grieve that I my self was not with him to take care for him for things necessarie in time of life, and for his funeralls after death? He wanted neither comfort in life, nor honourable buriall after death.

I will not then lament his death, who is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a better life: Neither will I weep for him, that is in joy: Nor put on mourning clothes for him that is clothed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. If it was any unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse for him to die, it is his

I wept for him when he was alive: and then he seemed to me to die when I left him on shipboard at <hi>Graves-end.</hi> The next news I heare, he lies buried at <hi>Custrin</hi> in <hi>Silesia.</hi> Whom sea and land and death hath parted, I hope blessed Eternitie shall at length bring together again. So I leave him and return to you. Sir, I hope you will pardon this <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi> or rather count it no <hi>digression</hi> at all, to speak of him whom I know you dearely loved. But I was speaking of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: for which still I finde a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie in the Sanctuarie. For my manner is, when troubles seize upon me, presently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire my self into my studie, and take in hand some book of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Concerning whom I may truely say thus much, If you make him your Counsellour and Companion, you shall never be without a walking Library: So full is he of Scripture Fathers and Schoolmen.

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3 At sundrie times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse manners God spake in time
<pb facs="tcp:3187:15"/>
past unto the fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. In these last dayes he hath spoken unto us by his Sonne,</hi> and his Apostles. <hi>Hebr. 1.1, 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> That <hi>word</hi> of God was first preached by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: and afterwards the chief and necessarie heads of divine revelation were penned by them, according to the will of God. <hi>Iren. lib. 3. cap. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> Therefore the undoubted <hi>word</hi> of God cannot at this day any where be found, but in the writings of the Prophets, and Apostles.</p>

               <hi>6</hi> From this <hi>word</hi> of God flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Theologie,</hi> and is busied about it, propounding unto us <hi>the oracles of God. Rom. 3.2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7</hi> Now <hi>Theologie</hi> is, as the name it self imports, <hi>A doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi>

               <hi>10</hi> The doctrine concerning the <hi>Essence of God,</hi> is absolved in this question, <hi>What God is:</hi> to wit, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova Elohim,</hi> One in <hi>Essence,</hi> three in <hi>Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">
               <hi>11</hi> For God hath so manifested himself; that in the divine <hi>Essence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one, and that undivided, there are three <hi>Persons,</hi> neither more nor lesse, to wit, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

            <p n="13">
               <hi>13 The Sonne</hi> is the <hi>second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> not made, nor created, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the <hi>Father</hi> from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>

               <hi>15</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is the <hi>third person,</hi> not made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> from all eternity.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <hi>16</hi> We must judge of the <hi>Will of God,</hi> by his decrees made from all eternitie.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <hi>17</hi> Whereof there are two more principall, The decree of <hi>Creation,</hi> and the decree of <hi>Reparation:</hi> or (as the Greek words signifie) <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Recreation; Formation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">
               <hi>18</hi> What those decrees were, the fulfilling of them in time doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <hi>19</hi> For what God doth, and in what manner he doth in time, the same thing, and in the same manner he decreed to do from all eternitie.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <hi>20</hi> The reason of which assertion depends upon the immutabilitie of Gods will.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <hi>21 Creation</hi> made in time, is the manifestation of the decree, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:3187:16"/>
the creation of all things, made from all eternitie.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <hi>22</hi> And it is the production of the Angels, Men, and all other creatures in the six first dayes of the world, wrought by God the <hi>Father,</hi> through the <hi>Sonne,</hi> in the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to his own glorie.</p>
            <p n="23">
               <hi>23</hi> A great part of the <hi>Angels</hi> fell away from God: The rest being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in goodnesse, do laud and praise God, and are ministring Spirits for the good of men.</p>
            <p n="24">
               <hi>24</hi> Our first parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> in like manner, at the instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Satan, transgressed the law of God, which was written in their hearts, and proclaimed by the mouth of God.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <hi>25</hi> So then by this fall of theirs the image of God was quite defaced in them, and their nature was corrupted with sinne.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <hi>26</hi> Whereupon their posterity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so were and are to this day born stark-naked of originall righteousnesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:3187:17"/>
in a miserable manner corrupted with sinne.</p>
            <p n="27">
               <hi>27</hi> Through the contagion whereof all the powers and faculties in the soul of man are so infected, that there is little or no light of Reason left, and scarce any power at all in the will, even about external things.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <hi>28</hi> God who is omniscient could not but know that our first parents would fall: and therefore of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercie, he made a decree, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reparation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man,</hi> from all eternity.</p>
            <p n="29">
               <hi>29</hi> What that decree was, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the same in like manner doth declare. He sent in time his Sonne to be our Redeemer and Mediatour: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he decreed to send him, from all eternitie.</p>
            <p n="30">
               <hi>30</hi> God by his word offereth the benefits of a Mediatour unto all, and applieth them unto those that beleeve: Therefore from all eternitie he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to offer them unto all by the
<pb facs="tcp:3187:17"/>
word, and to apply them unto those that beleeve.</p>
            <p n="31">
               <hi>31</hi> This decree, in Scripture is called <hi>Predestination:</hi> of which we must not judge but <hi>(à posteriori,</hi> that is) by the manifestation thereof.</p>
            <p n="32">
               <hi>32</hi> For the fulfilling of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, concerning the Reparation of man, God hath appointed the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments.</hi>

               <hi>35</hi> The <hi>Gospel</hi> is, the doctrine of faith: which pointeth at Christ our Mediatour, who hath made satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our sinnes, and raiseth up the conscience of man.</p>

               <hi>36</hi> The practise of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> consisteth in true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>

            <p n="5">5 The rest of the books of the Old Testament are called by S. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <hi>Apocrypha</hi>: because they were neither wrote by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor received by the <hi>Jews</hi> for <hi>Canonicall</hi>

and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13 But forasmuch as most of the ancients do not so much doubt of their <hi>Primarie authour,</hi> which is the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as of their <hi>Secundarie</hi> authours: therefore for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie I willingly suffer them to be equall with the Canonicall; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I contend with any man about this matter.</p>
            <p n="14">14 <hi>All Scripture is given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of God.</hi> 2. Tim. 3.16. And <hi>holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.21. Neither spake they onely, but they wrote also.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The same word of God which with a lively voice was preached, and preserved unwritten for a long time in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and likewise in the New Testament; but not so long: The same word, I say, was afterwards by the will of God written, and became Scripture. <hi>Iren. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3187:23"/>16 Therefore between the word of God preached, and the word written, we make no reall differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="17">17 For it is but an <hi>Accident</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of God, either to be preached, or to be written.</p>
            <p n="18">18 But although the Prophets and Apostles moved by the Holy Ghost have not wrote their whole sermons: yet they have made such a choice of what they wrote, that it is sufficient for the salvation of those that beleeve. <hi>August. tract.</hi> 49. <hi>in Joan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19 And therefore we say that the Holy Scripture is perfect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it all things necessarie for those that strive for the prize of eternall life which is set before them: both for the instructing of them in the faith; and the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in life.</p>
            <p n="20">20 That it is <hi>perfect,</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by evident testimonie. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3187:24"/>
3.16, and 17. where it is said that the Holy <hi>Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousnesse: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</hi> And therefore also <hi>the Holy Scriptures are able to make</hi> us <hi>wise unto salvation.</hi> 2. Tim. 3.15.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Seeing therefore that which is <hi>Profitable,</hi> in relation to <hi>Indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and want, is taken two wayes: either for that which of it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> excluding all want; or else, for that which is but <hi>In part</hi> profitable, and not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of it self without the help of something else: It is manifest that the Apostle here speaketh of that which is profitable taken in the first sense.</p>
            <p n="22">22 By those things which are written we may be taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on Christ. <hi>John</hi> 20.31. And, <hi>

2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. And the brethren of the rich glutton by hearing Moses and the Prophets in the Scriptures might have escaped the torments of Hell. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Whereupon it follows with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forcing, that the perfection of the Holy Scripture is such as we assigne unto it: For whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on Christ, and is furnished unto all good works, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of eternall life, what can he desire more?</p>
            <p n="24">24 This also is an Argument worthie our consideration, That the Apostle Saint Paul <hi>declared</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Ephesus <hi>all the counsel of God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (to wit, concerning our salvation) <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27. Again, the same Apostle <hi>said none other things then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come.</hi> Acts 26.22. Therefore in <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> is contained all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God concerning our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:3187:25"/>25 Now if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> (as indeed it is) Away then with <hi>Traditions,</hi> which some would thrust upon us to be received with like affection, and to be beleeved with like authoritie as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p n="26">26 For they are full of doubts, and sometimes also contradictions, being very apt to be corrupted, and many waies subject unto er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p n="27">27 The <hi>Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="28">28 Furthermore, seeing that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> was by God given unto men to this end, to instruct them unto salvation: from hence we conclude, that <hi>The Scripture is perspicuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3187:25"/>29 What? Could not God which made both minde &amp; tongue speak plainly and <hi>perspicuously?</hi> Yea certainly he used great care and providence that all men might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what he spake unto all men. <hi>Lactant. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Div. Institut. cap.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="30">30 Ought not that which is to instruct the rude and ignorant, and make them wise and learned, ought not that, I say, be <hi>perspicuous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="31">31 It is <hi>perspicuity</hi> which is fit to teach and instruct, not <hi>obscurity</hi> or <hi>perplexitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">32 Yet, when we say that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is <hi>perspicuous,</hi> we would not have it so understood, as if we meant, that whatsoever is contained any where in <hi>Scripture,</hi> were so easy and plain, that any man at the first sight may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.</p>
            <p n="33">33 But this is our meaning, that <hi>The perspicuity of Scripture is such,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3187:26"/>
that from thence a man may learn sure and infallible grounds and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion; the knowledge whereof is necessary unto every man, toward the attainment of everlasting salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="34">34 The books of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> are the integrall parts of Holy <hi>Scripture:</hi> And that both those are <hi>perspicuous,</hi> it is proved by good testimonies. If the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> then be <hi>perspicuous</hi>; how can the whole be said to be <hi>obscure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35 The <hi>Propheticall word</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is compared unto a <hi>Lamp, Light,</hi> or <hi>Lantern.</hi> Psalme 119.105. And, as much is said of the <hi>Apostolicall word.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.19. And again, <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.</hi> 2. Cor. 4.3. Whereby it appeareth, that if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be <hi>obscure,</hi> and hid, it is so onely <hi>by Accident:</hi> But <hi>of it self,</hi> and by its own nature it is <hi>perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.</hi>

            <p n="36">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:3187:26"/>36 Seeing therefore it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>perspicuous:</hi> It follows, that <hi>It is and ought to be the certain, infallible, and onely rule and judge of all controversies, that are moved about points of Christian religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37 What <hi>David</hi> saith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Psal. 19.4. <hi>Their line</hi> (or, <hi>their rule,</hi> or <hi>direction) is gone out through all the earth:</hi> the fame, <hi>Paul</hi> applies to the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Rom. 10.18. <hi>Their sound went into all the earth.</hi> But the Apostles wrote &amp; taught the same things.</p>
            <p n="38">38 <hi>Christ</hi> also and his <hi>Apostles</hi> for determining controversies of faith, appealed unto no other <hi>Judge,</hi> went by no other <hi>Rule</hi> but the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>; and they send us also to search the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> And what sheep will not follow Christ his <hi>Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Leader,</hi> and the Apostles his <hi>followers?</hi>

What hinders then, but that it may be unto us in this life a <hi>Perfect Rule?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="40">40 For if there be any part of celestiall doctrine not contained within the Canonicall books: How shall the judgement which shall be passed hereafter according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, be entire?</p>
            <p n="41">41 Furthermore, seeing that it is not onely permitted, but also commanded to all Christians to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> 1. John 4.1. to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of false prophets,</hi> Matth. 7.15. to <hi>prove all things,</hi> 1. Thess. 5.21. and thus it lies upon them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern between divine truth and humane dreams: certainly the rule of truth, that is, the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture belongeth unto all men. And therefore, <hi>The common people ought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3187:27"/>
not to be debarred the reading of the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42 What the Spirit of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth and commendeth, let not any man say, It is forbidden: But the Bereans are commended for this, that they examined <hi>Pauls</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Acts 17.11. <hi>The elect, strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</hi> 1.

And, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.16. the diligent study in the Scripture is commended to all Christians.</p>
            <p n="43">43 And seeing that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> &amp; <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, wherein the books of the Old and New Testament were written; and yet are bound to reade the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:</hi> Therefore their pains is to be commended, who have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> into the <hi>vulgar</hi> tongues.</p>
            <p n="44">44 But yet the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Old Testament, and the <hi>Greek</hi> in the New Testament, is <hi>Authenticall:</hi> because they were both written in those tongues.</p>
            <p n="45">45 Whatsoever floweth not from those fountains, hitherto hath not, cannot, neither must it be accounted <hi>Canonicall:</hi> seeing that it is not inspired by God.</p>
            <p n="46">46 Therefore that <hi>vulgar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> which may sooner be said then proved to be Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms,</hi> is without cause exalted to that high throne of authenticall authoritie.</p>
            <p n="47">47 For there are in it many faults both <hi>Graphicall, Ellipticall, Chronographicall,</hi> and <hi>Dogmaticall:</hi> faults in writing, in leaving out many things, in <hi>Chronographie,</hi> and in points of doctrine.</p>
            <p n="48">48 They have a corrupt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

that say that the Hebrew text is corrupted.</p>
            <p n="49">49 Neither do they love pure truth, who say that the fountains do not flow pure.</p>
            <p n="50">50 The <hi>end</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is attained by the true and lawfull <hi>interpretation</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p n="51">51 Seeing that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>perspicuous:</hi> therefore <hi>It is to be interpreted of it self, and by it self.</hi>

            <p n="52">52 For that which is perfect, ought not to be patched with things of another kinde: and that which is perspicuous of it self, doth not stand in need of anothers light.</p>
            <p n="53">53 Yet notwithstanding the Scripture is of it self perspicuous; the blinde eyes of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are dazled at the light of it.</p>

            <p n="67">67 Neither yet doe I commend the saying of that Greek <hi>Pelusiote,</hi> in the seventh Synod, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; That, <hi>A temple unles it were adorned with Statues, images and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures was nothing worth,</hi> and not to be regarded.</p>

            <p n="73">73 By the <hi>Vniversalitie</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> we understand, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospel belong unto all men.</p>
            <p n="74">74 But here we must distinguish between <hi>the Promise,</hi> and <hi>the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of the promise.

               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:3187:105"/>75 For the question is not here, Whether all men are actually made partakers of the benefits of the Gospell, which by the preaching thereof are offered unto all: for it is too manifest to be denied, That all men are not partakers of them.</p>
            <p n="76">76 But the question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Promises of the Gospell, of themselves, and in themselves are Universall, or else so restrained that by the counsell and decree of God they belong not but to some certain men absolutely chosen, by the good will and pleasure of God, before others.</p>
            <p n="77">77 For answer hereto we say, That God doth seriously desire the salvation of all; That Christ made full satisfaction for all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore That God doth by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell seriously offer the benefits of Christ unto all.</p>
            <p n="78">78 Christ commandeth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to <hi>go and preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell

            <p n="79">79 Whosoever therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth (that is, Whosoever by faith, which by the preaching of the Gospell the Holy Ghost work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all those that heare, and do not stubbornly resist) receiveth the benefits which are offered unto him, <hi>he shall be saved.</hi> Mark 16.16.</p>
            <p n="80">80 Therefore God offereth the <hi>Gospell</hi> unto all to this end, That by the hearing thereof, they may <hi>conceive Faith,</hi> whose <hi>Forerunner</hi> is <hi>Contrition,</hi> and whose <hi>Followers</hi> are <hi>Good works,</hi> which are the <hi>fruits</hi> of

            <p n="82">82 Concerning this <hi>Vniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> of <hi>Object,</hi> it is to be marked and observed, that it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Faith,</hi> but rather include it.</p>

by which we come to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the good promises.</p>
            <p n="86">86 The <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is, If thou shalt perform perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, thou shalt be saved: Here the <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>Aitiologicall,</hi> or <hi>Causaell:</hi> because perfect obedience is the cause for which eternall life is promised to those that keep the Law.</p>
            <p n="87">87 But the <hi>voice</hi> of the <hi>Gospell</hi> is, If thou doest beleeve, thou shalt be saved: Here the <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisticall,</hi> or <hi>Instrumentall:</hi> because the Gospell pronounceth that we are justified before God, and saved, not <hi>for</hi> Faith, but <hi>by</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p n="88">88 By the definition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell it is easy to be understood, whether, to speak properly, the Gospell be the preaching of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or no.</p>
            <p n="89">89 When the <hi>Gospell</hi> is taken <hi>generally</hi> for all the doctrine preached by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

It is most true, that the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell</hi> is the <hi>preaching</hi> of <hi>Repentance.</hi>

            <p n="90">90 Moreover, The Gospell doth onely declare the grace of God to those that repent, that is, to those that are humbled through the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of their sinnes, and the sense of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p n="91">91 And inasmuch as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that salvation is to be sought for onely in Christ, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth that without Christ all is concluded under sinne.</p>
            <p n="92">92 Besides, The Gospell doth demonstrate and expound unto us many places in the Law, which we cannot easily and evidently gather from the Law it self.</p>
            <p n="93">93 In this sense therefore and in these respects the Gospell may be said, and truely understood to be the preaching of Repentance: But yet we must know that the proper doctrine of the Gospell is about the free remission of our sinnes

through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="94">94 Thou wilt say perchance, <hi>Faith</hi> is by the <hi>Gospell:</hi> Therefore unbelief is reproved by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell: For the Law knew not Christ to be the Mediatour.</p>
            <p n="95">95 I answer: The <hi>Law</hi> bids us beleeve all the word of God.

            <p n="96">96 The <hi>Law</hi> reproveth all sins: therefore also unbelief: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell declareth by the <hi>Antithesis</hi> thereof, that not to beleeve on Christ the Mediatour is a sinne and the head of all sinne: as <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> teacheth. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>loc. pag.</hi> 570.

            <p n="63">63 But this it is which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That either these new motions are habituall righteousnesse of force before God; or that these good works are actuall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, on which we may rely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods judgement.</p>

            <p n="72">72 For <hi>Faith without works is said to be dead,</hi> not as if works were the life thereof; but because that

            <p n="2">2 For even as a man by <hi>Carnall Generation,</hi> is made partaker of <hi>Naturall Life,</hi> after which do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Naturall motions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 So he that is borne againe of the Holy Spirit by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is made partaker of <hi>Life Spirituall,</hi> after which doe also follow <hi>motions Spirituall.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5 This inward <hi>Renovation</hi> is oftentimes denoted unto us by the name of <hi>Good Works,</hi> and that by a figure which is called <hi>Synecdoche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 For <hi>Renovation</hi> consists not onely in <hi>Outward good Works,</hi> and <hi>actions transient,</hi> but also (and that more principally) in the <hi>Inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi> of the mind, will, and all the faculties of the Soule.</p>
            <p n="7">7 From this <hi>Inward renewing</hi> flow forth <hi>Good actions:</hi> and <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good Works</hi> beare witnesse of it.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But it pleased the Holy Ghost by the name of <hi>Good Works</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <hi>Renovation,</hi> and that for our sakes: <hi>Because Outward good Works are better knowne unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward qualities of the minde, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 Moreover, <hi>All the praise of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3187:131"/>
consisteth in action:</hi> Therefore we are renewed by the Holy Ghost within, that the fruits of the Spirit may appeare without.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And last of all, <hi>By this meanes deceitfull Hypocrisie is excluded,</hi> which is a counterfeit shew of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pietie: which indeed is none at all, unles it be also demonstrated by good Works.</p>
            <p n="11">11 As therefore <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> hath <hi>Contrition</hi> for her <hi>Vsher</hi> or <hi>Forerunner,</hi> so she also hath <hi>Good Works</hi> for her <hi>waiting Maids</hi> or <hi>Followers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12 For <hi>Good Works</hi> do not goe before <hi>Justification,</hi> or before a man be <hi>justified</hi>; but they follow after <hi>Justification,</hi> or when a man is <hi>justified.</hi> It is the saying of <hi>S.

               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:3187:136"/>14 Neither is it any hard matter to assigne the cause of this neare Union, and indissoluble knot, which is between true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15 For this is the Nature of <hi>True Faith,</hi> That it doth demonstrate it selfe by love and charitie.</p>
            <p n="16">16 He that beleeveth is borne of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.13. He will therefore resemble the nature of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Father. Now <hi>God is Love.</hi> 1 Ioh. 4.8. And, <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17 <hi>Faith is an inward, saving, and efficacious knowledge of God:</hi> How then can that chiefe good choose but be beloved, if it be once truely knowne? <hi>If any man love mee, he will keepe my words.</hi> Ioh. 14.23. <hi>He that hath my commandments</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>and keepeth them, he it is that loveth mee.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="18">18 From hence the Apostle concludeth: <hi>Hereby we do know that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3187:136"/>
we know him, if we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.3. And again, <hi>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a Liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="19">19 <hi>Faith is the spirituall Light of the Soule:</hi> But, if there be <hi>Light within,</hi> it will shew forth the <hi>Rayes without.</hi> Matth. 5.16. <hi>Let your Light so shine before men, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="23">23 <hi>Our hearts are purified by Faith.</hi> Act. 15.9.

For, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</hi> Matth. 12.14.</p>
            <p n="24">24 These things were thus plainly to be expounded, That we might not onely be freed from the <hi>Tridentine</hi> accusation, as if we prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched onely Confidence and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance remote from all pietie; but also that all vain opinion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of Faith might be taken away from all sinners that live in securitie.</p>
            <p n="25">25 We may make answer to them out of S. James, 2.26. <hi>As the Body without the Spirit,</hi> (that is,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3187:137"/>
without breathing) <hi>is dead: So Faith without works is dead also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26 Neither onely doe <hi>Good Works</hi> proceed from <hi>Faith</hi>; but, to speak the truth, there are no good works unles they proceed from Faith.</p>
            <p n="27">27 Seeing therefore <hi>Faith</hi> hath respect unto the <hi>Word</hi> as unto its <hi>Correlate:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Law</hi> of God, or the ten commandments are the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">28 Therefore superstition and will-worship pleaseth not God but those works onely which are done according to the Canon and; rule of the morall Law comprehended and contained in the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p n="29">29 And we are to understand the Commandments, according to the exposition of the Prophets, of Christ, and his Apostles.</p>
            <p n="30">30 Moreover, seeing that <hi>Faith</hi> doth not arise from any naturall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3187:138"/>
power of free-will, but is the Gift of the Holy Ghost: Therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom what we said, that works must proceed from <hi>Faith,</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre further that there are no works good indeed done by men, except they be regenerate by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p n="31">31 For men <hi>by nature are dead in sinnes.</hi> Ephes. 2.5. Coloss. 2.13.</p>
            <p n="32">32 As therefore those which are not yet regenerate have no spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life: So also they haue no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall works pleasing God.</p>
            <p n="33">33 Rightly therefore disputeth S. Augustine, and with much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: <hi>Those works,</hi> which seeme to be good, if they be <hi>without Faith,</hi> they are no better then <hi>Sinnes,</hi> or, at best, but <hi>shining sinnes.</hi> Lib. 3. <hi>ad Bonifac. cap.</hi> 5. as also in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
            <p n="34">34 <hi>Anselme</hi> disputeth thus, That all the life of infidels and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers is sinne: because without
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3187:138"/>
the chief good nothing is good. <hi>Vpon the</hi> 14 <hi>Chapter to the Romanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35 Which opinion of his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hold to be cruell, they themselves are cruell against the truth, <hi>Cens. Colon.</hi> pag. 29.</p>
            <p n="36">36 <hi>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> Matth. 7.18. So neither can a person not reconciled unto God be accepted of him, neither can his works please him.</p>
            <p n="37">37 From this Conclusion, That it is necessarie that those works which are truely good proceed from <hi>Faith,</hi> we might gather many other things. For from thence it followes, That <hi>Good Works,</hi> although they reach not to that high pitch of perfection, which is prescribed in the Law, yet they are <hi>pleasing unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38 Christ apprehended by true Faith, makes a man and his works done in Faith acceptable before God.</p>
            <p n="39">
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:3187:139"/>39 And thus is that to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, which is said in our Churches, That Faith is the form of Good works.</p>
            <p n="40">40 For this is not our meaning, That Christs satisfaction is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our works, that for those works of ours we are justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p n="41">41 For seeing that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves stand in need of justification (as I may so speak) certainly they cannot justifie us.</p>
            <p n="42">42 But this we say, That those good works are therefore &amp; from thence acceptable and pleasing unto God, because the person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by Christ worketh good works through Faith.</p>
            <p n="43">43 The <hi>Good Works</hi> of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate do <hi>please</hi> God, but they do not <hi>appease</hi> God.</p>
            <p n="44">44 To conclude: Because Good Works proceed from Faith, we are not therefore by them and for
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3187:139"/>
them justified before God.</p>
            <p n="45">45 For what we have already obtained by <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ, what need have we to seek for by <hi>Good works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">46 When the question there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is moved, <hi>Whether we be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Good works, and so merit sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> Let us diligently examine the <hi>Terms,</hi> and words of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="47">47 <hi>Good works</hi> are the <hi>works</hi> of those that are already <hi>justified:</hi> Therefore they are <hi>not works</hi> (if I may so speak) <hi>Justifying.</hi> Even as fruits are good: because they are the fruits of a good tree; but do not yet make the tree good.</p>
            <p n="48">48 I know the common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: It is by way of distinction, between the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="49">49 But beside other things, even this one thing doth take away quite that distinction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3187:140"/>
the Apostle denyes that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the very midst of his Good Works was justified before God by his Works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. If any where, then certainly in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that Second Justification by Works (if there were any such) should have found place.</p>
            <p n="50">50 Moreover all places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which deny that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Works, overthrow that difference.</p>
            <p n="51">51 Our <hi>Good Works</hi> are due <hi>Debts</hi> unto God: <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we merit nothing by them.</p>
            <p n="52">52 Our <hi>Good Works</hi> are <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and unclean, forasmuchas our Renovation it self is not altogether absolute and perfect in this life: How then can we by them merit eternall life? What are all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to so great glory? <hi>Bern. serm.</hi> 1. <hi>in Annun. Col.</hi> 106.</p>
            <p n="53">53 <hi>Good works</hi> are the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> leading and drawing the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3187:140"/>
regenerate, and working effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them: Therefore man is so farre from meriting by them any thing at Gods hands, that he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indebted to God for them. <hi>Bern. ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54 If <hi>Good works</hi> could merit eternall life, then they ought and might be done to that end and with that intent, that thereby we might obtain the reward of eternall life: But works done with such intent are not truely good works.

doth repeate the words of institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, saying first over the Lords Prayer: we must not in any case thinke that it is a meer Historicall reading of the Text.</p>

            <p n="35">35 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He doth earnestly pray, that Christ would be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his promise, and vouchsafe

to be present at the Sacramentall action, and distribute both his Body and Bloud together with the externall Elements, or the Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p n="36">36 <hi>Last of all,</hi> He doth testifie that by vertue of the Lords insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and promise, the <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi>; and the <hi>Cup</hi> of Blessing, the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> and further doth admonish all those that intend to receive the Sacrament, to remember that they are Christs Guests, to rely on his words with true Faith, &amp; to come with due preparation, that so they may receive it unto their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p n="55">55 This <hi>eating</hi> is neither meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall, nor meerly spirituall, but <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> depending on the Sacramentall union of the bread and body of Christ.</p>

               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:3187:176"/>
and <hi>drinking</hi> depends on the institution of Christ, who is true and omnipotent; but it cannot be comprehended by humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, neither must it curiously be searched into.</p>
            <p n="57">57 If then thou opposest the <hi>spirituall</hi> eating, to the <hi>naturall, carnall, physicall, locall,</hi> and <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiticall:</hi> then rightly do we say, that the eating of the body of Christ with the bread is spirituall.</p>
            <p n="58">58 But if by spirituall eating thou understandest that whereof John speaketh in the sixt chapter: That appertaineth to the fruit of the supper, and therefore undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly not to the essence thereof.</p>
            <p n="59">59 <hi>The end</hi> of the <hi>Holy Supper</hi> is set down in these words of Christ, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.24.</p>

            <p n="61">61 From whence it appeareth, that the primarie and principall end of the Holy Supper is, the confirming of our faith.</p>
            <p n="62">62 Which comprehendeth in it these fruits, That in the true and saving use of the Holy Supper the promise of the forgivenesse of sinnes is sealed unto us; That the grace received in Baptisme is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in us; That the covenant of friendship and reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man is renewed in us; That we are again ingrafted into Christ; and, That we are fed with incorruptible food, by faith, unto everlasting life.</p>

            <p n="3">3 For the <hi>Church</hi> is an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or company of men gathered together unto the kingdome of God by the ministery of the Word &amp; the Sacraments: amongst whom there are alwaies some true godly which persevere in the true faith even unto the end: with whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

            <p n="5">5 And because the ministerie of preaching the Word, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Sacraments is obvious to our senses, it is also called the <hi>Visible Church.</hi>

            <p n="7">7 Therefore that distinction of the Church into <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> doth not introduce two as it were distinct Churches, or divers companies:</p>

Even as, saith he, little children do distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish a man from a beast, by the externall lineaments of body, and outward figure of a man; because they are led onely by their sense: And those which are of riper yeares and have the use of reason, but yet are rude and unlearned, do it by operations of life &amp; functions which are onely proper to a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to speak like a man, to walk like a man, &amp;c.

and in this sense, the Church is said to be more pure, or more impure, comparing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="36">36 So Christ would have the Scribes and Pharisees to be heard, <hi>Sitting in Moses Chaire.</hi> Matt. 23.2. that is, delivering the Doctrine which <hi>Moses</hi> delivered (according to the interpretation of <hi>Biel.</hi> 4. <hi>Sent.

            <p n="39">39 So the Popish Church is not a true and pure Church: But yet in former ages under Poperie did God gather, and even at this day still doth gather unto himself a Church.</p>

            <p n="42">42 Let them therefore either convince us, out of the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, to have departed from the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles: or let them not deny unto us the name of <hi>Catholike</hi> and <hi>Apostolike Church.</hi>

            <p n="45">45 And againe, we have another saying out of <hi>S. Augustine (De uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Eccl.

            <p n="46">46 And further we urge upon them that <hi>Exclusive</hi> particle of Saint <hi>Chrysostome (Hom.</hi> 49. <hi>oper. imperf. in Matth.</hi>) They which would know which is the true Church of Christ, can know by no other means but <hi>Onely</hi> by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="47">47 The word of God, which this day is not extant but in the writings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, is the seed, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, as it were, the soul of the Church: If the Church depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the tract thereof, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth into errour, and that so much the more grievous, by how much the more remote and distant from the sinceritie of the word.</p>

            <p n="6">6 <hi>Vocation</hi> is certainly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church, and that such as is lawfull.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For, <hi>How shall they preach, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be sent?</hi> Rom. 10.15.</p>

            <p n="9">9 Now <hi>God calls</hi> the <hi>Ministers</hi> of his Church both <hi>Immediately,</hi> and <hi>Mediately.</hi>

            <p n="13">13 The <hi>Immediate</hi> vocation or calling is alwayes accompanied with some extraordinarie Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Gifts of God.</p>
            <p n="14">14 But yet by Testimonies and Gifts we would not have miracles to be understood.</p>

            <p n="46">46 Now the reason, why the Apostle maketh mention of these common vertues, is: Because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of life is required of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters

not onely for the same causes for which they are required of other private Christians; but also in a peculiar name: That their ministerie be not calumniated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and ill spoken of, and so the fructification of the word be hindred.</p>
            <p n="47">47 The Apostle requires that a <hi>Bishop</hi> be <hi>the husband of one wife,</hi> to stop the mouthes of Heretikes, which speak against their marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: shewing thereby that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is no impure thing, but so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, that it is no hindrance to a man from ascending up unto the Bishops chair. <hi>Chrysost. in cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Tit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="48">48 Therefore the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Order,</hi> or the <hi>Clergie</hi> are not by Gods law forbidden marriage.</p>
            <p n="49">49 For the temperance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie which the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in a Bishop (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.8.) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved to be understood of

            <p n="50">50 Neither doth the Apostle hereby hinder those from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, who after they have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one wife, have lawfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried another.</p>
            <p n="51">51 But he forbids those to be chosen unto the Ministerie, who in any sort sinne so against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="54">54 The <hi>Proper</hi> and peculiar <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> which the Apostle requires of the Ministers of the Church are these, That they must be <hi>apt to teach.</hi> 1.

            <p n="3">3 But, because this gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Church, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of the divine Image is wrought in this life: Therefore God hath instituted and ordained the <hi>Politicall Order</hi> or the <hi>Civill Magistracie,</hi> to be as it were an <hi>Hedge</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi>

out of mankinde. Mankinde being miserably corrupted since the fall cannot possible consist without civill government. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it necessarie for the Churches sake, that the <hi>Politicall Order,</hi> or <hi>Civill Magistracie</hi> should be instituted and appointed.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The parts of the <hi>Politicall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> are two: The <hi>Magistrates</hi> and the <hi>Subjects.</hi>

            <p n="7">7 The <hi>Magistrates</hi> rule; The <hi>Subjects</hi> obey.</p>

            <p n="14">14 Examples of <hi>Immediate</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we have in <hi>Moses, David,</hi> &amp;c. For God by his own voice called them <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> unto the rule and governing of his people.</p>
            <p n="15">15 <hi>Mediate calling</hi> is especially two waies, either by <hi>Hereditarie succession,</hi> or by <hi>Mens election:</hi> Unto these two waies of calling may all other be referred.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="17">17 For whereas <hi>Peter</hi> calleth them <hi>the Ordinance of man.</hi> 1. Epist. 2.13. he doth it not therefore, as if they were onely an humane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: but because they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by men, because they are men, and because they are made and appointed for the good of men, and common benefit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Magistrate</hi> is seen or considered, either in <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Warre.</hi>

            <p n="21">
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:3187:201"/>21 For it is the <hi>Magistrates</hi> charge and care, to see that both the Tables of the commandments be kept and observed, as farre as it concernes <hi>Externall Discipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22 He may and must hinder false and blasphemous opinions from being spread abroad: He may and must punish those which are seducers of Soules, especially such as are seditious: He may and must hinder the profanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
            <p n="23">23 But yet he must not take upon him authoritie and power over the Consciences of men, whereof God onely is King.</p>
            <p n="24">24 Therefore neither must the Magistrate compell the Subjects to any false religion, neither must the Subjects obey, if he goes about to compell them.</p>
            <p n="25">25 Unto the <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> there belongeth also the power of making <hi>Civill Lawes,</hi> to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3187:201"/>
be the determination of the Law of nature.</p>
            <p n="26">26 For <hi>Christian Commonwealths</hi> are <hi>not</hi> simply tyed and <hi>bound</hi> to the <hi>Judiciall Lawes</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="27">27 Unto the same also belong <hi>Contracts,</hi> which are to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by <hi>Charitie</hi> &amp; <hi>Equitie:</hi> From whence it is easily gathered, what we may determine in the question, about <hi>Vsurie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">28 The Scripture simply for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth <hi>Vsurie:</hi> But what be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> of <hi>Vsurie,</hi> that we must learne from the end of the Law, which is Charitie; and from the description of the Prohibition, as also from the incorrupt judgement of the prudent.</p>
            <p n="29">29 By the name of <hi>Judgement</hi> forementioned, we understand the defending of the good, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of those which do that which is evill. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.</p>
            <p n="30">30 To which end and purpose
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3187:202"/>
were judiciall Lawes invented, for the hearing &amp; judging both <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Criminall</hi> causes.</p>
            <p n="31">31 Therefore a Christian man is not forbidden to go to Law, so he do it in a lawfull manner.</p>
            <p n="32">32 The <hi>Punishment</hi> which the Magistrate inflicteth upon the transgressours of the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and the troublers of humane societie, must be <hi>Correspondent</hi> to the <hi>Fault</hi> committed.</p>
            <p n="33">33 For it is not free for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate at his pleasure, to let de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents and offenders, especially such as are in any enormous crime, escape and go unpunished.</p>
            <p n="34">34 Yet sometimes <hi>Equitie</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> of the rigour of the Law is to be used: but still with a respect unto the <hi>Delinquent</hi> or <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,</hi> and the <hi>Offence</hi> it self.</p>
            <p n="35">35 As <hi>Extreme rigour</hi> of the Law is sometimes, <hi>Extreme injuries:</hi> So likewise <hi>Extreme indulgence</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:3187:202"/>
and remissenesse doth <hi>Dull</hi> the <hi>Edge</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the power and authoritie of the Magistrate.</p>
            <p n="36">36 Here a question is moved about <hi>Heresie, Theft,</hi> and <hi>Adulterie,</hi> Whether the <hi>Punishment</hi> thereof ought to be <hi>Capitall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37 Whosoever doth maintaine an Heresie <hi>Privately,</hi> or else doth spread it abroad but <hi>not seditiously:</hi> we deny that such a one is to be put to death.</p>
            <p n="38">38 Other wayes of sowing, and spreading abroad heresies, we leave unto the Magistrate to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</p>
            <p n="39">39 To say that the punishment of simple <hi>Theft</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially if it be but of a light and petty matter, ought to be <hi>Capitall:</hi> that's very hard.</p>
            <p n="40">40 Yet we do not mislike that the rigour of the Law should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon such as are common
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:3187:203"/>
robbers, breakers into houses, and such as have often escaped for stealing, and yet steal againe.</p>
            <p n="41">41 The Law of God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged <hi>Adulterie</hi> to be punished with death.</p>
            <p n="42">42 In the time of <hi>Warre</hi> let the <hi>Magistrate</hi> be mindfull of his office and duty, that he wages <hi>Warre lawfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="43">43 For neither is the <hi>Magistrate</hi> forbidden to <hi>Denounce Warre,</hi> nor the <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>take up armes:</hi> If the <hi>Warre</hi> be <hi>Lawfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="44">44 The <hi>Conditions</hi> of a <hi>Lawfull Warre</hi> are these, That it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <hi>upon Authoritie</hi> of superious, <hi>upon a good Cause,</hi> and <hi>with a good Intention.</hi> Thom. 2.2. q. 40.</p>
            <p n="45">45 Warre is not warre but rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, if it be undertaken without lawfull <hi>Authoritie</hi> of him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it.</p>
            <p n="46">46 The <hi>Just causes of warre</hi> are <hi>Three,</hi> Either <hi>Just defence,</hi> or <hi>Just

Punishment,</hi> or <hi>Recovering</hi> what is unjustly taken away.</p>
            <p n="47">47 There must also be added an <hi>Intention</hi> of a fit and convenient end.

and <hi>not in the countrie of their friends and allyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">50 For it can never be hoped, that those souldiers should be prosperous in warlike enterprises, and feats of armes, which at their departure carry away with them curses and teares for their <hi>Viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> to feed upon by the way. <hi>Gregor. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Histor. cap.</hi> 12.</p>

            <p n="52">52 But yet it behooves a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> to try all courses before he goes to warre: For he may not do it, but when the extreme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the commonwealth calls for it.
