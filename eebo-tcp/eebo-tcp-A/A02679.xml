            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in which ſpace as well Priests, as
people have expected a redreſſe of ſo
great wrongs. But ſince ſo long a time hath not wrought
that effect which was dayly looked for, we thought it full

ſo prejudiciall a ſilence, and better late, then never, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
unto the world, as well the inſufficiency of that
ſentence, as the innocency of the cenſured, and if it bee
poſsible to undeceive ſuch as are poſſeſſed of the contrary.
Our delay in this affaire (I confeſse) hath bred us this
Inconvenience. That the contrary opinion being ſo long
ſucked in, hath ſo ſeaſoned the Potts, as hardly now will
they ſmell of any other liquor. Three ſorts of Readers (and

was onely communicated unto Catholickes. I ſay,
in this alſo they are alike. For as a matter made

the Canon Law, as the grounds of
my following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The firſt Principle is, That the
Cenſure of Excommunication
grounded upon an intollerable
error, is both injuſt and invalide, and ſo, obligeing to
no obedience, neither <hi>in for o fori,</hi> or <hi>in foro poli,</hi> as much

II. The ſecond Principle is, That no Excommunication
juſt &amp; valid can be fulminated but for a mortall ſinne,
the ſame manifeſted, &amp; afore-hand forbidden under
paine of Excommunication, &amp; ſo alwayes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed

their Biſhop or Ordinary, then Canonicall. That is,
ſuch as the Lawes of holy Church preſcribe, and
which they promiſe in their Conſecration. <hi>vid. Ep.</hi>

unto his anſwer, &amp; convicted of what he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> it containes an intollerable error.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Minor</hi> of this Syllogiſme; namely, That the
precedent Cenſure was publiſhed without cauſe or reaſon,
I thus declare. The cauſe of the Cenſure layde downe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the Tenor thereof, is the inſolencie and obſtinate
diſobedience of the two aforenamed Prieſts, &amp; that without
hope of amendment, to the great diſedification of his flock.</p>
               <p>To which it is anſwered by the aforeſaid venerable Prieſts
in this their Apology or defence. That this cauſe was never
proved againſt them, &amp; therefore is no cauſe at all, by that
rule of the law, <hi>Cauſa non probam, non eſt cauſa,</hi> A cauſe not
proved, is no cauſe. 24. <hi>q. 3. de Illicita.</hi> and is manifeſt by the
light of reaſon. For they alledge that to this day they have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17421:9"/>
never bin accuſed, much leſſe convicted of any ſuch diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
or obſtinacy. Nay they ſay further, That as yet they
never were cited before their Ordinary, to anſwer any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of diſobedience in all their lives whatſoever. Now then
forſomuuch as the Canon it ſelfe tells us, <hi>Quod publicum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium
eſt inſtitutum, ut innocentia protegatur, &amp; culpa puniatur</hi>
2. <hi>q.</hi> 1. That publique Iudgments are therefore ordained, that
Innocencie may be protected, &amp; faults puniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. And our
wiſe Law-givers obſerving, that this end and ſcope of the
law could not otherwiſe be attained, but by citing &amp; calling
to their anſwer, the parties ſuppoſed to be delinqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them to their defence. Therefore was it ordained
by the Canons &amp; lawes of holy Church, that even in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary

of theſe two maine pillars of all legall &amp; juridical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
being neglected; namely, Citation &amp; Conviction,
as is above proved in the fourth Principle. And that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of both, or either of theſe two eſſentiall parts of all
lawfull proceſſe all ſentence &amp; publication of ſentence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
is to be held <hi>ipſo fact,</hi> voyde, &amp; ſo Invalid in law, as
no appellation from ſuch ſentence ſhall be neceſſary to any

&amp; mortality, is juſt &amp; valid, although it expreſſe no

Citty from infection in time of peſtilence. Yet ſay I, in caſe
there were no danger of infection, for that there is no fame
or report of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iagues abroad, it were no valid ſentence,
for want of intimation and expreſſion of a cauſe. And this
happens ſo often, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch things are pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hibited under cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which of themſelves are not unlawfull, but by ſome
accident, or circumſtance. And in this all agree.</p>
               <p>Now the afore-named Prieſts doe alledge in this their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17421:10"/>
Apology, That there is no cauſe at all layde downe in the
ſentence of the aforeſaid Excommunication, nor yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
manifeſt: for which want &amp; defect, they doubt not to
avouch it Invalid.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid unto the <hi>Minor</hi> of this Syllogiſme,
That there is a cauſe expreſſed &amp; nominated, yea and very
much inſiſted upon in the Cenſure, to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

to the great ſcandall and diſaedification of many
Catholiques, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwere, That Diſobedience is an univerſall
cauſe, &amp; hath many branches, ſpreading it ſelf farre &amp; wide
thorough the whole life of man. For example, there is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
unto God, and that in as great variety as there
be ſins &amp; offences againſt the firſt &amp; ſecond Table. There is
diſobedience unto the lawes of holy Church. There is diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
unto the lawes &amp; edicts of Princes, to Prelates, to
inferiour Magiſtrates, to Parents, to Tutors, to Maſters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
to Pedagogues, &amp; to all lawfull Superiours, &amp; that in
an Ocean of matter &amp; circumſtances. Now then forſomuch
as neither vice nor vertue can be exerciſed but in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
particular &amp; individuall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntioned, no cauſe of the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
is expreſſed, &amp; no cauſe, no cenſure. For it is a
ſaying as true as common, That <hi>qui ambulat in univerſalibus,
intendit decipere;</hi> He that walketh in univerſalities and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities,
deſires to deceive.</p>
               <p>You know in your Civill &amp; Temporall Courts, If a man
be to be puniſhed either corporally, or by the purſe, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
fault is ſet before his eyes, yea and made manifeſt to
ſo many as pleaſe to take knowledge thereof. Is <hi>Titius</hi> an
offender? Is he a wicked man? This is not ſufficient to
doome him to puniſhment: And why ſo? becauſe there bee
many kindes of offences, many ſorts of wickedneſſe. Is <hi>Titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
a theefe, &amp; hath ſtolne? Neither is that ſufficient to cauſe
his puniſhment: And why? becauſe there be many ſorts of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17421:10"/>
ſtealths &amp; theeveries. But hath <hi>Titius</hi> ſtolne a piece of plate
of ſo mauy ounces; an horſe, or a cow of ſuch a valew, from
ſuch a man, ſuch a time, &amp; in ſuch a manner: O when <hi>Titius</hi>
is brought unto his tryall in open Court, &amp; is convicted of
his particular act &amp; crime, either by his owne confeſſion, or
proofe of witneſſe, then is <hi>Titius</hi> ſubject to the ſentence,
and to the execution thereof.</p>
               <p>Even ſo ſay I, diſobedience is a vice <hi>in univerſali,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as not committable, ſo not puniſhable but in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Act. For they that know any thing, know this: that
ſinnes cannot be committed neither in <hi>Genere,</hi> nor in <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
but <hi>in Individuo per Iudividuum.</hi> But heere in the cenſure
of the Archbiſhop, it is neither declared againſt whom, or in
what matter this diſobedience was, or of what nature, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lout
it is. The puniſhment is declared to be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the cauſe of it hangs in the cloudes of univerſality:
and whether it will prove hayle, raine, or ſnow, no man
knowes but by divination.</p>
               <p>Now let any indifferent man judge, whether it be not a
moſt illegall, &amp; an exorbitant courſe of proceeding, for a
man to know his puniſhment, &amp; not his offence; to feele the
one, before he be convicted of the other? And ſuch is the
caſe of theſe R. Prieſts, who from time to time have deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
urged, &amp; required with all duty &amp; due reſpect of their
Archbiſhop, as alſo of his Councell of Friars: What this
their diſobedience was, againſt whom it was committed, in
what matter it conſiſted of, what nature it was of? And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
anſwered, but <hi>ſic volo, fit jubeo:</hi> or as ſometimes it
pleaſeth him to ſay: That he doth theſe things for cauſes
and reaſons onely knowne unto himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But if it were lawfull for <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iob,</hi> to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with God Almighty: let me alſo with due reſpect aske
of you my <hi>L.</hi> Archbiſhop, whether this be not to open a

and impiety: I ſay, my Lord, to puniſh your ſubjects
for cauſes &amp; reaſons only knowne unto your ſelfe. For in ſo

doing, you ſeeme to erect a new tribunall, &amp; to bring in ſuch
a forme of judgment among us, as the world hath not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Act. 25. It ſeemes unto me a thing unreaſonable, to

thinke you, a farre more unreaſonable thing to thruſt the
people into the ſpirituall bondes and fetters of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and not to ſignifie the cauſe thereof? And I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that our great Maſters in Iſrael, and you onely great
Couucellours of warre againſt the poore Clergy; my <hi>Lord,</hi>
I meane our Friars who profeſſe ſo great Schollerſhip,
would not adviſe your Hon: (who happily by reaſon of your
other imployments, cannot ſo well attend unto the ſtudy
of the Canons) what puniſhment that Biſhop incurres, who
excommunicates before the cauſe thereof be proved. See
then for this, the Councell of Paris, with <hi>Gratian 24. q. 3. De
Illicita.</hi> And I will for the eaſe of my Reader ſet downe the
words. <hi>De illicita excommunicatione lex Iuſtiniani Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
Catholici, &amp;c.</hi> As touching unlawfull Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the law of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Catholicke Emperour (which
law the Catholicke Church doth approve and obſerve) in
his 123. Conſtitution, <hi>cap.</hi> 351. hath decreed that no Biſhop
or Prelate excommunicate any perſon before the cauſe bee
proved, for which the Canons of the Church command this
to be done, and for his unjuſt attempt he ſhall ſo long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from the ſacred Communion as ſhall ſeeme good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Superiour. So that Councell. And it appeares by the

Excom. Sacro.</hi> So S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great abſolved the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

of <hi>Millan.</hi> See S. <hi>Gregory lib. 2. Epiſt.</hi> 26. And the
ſame Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> did puniſh <hi>Iohn</hi> a Biſhop, for inflicting
of unjuſt Excommunications. See for this the place above
cited, <hi>de illicita Excom.</hi> And let them conſider of this who
teach, that our Biſhops cannot erre in their cenſures. That
they muſt be obeyed in right and wrong, &amp;c. But I ſhall have
occaſion to ſpeake of that point hereafter.</p>
               <p>Forſomuch then as you ſee the Law tells us, that no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
can either be inflicted or incurred, before
the cauſe thereof be proved. Let me humbly intereat your
Hon: my very good Lord, for I ſuppoſe that you are neither
too old to learne, nor my ſelfe too yong to teach: Nor doe I
doubt, albeit I be inferiour to you in place and dignity in
Gods Church, that it will either miſbecome my profeſſion,
as being a Prieſt, nor my white haires, as now being <hi>Paulus
ſenex,</hi> even <hi>Paul</hi> an old man, to preach unto you. That as
well for the ſecurity of your owne conſcience towardes
God, as to avoyde the ſcandall and obloquy of the world,
as alſo puniſhment from the higher powers. That hereafter
you will either make the cauſe of your Cenſures as well
knowne and approved unto the world, as you doe your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
or elſe the puniſhments as private unto your
ſelfe as the cauſes thereof. And ſo hoping your Hon. will
take the premiſſes into your conſideration, I will deſcend
unto the next point; which ſhal be to ſatiſfie ſome doubts, &amp;
to anſwer to certaine objections which may be made in the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt then it may be ſaid in defence and excuſe of
the Ordinary: That the times are ſuch, as our
Prelats in this kingdome cannot obſerve any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
or canonicall proceſſe or courſe of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with their ſubjects, and therefore are conſtrayned to
proceed as they may. And that albeit they neither call the
Defendant unto his anſwere, nor admit of any proofe of
cauſe by witneſſe againſt them, they are to be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
<hi>Neceſſitas non habet legem,</hi> Neceſſity knowes no law, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which firſt I anſwere, That if the Catholicke Prelats
either have way by permiſſion of the ſtate, or take unto
themſelves ſo much boldneſſe, as to publiſh their ſentences
of Excommunication in their Chappels and Oratories after
Maſſe, as well by ſuch Pariſh Prieſts, as are placed in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
and ſuburbes, as alſo by the Friars of ſo many Orders.
Than ſay I, How can they be excuſed in the pretermiſſion
of ilegall proceeding in that former part of Iuſtice, going
before ſentence. Namely calling the parties unto their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
examination of their cauſes, admitting of proofe <hi>pro
&amp; contra.</hi> For ſo much as all this may be performed with
much more privacy then the publication of ſentence can
be. The Cano is of holy Church requiring no greater a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                  </gap>e five or ſixe perſons at the moſt. That
Prelate then who can be ſo bold as to command his ſentence
of Excommunication to be publiſhed in the hearing of ſo
many hundreds, yea of thouſands, as my Lord Archbiſhop
<hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> alias <hi>Barnwell</hi> hathdone, yea and from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17421:13"/>
time to time 1. publiſhed the ſame ſentence, leſt it ſhould
grow ſtale, and out of requeſt How can he in reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any feare of perſecution in granting a legall courſe of
proceeding, in which the preſence of ſo few (as hath beene
ſaid) is neceſſary. And therefore to doe the one, and to omit
the other, is but to ſleight Iuſtice, and to oppreſſe the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
And ſo much for the firſt anſwer.</p>
               <p>My ſecond anſwer is, That in caſe the times be ſuch, &amp; the
perſecution ſo great, as that thoſe eſſentiall parts of all legall
proceeding muſt of neceſſity be pretermitted, (I meane
Convention of the parties, &amp; Conviction by due proofe:)
I ſay then with that common Maxime of the law, Better an
Inconvenience, then a Miſchiefe; &amp; in ſuch caſe all ſentence
of puniſhment, publication, and execution doth likewiſe
ceaſe, and the guilty is rather to paſſe unpuniſhed in this
world, then the very <hi>ſyſtema</hi> of all Tribunalls to be ruinated,
&amp; Iuſtice depoſed from her Throne; for then it ſeemes to be
a caſe of a common calamity &amp; an inevitable neceſſity, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſilence unto all lawes, &amp; better the Nocent be ſpared,
then the Innocent puniſhed.</p>
               <p>But ſee, &amp; note (gentle Reader) what uſe of the times, &amp;
what an excellent advantage the Ordinary makes unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to compaſſe his own ends (I ſay, by fiſhing in theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
waters.) For whereas in France, Spaine, Italy, and thoſe
Countreyes where the ſpirituall ſword hath his free ſtroke
in all Tribunalls (ſupported &amp; maintained ſo often as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
with the ayde &amp; aſſiſtance of the ſecular arme,) yet
all forme of due Iuſtice is punctually obſerved. <hi>Id enim poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus,
quod juſtè poſſumus;</hi> for that only can we doe (ſaith
the Law) which we may juſtly doe. But here in this Dioceſe,
all muſt be preſumed for the Ordinary, becauſe we live in a
mixt people, neere unto the State &amp; Magiſtrate of an other
profeſſion in Religion from us, no juridicall proceeding
muſt be held neceſſary, but that our Eccleſiaſticall Iudge may
lay about him at his pleaſure, in his cenſures &amp; puniſhments
of his ſubjects, without calling the parties before him to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17421:14"/>
their anſwer, without examination of their cauſe, without
conviction, &amp;c. So as what an Ordinary could not do where
the Church is eſtabliſhed, &amp; in his full ſtrength and vigour
againſt the pooreſt Prieſt of his Dioceſe here, under pretence
of a perſecution, and obſtacle of a free courſe of Iuſtice, he
ſhall moſt eaſily effect (I ſay) under the name &amp; cloake of
perſecution, more freely himſelf to perſecute, as at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
&amp; for ſome yeares paſt, the Clergy of this Dioceſſe hath
both ſeene &amp; felt, having endured a more bitter perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from this their Biſhop &amp; his Friars, then from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Magiſtrate, though divided from them in matter of
Religion.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto a ſecond advantage alſo, that this Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Dublin makes of theſe times by a ſeeming and a
pleaſing correſpondency which he keepes (as he imagins
himſelfe) with the State. For he being a Friar, &amp; ſeeking by
all meanes to ſuppreſſe the Clergy, and to bring all into the
hands of the Regulars, I meane the Monks &amp; Friars, as well
Franciſcans, Capuchins, Dominicans, Auguſtines, Carmelits,
&amp; Ieſuits, (For ſcarce are there ſo many Prieſts of the Clergy
left in all this Citty, as there be Orders of Regulars therein
at this day.) And knowing that they of a contrary profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can well endure that Prieſts either in their perſons, or in
their maintenance &amp; lively hood ſhould be ſtraitned &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.
And knowing alſo that it will not diſcontent the
Proteſtane Magiſtrate to have the people forbidden to heare
the Maſſes of Prieſts. He upon theſe preſumptions, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Counce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l of his Fryars, who are of more ſtrength
in this Citty then men would imagine) is animated to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
ſuch deſignes as of late he hath undertaken, knowing
that the lower the ballance of the Clergy deſcends, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are the Fryars advanced, &amp; by driving of the people from
the Clergy, the more of neceſſity muſt they &amp; wild they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Friars. But this wiſedome (doubtleſſe) is not
ſpirituall, but carnall; not from above, but earthly; ſavouring
not of the Holy Ghoſt, but of ambition, of temporal means,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17421:14"/>
and of the belly. And ſo being a Councell, not of God, will
come to nothing, though for a time (by never ſo ſtrong a
faction) ſupported.</p>
               <p>A ſecond defence of the Archbiſhops proceedings, is
this, &amp; which by our Friars is much put on foot, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the common people: That the Biſhop is to be obeyed
in all things, yea in right &amp; wrong, as ſome teach: And ſhall
the foot judge the head? the ſubject the Magiſtrat? the ſheep
the Prelate? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the firſt part of this popular argument ſo much inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
upon, I anſwer, that if it be ſpoken merrily, it may paſſe
for a jeſt; but if ſeriouſly, it is flat hereſie; namely, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Biſhop in right and wrong is to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond part, which thorough the perſwaſion of
the Friars, is in every old wifes mouth; &amp; the ſecond word
of every Artiſan &amp; Tradeſman, That the ſheep are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
or queſtion the ſentence of their Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate: the ſubject
of the Magiſtrate. I anſwer, that albeit indeed the Inferiour
can not reverſe or correct the judgment of his Superiour, &amp;
much leſſe may he puniſh him for the ſame (becauſe he hath
no juriſdiction or power over him.) Yet by the Friars good
leave, the Inferiour may examine, may queſtion &amp; diſcuſſe
the judgment &amp; ſentence of his Superiour, both in his own
&amp; other mens caſes: yea &amp; if the Inferiour, or Subject, doe
finde either by his owne learning, or by help of ſuch as are
ſeen in the knowledge &amp; profeſſion of the Lawes, that a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat
Prelat, ſuch as be all Archbiſhops &amp; Biſhops (who
are as equally ſubject to the Canons, as the pooreſt Prieſt)
have not proceeded according to the lawes of holy Church,
the Conſtitutions of the See Apoſtolick, the Decrees of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councels, the ſacred Canons received, &amp; of force in all
Tribunals, but that ſuch Iudges, whether Archbiſhops or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have gone aſtray, contrary to the rules preſcribed by
the above-mentioned Legiſlatours, all which are their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
in juriſdiction, &amp; as farre above them in power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as the common people are inferiour unto their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17421:15"/>
Prelats &amp; Paſtours. It is plaine, that in ſuch caſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prieſt nor People, is bound either in law or conſcience
to obey any ſuch Archbiſhop, or Biſhop, or their ſentence,
not grounded &amp; founded on that law, according to which
they preciſely were bound to judge. For ſaith <hi>B. Aug. Ser. 6.

That the Biſhop is to be obeyed in right and wrong, &amp; that

               <p>Againe, What is the cauſe, why that libelling Friar of S.

himſelfe being but a ſeditious Friar, and I trow none of the

               <p>And to come neerer home: How came it to paſſe? That in
Droghedah ſome ten yeares agoe, certaine of the Ieſuites
being excommunicated, &amp; that by name by <hi>Iames Plonket,</hi>
then <hi>Conſervator Iuris</hi> for the Franciſcans: And certaine of

but both ſtood ſtiffely in defence of their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
exclayming againſt, and condemning each other in

And laſtly to come home, &amp; unto our owne doores: What
ſay you gentle Friars unto this late example, &amp; now in the
mouth of every one, as well Proteſtant, as Catholicke, I ſay,
of our Archbiſhop of Dublin, <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> aliàs <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
Friar of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> who ſtands at this day
excommunicated, yea <hi>Excommunicatus nominatim, &amp; denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatus,</hi>
Excommunicated by name, &amp; denounced; &amp; the ſame
by a Papall Excommunication, legally, &amp; for moſt juſt cauſes

of the Iujuſtice or Invalidity thereof, remaines obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
diſobediant, unto the See Apoſtolicke, to the great
ſcandall &amp; diſaedification of all Catholickes, not onely of
this Dioceſſe, &amp; Kingdome, but thorough the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World. So as he who moſt injuſtly, &amp; contrary to all
courſe of law cenſured others, himſelfe is faſt bound in the
tyes of an excommunication, &amp; that from the See of Rome:
So as it may truely be ſaid of him: <hi>Incidit in lequeum quem

The thing is ſo manifeſt, that he can not, as till it be affirmed

remaineth then, that forſomuch as the people could not be
excommunicated for the Prieſts diſobedience, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily

               <p>An Excommunication inflicted for a vertuous act, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
an intollerable errour, &amp; ſo by the ſecond principle is
moſt injuſt and invalid.</p>
               <p>But to be preſent at the adminiſtration of Sacraments by
Prieſts, who are free of all canonicall cenſures, is a vertuous
action.</p>
               <p>Therefore an Excommunication fulminated againſt ſuch
as be preſent thereat, is not onely voyde of force, but alſo
wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:17421:19"/>
For declaration of the <hi>Minor,</hi> it is to be underſtood, That
ſo long as the Prieſts are uncenſured, they are ſuppoſed by
the Church as men allowed, to whom all may have acceſſe
in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. For when the
Church holdes it not ſafe for the people to communicate
with their Prieſts, or Paſtours, whether Biſhops, or Curates,
or any other who have lawfull ordination, &amp; juriſdiction, It
beginnes (as is moſt reaſonable) firſt with the head, to cure
the maladyes &amp; diſeaſes thereof, with the medicinable bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamon
of the Cenſures. (For the Cenſures of holy Church
ought to be medicinable, &amp; not vindicative, uſed for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
&amp; ſerviceable to true Piety, &amp; not to ſiniſter ends. 2. <hi>q. 1,
multi. 34. q.</hi> 3.) So as if the Paſtor or Prieſt be not ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
be not excommunicated, be not interdicted, nor the
ſame publiſhed unto the people, together with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
cauſe of ſuch cenſure, in the ſentence of the Prelat expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
&amp; mentioned. It is to be underſtood, that by the Church
he is tollerated, neither can the people be cenſured for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
with him, either in divine, or civill actions. I ſay,
ſo long as himſelf is not cenſured: For to illuſtrate this by
a familiar example. Tell me, would it not be thought a ſtrange
reckning, If the Magiſtrat did forbid under ſome heavy fine,
that none ſhould frequent the ſhop, or buy &amp; ſell, with ſuch
a Merchant in the High-ſtreet, the ſaid Merchant neither pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or puniſhable for any delict, or fault committed. I

               <p>That none can be puniſhed with the ſpirituall ſword of
Excommunication for the ſin of another, not partaking in

by peſtilence. 2. <hi>Reg. 24. Iſti qui oves ſunt quid fecerunt?</hi>
Theſe ſheep what have they done? <hi>Let</hi> thy hand (I pray
thee) be turned againſt my ſelfe, &amp;c. If the Prieſts have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
let them in the name of God be puniſhed, but what
hath the innocent people committed, that they ſhould be
cenſured, either for the Prieſts true, or ſuppoſed offences.
Sure if that great Doctour of the Church S. <hi>Gregory</hi> may be
judge, his ſentence will be for the people againſt our Prelat.
For theſe are his words: <hi>Non debet is poenam ſuſtinere canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,
in cujus damnationem non eſt canonica prolam ſententia,</hi> II

And that whoſoever yeeldeth obedience unto the ſame

So S. <hi>Thomas 2. 2. q,</hi> 73. 1. &amp; all Divines. Yea
&amp; ſo much is that defamation or detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
greater, &amp; more grievous, by how much
it is more materiall, &amp; the partyres againſt
whom more honorable. And it is to be underſtood, That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation
or detraction is not only verball, but alſo mentall
and reall, that is, not only in word, but in thought alſo, and in
fact. And becauſe every thing is made more familiar by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
I put the caſe, that my ſelf, as alſo the whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
hath underſtood of ſome ſcandalous ſinne of one
of our old friends and familiar acquaintance, whom wee
held, albeit a poore, yet an honeſt, &amp; a very pious man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we with-draw our good opinions from him, our
wonted converſation, our familiarity, and ſuch benefites as
from time to time we were wonted to beſtow upon him,
and ſtill would have continued, if we had not heard ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
of him: well, it appeares unto us not long after, that
the party was wronged, and free from all ſuch vice &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17421:20"/>
as he was charged withall, and ſo as in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we are aſſured of his innocencie; yet notwithſtanding
we beare ourſelves towards him, as formerly we did, when
we believed thoſe evils of him, to his great diſcomfort, to
his diſcountenance in the world, and in fyne to his great
ſhame, &amp; infamy: I ſay in this caſe we all ſinne mortally, and
the blacke ſinne of Detraction, if not in thought, and in
word, yet (which is as bad as the reſt) really &amp; indeed. So I
ſay, theſe two R. Prieſts, ſo often mentioned, were charged
by their Ordinary with diſobedience, with continuall inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
&amp;c. All this is manifeſted to be a malicious ſlander,
notwithſtanding are the people forbidden to be preſent at
their Maſſes, &amp; the ſame under paine of Excommunication.
One Fryar ſayes, the Cenſure ought to be obeyed: Another
ſayes at leaſt, it is the ſafeſt way. I ſay, they both erre, &amp; lead
into errour. For the ſafeſt way is, not to defame my brother,
or to obſcure his good name, nor yet to joyne and concurre
with ſuch as do detract &amp; with-draw from his juſt honour,
and that eſpecially in perſons of ſo eminent a ranke in the
Church, as are anointed Prieſts, by which meanes their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
is leſſe reſpected, and themſelves diſinabled to walke
in that vocation to which they are called.</p>
               <p>And firſt the Biſhop who gave ſo impious a ſentence, &amp;
next the Friar, who gadding from houſe to houſe, ſeekes to
perſwade the ſame, are guilty of moſt horride ſin, and as the
Apoſtle calls it, blaſphemy. And as well the one as the other
obliged to ſatiſfaction unto the Innocent ſo wronged, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
unto the Church of God. In the meane time let both
Prieſt &amp; people comfort themſelves in that ſweet bleſſing,
pronounced by the month of our Saviour, Mat. 5. <hi>Beati eſt is
cùm maledixerint vobis, &amp;c.</hi> Bleſſed are you when men ſhall
revile you, &amp; ſhall perſecute you, &amp; ſhall ſpeake all evill of
you lying for my ſake: Be glad &amp; rejoyce, for great is your
reward in heaven, for ſo did they perſecute the Prophets
who were before you. And forſomuch as it is the counſell
of our ſweet Saviour, to love our enemyes, to doe good to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17421:21"/>
them that hate us, &amp; to pray for them that perſecute us. It
wilbe a worke of mercy, &amp; not (I truſt) miſbecomming me,
to give a parcell of good counſell &amp; advice unto my Prelat;
&amp; if with the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> by ſetting his fault before

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17421:24"/>
by his own paſſion, &amp; partly by the continuall ſollicitation

but by this time he hath a deſire (eſpecially ſince the ſucceſſe
was no better) by correcting of his miſtakes, to bring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into joynt againe. One great impediment I feare will be
in his way, which is the reſtitution of honor &amp; fame, which
I tell you is a block that lyes before many in the path that
leades unto ſalvation. For albeit (I confeſſe) it goes much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the haire to make reſtitution in temporall goods, in
which a man hath damuified his neighbour; yet have we in
the Old Teſtament a <hi>Tobias</hi> chap, 2. who commaunded the
ſame to be done: &amp; in the New a <hi>Zacheus,</hi> Luke 19: who
performed it himſelfe, But in reſtitution of honour &amp; fame,
our proud corrupt natures have ſuch an averſion to humble
our ſelves unto our equalls, &amp; much more to our Inferiours:
I ſay in acknowledging a wrong &amp; an injury done by us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>Onely good Reader, give me leave further to inlarge my
ſelfe, as touching the difficulty that all of us doe ordinarily
finde in this kinde of reſtitution, I meane of fame, more then
of any other. To which purpoſe I will relate unto you a
ſhort Hiſtory, &amp; I beleeve neither unprofitable, nor unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
which I finde in an old booke, &amp; indeed ſo old, as it was
printed above one hundred &amp; fifty yeeres agoe. Albeit for
a writer to be of that antiquity, is nothing. And this my
booke ſo ancient as appeares by the date of the impreſſion,
as well alſo may witneſſe the old Character, &amp; the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the Paper, is in a farre bigger volume, then ever I
yet beheld booke, &amp; it hath hitherto had ſo good a fate (of
which alſo I am right glad) that it hath eſcaped the Indian
leafe, the greateſt enemy that this day I know, to the leaves
of many a good booke, I ſay in this our reumatique &amp; ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
age: for it neither wanteth the firſt nor the laſt pages,
or any elſe thorough the whole volume. The name of it is
<hi>Correctorium Vitiorum,</hi> but the Author it ſeemes, meant not
to favour us ſo much, as to give us his name, for in ſtead
thereof, he is onely yelepped. <hi>Fabri lignarij filius:</hi> The Sonne
of the Carpenter, belike his father was free of S. <hi>Ioſephs</hi>
trade, but to our Story.</p>
               <p>This Author writing upon that commandement which S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> accounts to be the 7. but S. <hi>Hierome</hi> the 6. <hi>Non
furtum facies.</hi> Thou ſhalt not ſteale. Tells us of a certaine
Prieſt, who had a penitent, &amp; this penitent he was an arrant
theefe, but not of money or goods, but of honour and fame,
among other of his ſinnes acknowledging at the feet of his
ghoſtly father, that he had wronged a noble Gentleman in
his name, &amp; in his reputation, &amp; that very grievouſly before
many witneſſes. The Prieſt his ghoſtly father tells him he is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17421:25"/>
damned. He anſwers that he is very ſorry, &amp; were it to doe
againe, he would not for the world commit the like fact.
His Confeſſour tells him, he is damned. O ſayth the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
good father have compaſſion on me, you ſee my teares
&amp; my unfained ſorrow &amp; contrition of heart for my offence.
Goe thy wayes, ſaith the Prieſt, for thou art damned. O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of my ſoule, ſaith the penitent, I come hither to ſeeke
comfort in the Sacrament, having beene alwayes taught ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to diſpayre of Gods mercy, for what ſin or offence ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
And for my part, I am willing to accept of what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſhall be enjoyned me, though it were to goe on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griinage
to <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Compoſtella.</hi> Well then ſaith his ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
father, my child, If thou wilt be ſaved, goe thy wayes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

confeſſe thy fault, &amp; humbly aſke him forgiveneſſe, &amp; having
ſo done, returne hither to me againe, &amp; I will give thee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
And ſhall I, that am a Gentleman, a man of note, &amp;
a commander in my country, ſo abaſe, &amp; diſgrace my ſelfe, I
will firſt be damned. Why, ſayth the Prieſt, &amp; did not I tell
thee ſo much before, and yet I could not make thee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

of his Holineſſe to bee called unto the dignitie of the

the potency and ſedulity of the Fryars of his owne Order,
who by all meanes ſeeke to effect, (as they have often done)
to have Biſhops made out of their Convents, accounting
themſelves as good as Lords of that Dioceſſe, whoſe Biſhop
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17421:26"/>
is a Fryar: neither is this proper onely to the Cordiliers,
but to all other Orders of Regulars: Onely the Ignatians, I
confeſſe, are not ſo bent to ſeeke for theſe dignityes, at leaſt
in Europe, though we heare that in the Indyes they ſhoot
alſo at that marke.</p>
               <p>Yet this Epiſcopation of Fryars, eſpecially in the See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicke,
is not held ſo convenient, and therefore by the
wiſedome of the Cardinals is either wholly taken away, or
at leaſt much diſcontinued. Forſomuch as now for theſe 60.
yeares paſt, we have not had any Monke or Fryar advanced
unto that ſeat; I ſay, ſince the dayes of <hi>Sixtus quintus,</hi> who
was a conventuall Fryar of the Order of S. <hi>Francis.</hi> And the
ſaid government might very well be obſerved (as the beſt)
thorough the whole Church, &amp; would alſo, no doubt, if it
were not for the Importunity of them, who finde that the
eaſieſt way to climbe unto that greatneſſe which they ſo
much affect. And to this purpoſe you may call to minde the
parable of him who went at midnight to his neighbours
houſe to borrow 3. loaves, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. But upon what neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Forſooth becauſe, ſaith he: <hi>Amicus meus venit de via ad
me, &amp; non habeo quod ponam ante illum:</hi> A friend of mine is
come out of his way, &amp; I have not what to ſet before him.
But who is this friend who is come out his way, &amp; wants
his ſupper? Mary a Friar, who hungreth after a Biſhopricke.
For ſurely ſo often as a Friar, who hath by vow renounced
all dignities, &amp; advancements, as well ſpirituall, as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
hungers after a Myter, &amp; ſends his friend to Rome to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate
for him, he is, (no doubt,) out of his right way; for it
is not unknowne what path the Friar ought to keepe. The
path of a more then an ordinary humility, the path of auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
&amp; mortification, the path of continuall prayer &amp; recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
The path of abjection &amp; denyall, not onely of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments

               <p>Yet let no man ſo farre miſtake me, as to imagin that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in this diſcourſe, to diſparage the office, or diminiſh
the dignity of ſuch Biſhops, as are aſſumed from among the
Friars. Far be from me any ſuch thought, for we thankfully
acknowledge ſome of them, even in this Kingdome, to be
very good heads of the Clergy, &amp; zealous of their honour;
neither yet to infirnate, that for any perſonall defect, either
of Iudgment, learning, or diſcretion, their ſacred office and
Miniſtery is leſſe to be eſteemed. Forſomuch as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
tells me in his <hi>Paſtorali, Nihil in hoc ſaeculo excellentius ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotibus:
Nihil ſublimim Epiſcopis reperiri poteſt:</hi> Nothing in

by a ſpeech proceeding from a certaine Noble-man in
England, in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 3. for me thinkes it
reſeuteth a very ſound judgment. This Nobleman being ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
by others of his quality, to joyne with them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that King, who was held both for a Tyrant, &amp; an V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper,
made anſwer, That he in no ſort would concurre in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch action with them. For (ſaith he) let him be what he
will, he hath now the Crowne upon his head, and if you ſet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17421:27"/>
the Crowne upon a ſtake or a poſt, I for my part will follow
it. What that Nobleman ſaid of the Crowne, the ſame ſay I
of the Miter, let it be placed either on the head of a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or an or an undeſerving man, I for my part will honour and
obey the ſame, as hitherto I have everdone. Now, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is due unto the Miter, I happily ſhall have occaſion

I propoſed, &amp; the Reader may help himſelf by looking
back a page or two.</p>
               <p>So it happened, as our preſent Archbiſhop (his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
being deceaſed at Rome) landed in Ireland about the
yeare 1623. And ſcarce had he twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to put in execution. But what
ſay you is that? Mary a Plantation upon the Clergy, and in
their places to bring in the Monks &amp; the Friars, which about
thoſe times, as alſo before in great numbers, &amp; of all Orders

Neither (when I ſpeak of Monks and Friars) thinke that I

colours of the Friars. Now the meanes to effect this Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wars, to make themſelves ſtrong, &amp; the Clergy weake. To
make themſelves ſtrong, was to take into their Orders by
all manner of allurements and perſwaſions, ſuch as may bee
thought any wayes fit for their purpoſe: &amp; to this end they
induce Gentlemens ſecond ſonnes, as alſo Farmers ſonnes, &amp;
Merchants Apprentices, among which they found (and ſtill
doe) a plentifull harveſt. For I have heard Merchants of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin
complayning, that ſcarce could they have an Apprentice
to ſerve out the halfe of his yeares, before he had a vocation
to be a Fryar. And among thoſe they refuſed not alſo to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Serving-men, Soldiers, Taylours, &amp; Horſe-boyes, who
are now become R. Fathers, though neither learned, nor ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17421:28"/>
men. And indeed by taking in ſuch a multitude of rude,
&amp; licentious youthes, of all ſorts and conditions, many ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls
have happened among them theſe yeares paſt. And no
marvaile, for when ſuch a company of unbridled colts break
looſe from obedience of Parents &amp; Maſters, by whom they
were formerly curbed &amp; kept in awe, and begin to taſte that
pleaſant liquor of liberty, which under the Fryars they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
injoyed, they grew very inſolent &amp; terrible, yea and
many times inſupportable. For their new Superiours, not
willing to diſtaſte their novices (who many times in regard
of the portions &amp; meanes they brought with them, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
their Maſters.) And partly for feare of looſing them, of
whom for a long time they could not be well aſſured, as alſo
leſt by offending and diſcontenting of them, they ſhould not
ſo eaſily draw in others. And laſtly, for that in truth ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall
diſcipline (as is requiſit &amp; commanded by the rule)
could not conveniently be obſerved in this Countrey, ſo
many abuſes on a ſudden did ruſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in among them, as it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome zealous of the common good, (true lovers of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; vertue; &amp; not only of the ſpecious names &amp; glorious
titles therof) to move his Holines for a Reformation, which
accordingly was effected, &amp; a direction came downe; That
no Novices ſhould be received into any Order of Religion
in theſe parts, where Regular diſcipline could not be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But this Inhibition took as much effect with our Friars,
as if it had come from me. For the manner of our Regulars
in theſe parts is: That if any thing from the Citty be obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their behalfe; for example, any new priviledge, or
augmentation of authority, Exemption, Faculty, Indult,
Grant, Diſpenſation, Immunity, which fals out to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and of which themſelves by long fuit have beene the
procurers; O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it is received as an Oracle, it is publiſhed,
it is proclaymed, it is urged, it is inſiſted upon. And
what but the authority of the See Apoſtolicke, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Obedience. But if on the contrary, by reaſon of my
juſt complaint made againſt them by the Biſhops &amp; Preats
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17421:28"/>
of the Clergy, any reſtraint or limitation of their power be
made, or diminutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their greatnes, which may but eclipſe
the ſmalleſt glimpſe of their accuſtomed ſplendor, then ſhall
ſuch Apoſtolicall letters be viewed, &amp; reviewed, they ſhall
be ſearched, weighed, &amp; pondered, they ſhall be conſtrued,
gloſſed, &amp; interpreted, yea every point and iota ſhall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
&amp; pryed into; if happily by any meanes they may be
avoyded. But if no ſuch flaw can be found in them, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
they were obtayned by ſiniſter &amp; wrong informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; ſo ſubject unto obreption. or elſe their Generalls have
not ſignified them, &amp; ſo no reckoning to be made of them.
Example where of wee have lately ſeene in the Bull of the
Revocation of Facultyes: And now ſince that againe, in the
Inhibition, <hi>De non admittendis Novitijs in Hibernia,</hi> I ſay
then, ſince the time that our Fryars began to give their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
&amp; to take in Probationers in the Kingdome (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in much fewer numbers were bred for them beyond
ſeas) they are increaſed to ſuch a height, as they are become
not onely terrible unto the Biſhops &amp; Clergy, but whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall oppoſe them ſhall find of what power they are of.
And this may well be underſtood if wee doe but obſerve
what Inwardneſſe, or rather I may call it, a kinde of Kinred
&amp; alliance they have contracted, not onely with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, but with them alſo of beſt note and ranke, by
drawing unto them this ſonne, that Daughter, this brother,
that ſiſter, this uncle, that aunt, this Nephew, that Niece, this
Kinſman, that Apprentice: So as they are become farie more
deare &amp; neere unto the Inhabitants, then were ever in times
paſt, Foſters, or Goſſips: So as by their owne multitudes, &amp;
this intaylemente of their Devotoes, they are now able in
two houres to make the worthy eſt man either of our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
or. Laity (within the Citty of Dublin, or where elſe they
reigne) as odious and hatefull unto the people, as any Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour
whatſoever.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of that hereditary diſeaſe of lying, which

backbiting, &amp; detraction, they have purchaſed more beliefe,
eſpecially among the vulgar, then he that comes with the
goſpell of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his mouth. For whenſoever a Fryar is
diſpoſed by lying and back<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iting to take away the good
name of a Prieſt, or any other man whoſoever, hee preſently
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17421:29"/>
be takes himſelfe unto his begging vocation, which is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
colour to bring him to any mans houſe, and ſo very
dextrouſly he can ſtop two ſhards with one buſh, for hee
can both begge and ſlander at one time. For ſay, his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
buſines (&amp; that which he cheifly intends) is to defame,
&amp; to backbite his neighbour, yet his begging ſhall bee the
ſtalking horſe unto that foule buſineſſe, ſo as the detraction
ſhall onely ſeeme to come by way of diſcourſe &amp; communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
accidentally. And this advantage hath the Friar of all
men in the world, who ſay they were malitiouſly minded, &amp;
intended never ſo much evill againſt their neighbour, yet
are they to ſeeke of an occaſion &amp; an excuſe to bring them
to this &amp; that bodies houſe, whereby they might vent the
poyſon &amp; malice of their hearts, of which pretext by reaſon
of his begging, the Friar is ever provided, and therefore in
flandering, backbiting &amp; defaming, whenſoever it pleaſeth
the Friar to be ſo wicked, (as I ſaid before) he hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of all men upon earth. In confideration whereof I
leſſe muvaile at the ſpeech of a certaine Gentleman, who in
a familiar diſcourſe ſaid, that he had rather have the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of any Nobleman in the country, then of the meaneſt
Fryar of any order: being aſked the reaſon thereof, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he would keepe that to himſelfe. And whence may we
thinke all theſe lyes &amp; tales with which this country (more
of late then ever heeretofore) is abuſed? I ſay from what
fountaine by all probability doe they deſcend, but from
theſe Fryar limitours, who paſſing from pariſh to pariſh,
from houſe to houſe, are lurking and ſcouting in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
For albeit I confeſſe the needy beggar is alſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a lyar, yet neither hath he the wit, or the boldneſſe to vent
ſuch lewd repo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, neither (if he did) is there any ſo light of
beliefe, is to give credit unto him. No, no: it is not the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
beggar that ſits at the gate with a meſſe of broth, and a
piece of bread in his hand, who bruiteth all theſe lyes and
ſlanderous detractions of this, &amp; that party, whom they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect,
but it is the wanton beggar who ſits above the ſalt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17421:30"/>
becauſe he hath a better coat upon his back, &amp; authorized
by his profeſſion, which in this kingdome is made too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a Pandor to wicked abuſes. And I am the rather induced
ſo to thinke, for that in this City of Dublin, we never yet
found any lye, or wicked ſlander made of a Clergy-man, but
when we got the end of the threed, and did winde up the
ſame to the bottome (as ſomtimes we have done) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of it did alwayes hang at a Fryars tongue. And this
they are the more animated, &amp; encouraged to doe (I ſay, to
offer any abuſe or diſgrace to a Paſtor, or a Pariſh Prieſt, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other of the Clergy) for that no remedy in the earth can
be had againſt them. But why? Becauſe it is provided by
ſuch priviledges &amp; indults, as they have obtained from the
See Apoſtolick (which I doubt not but was at the firſt gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them upon good conſideration) That upon all cauſes
(excepting hereſies, &amp; ſuch other enormous crimes reſerved
to the cognizance of the Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates) they
ſhall be convented before no other Iudges <hi>in primo inſtanti,</hi>
then their own Superiours; as Guardians, Priors, Rectors,
Provincials, and the like. And you know it is a Proverb, that
the clout will help the ſhooe. So as a man (though never ſo
highly wronged by a Friar) had better fit him down conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
then make a journey to the Friars Superiour, happily 20
or 30 miles from him, &amp; comming to his reſidence or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
his Guardian ſhall either be at home, or from home;
within, or abroad; at leyſure, or not at leyſure; to be ſpoke
withall, or not to be ſpoke withall, even as it pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And let the plaintiff doe his beſt or his worſt, he ſhall be
ſure his ſatiſfaction ſhall never countervaile his labour, and
for one enemy he had before, he ſhall be ſure to purchaſe a
ſcore. I could be content to make a Catalogue of ſome part
of their lyes and ſlanders, were it not to avoyde prolixity, &amp;
that they are ſo incredible, as my ſelfe ſhould alſo incurre
the name of a lyar in relating them: wherefore I hold it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſay my prayers with the Prophet <hi>David: Domine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

deliver my ſoule from lying lips, &amp; from a deceitful tongue.</p>
               <p>And thus have you the firſt meanes of the oppreſſion of
the Clergy by our Friars, which conſiſts in making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtrong. The ſecond is, in making the Cleargy weake,
for upon theſe two Poles moves the Spheare of the Friars
Monarchy. Now to weaken the Cleargy there was held no
better courſe, then upon the vacancy of any Pariſh, either by
death, or otherwiſe, to annex that cure unto another, as we
ſee at this day, five or ſix pariſhes within the walls, with us
reduced unto two, or els in place of the dead (who was a
man of good talents and parts) to ſubſtitute ſome Arcadian
creature, who litle can ſay more then his Matins, &amp; he ſhall
undergo the Cure. For you know, the greater the Aſſe, the
greater burden is he able to beare, beſides (none more ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto the humour of the Fryar) then he that is guilty of
little worth in himſelfe. So twixt the one &amp; the other, we
ſee of ten Pariſhes within &amp; without the walls, only remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
five, while (in the mean time) the Fryars, in, &amp; about the
town, are multiplyed unto five ſcore: Beſides what they
have in the Countrey, &amp; not one of theſe, but what by his
owne endeavours, the ſtrength of his Order, the dependance
of his Devoto's, the countenance of our Franciſcan Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
is able to prevayle in right and wrong, againſt all our
Clergy in Dublin. For (God help us) at this day both Pariſh
Prieſts, &amp; all others of the Clergy, aſwell in the Suburbes,
as Citty of Dublin, ſcarce are wee ſo many perſons as
were in the Arke of <hi>Noah.</hi> Of which ſmall number, ſome
of them being called by the Ordinary, to have the care
of Pariſhes (and as themſelves know, and others can
witneſſe with them, neither for any deſert of learning,
or good life at all.) Others being the out-caſt of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and without all hope of reentrance, being throwne out
as branne, (good enough in thoſe mens eyes, to make pariſh
Prieſts) entertained into the Archbiſhops favour by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring
of his Friars, (who according to that rule of ſtate

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17421:31"/>
a faction among thy ſubjects &amp; then be abſolute) he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make uſe of them, and to ſerve himſelfe of them, to
ruinate both themſelves and their fellowes, knowing by
how much more theſe ſilly men are obnoxious unto him,
and in his danger for ſome cauſes, he is the more aſſured of
them, as the fitteſt inſtruments of oppoſition unto the reſt
of the Clergy.</p>

in a manner is committed the managing of the whole warre

Prieſts D. <hi>Peter Cadell,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul Harris,</hi> in whom finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he could reprehend; The Biſhop (by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of his Fryars) falls upon the moſt ingenious kinde of
perſecution, &amp; withall the moſt impious that ever in any age
was practiſed, yea, I challenge all antiquity, ſince the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Saviour; to give an Example of the like. For firſt
attempting by Regall power, rather then Epiſcopall, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them out his Dioceſſe, &amp; that without alledging any
cauſe againſt them, &amp; finding this not to ſucceed with him,
he then commaunds under paine of Excommunication, that
none ſhould be preſent at their Maſſes, knowing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more prejudiciall unto them, in regard of
their temporall maintenance, nor nothing leſſe troubleſome
unto the people. For what is it to forbeare the Maſſes of
two Prieſts (ſay they) when as with ſuch eaſe they may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that want among the Friars? So that upon the leaſt
ſcruple in the world, he wiſt well that would be obeyed.
And ſo by this one commaund he ſerves himſelfe of two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
purpoſes. For firſt he deprives the Prieſts of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
maintenance: And by the ſame hee brings what
they ſhould have, unto his beloved Friars. For it is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
(which he well knew) both of the Citty &amp; countrey
in theſe parts, that where the good people heare Maſſe, that
there one time or other, they leave ſome ſmall almes or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
according to their devotion. Heere, I confeſſe, was a
great deale of policy, but where was the Religion? Now
happily if any of more underſtanding &amp; judgment then the

them ſomtimes with the honey, ſomtimes with the ſting, as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17421:32"/>
beſt might ſerve their turne: In Confeſſion perſwading ſuch
as repaire unto them, &amp; never giving them abſolution, till
they have promiſed not any more to frequent the Maſſes of
the two Prieſts. Others who are ſlow in comming unto the
Friar, the Friar comes unto them, he viſites them in their
houſes, he tells them how ſuch a good friend of theirs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
their love unto them: he brings them a letter or a
token from ſuch a Friar of their kinred or acquaintance, and
wiſhes them to be adviſed by him: He proteſteth how well
he loves them; how much S. <hi>Francis</hi> or S. <hi>Dominick</hi> is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto them for their great charity &amp; almes; &amp; for their
parts, they pray continually for their happines &amp; proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
both in this life, &amp; in the next. If they prevaile (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

others that are of a better head-piece, &amp; have a litle more
ſteele in their beards,, &amp; will not ſo eaſily be drawne with
their ſweet words: If he be a Merchant, they tell him plainly

Taylours, &amp; Shoe-makers: Nay, they will threaten the very
Tavernes, that they ſhall have no ſale of their Wine &amp; their
Beere, if they will adhere unto thoſe two Prieſts. (I write
nothing but what is well known through all the ſtreets of
Dublin.) Nay, &amp; they will be as good as their words: for
all our friends who wiſh us well, or gives us a meales meat,

man his own. Iuſtice, which (as <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> ſaith) knowes
neither father nor mother, but only the truth. It accepteth
no perſon, it imitateth God. Iuſtice, Iuſtice cryes the Prieſt:
Peace, hold thy tongue, ſayes the Friar. The one ſtill laying
on, the other ſtill crying out: as having more reaſon to cry
for his beating, then the other to beat him for his crying.
But never will the Muſick be ſweet, betwixt them, till it be

firmely will, that they labour with their hands what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to honeſty: &amp; ſuch as know not, let them learne; not
for deſire of receiving a reward of their labours, but for
good example, &amp; to avoyde ſloath, &amp; when the price of our
worke is not given us, let us have recourſe unto the Table
of our Lord, asking almes from doore to doore. By which it
is manifeſt, that the bleſſed S. <hi>Francis</hi> intends not the labour
of the minde, in ſtudying to become learned, but manuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
&amp; bodily worke, propounding the ſame unto them by
his own example: <hi>Et ego manibus me is laborabam,</hi> &amp; I (ſaith
he) laboured with my hands: neither can any ſay, that this is
only adviſed them by way of counſell, but rather abſolutely
commanded, for ſo ſaith the Saint, <hi>&amp; volo,</hi> &amp; I will that all
other my brethren labour <hi>de laboritio,</hi> by which word is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
underſtood bodily labour.</p>
               <p>Now, if the Friars in their own defence, ſay, that it may
be ſo expounded, as extended unto the labour of
the mind, as well as of the body: Then (ſay I) they violat
another precept of their rule given them by S. <hi>Francis,</hi>
which is, that they are to make no gloſſe, commentary, or
expoſition, upon his rule, but to underſtand the words plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they lye, &amp; this is commanded them under obedience,
in the laſt Paragraph ſaving one, of his Teſtament, in theſe
words: <hi>Et omnibus fratribus meis Clericis &amp; Laicis, praecipio
firmiter per obedientiam, ut non mittant gloſſas in Regulam, nec
in iſtis verbis, dicendo, Ita volunt intelligi, ſed ſicut Dominus dedit

operatione obſervetis uſque in finem.</hi> The ſame in Engliſh is
thus. And I firmely commaund under obedience, all my Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
Clergy, and Laity, that they make no gloſſes upon the
Rule, nor in theſe words, ſaying: So they wil be underſtood;
but as our Lord gave me ſimply &amp; purely to ſpeak, and to
write the Rule, &amp; thoſe words, ſo ought you to underſtand
them, without a gloſſe, &amp; by holy operation obſerve them
unto the end.</p>
               <p>Now if our Friars tell us, That the Teſtament of S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
is diverſe from his Rule, &amp; ſo not of that authority as to
bind them to that obedience and obſervation, as the Rule
doth. Then ſay I, <hi>Let</hi> S. <hi>Francis</hi> anſwer for himſelf in his ſaid
Teſtament §. 6. in theſe words: <hi>Et non dicant fratres, Haec eſt
alia Regula, quia haec eſt recordatio, admonitio &amp; exhortatio, &amp;
meum teſtamentum quod ego frater Franciſcus parvulus veſter
&amp; ſervus facio vobis fratribus meis benedictis, propter hoc, ut

In Engliſh thus: And let not the Friars ſay, This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rule, for that this is a remembrance, admonition, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
&amp; my will which I brother <hi>Francis,</hi> a little one, &amp;
your ſervant, doe make to you my bleſſed brethren, to this
end, that we may better Catholickly obſerve this Rule,
which we have promiſed unto our Lord.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Friars ſay: That howſoever it be, yet they are
diſpenſed by authority of the See Apoſtolick, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of his Teſtament, &amp; conſequently, from any bodily
work or labour, other then it pleaſe themſelves. I anſwer: As
the Pope cannot diſpenſe with any commannd or Precept
of Canonicall Scripture; no more can he with the Rule of S.
<hi>Francis.</hi> If it be true which S. <hi>Francis</hi> wrote in his Will and
Teſtament, a little before his death: (And I truſt our Friars
will hold it a great ſin to ſay, S. <hi>Francis</hi> lyed) in theſe words,
<hi>Dominus dedit mihi ſimpliciter &amp; purè dicere &amp; ſcribere regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,
&amp; iſta verba:</hi> Our Lord granted unto me, ſimply &amp; pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſpeak &amp; write the Rule, &amp; theſe words: Teſtament §.
11. By which teſtimony of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> it appeareth, that as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17421:35"/>
well his Teſtament or Will which he made but two yeares
before his death, as his Rule before given unto his brethren
was indited by the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; ſo by divine authority
given unto him. Notwithſtanding the Friars of his Order
doe exempt themſelves from his Will &amp; Teſtament, &amp; the
obſervance thereof, &amp; conſequently from all bodily labour
therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, &amp; contrary unto the expreſſe commaund
of the aforeſaid Will, they take upon them to procure gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
&amp; expoſitions upon the Rule as alſo diſpenſations &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations
from the See Apoſtolick. And this by vertue of
the Declarations of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> 9, &amp; <hi>Nicolaus</hi> 3. who (as they
ſay) have declared, that they are not bound to obſerve or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
that Teſtament or Will of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or the thiugs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained. Thoſe Popes (it ſeemeth) were not of opinion,
That the Teſtament of S. <hi>Francis</hi> was of ſacred authority, or
canonicall Scripture, or that it was from Heaven, &amp; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt inſpired into S. <hi>Francis.</hi> And ſo the Friars reſting
upon the aforeſaid Declarations, are well contented that ſo
it ſhould be believed. And therefore (ſay S. <hi>Francis</hi> what he
will, or what he can) begg they will, &amp; labour they will not;
for that is the more eaſie Trade of both; <hi>&amp; aucupium longe
queſtuofiſſimum,</hi> a moſt ready way to attaine, not onely to
meanes neceſſary, but to ſuch abundance, as wee ſee them in
all places to injoy. For firſt our Mendicant Orders have two
ſorts of Begging, like two ploughes ever walking. For firſt,
they paſſe thorough the Pariſhes, from houſe to houſe, not
contented to aske their almes at the doore, as S. <hi>Franeis</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in his Will, &amp; was practiſed in his dayes, and in the
primitive times of his Order; for that is not Gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but boldly will they ruſh into the Hall, &amp; from thence
into any other part of the houſe, more like unto Officers,
then poore Beggars: So haunting the richeſt ſort of people
for Money, Wheat, Muttons, Malt, Salt, Fiſh, Fleſh, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
comes amiſſe; as they forget not the honeſt Farmer,
neither ſhall the poore Cotter eſcape them. And as <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hanus</hi>
noted in his time, ſo ſhameleſſe, and importunate in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17421:35"/>
their begging, as if there be but two Cheeſes in the houſe,
they will carry them both away, or they will ſhame the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
And verily this which S. <hi>Richard</hi> of Dundalke writes
in his <hi>Defenſorium Curatorum,</hi> of the two Cheeſes, puts me
in minde of what lately we ſaw practiſed in the Countie of
Wexford, where a Friar comming to begge Muttons, a
poore Cotter, (having but only two,) out of his kind heart
told the Friar, he ſhould have one of them. Alas (quoth the
Friar) my honeſt friend, and what wilt thou doe with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
It will but ſtray from thee; give them both to GOD
Almighty. The poore man was content: And ſo GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
(by the Friars help) got both the Muttons. But farre
be it from me to ſay, That this Friar was either a bold Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
or avaricious at all.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond kind of Begging, as it is farre more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
ſo much more commodious: for as their former Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
ſeemed to, be but by retayle, by viſiting the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their houſes; ſo this is altogether by whole-ſale, and
(as it were) in groſſe. And it is after this manner, though
uſed in no other Countrey (that ever I could obſerve) but
only in Ireland.</p>
               <p>The Friar betakes himſelf on Sondayes, on Holy-dayes, or

that many of them take among their neighbours to bee

theſe yeeres paſt. But indeede of late I heare ſay, the caſe is
altered, &amp; no marvaile if with continuall blood-letting the

in which three all things were created, as alſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and oppreſſed, as now they are as unwilling to ſee a
Friar come among them to begge, as a Trooper to diſtraine,
&amp; to take up their pawnes. Inſomuch as in the Countrey the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17421:36"/>
good people, (though never ſo Catholicke &amp; devout,) they
will rather looſe Maſſe upon Sundayes &amp; Holydayes, then
they will come within a muſket ſhot of a Fryar, ſo much
they feare to be pounded up in a Gentlemans Hall, or in a
pariſh Chappell, as their Cowes uſe to be, when they treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
upon their neighbours cornes. Thus are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
prophaned: And that <hi>munda oblatio:</hi> that cleane offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(propheſied of by <hi>Malachy.</hi> 1.) neglected, the ſervice
&amp; ceremonyes of the Church contemned. While in the eyes
of the people, either nothing, or nothing more is ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then the belly. For who is either ſo patient by nature, or
ſo irreligious for want of breeding, as he can endure a Friar
limitour in a publicke audience, (when he findes the people
ſometimes, not to anſwer his expectation in giving of
almes) to utter theſe wordes. Well and doe you depart the
the place, &amp; give me nothing? From the richeſt to the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
thoſe who leave no almes with me, I will take from
them the grace and benefite of that Maſſe which this day
they have heard. This prophane &amp; Symoniacall ſpeech was
uttered by a Franciſcan in the Dioceſſe of Meath, &amp; the ſame
very lately. And if any of his order will queſtion the truth

               <p>The conſideration of theſe our miſerable times in Ireland

the Sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> neither knowing our Lord, nor the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Prieſts unto the people, &amp;c: by whoſe baſe greedineſſe,
as you may read in the place above cited, it is ſaid. <hi>Quòd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahebant
homines à ſacrificio Domini.</hi> They did withdraw
the people from the ſacrifice of our Lord, which example of
<hi>Ophni</hi> &amp; <hi>Phinees</hi> the two Sonnes of <hi>Heli,</hi> in preferring the
fleſh pots before the ſacrifices of God, is ſet forth unto us a
moſt lively type &amp; figure of our Friar Mendicants, who in
what abundance ſoever they live (whoſe apparell, horſes, &amp;
foote-boyes, argues rather ſuperfluity then poverty) yet
begge they will, &amp; begge they muſt, &amp; that, (as before hath
beene noted) with ſuch immodeſty, as all preſent but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are much aſhamed of them, making the people either
to loathe, or at leaſt to forbeare their duty to God, and in
truth to conceive that all our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion is but to ſerve our
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17421:37"/>
owne turnes. Thoſe who doubt of the truth of my ſpeeches,
let them but upon ſome Feſtivall day, walke unto the next
Villages, as Cromlin, Caſticknock, Palmerſton, or Lucan, &amp;c.
and they ſhall be both eye &amp; eare witneſſes of much more
then I have ſaid. But &amp; if they will take the paines to make
a journey ſo farre as Connagh, then I will promiſe them that
there they ſhall find our Friars rather <hi>latrones,</hi> then <hi>mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,</hi>
more to ſmell of the Theefe, then of the Beggar. For
without any leave or liking of the honeſt Farmer, they will
make bold to ſearch his Arkes, &amp; hutches of Corne, Meale,
Malt, &amp; thence to take away what they pleaſe, for who can
controll them? Moreover, I am credibly informed by divers
of very good note in thoſe parts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> That many times they
will drive together all their neighbours ſheepe into one
fold, &amp; knowing every mans marke, they will chooſe out
what Muttons they like (and I beſhrew them if they take
not the fatteſt) &amp; who is he that dare ſay, they doe amiſſe?
To ſuch a potency they are growne (even in a ſhort time)
in this Kingdome, that they are become not only terrible
unto the people, but not to be ruled by the lawes of the
Church, and the inſtitutes of their owne Orders.</p>
               <p>And even as in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8, of late memory,
the manifold abuſes not onely of the Laity, but even of
Church men, did caſt them out of theſe Kingdomes, and
brought that deſolation upon them, which to this day their
poſterity doth inherite. So let us never thinke to repayre
our ruines, with thoſe exceſſes, and diſorders, which were
the cauſes of thoſe ruines. For doubtles the ſame cauſes, ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or later, will have the ſame effects. Now certaine it is,
that as ſome of the Eccleſiaſticall order might be tainted
with much pride &amp; ambition, by meanes of their great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
&amp; abundance, &amp; not free alſo from covetouſneſſe, yet the
Mendicant orders according to the courſe of mans naturall
corruption, are more prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Clergy, or any other eſtate &amp; condition of men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17421:38"/>
a competency of ſome ſettled meanes, may well attend
their vocation with tranquillity, &amp; contentment of minde,
(I ſay, their mediocrity of meanes under God, defending
them from too much anxiety, and care of future wants.)
When as the Friar Mendicant, being habituated in begging,
&amp; continuall receiving of almes, &amp; expectation of uncertain
gifts, dwels ever in cares houſe, his wants as well imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as reall, like unto two fore-ſwarty forge-men, ſtill bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
&amp; hammering upon the head-piece of his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
permitting him not to take any reſt, yea without a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
degree of Gods grace, the beggar is ever ſad, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
humorous &amp; greedy, nor ordinarily ſo well provided as
he ought to rely upon that providence, which ever takes
place of humane diligence. For example, give a convent of
Fryars, though but of 20. perſons, five hundred pounds in
almes this day (which is a faire proportion) you ſhall ſee
them to morrow as induſtrious in begging, as if you had
given them but ten ſhillings. For even as Hawkes halfe
gorged are more eager of prey, then theſe which are kept
faſting, ſo fareth it with the Mendicants, who looke not ſo
much to what they have allready gotten, as what they have
not yet obtained, nor what for the preſent they enjoy, as
what in time they may come to want. Nay the Friar though
never ſo well accommodated, abounding on every ſide, with
rich kinred, friends &amp; Benefactours, amidſt his owne nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
where probably he can never come to looke neceſſity in
the face, &amp; having alſo <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> as a ſure buckler
(in the hands of a man of good comportment) to defend
him alſo from want: yet compare this Friar Mendicant not
now to a Clergy man (as we have already done) but even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the needy beggar, who hath plenty of nothing, but of
want, you ſhall ſee the one well contented with a piece of
bread, to ſatiſfie his hungry b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lly, or a paire of broken ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or an old ſhoe to his foot, when as the other beggar
will not ſticke to aſke you an horſe of eight or ten pounds
price, &amp; if you deny him, he will ſhew much more diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17421:38"/>
then the other beggar who is denyed a piece of peaſe
bread, after which his hungry belly roares; but if it ſo fall
out, as your horſe which you refuſed to beſtow on the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
miſcary, or come to any miſchance, &amp; ſo periſh, why then
the owner is rightly ſerved, ſince he denyed him the Fryar.
Some reading theſe lines will better underſtand them then
others. A Merchant of my acquaintance, and living at this
day in this Citty of Dublin, refuſed to give a Friar a barrell
of Beefe, who of my knowledge was in leſſe neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
then the Merchant himſelfe, conſidering his charge of
wife &amp; children: ſoone after the Merchant (being his owne
Factour) embarked himſelfe with his Beefe, and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
for <hi>France,</hi> upon the ſeas he meetes with a ſtorme,
&amp; it was thought neceſſary for their ſafety to lighten the
ſhip, &amp; to caſt over-board ſome part of the Beefe, it pleaſed
God (the tempteſt ceaſing) they held on their voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more hurt. But what ſaid the Friar and his fellowes
when newes came to towne? forſooth, it was the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God that he ſhould bee forced to throw that Beefe
into the ſea, which he would not beſtow on them. So as in
feare of theſe enſuing calamities incident unto our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mortality &amp; uncertaine eſtate of life, in this vale of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
What man of trade or occupation, but eſpecially what

Orders what they aſke? for he ſhall be ſure the next
calamity or miſfortune ſhall be ſet upon the ſkore of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall.

ſort) that the Friar caſts an affection unto; for being once
asked and denyed, they are perſwaded that it will periſt
from them, &amp; never do them good. Neither ſtands it with
the Friars profit to remove this &amp; the like opinions from
the peoples minds; <hi>quaerentes magis quae ſua ſunt, quam quae
ſunt Chriſti Domini,</hi> rather ſeeking themſelves, then what is
our Lord Chriſts; as dayly experience teacheth, and as the
Apoſtle ſpake of ſome in his time, Philip. 2.</p>
               <p>Now as for their Propheſies: If any diſaſter or miſhap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
to any man or woman, who is not ſo much devoted unto
their order, or not ſo kind unto them, as they deſire, preſently
the Friar divulges among the people, that either himſelf, or
ſuch another Friar of his Order, did propheſie ſuch things to
befall them: As likewiſe if any of their Benefactours receive
any temporall bleſſing, profit, or emolument more then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
it ſhall be imputed either to the prayers, or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
predictions of ſome Friar, as if GOD Almighty
would keep nothing ſecret from them, nor diſpoſe either of
his bleſſings or puniſhments, but by their miniſtery and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation.
And among other of their propheſies, there is
none ſtronger among the Friar Minors, then that in this
Kingdome, the Church ſhall one day be ruled by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which propheſie they well weened (about ſixe yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone)
had bin fulfilled, when as (of the foure Arch-biſhops)

of this life, did fruſtrate their expectation for that time. As

               <p>Now then I ſay, That cauſes meerely Civill, as Debts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances,
Pawnes, Morgages, Leaſes, Rents, Annuities, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
Purchaſes, Sales, and the like; ſo often as Prieſts and
Clergy-men were to be Defendants in all times, as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the government of the Saxon, as Norman Kings, were
determinable by the Common-law, &amp; never in any Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
Court at all. So as it ſeemes unto me, that law of the
Church was either never received, which in theſe Civill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
drawes the plea unto the Court of the Ordinary,
(which I rather believe.) Or if it were at any time in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance,
by cuſtome beyond all memory, it was abrogated.
Neither need we ſo much to marvaile heereat, ſince it is the
common opinion of Divines, that the exemption of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as well in reſpect of their perſons, as their goods, from
ſaecular tribunalls, was at the firſt introduced by humane, &amp;
not divine law. So S. <hi>Greg. lib. 11. epiſt.</hi> 54. doth no otherwiſe

further clearing of this point: Forſomuch, as I am in the
Negative, &amp; our Archb. with his Friars in the Affirmative.
If they will maintaine, that the law above cited in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Chap. was ever <hi>in viridi obſervantia,</hi> in due
practiſe within theſe Kingdomes of England &amp; Ireland: I
ſay, it is their parts by examples of Caſes pleaded, of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp; Sentences, in ſuch &amp; ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Courts of
Biſhops, or their Vicar Generalls, or their Chancellours, to
ſhew out of ſome auncient Records of the afore-named
Courts &amp; Tribunals, what may make for the confirmation
of their cauſe, which I aſſure my ſelf they ſhall never be able
to doe; no not ſo much as to afford us one onely preſident,
though nothing be more common in the Common-law,
then Biſhops, Abbots, Prieſts, &amp;c. convented in the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Courts, in Civill cauſes, even in the beſt &amp; moſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
times, no leſſe then at this day. Hence are thoſe Writs
of temporall Courts unto the Diocaeſan Biſhops, <hi>venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

               <p>Why then doth our Archbiſhop <hi>Thomas Flemming</hi> aliàs
<hi>Barnwell,</hi> together with his Friars, noyſe it up and downe

by the Lord Chief Iuſtice? (eſpecially the aforeſaid Prieſt
<hi>A B.</hi> firſt having made his complaint unto his Ordinary,
the aforeſaid Archbiſh. &amp; could not be heard.) Shall we ſay,
That our Archbiſhop and Friars are either more wiſe, more

&amp; as obedient children of the Church, and as reſpective of

Governours, who as good children of the Church,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17421:42"/>
were enduced to grant this temporall aſſiſtance, onely in
ſome caſes, unto the Paſtor, for the better government of his
flocke in his Spirituall regiment. And ſo it came to paſſe
that priſons were allowed unto Biſhops, wherein not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to detaine, but alſo to chaſtiſe Herètickes, Simoniſts, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
prophaners of the Sacraments, vow breakers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of the faſts of the Church, &amp; Holy-dayes, violators
of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, and the like, as alſo for faults not
of ſo bad a note, to inflict pecuniary mulcts &amp; fines at their
diſcretion, yet wee finde not that Biſhops or Prelats (who
beſides their ſpirituall juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not temporall Princes,
either in whole, or in part) doe corporally puniſh, either
theft, or murders, or treaſons, or rapes, or blood-ſhed, with
infinite other offences, which are dayly committed in all
common-wealthes. So never doe we finde by any record or
regiſter of any Eccleſiaſticall court. That in theſe Kingdomes
either with cauſe, or without cauſe, it was permitted by the
Church unto Archbiſhops, or Biſhops, or ever did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
the paine of baniſhment, either out of their Provinces
or Dioceſſes. It being a power meerely temporall, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,
&amp; never committed unto them, no more then puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of death, loſſe of lim, forfeyture of houſe, &amp; land, &amp;c.
Nay if it be law which Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> reports in his
comment upon <hi>Littleton lib. 2. cap. Villinage ſect.</hi> 200. No
ſubject may be baniſhed out of the Kingdome, but by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
authority, for what cauſe or crime ſoever. Shall then
our Archbiſhop who borrowes his temporall power, &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
from the King, aſſume the like authority? But to
this it will be ſaid, That the Archbiſhop onely exiles out of
his Dioceſſe, or at the moſt out of his Province, not out of
the whole land. To which I anſwere, but in caſe the foure
Archbiſhops of this Kingdome ſhould agree (as within
theſe ſixe yeeres, three of them at one time were gray Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars)
to baniſh a man each one out of his Province, is he not
then baniſhed the whole Kingdome of Ireland? and with
leſſe difficulty might this be done in England, where wee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17421:42"/>
have only two Provinces, &amp; two Archbiſhops, Canterbury,
and Yorke. And (I trow) it is no hard matter for two to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
But that which is moſt ſtrange, &amp; not to be believed,
were it not that it was done in the hearing of many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
&amp; in this Citty of Dublin againſt parties living, and who
at this day remaine in this Citty, (albeit I ſpare to name
them.) I ſay, ſo it was, &amp; will be juſtified that this preſent
Archbiſhop Friat <hi>Thomas Flemming</hi> aliàs <hi>Barnwell,</hi> did by
ſentence baniſh out of his Dioceſſe, men of the Clergy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them under Cenſures within 15. dayes to depart
the ſame: &amp; being demanded wherein they had offended, or
what they had committed deſerving ſuch puniſhment. He
anſwered, that he knew no hurt by them, but that he had no
uſe of them, slbeit verily he had uſe enough of them, had he
bin pleaſed to make uſe of them, for they were of the moſt
learned men of his Dioceſſe. And whom a vertuous Prelat
would have eſteemed as his own eyes, &amp; much leſſe have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
But ſo the times are, that learning, vertue, and good
breeding, are ſo farre from being ſtayres to honour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
as nothing can ſooner (with this Ordinary) work
his diſgrace, his dejection &amp; utter over-throw: well then,
the Archbiſhop ſtands ſtiffe in this doctrine: That he can <hi>ad
nutum, &amp; ad libitum,</hi> baniſh any Prieſt out of his diſtrict;
which doctrine were it true, what man (I pray you) would
take upon him the vocation of a Clergy-man, or of a Secular
Prieſt, knowing that ever after he muſt be a perpetuall ſlave
to humour his Ordinary, or elſe not to live in the Church:
for what one Biſhop can doe, another may doe. And a Prieſt
by this meanes may be baniſhed out of all Chriſtendome;
when as a Miller, or a Baker, or a Porter, will aske never a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
in the land leave ro dwell in his Dioceſſe. So much do
our ſacred Orders help us, as rather they help to undoe us?
Say, is not this to <hi>dominari in Clerum,</hi> to tyrannize over the
Clergy? Is not this to encroach upon Regall authority? Is
not this to confound all lawes both of Church &amp; Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?
Wherefore for my part I allow very well of that

dangerous Wolves of all other. I ſay, had theſe two points
bin well conſidered of, by our Paſtour, he doubtleſſe would
have bin more diligent &amp; frequent in his Sermons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
unto the people, as in perſwading them unto

very neceſſary) ſo in their faith confirming them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all tempeſts of perſecution which may ariſe. If happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

unto the poore, according to which miſſion from his
Heavenly Father, he did ſo attend his Office of Preaching (as
the Goſpell reports of him) That he travailed from Citty to
Citty, from place to place, preaching the Kingdome of God,
&amp; that not only in the Temple of God, but in the fields, in
the deſerts, in the mountaines, upon the ſea, in private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſitting at the table, walking upon the high-way, at all
times, &amp; in all occaſions remembring that he was ſent to
preach.</p>
               <p>So after him the Apoſtles, to whom Biſhops ſucceed, they
declare that this was their Office. The Apoſtle 1. Cor. 9. <hi>

<hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle; who frequented the Pulpit in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
yeeres, as witneſſeth S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the third Booke of
his Commentaryes upon the Epiſtie unto the Galathians.
And the ſame the 4. Councell of Carthage declared, teaching
that a Biſhop ſhould attend unto Prayer, to reading, &amp; to the
preaching of the Word of God. To which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,

It is a Biſhops part to thinke of the miniſtery of

were nothing elſe but Sermons preached unto the people.
And if the ſame obligation did not alwayes remaine; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this day in putting into their hands a Bible is it ſaid
in the Conſecration of Biſhops? <hi>Accipe Evangelium, vade,

the office of Preaching is the chiefe? <hi>Seſſ. 5. &amp;</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>But our Biſhop will happily ſay, That his talent is not in

though he be not able to preach and make a formall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
at leaſt, why (as occaſion offereth it ſelfe) doth he not
in ſome ſhort exhortations move the people to good life,
ſetting before their eyes the reward of vertue, &amp; the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of vice, as alſo its puniſhments: or at leaſt, why teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he not the Chriſtian doctrine, which in truth is the beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
of preaching, and moſt neceſſary in this kingdome of
all other, where ſuch ignorance raigneth among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, that if every haire of our heads, were preachers
or teachers of the Catechiſme, it were little enough? But and
if our Archbiſhop, bee not either able, or not willing to
preach, &amp; to feede his flocke, with the ſpirituall food of the
word, wherefore then did he condiſcend to accept of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricke,
knowing himſelfe ſo unmeet for the ſame? or
what account will he give up to the Prince of Sheepheards,
when it ſhall be required at his hands? Happily they may
have enough to doe, to anſwer for themſelves. He layes the
burden upon their neckes, they will ſay they were but aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
unto him: Now as that learned Cardinall ſaith, <hi>non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juvari

he) they will ſay, that at this time there be many preachers
of Gods word among religious Orders, true it is, but they
be called to be helpers to the Biſhops, not hinderers of that
which is their owne proper duty to performe. But verily

               </p>
               <p>I may remember ſince in England before the comming
in of the Regulars, all ſpirituall offices were performed unto
the Catholickes, by the Prieſts of the Clergy, of which
times it might be ſaid, in reſpect of the great concord and
unity which they enjoyed, as well the Prieſts among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as with the Laity. That <hi>terra erat unius labij.</hi> The
earth it was of one lippe &amp; language, and as it is ſaid in the
4. Act. of thoſe primitive times of the Church: <hi>Multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
credentium erat corunum, &amp; anima una,</hi> the multitude of
beleevers were all of one minde, &amp; of one will. But no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
came the Ignatians (for they were the firſt) and the
Monkes, &amp; the Friars after them, &amp; did grow to any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
&amp; ſtrength, but then came in the confuſion of Babell, &amp;
their tongues were ſo devided, as one ſpoke nothing but of
<hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp; another of <hi>Cephas,</hi> (not I confeſſe in diverſity of
doctrines) but in variety of affections: where the Ignatian
was in requeſt, the Prieſt was neglected; where the Monke
ruled the roaſt, there the Ignatian was diſreſpected; where
the Friar could prevaile, there neither one nor other was
regarded. Till at length rather upon a ſudden ſhuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling up,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17421:46"/>
then compoſing any ſtable peace, they joyned all in one
with united forces to oppoſe the Eccleſiaſticall Clergy, and
what tumults &amp; hurly-burlies have ever ſince bin on foot
among them, &amp; ſtill continues (I wis, <hi>non ad aedificationem,
ſed ad deſtructionem,</hi> not to edification, but to deſtruction)
the world can witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now in this Kingdome of Ireland what I have not onely
ſeene, but felt, it remaines further to declare. For about ſome
18. yeeres agoe, you may well remember with me, that the
Monkes &amp; the Friars being then but weake, &amp; (as it were)
in the cradle, the good Catholicke people were ruled both
in the divine office of the Church, as alſo in direction of
their conſciences wholly by the Prieſts of the Clergy their
Paſtours. Then was there ſuch devotion &amp; piety in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, ſuch frequenting the Sacraments, ſuch love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
neighbours, ſuch feare of offence and wrong doing,
as it might truly be ſaid of thoſe golden dayes:
<q>
                     <l>Flumina tum lactis, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m flumina nectaris ibant,</l>
                     <l>Flavaque de viridi ſtillabant illice mella.</l>
                  </q>
Then ſtreames of milke, then ſtreames of wine did flow,
Then on greene okes ſweet honey-combes did grow.</p>
               <p>Then the Friar made ſcruple to encroach in the ſmalleſt
matter upon the office of the Pariſh Prieſt, nay he was ſo
humble, ſo gentle, ſo recollected, &amp; ſo mortified, as truly you
would have taken him for a very gay creature; but this was
but in his infancy, &amp; during the time of his noneage; for by
too much petting &amp; cockering of him, &amp; that chiefly by the
Pariſh Prieſts themſelves in the beginning (not then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
whom they did foſter &amp; harbour in their boſomes,
or what rods they were in preparing for their owne ribs)
the Friar growing dayly to further acquaintance with the
Citizens, &amp; gathering unto himſelf continually more num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his fellowes, he began ſoon to goe upon his owne
legges, &amp; to perceive <hi>quod cornuta erat facies ejus,</hi> that his
face had two hornes, with which he began bravely to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, A Paſtour when he pleaſeth, a Regular when hee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17421:46"/>
pleaſeth, a voluntary when he liſt, a preſſed ſouldier when
he liſt, an aſſiſtant when he thinkes good, and a principall
when he will. So as now down muſt the Oke, &amp; up muſt the
Bryar, under whoſe protection the ſheep betaking himſelfe
for ſhelter and protection in every ſtorme, his fleece ſhall be
well pulled, &amp; his skin ſurely ſcratched for his paines, as we
dayly ſee, &amp; in part already have ſet downe. But the Preſſe
calls ſo faſt upon me, as I can hardly with equall paces keep
company with it, &amp; therefore muſt ſpare further to enlarge
my ſelf upon this argument. Onely I will conclude it with
the ſaying of that holy &amp; learned Prelat <hi>Peter Camus,</hi> Biſhop
of Bellay in his <hi>Petronilla: That it is an admirable thing to ſee,
that ſuch as governe the people, will not take charge of them, &amp;
ſuch as have charge of them, &amp; are anſwerablo for them, can not
have the government of them.</hi> So he. Which obſervation of
his agrees with what a principall Friar of his Order lately
ſaid in this Citty, &amp; that in the hearing of many, That for
their parts they ſcorned to bee Pariſh Prieſts or Paſtours.
According to the doctrine which Friar <hi>Thomas Strong,</hi> a
Franciſcan, layde downe in his Manuſcript intituled an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
unto the fraternall correction of <hi>Paulus Veridicus Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
in which he compares the Superiours of Regulars unto
Sheep-heards, and the Pariſh Prieſts unto Swine-heards, &amp;
conſequently the Laity to Pigs &amp; hogs. This writing of his
is this day in my cuſtody, under his own hand, which I am
ready to impart to any who make doubt of the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
O S. <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Paul!</hi> yea, O S. <hi>Francis!</hi> How baſe and
contemptible is that holy office of Pariſh Prieſts in thy Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
eyes at this day, who now beare themſelves as the only
Maſters in Iſrael, and would be accounted the ſole pillars of
Gods Church. So much then for the firſt office of a Paſtour
in the diſpenſation of the Word and Sacraments, together
with ſome digreſſions (I confeſſe) in which how defective
our Ordinary hath beene, in part is declared.</p>

               <p>To which Petition no anſwer was ever yet given, neither
doe we expect that any ever will be given, but rather we
feare that this canker hath alſo poſſeſſed the head. And the
rather for that we underſtand, that theſe errours doe more
&amp; more ſpread themſelves thorough the bowels of this
Kingdome: and by name that there is another Carmelite,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17421:48"/>
called <hi>Patrick Donavan,</hi> native of the County of Corke, who
perſevers to teach the aforeſaid errors and blaſphemyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people, to the great ſcandall of all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
And forſomuch as we can not find that any Friars do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves either by word or writing, to theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
pernicious doctrines, but only the Prieſts of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
Therfore it may well be inferred, that all the Regulars of
this Kingdome are infected with the ſame leproſie, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in time (if it be not already paſt time) to be ſeparated
from the reſt of the body. The dayes were when <hi>Celeſtius,</hi>

though cloked with truth; by this means they will not only
abandon their rule inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt againſt their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but will alſo ruine, &amp; alter the purity therof,
changing the good intention into perverſe, and being armed
by meanes of the ſaid priviledge, againſt obedience, againſt
other Religious, and againſt all the Clergy, when they ſhall
expect to get the victory, the wretches ſhall find themſelves
falne into the trench which themſelves ſhall have made, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
no other fruite of their Seminary, but ſcandals;
which they ſhall offer to God in ſteed of the ſalvation of
ſoules, who ſeeing the ſame, ſhall be no more hence forward
their Paſtour, but their ruiner, according unto their merits.
And therefore he will leave them entangled in the nets of
Avarice, and their vaine deſires, &amp;c. So S. <hi>Francis</hi> in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Chronicle, printed &amp; publiſhed by his own Friars.</p>
               <p>And who can make queſtion, but thoſe times foretold by
S. <hi>Francis,</hi> are now come, &amp; that his prophecy in all points
is fullfilled! And firſt for the praevarication of his Rule, in
receiving of all ſorts of money, we ſee it dayly practiſed by
his owne Friats, in taking of Gold &amp; Silver, &amp; that as freely
as any worldlings, alwayes provided, that they touch it not
with their bare hands: but alas! what pennance or mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is that? when as they may admit of it in a hander-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
a glove, or lapped in a browne paper? for being given
them in that manner, the Capuchin himſelfe (who profeſſeth
moſt ſtrictly to obſerve the Rule of S. <hi>Francis</hi>) will moſt
gently accept of it, &amp; place it in his pocket. But ſhall wee
thinke that S. <hi>Francis</hi> (ſo holy a man) had no deeper a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
in prohibiting his Friars ſo earneſtly, and with ſo
many words in that his ſhort Rule, neither to aſke, nor in

that they ſhould not handle the ſame? But that you may the

               <p>That the Friars ſhall not receive money.</p>
               <p>I doe commaund firmely all the brethren, that by no
meanes they receive pence, or money, neither by themſelves
nor by another perſon; Yet for the neceſſity of the ſicke, and
for the cloathing of the Friars, by their ſpirituall friends,
onely the Superiours, and Guardians, ſhall have great care of
them, according to places, and times, and cold Regions, as
they ſhall ſee it to be neceſſary. This alwayes remembred,
that (as it is ſaid) they receive no pence or money.</p>
               <p>And this is one of thoſe 7. formall precepts, which they

them as you ſee, neither by themſelves, nor by any other
perſon, to receive any moneyes: Which precept now for a

your owne Tradition. This precept (as S. <hi>Francis</hi> hath left
written,) was commaunded by Ieſus Chriſt, and vowed by
his Friars, &amp; yet in the ſight of all mens eyes violated. Nay,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17421:50"/>
that our Mendicant Friars may make it knowne unto the
world, that they are <hi>veri philargiri,</hi> true lovers of money,
they every yeare ſell and turne into coyne, many flockes of
Sheepe, Hoggs, Geeſe, Turkies, Hens, Cheeſe, Egges; which

becauſe their legiſlatours &amp; inſtituters (moſt holy men)
would therefore have them poore, &amp; altogether free from the

aſtray, they have in ſuch ſort ſtayned that their profeſſion of
truth, by their unhappy living, that in theſe dayes in every

               <p>But alas, why ſhould I looke behind me unto the times of
yore, will not theſe our dayes, &amp; this poore countrey yeeld us
palpable examples of the Covetouſnes of Friars, not to ſpeak
of their other vices? Somthing I have ſpoken before of their
two ploughes of Begging Cap. 1. the one by retayle, the other
by groſſe. Now I wil ſpeak a word or two of other 2 ploughs
of theirs, no leſſe working then the former. The firſt, of their
Novices which they receive into their Order. The ſecond of
their cord, habit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the men Novices. It is well knowne that the
Friar will admit of none among them, but ſuch as either bring
them in good portions, or elſe ſuch as they gueſſe will prove
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> out Beggars, to recompence in their induſtry what they are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17421:52"/>
wanting in meanes. So as what patrimony a father would
leave his ſon, either upon his preferment, or at his death, that
the Friar will have, he will not abate a ſmulkin. If the Father
ſtumble at it, he ſhall be terryfied with matter of conſcience,
as, Is not God Almighty worthy to have as much as the
world? &amp;c. or elſe with the authority of the Biſhop of the
Dioceſſe, eſpecially if that Biſhop be a Friar. And doe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what he can, he ſhall both part with his Son, &amp; his mony.</p>
               <p>As for their vowed Nunnes, they bring with them 700. or
500. &amp; at the loweſt rate 300. or 200. &amp; 50. pounds ſterling, &amp;
yet if they live in ſuch pennance, &amp; auſterity, as the Friars per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us, ſurely they cannot ſpend by the powle, <hi>omnibus vijs,
&amp; modis,</hi> 10. pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding all
theſe marriage goods, (for ſo they call them) thoſe virgins
have their agents, who begge in the country for them, to bring
them in almes, for it is a rule with our Nunnes, as well as with
the Friars. Want, or want not, begge they muſt, beſides what
gifts the friends of thoſe ſo rich maides, &amp; ſo well deſcended,
doe dayly preſent them withall. Now if a maide who is poore
&amp; hath no portion, or meanes at all, ſhould offer her ſelfe unto
their Nunneryes, were ſhe as devout as <hi>Anna</hi> the daughter of
<hi>Phanuel,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that ſhe never departed from the
Temple ſerving God, night &amp; day in prayer &amp; faſting. Luke. 2.

Virgins, with <hi>neſcio vos,</hi> I know you not.</p>
               <p>Another plough of our Mendicants, I will not ſay the laſt,
(for they better know then I, how many they have) is the cord
or the Scapulare, or the Girdle, or the Breads of S. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> or
the Rofary, as alſo the habite of their Orders, which brings no
ſmall profit unto them. For by ſuch indulgences, graces and
pardons, annexed unto them, there is procured unto the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants,
infinite calmes and perpetuall Benefactours. For the
people generally, whether thorough their ignorance, or miſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
I know not, ſeeme much more at this day to ſtand in
feare of Purgatory, then of hell it ſelfe. And they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17421:53"/>
that theſe things, together with their almes unto the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
will ſave them from the flames of Purgatory. So as who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them now is ſo hard hearted, as in his life time is not

                  </gap> their deathes is not buried in a Friars
habit? which habit if of your ſelfe you ſhall have no devotion
to deſire, the Friar will take occaſion to viſite you in your
ſickeneſſe, &amp; although it be but 5. minutes before you deceaſe,
he will offer you to be buried in his habit; If you thanke him
it is enough, it is taken for acceptation, albeit you ſay neither
yea, nor no. On goes the habit ſo ſoone as the life hath left
you, &amp; ſo you are expoſed till buriall, that all your neighbours
may behold you. The great devotion of the party unto the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whoſe habite he tooke, is much advanced, his ſalvation is
no whit doubted of, &amp;c. Now you muſt conceive by all meanes
that this habit is given you <hi>gratis,</hi> that is, of free coſt, for elſe
it were Simony, but yet I truſt the friends of the party are not
ſo unmannerly, but by all recknings be ended, they might as
cheape have bought a piece of frize of an hundred yards. You
know what <hi>Martiall</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pauperum dona hami ſunt, Cum
dant, tum maxime petunt.</hi> Poore mens gifts are hookes, when
they give, then moſt of all they crave, &amp; who poorer then the
Friar, though little pinched with want. For they know well
to diſtinguiſh, <hi>inter pauper tatem &amp; indigentiam,</hi> twixt poverty
&amp; want, the firſt indeed they profeſſe, but the ſecond is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the compaſſe of their vowes, they leave that for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
And therefore <hi>Iohannes Ruſbrochius</hi> himſelfe a Monke,
ſpeaking of the Friar Mendicants of theſe times, in his booke

verily in theſe parts it ſhall be much againſt the Friars humour
to travell two miles out of Towne, not mounted upon an eaſie

are of opinion, that the world would be ſcandalized to ſee
them goe on foot. Well then let us leave the Friar on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
and returne we a little backe to our purpoſe of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,

               <p>Were then our Friars really ſo charitable, &amp; ſo liberall in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing

themſelves unto the rich &amp; to the great ones, and not unto the
poore, for ſurely our chriſtian faith teacheth us that the poore
have ſoules as well as the rich. And who can otherwiſe judge,

the place, clayming not onely the honour of the funerall rites,
&amp; ceremonies, to be performed by themſelves, but challenging
all dutyes, offerings, and almes thereunto belonging. And here
I may not forget what a late preſident of the Parliament of
Aix in France, hath left written of the ambition of our Friars
Minors in ſuch occaſions. I will give you his words.</p>
               <p>Fratres S. Franciſci qui ſe appellant Minores; ut nomen conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
rei, debent eſſe minori loco, ideò tanquam humiliores, quia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores
non debent praetendere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra aliquos de aliqua praecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Friars of S. <hi>Francis</hi> Order, who call themſelves Minors,
as much as to ſay, the leſſer; that their name may be agreeable
unto the thing, they ought to be in a lower place, as more
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, for that the leſſer ought never to pretend for preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of place againſt any. Becauſe in doing otherwiſe they ſhould
ſeem to go againſt their own Order, &amp; eſtate, which is to be the
leſſer of all eſtates &amp; Orders of the whole Vniverſall Church;
nay, which is more, ſince a certain time, they would have the
name of <hi>minimi,</hi> that is, the loweſt of all other, by vertue of a
certain reformation. But I ſee that all this is but in word, not
in deed. For that they will not only contend for equality with
other Religious, but alſo with the Cathedrall Church: As I
have ſeene in the Funerals of a certaine Noble &amp; potent man,
<hi>Francis Rollin:</hi> who for one onely houre was depoſitated in
their Church; &amp; in carrying of the Corps, they would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be in the laſt place before the Canons of the Cathedrall
Church; but their Guardian ſaid, That he ought to have the
laſt place, yea after the Biſhop himſelf then in place. Which
how ridiculous it was, &amp; ought to be, let all imagin. By which
it may be ſeen what may be ſaid of them, who when as they
ought in all humility to ſtrive with the loweſt, yet will they
contend for equality with the higheſt. Wherefore their pride
can not more rightly be compared to any thing, then to the
pride of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who would be like unto the moſt High. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomaeus

               <p>Thus (gentle Reader) I have given theea touch of thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
doctrines taught by our Friars, tending to the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17421:54"/>
of that great benefit of our ſalvation in Chriſt. I have
ſhewed how farre our Archbiſhop, with all the reſt of his Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
are intereſſed therein. Moreover, both out of grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
&amp; lamentable experience of theſe times, I have diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of thoſe manifold and manifeſt enormityes of the Friar
Mendicants, &amp; more particularly of this Country: Their Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
Lying, Ambition, &amp; Hypocriſie. Neither have publiſhed
the ſecret faults of any. God forbid I ſhould. It is not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chriſtian charity, but humanity, ſo to do. If any ſay, It is
not my part to handle theſe matters, &amp; it concernes me not? I

<hi>Cadell</hi> &amp; my ſelfe to publiſh in Print our late
Appeale unto the See Apoſtolicke, from the
<hi>gravamina</hi> or agrievances of the Archbiſhop,
&amp; the rather, for that the Friars, &amp; thoſe of his
faction (as it is ſaid) take great exceptions thereunto.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt then in defence of the aforeſaid printed Appeale; I
anſwere, That there is nothing therein publiſhed unto the
world, which was not publicke before, either <hi>de Iure,</hi> or <hi>de

Now to make a thing more publick, which is already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

publication.</p>
               <p>If you ſay; But thoſe foule exceſſes laide unto the charge of
the Archbiſhop, ought at leaſt to have bin concealed from the
Proteſtants. I anſwer, (as in part I have done before in my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
unto the Reader) That as among us a mixt people, the
manifeſt faults &amp; exceſſes of Proteſtants, cannot be concealed
from the Catholicks: No more is it poſſible, that the manifeſt
faults &amp; exceſſes of our Catholicks can any wiſe be hidden
from the Proteſtants, of which nature &amp; quality are thoſe 8.
aggrievances, which we layde down in our late Appeale.</p>
               <p>Beſides, who ſeeth not, that it is the delinquents the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves,
who firſt manifeſt &amp; make publick their own diſorders, &amp; by
ſuch manifeſtation they come to be known of others, who in
their own juſt defence may make uſe therof, by way of juſtice,
to haue the ſame reformed or corrected: how els could it be
lawfull to bring any perſon in queſtion, upon crimes in courts
&amp; Tribunals? And how comes it to paſſe, that we have both
heard 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> read of Prelats, not only excommunicated, or ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but ſomtimes depoſed for Hereſie, Schiſme, Simony, &amp;c.
I ſay, If their own faults might not be further publiſhed.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly in defence of Printing our Appeale, I ſay, that
an Appeale is a juridicall inſtrument, of his owne nature, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
publicity no leſſe then all other court pleadings, as
Bills, Anſwers, Orders, Sentences, Iudgements, Executions, &amp;
the like: All which proceſſes of publicke courts, may be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
through the world, either by pen, or Preſſe.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly we committed that our Appeale, the rather unto
the Preſſe, for that we ſuſpected our Ordinary would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it at our hands, having often before denyed to receive any
letter, or Petition, from ſuch ſuiters as deſired juſtice of him, &amp;
ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> it came to paſſe. For firſt perſonally, &amp; in pen hand,
we preſented this ſelfe ſame Appeale unto our Ordinary, Iune
21. an. 1632. who refuſed to receive it of us. Wherefore that it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17421:55"/>
might be ſufficiently knowne that we did. Appeale from his
manifold tyrannies, to a higher Tribunall, which benefit of the
canon, for that he both hath &amp; doth continually ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of, and debarre us of all audience, we held it neceſſary
(and as by our learned councell we were adviſed) to notifie
his manifold and manifeſt injuſtice: <hi>omnibus Chri. fidelibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, None can Appeale from the court of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to a higher Tribunall, but of neceſſity he muſt lay downe
the cauſes &amp; grounds, why he declines the judgement of his
Ordinary, otherwiſe his Appeale is not onely voyde in law,
but he is puniſhable for the ſame. See 2. <hi>q. 6. cap. Quicun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;
cap. emaino, de appellationibus in 6. &amp; ibi, gloſſam. Item Sayrus de
eenſ. lib. 12. cap. 17. num.</hi> 34. with many Doctours by him cited:
So then thoſe 8. Gravamina layd downe in our Appeale, being
the cauſes why we declined his juriſdiction, wee could not
omit the ſame.</p>
               <p>5. Our fift reaſon is <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> as thus: Our Ordinary <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Flemming,</hi> aliàs <hi>Barnewell,</hi> thinking good to prohibit the
people our Maſſes, under Excommunication, he layes downe
for his ground, our diſobedience &amp; continuall inſolency, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of amendment, &amp;c. as may appeare by the firſt lines
of his cenſure prefixed unto this work (which cauſes althogh
above at large are proved to be meerly his owne inventions)
yet true or falſe, he made no ſcruple to publiſh them in open
Auditories &amp; aſſemblies, when the greateſt concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might be had, to our great diſgrace, ſhame, and infamy (as
much as in him was.) If this (I ſay) was lawfull for him to do
againſt us in matters ſo falſe (as we dayly challenge him to the
proofe of them) may not we doe the like in our juſt defence,
in his moſt notorious crimes, to which every day we offer our
ſelves to the tryall and touchſtone of proofe, before any Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
which is pleaſed to take knowledge thereof?</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly, our Archbiſhops faction dayly writes, and prints
againſt us of the Clergy, witneſſe that infamous Libell, called
<hi>Examen juridicum cenſurae Pariſienſis,</hi> under the ſaigned name
of <hi>Edmundus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulanus,</hi> not onely ſcoſfing the R. Biſhops of
France, with all the moſt learned Doctours of Sorbon, &amp; that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17421:56"/>
famous Vniverſity of Paris, in moſt baſe &amp; contumelious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
traducing them: but alſo charging five R. Prieſts of this
Iriſh Nation (&amp; that by name) with lewd aſperſions, of which
himſelfe dare neither give his name (by which he may be
knowne) nor ſhew his head to the juſtification. Nay, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to blemiſh the fame of the moſt Ill: Archbiſhop of Paris,
being himſelfe (as is confeſſed by his owne faction) a Friar
Minor, (but more they neither will, nor dare give us of him,)
which libelling Pamphlet of that Friar, is in ſuch high eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with our Archbiſhop, as it is made his only <hi>Vade mecum:</hi>
may not we then in defence of our good names, print what
we are daily provided to juſtifie, firming it with our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
names, by which every houre we may be knowne &amp; chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged,
as we did that our aforeſaid Appeale, to ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as we did communicate the ſame unto? And as I my ſelf
the Author of this Book <hi>Paul Harris,</hi> do ſubſcribe my name
with mine own hand, offering my ſelfe to the juſtification of
every word &amp; ſyllable therein contained.</p>
               <p>The next worke (gentle, judicious, &amp; impartiall Reader)
which thou mayeſt expect at my hands, is a full refutation of
thoſe moſt impious &amp; blaſphemous doctrines of the Friars,
above-mentioned in Cap. 4. As alſo a compendions Treatiſe of
the 6. Excommunications, 2. Exiles, 2. Suſpenſions, publiſhed

motives, &amp; ſubjects of them all. And ſo ſubmitting my ſelf
&amp; all my writings, to the cenſures of the See Apoſtolick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
Almighty God of his infinit goodnes and mercy, to
grant us his grace, ro live and dye his ſervants. I heere end.</p>
