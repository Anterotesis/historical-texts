            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter Declaratorie,
To the Diſturbers of the Peace
OF THE
County of KENT:</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Occaſioned by a Petition tending to an Accommodation,</hi>
Subſcribed by twenty ſeven thouſand three hundred ſeventy three Hands.</head>
            <p>OBſerving with what diligence and expedition, Parties are
drawne together, armed, and by whom: we cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to what end? The Country is quiet, and deſires ſo to
continue: Our Intereſt is peace, not rapine and bloodſhed: yet are
we alſo reſolved, not to fall tame ſacrifices to the ſpirit of ſlumber
and deluſion, and render up our Religions, Lawes, lives and fortunes,
upon ſuch cold conditions.</p>
            <p>We muſt crave leave to tell you, that a Petition, concluded on, and
avowed by the Univerſality of this County, repreſenting their honeſt
deſires, in a modeſt way, to the two Houſes of Parliament, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the practice, nay the approbation of this preſent Parliament;
—That this Petition is by the moſt active in this new commotion,
diſcountenanced and menaced, which makes us reaſonably ſuſpect,
whither thoſe deſignes may tend, whereof they have the ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
Our addreſſes are to the Parliament, not you, and from them
we ſhall await a ſeaſonable Returne; our deſires being of a moment
above your cognizance. That we labour for is peace; and in a
peaceable manner: Nor can we without horrour think of a freſh
imbroylement.</p>
            <p>The Petition we do all owne, affirming the ſcope thereof ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that we dare deliver it up to heaven with our ſoules; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to do, if thereunto reduced by any troubleſome interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till the great Councell of the Kingdome (to whom onely and
properly it referres) ſhall adviſe upon it. Wherefore, to avoid the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of jealouſies, (the fountaine of this late warre) we deſire alſo
the cauſes may be removed, leſt introductive to another.</p>
            <p>When you have ſatisfied this ſcruple, you have obliged your
friends.</p>
