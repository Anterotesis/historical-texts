            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RIght Honorable, hauing by chaunce reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of late into my handes (after I had once lost the same) a copie of the Discourse of our late VVest Indian voyage, vvhich vvas begun by Captaine Bigges, vvho en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his life in the said voyage after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Cartagena, the same being aftervvardes finished (as I thinke) by his Lieutenant Maister Croftes, or some other, I knovve not vvell vvho. Novve finding therein a most true report of the seruices and other matters vvhich happened in the sayd voyage, the sight vvhereof is vvonderfully desired by manie honest and vvell disposed persons. I haue presumed to recommend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing thereof, vnto your Lordships protection and fauour, for these tvvo causes. The one, for that your Lordships Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disposition is in the knovvledge of all men that knovv your selfe most thirstingly affected to embrace in your ovvne person,
<pb facs="tcp:4858:4"/>
the brauest enterprises, if the time vvould once affoord anie such fit occasion, as might be agreeable to her Maiesties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: vvho vvisely (and long may she do it) gouerneth all things to the greatest aduantage of her selfe and people. The other, because my selfe hauing bene a member in the sayd actions, and vvas Lieutenant of Maister Carleils ovvne companie, vvhereby I can vvell assure the truth of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: I thought it my bounden duetie, hauing professed my seruice to your Lordship before all men, to dedicate the same rather vnto your Lordship then to anie other. And although it be novve a yeare and a halfe sithence the voyage ended, vvhereby some man vvill say, that it is novve no nevve matter: yet the present time considered, hovv doubtfull some of our meaner sort of people are of the Spanish preparations, I thinke this Discourse a very fit thing to be published, that they may see vvhat great victories a fevve English men haue made vpon great numbers of the Spaniardes, euen at home in their ovvne countreyes. The beholding vvhereof vvill much encourage those, vvho by fame and bare vvordes are made to doubt much more then there is cause vvhy they should. Vpon vvhich point, as there may be much sayd: so my selfe being no Discourser, do desire to be held excused therein: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe onely commend the trueth of this report vnto your Lordship: vvhich vvill be also auovved by diuers Captaines that vvere in the sayd voyage. And so in all humblenesse do take my leaue, readie to do your Lordship all faithfull seruice.</p>

               </gap>e, we had the winde for a few daies somewhat skant, and sometimes calme. And being ariued neere that part of the coast of Spaine,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4858:6"/>
which is called the Mores, we happened to espie diuerse sailes, which kept their course close by the shore, the weather being faire and calme. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall caused the Vizeadmirall to goe with the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces well manned to see what they were, who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon sight of the said pinnaces approching nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, abandonned for the most parte all their shippes (being Frenchmen) laden all with salt, and bounde homewardes into France, amongst which ships (being all but of small burden) there was one so well liked, which also had no man in her, as being brought vnto the Generall, he thought good to make stay of her for the seruice, meaning to pay for her, as was accordingly performed at our returne, which barke was called the Drake. The rest of these ships being eight or nine, were dismissed without any thing at all taken from them. VVe being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put somewhat further off from the shore, by the contrarietie of winde, we happened to meete with some other French ships, full laden with New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land fish, being vpon their returne homeward from the said New found land: whom the Generall after some speech had with them, and seeing plainly that they were Frenchmen, dismissed without once suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any man to go aboord of them.</p>
            <p>The day following standing in with the shore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, we discried an other tall ship of twelue score
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4858:6"/>
tunnes or thereabouts, vpon whom Maister Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leill the Lieutenant generall being in the Tiger, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the chase, whom also anone after the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall followed, and the Tiger hauing caused the said strange ship to strike her sailes, kept her there without suffering any bodie to go aboord vntill the Admirall was come vp: who foorthwith sending for the Maister, and diuerse others of their principall men, and causing them to be seuerally examined, founde the ship and goodes to be belonging to the inhabitants of S. SEBASTIAN in Spaine, but the marriners to be for the most parte belonging to S. Iohn de LVCE &amp; the passage. In this ship was great store of drie Newland fish, commonly called with vs Poore Iohn, wherof afterwards being thus found a lawfull prize, there was distribution made into all the ships of the Fleete, the same being so newe and good, as it did very greatly bestead vs in the whole course of our voyage. A day or two after the taking of this ship, we put in with the Isles of BAYON, for lacke of fauourable wind, where we had no sooner anckered some part of the Fleete, but the Generall commaunded all the Pinnaces with the ship boates to be manned, and euerie man to be furnished with such armes as was needefull for that present seruice, which being done, the Generall put him selfe into his Galley, which was also well furnished, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

towards the Citie of BAYON, with intent, &amp; the fauour of the Almighty to surprise it. Before we had aduaunced one halfe league of our way, there came a messenger being an English Marchant from the Gouernour, to see what straunge Fleete we were, who came to our Generall, and conferred a while with him, and after a small time spent, our Generall called for Captaine Sampson, and willed him to go to the Gouernour of the Citie, to resolue him of two pointes. The first, to knowe if there were any warres betweene Spaine and England. The second why our Marchants with their goods were imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or arrested. Thus departed Captaine Sampson with the said messenger to the citie, where he found the Gouernour and people much amazed of such a sudden accident.</p>
            <p>The Generall with the aduise and counsell of Maister Carleill his Lieutenant generall, who was in the galley with him, thought not good to make any stand, till such time as they were within shot of the Citie, where they might be readie vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of Captaine Sampson, to make a sudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt if cause did require before it was darke.</p>
            <p>Captaine Sampson returned with his message in this sort. First, touching peace or warres, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour sayd he knew of no warres, and that it lay not in him to make any, he being so meane a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4858:7"/>
as he was. And as for the stay of the Marchants with their goods, it was the kings pleasure, but not with intent to endommage any man. And that the kings conter commandement was (which had bene receaued in that place some seauennight before) that English Marchants with their goods should be discharged: for the more verifying whereof, he sent such Marchants as were in the towne of our Nation, who traffiqued those parts: which being at large declared to our Generall by them, counsell was taken what might best be done. And for that the night approched, it was thought needefull to land our force, which was done in the shutting vp of the day, &amp; hauing quartered our selues to our most aduantage, with sufficient gard vpon euery straight, we thought to rest our selues for that night there. The Gouernour sent vs some refreshing, as bread, wine, oyle, apples, grapes, marmalad and such like. About midnight the weather beginnes to ouercast, insomuch that it was thought meeter to repaire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, then to make any longer abode on land, and before we could recouer the Fleete, a great tempest arose, which caused many of our ships to driue from their ancker hold, and some were forced to sea in great perill, as the barke Talbot, the barke Hawkins and the Speedewell, which Speedewell onely was driuen into England, the others recouered vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4858:8"/>
the extremity of the storme lasted three daies, which no sooner beganne to asswage, but Maister Carleill our Lieutenant generall, was sent with his owne ship and three others: as also with the galley and with diuers Pinnaces, to see what he might do aboue VIGO, where he toke many boats and some Caruels, diuersly laden with things of small value, but chiefly with houshold stuffe, running into the high countrey, and amongst the rest, he found one boate laden with the principall Church stuffe of the high Church of VIGO, where also was their great Crosse of siluer, of very faire embossed worke, and double gilt all ouer, hauing cost them a great masse of money. They complained to haue lost in all kind of goods aboue thirtie thowsand Duckets in this place.</p>
            <p>The next day the General with his whole Fleete went vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iles of BAYON, to a very good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour aboue VIGO, where Maister Carleill stayd his comming, aswell for the more quiet riding of his ships, as also for the good commoditie of fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, which the place there did afoord full well. In the meane time the Gouernour of GALLISIA had reared such forces as he might, his numbers by esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate were some two thowsand foot, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horse, &amp; marched from BAYON to this part of the countrey, which lay in sight of our Fleete, where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4858:8"/>
making stand, he sent to parle with our Generall, which was graunted by our Generall, so it might be in boates vpon the water: and for safetie of their persons, there were pledges deliuered on both sides, which done, the Gouernour of GALLISIA put him selfe with two others into our Vize-Admirals Skiffe, the same hauing bene sent to the shore for him: And in like sort our General in his own Skiffe, where by them it was agreed, we should furnish our selues with fresh water, to be taken by our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quietly on the land, and haue all other such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, paying for the same, as the place would affoorde.</p>
            <p>VVhen all our businesse was ended, we departed, &amp; toke our way by the Islands of CANARIA, which are esteemed some three hundred leagues from this part of Spain, &amp; falling purposely with PALMA, with intention to haue taken our pleasure of that place, for the full digesting of many things into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the better furnishing our store with such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall good things as that affoordeth very abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, we were forced by the vile sea gate, which at that present fell out, and by the naughtinesse of the landing place, being but one, and that vnder the fauor of many Platformes, well furnished with great ordinance, to depart with the receipt of many their Canon shot, some into our ships, and some besides,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4858:9"/>
some of them being in very deede full Canon high. But the onely or chiefe mischiefe, was the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous sea surge, which at shore all alongest, plainly threatned the ouerthrow of as many Pinnaces and boates, as for that time should haue attempted any landing at all.</p>
            <p>Now seeing the expectation of this attempt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the causes aforesaid, we thought it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fal with the Isle FERRO, to see if we could find any better fortune, and comming to the Island, we landed a thousand men in a valley vnder a high mountaine, where we stayed some two or three houres, in which time the inhabitants, accompanied with a yong fellow borne in England, who dwelt there with them, came vnto vs, shewing their state to be so poore, that they were all readie to starue, which was not vntrue: and therefore without any thing gotten, we were all commaunded presently to imbarke, so as that night we put off to sea South Southeast along towards the coast of Barbarie.</p>
            <p>Vpon Saterday in the morning, being the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Nouember, we fell with Cape Blancke, which is a low land &amp; shallow water, where we cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched store of fish, &amp; doubling the Cape, we put into the Bay, where we found certain Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ships of war, whom we entertained with great curtesie, and there left them. The after noone the whole Fleete assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4858:9"/>
which was a litle scattered about their fishing, &amp; put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to the Isles of Cape Verde, sayling till the sixteenth of the same moneth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, on which day we descried the Island of S. IAGO, and in the euening we anckered the Fleet betwene the towne called the PLAY or PRAY and S. IAGO, where we put on shore a thousand men or more, vnder the leading of Maister Christopher Carleill Lieutenant Generall, who directed the seruice most like a wise commaunder. The place where we had first to march did affoord no good order, for the ground was mountaines and full of dales, being a maruellous stonie &amp; troublesome passage, but such was his industrious disposition, as he would neuer leaue, vntil we had gotten vp to a faire plaine, where we made stand for the assembling of the Army. And when we were all gathered together vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plaine, some two litle miles from the towne, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall thought good not to make attempt till day light: because there was not one that could serue for guide or giuing knowledge at all of the place. And therefore after hauing well rested, euen halfe an houre before day, he commanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be deuided into three speciall parts, such as he appointed, whereas before we had marched by seuerall companies, being thereunto forced by the naughtinesse of the way as is aforesayd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:4858:10"/>Now by the time we were thus raunged into a very braue order day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light began to appeare, and being aduaunced hard to the wall, we sawe no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to resist, whereupon the Leiutenant generall appointed Captaine Sampson with thirtie shot, &amp; Captaine Barton with other thirtie, to goe downe into the towne which stood in the valey vnder vs, and might verie plainely be veiwed all ouer from that place where the whole Army was now arriued &amp; presently after these Captaines was sent the great Ensigne, which had nothing in it but the plaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Crosse, to be placed towardes the sea, that our fleet might see Saint Georges Crosse florish in the enemies fortresse. Order was giuen that all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance througout the towne and vpon all the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, which was aboue fifty peeces all ready char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, should be shot of in honor of the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties coronation day, being the seuententh of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, after the yearly custome of England, which was so answered againe by the ordinance out of all the ships in the fleete which now was come neere, as it was straunge to heare such a thondering noise last so long to gether. In this meane while the Leiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt generall held still the most part of his force on the hill top, till such time as the towne was quartered out for the lodging of the whole armie, which being done euerie Captaine toke his owne

Somewhat aboue the towne on the North side betweene the two mountaines, the valley wageth somewhat larger then at the townes end, which val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley is wholie conuerted into gardens and orchards well replenished with diuers sorts of fruicts, herbes &amp; trees, as lymmons, orenges, suger canes, cochars or cochos nuts, plantens, potato roots, cocombers, small and round onions, garlicke, and some other things not now remembred, amongst which the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos nuts and plantens are very pleasant fruicts, the sayd cochos hauing a hard shell and a greene huske ouer it, as hath our walnut, but it farre exceedeth in greatnesse, for this cochos in this greene huske is bigger then any mans two fistes, of the hard shell many drinking cups are made here in England, and set in siluer as I haue often seene.</p>
            <p>Next within this hard shell is a white rine resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in shew very much euen as any thing may do, to the white of an egge when it is hard boyled. And within this white of the nut lyeth a water, which is whitish and very cleere, to the quantitie of halfe a pint or thereabouts, which water and white rine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of, are both of a very coole fresh taste, and as pleasing as anything may be. I haue heard some hold opinion, that it is very restoratiue.</p>
            <p>The Planten groweth in cods, somewhat like to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4858:14"/>
beanes, but is bigger and longer, and much more thicke together on the stalke, and when it waxeth ripe, the meate which filleth the rine of the cod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth yellow, and is exceeding sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.</p>
            <p>In this time of our being there, hapned to come a Portingall to the VVestermost fort, with a flag of truce, to whom Captaine Sampson was sent with Captaine Goring, who comming to the sayd Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, he first asked them what nation they were, they aunswered Englishmen, he then required to know if warres were betweene England &amp; Spaine, to which they answered that they knew not, but if he would go to their Generall he could best resolue him of such particulars, and for his assurance of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and repassage, these Captaines made offer to ingage their credits, which he refused for that he was not sent from his Gouernor. Then they tolde him, if his Gouernor did desire to take a course for the common benefit of the people and contrie, his best way were to come &amp; present himselfe vnto our Noble and merciful Gouernor Sir Frances Drake: whereby he might be assured to finde fauour, both for him selfe and the inhabitants. Otherwise within three daies we should march ouer the land, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume with fire all inhabited places, and put to the sworde all such liuing soules as we should chaunce
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4858:15"/>
vpon: so thus much he tooke for the conclusion of his answer, and departing, he promised to returne the next day, but we neuer heard more of him.</p>
            <p>Vpon the foure and twentieth of Nouember, the Generall accompanied with the Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and six hundred men, marched foorth to a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage twelue miles within the lande, called S. DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINGO, where the Gouernor and the Bishop with all the better sort were lodged, and by eight of the clocke we came to it, finding the place abandoned, &amp; the people fled into the mountaines: so we made stande a while to ease our selues, and partly to see if any would come to speake to vs. After we had well rested our selues, the Generall commaunded the troupes to march away homewardes, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the enemy shewed them selues, both horse &amp; foote, though not such force as durst encounter vs: and so in passing some time at the gase with them, it waxed late and towards night, before we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer home to S. IAGO.</p>
            <p>On Munday the six &amp; twentieth of Nouember, the Generall commanded all the Pinnaces with the boates, to vse all diligence to imbarke the Armie into such ships as euery man belonged. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall in like sort commaunded Captaine Goring and Lieutenant Tucker, with one hundred shot to make a stand in the market place, vntill our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4858:15"/>
forces were wholly imbarked, the Vizeadmirall making stay with his Pinnace and certaine boates in the harbour, to bring the sayd last company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the ships. Also the Generall willed foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Gallie with two Pinnaces to take into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the company of Captaine Barton, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Captaine Bigs, vnder the leading of Captaine Sampson, to seeke out such munition as was hidden in the ground, at the towne of PRAY or PLAY, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene promised to be shewed it by a prisoner, which was taken the day before. The Captaines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid comming to the PLAY, landed their men, and hauing placed the troupe in their best strength, Captaine Sampson tooke the prisoner, and willed him to shewe that he had promised, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he which he could not, or at least would not: but they searching all suspected places, found two pieces of ordinance one of yron, an other of brasse. In the afternoone the Generall anckered the rest of the Fleete before the PLAY, comming him selfe a shore, willing vs to burne the towne and make all haste a boorde, the which was done by sixe of the clocke the same day, and our selues imbarked againe the same night, and so we put off to sea Southwest.</p>
            <p>But before our departure from the towne of S. IAGO, we established orders for the better gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the armie, euery man mustered to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4858:16"/>
and othes ministred to acknowledge her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie supreame Gouernour, as also euery man to do his vttermost endeuour to aduaunce the seruice of the action, and to yeeld due obedience vnto the directions of the Generall and his officers. By this prouident counsell, and laying downe this good foundation before hand, all things went forward in a due course, to the atchiuing of our happie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.</p>
            <p>In all the time of our being here, neither the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor for the king of Spaine, which is a Portingall, neither the Bishop, whose authoritie is great, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of the inhabitants of the towne or Island e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came at vs (which we expectected they should haue done) to intreate vs to leaue them some part of their needefull prouisions, or at the least, to spare the ruining of their towne at the going away. The cause of this their vnreasonable distrust (as I do take it) was the fresh remembrance of the great wrongs they had done to olde Maister VVilliam Hawkins of Plimouth, in the voyage he made fower or fiue yeares before, when as they did both breake their promise, and murdered many of his men, whereof I iudge you haue vnderstood, and therefore neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to be here repeated. But since they came not at vs, we left written in sundry places, as also in the Spitle house (which building was onely appointed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4858:16"/>
to be spared) the great discontentment and scorne we tooke at this their refraining to come vnto vs, as also at the rude maner of killing, and sauage kind of handling the dead boy of one of our boyes, found by them stragling all alone, from whom they had taken his head and his heart, and had stragled the other bowels about the place, in a most brutish and most beastly maner.</p>
            <p>In reuenge whereof at our departing we con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire all the houses, aswell in the countrey which we sawe, as in the towne of S. IAGO.</p>
            <p>From hence putting ouer to the VVest Indies, we were not many dayes at sea, but there beganne amongst our people such mortalitie, as in few daies there were dead aboue two or three hundred men. And vntil some seuen or eight dayes after our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from S. IAGO, there had not died anie one man of sickenesse in all the Fleete: the sickenesse shewed not his infection wherewith so many were stroken, vntill we were departed thence, and then seazed our people with extreme hote burning and continuall ague, whereof some verie fevve escaped vvith life, and yet those for the most part not vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great alteration and decay of their vvittes and strength for a long time after. In some that dyed vvere plainely shevved the small spottes, vvhich are often found vpon those that be infected vvith the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4858:17"/>
plague, we were not aboue eighteene daies in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage betweene the sight of Sainct IAGO aforesaid, and the Island of DOMINICA, being the first Island of the VVest Indies that we fell wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l, the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inhabited with sauage people, which goe all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, their skin couloured with some painting of a reddish tawney, verie personable and handsome strong men, who doe admit little conuersation with the Spaniards: for as some of our people might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them, they had a Spaniard or twaine priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with them, neither doe I thinke that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny safety for any of our nation, or any other to be within the limits of their commaundement, albeit they vsed vs very kindely for those fewe houres of time which we spent with them, helping our folkes to fill and carie on their bare shoulders fresh water from the riuer to our ships boats, and fetching from their houses, great store of Tobacco, as also a kinde of bread, which they fed on, called Cassado, verie white and sauerie, made of the rootes of Cassania. In recompence whereof, we bestowed liberall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of glasse, coloured beades and other things, which we had found at Sainct IAGO, wherewith (as it seemed) they rested very greatly satisfied, and shewing some sorowfull countenance when they perceaued that we would depart.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to another Island VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4858:17"/>
of it, called Sainct CHRISTOPHERS Island, wherein we spent some dayes of Christmas, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh our sicke people, and to cleanse and aire our ships. In which Island were not any people at all that we could heare of.</p>
            <p>In which time by the General it was aduised and resolued, with the consent of the Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the Vizeadmirall, and all the rest of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to proceede to the great Island of HISPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIOLA, as well for that we knewe our selues then to be in our best strength, as also the rather allured thereunto, by the glorious fame of the Citie of S. DOMINGO, being the auncientest and chiefe inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited place in all that tract of country there abouts. And so proceeding in this determination, by the way we met with a small Frigot, bound for the same place, the which the Vizeadmirall tooke, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing duly examined the men that were in her, there was one found by whom we were aduertised, the hauen to be a barred hauen, and the shore or lande thereof to be well fortified, hauing a Castle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon furnished with great store of artillerie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the daunger whereof, was no conuenient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place with ten English miles of the Citie, to which the sayd Pilote tooke on him to conduct vs.</p>
            <p>All things being thus considered on, the whole forces were commaunded in the euening to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke

them selues into Pinnaces, boates, and other small barkes appointed for this seruice. Our soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being thus imbarked, the Generall put him selfe into the barke Fraunces as Admirall, and all this night we lay on the sea, bearing small saile vntil our arriuall to the landing place, which was about the breaking of the day, and so we landed, being New yeares day, nine or tenne miles to the VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of that braue Citie of S. DOMINGO: for at that time nor yet is known to vs, any landing place, where the sea surge doth not threaten to ouerset a Pinnace or boate.

They had manned them both, and planted their ordinance for that present and sudden alarum without the gates, and also some troopes of small shot in Ambuscado vpon the high way side. VVe deuided our whole force, being some thousand or twelue hundred men into two partes, to enterprise both the gates at one instant, the Lieutenant generall hauing openly vowed to Captaine Powell (who led the troope that entred by the other gate) that with Gods good fauour he would not rest vntill our meeting in the market place.</p>

And notwithstanding their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscadoes, we marched or rather ranne soe roundly into them, as pell mell we entered the gates with them, and gaue them more care euerie man to saue himselfe by flight, then reason to stand any longer to their broken fight, we forthwith repaired to the market place, but to be more truely vnderstood

            <p>During our being in this towne, as formerly also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In this time also passed many treaties betweene their commissioners and vs, for ransome of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but vpon disagreements, we still spent the early mornings in firing the outmost houses: but they being built very magnificently of stone, with high loftes, gaue vs no small trauell to ruine them. And albeit for diuers dayes together, we ordained eche morning by day breake, vntill the heate began at nine of the clocke, that two hundred mariners did nought else but labour to fier and burne the sayd houses without our trenches, whilest the souldiers in a like proportion stood foorth for their gard: yet did we not or could not in this time consume so much as one third part of the towne. And so in the end, what wearied with firing, and what hastened by some other respects, we were content to accept of fiue and twentie thousand Duckets, of fiue shillings sixe pence the peece, for the raunsome of the rest of the towne. Amongst other things which happened and were found at S. DOMINGO, I may not omit to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4858:23"/>
let the world know one very notable marke and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of the vnsatiable ambition of the Spanish King and his nation, which was found in the kings house, wherein the chiefe Gouernour of that Citie and countrey is appointed alwayes to lodge, which was this. In the comming to the hall or other roomes of this house, you must first ascend vp by a faire large paire of staires, at the head of which staires is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some spatious place to walke in, somewhat like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gallerie, wherein vpon one of the walles, right ouer against you as you enter the sayd place, so as your eye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not escape the sight of it, there is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed &amp; painted in a very large Scutchion, the armes of the king of Spaine, &amp; in the lower part of the said Scutchion, there is likewise described a globe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it the whole circuite of the sea and the earth, whereupon is a horse standing on his hinder part within the globe, and the other fore part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the globe, lifted vp as it were to leape, with a scroll painted in his mouth, wherein was written these wordes in Latin NON SVFFICIT ORBIS: which is as much to say, as the world suffiseth not, whereof the meaning was required to be knowne of some of those of the better sort, that came in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to treate vpon the ransome of the towne, who would shake their heads, and turne aside their countenance in some smiling sort, without aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4858:24"/>
any thing, as greatly ashamed thereof. For by some of our companie it was told them, that if the Queene of England would resolutely prosecute the warres against the king of Spaine, he should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lay aside that proude and vnreasonable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vaine of his, for he should finde more then inough to do, to keepe that which he had alreadie, as by the present example of their lost towne they might for a beginning perceaue well inough.</p>
            <p>Now to the satisfying of some men, who maruell greatly that such a famous &amp; goodly builded Citie so wel inhabited of gallant people, very brauely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled (whereof our souldiers found good store for their reliefe) should afoord no greater riches then was found there, wherein it is to be vnderstood that the Indian people, which were the naturals of this whole Island of HISPANIOLA (the same being neare hand as great as England) were many yeares <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The chiefe trade of this place consisteth of suger &amp; ginger, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Island, and of hides of oxen and kine, which in this wast countrey of the Island are bred
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4858:24"/>
in infinite numbers, the soile being very fertile: and the said beasts are fed vp to a very large growth, &amp; so killed for nothing so much, as for their hides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid. VVe found here great store of strong wine, sweete oyle, vineger, oliues and other such like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, as excellent wheate meale packed vp in wine pipes and other caske, and other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties likewise, as wollen and linnen cloth, and some silkes, all which prouisions are brought out of Spain and serued vs for great releefe. There was but litle plate or vessell of siluer, in comparison of the great pride in other things of this towne, because in these hote countreyes they vse much of these earthen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes finely painted or varnished, which they call Parsellina, and is had out of the East India, and for their drinking, they vse glasses altogether, whereof they make excellent good and faire in the same place. But yet some plate we found, and many other good things, as their houshold garniture very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and rich, which had cost them deare, although vnto vs they were of small importance.</p>

In which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Vizeadmirall had the rudder of his Skiffe stroken through with a Saker shot, and litle or no harme receaued elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The troopes being nowe in their march halfe a mile behither the towne or lesse, the ground we were on grewe to be straight, and not aboue fiftie pases ouer, hauing the maine sea on the one side of it, and the harbour water or inner sea (as you may tearme it) on the other side. This straight was forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied cleane ouer with a stone wall and a ditch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the said wall being as orderly built with flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in euery part, as can be set downe. There was onely so much of this straight vnwalled, as might serue for the issuing of the horsemen, or the passing

of cariage in time of neede: but this vnwalled part was not w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>out a very good Barricado of wine buts or pipes, filled with earth, full and thick as they might stand on end one by other, some part of them standing euen within the maine sea.</p>
            <p>This place of strength was furnished of sixe great peeces, demi-Culuerins and Sakers, which shot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in front vpon vs as vve approched. Novve without this wall vpon the inner side of the straight, they had brought likewise two great gallies with their prowesse to the shore, hauing planted in them eleuen peeces of ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which did beat all crosse the straight, and flanked our comming on. In these two galleyes wered planted three or foure hundred small shot, and on the land in the gard onely of this place three hundred shot and pikes.</p>
            <p>They in this their full readinesse to receaue vs, spared not their shot both great and small.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4858:29"/>
together we approched the place, where we soone found out the Barricadoes of pipes or buts, to be the meetest place for our assault, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was well furnished with pikes and shot, was without staying attempted by vs: downe went the buts of earth, and pell mell came our swordes and pikes together, after our shot had first giuen their volley, euen at the enemies nose. Our pikes were somewhat longer then theirs, and our bodies better armed, for very fewe of them were armed, with which aduantage our swordes and pikes grewe to hard for them, and they driuen to giue place. In this furious entrie, the Lieutenant generall slue with his owne hands, the chief ensigne bearer of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who fought very manfully to his liues end.</p>
            <p>VVe followed into the towne with them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them no leasure to breath, we wanne the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, albeit they made head, and fought a while before we got it, and so we being once seazed and assured of that, they were content to suffer vs to lodge within their towne, and them selues to go to their wiues, whom they had caried into other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the countrey before our comming thither.</p>
            <p>At euerie streetes end they had raised very fine Barricadoes of earth workes, with trenches without them, as well made as euer we saw any worke done: at the entring whereof was some litle resistance, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4858:30"/>
soone ouercome, it was with few slaine or hurt. They had ioyned with them many Indians, whom they had placed in corners of aduantage, all bowe men, with their arrowes most villanously empoisoned, so as if they did but breake the skinne, the partie so touched died without great maruell: some they slue of our people with their arrowes, some they likewise mischieued to death with certaine prickes or small stickes sharply pointed, of a foote and a halfe long, the one end put into the ground, the other empoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, sticking fast vp, right against our comming in the way, as we should approch from our landing towardes the towne, whereof they had planted a wonderfull number in the ordinarie way, but our keeping the sea wash shore, missed the greatest part of them very happily.</p>
            <p>To ouerpasse many particular matters, as the hurting of Captaine Sampson at sword blowes in the first entring, vnto whom was committed the charge of the pikes of the Vantgard by his lot and turne, as also of the taking of Alonso Brauo the chiefe commander of that place by Captaine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, after the sayd Captaine had first hurt him with his sword, vnto which Captaine was committed the charge of the shot of the said Vantgard.</p>
            <p>Captaine VVinter was likewise by his turne of the Vantgard in this attempt, where also the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

The originall cause thereof, is imputed to the euening or first night aire which they tearme La serona, vvherein they say and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4858:31"/>
hold very firme opinion, that who so is then abroad in the open aire, shall certainly be infected to the death, not being of the Indian or naturall race of those countrey people: our people by holding their watch, were thus subiected to the infectious aire, which at S. IAGO was most daungerous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all other places.</p>
            <p>VVith this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience of continuall mortality, we were forced to giue ouer our inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded enterprise, to go with NOMBRE DE DIOS, and so ouerland to PANNANIA, where we shoulde haue stroken the stroke for the treasure, and full recompence of our tediouse trauailes. And thus at CARTAGENA we toke our first resolution to returne homewards.</p>
            <p>But while we were yet there, it happened one day, that our watch called the Sentinell, vpon the Church steeple, had discouered in the sea a couple of small barkes or boates, making in with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of CARTAGENA, wherepo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Captaine Moone and Captaine Varney, with Iohn Grant the Maister of the Tyger, and some other seamen, embarqued them selues in a couple of small Pinnaces, to take them before they should come neare the shore, at the mouth of the harbour, lest by some stragling Spaniards from the land, they might be warned by signes from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in, which fell out accordingly, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al the diligence that our men could
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4858:31"/>
vse: for the Spanish boates, vpon the sight of our Pinnaces comming towards them, ran them selues a shore, and so their men presently hid them selues in the bushes hard by the sea side, amongest some others that had called them by signes thither. Our men presently without any due regard had to the qualitie of the place, and seeing no man of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards to shew them selues, aboorded the Spanish barkes or boates, and so standing all open in them, were suddenly shot at by a troope of Spaniards out of the bushes, by which volley of shot there were slaine Captaine Varney, who died presently, and Captaine Moone, who died some fewe dayes after, besides some foure or fiue others that were hurt: &amp; so our folkes returned without their purpose, not hauing anie sufficient number of souldiers, with them to fight on shore. For those men they carried were all marriners to rowe, fewe of them armed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they made accompt with their ordinance to haue taken the barks well inough at sea, which they might full easily haue done, without any losse at all, if they had come in time to the harbour mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spaniards boates had gotten so neare the shore.</p>
            <p>During our abode in this place, as also a S. DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINGO, there passed diuerse curtesies betweene vs and the Spaniards, as feasting, and vsing them with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4858:32"/>
all kindnesse and fauour: so as amongst others there came to see the Generall, the Gouernour of CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGENA, with the Bishop of the same, and diuerse other Gentlemen of the better sort.</p>
            <p>This towne of CARTAGENA we touched in the out parts, and consumed much with fire, as we had done S. DOMINGO vpon discontentments, and for want of agreeing with vs in their first treaties touching their ransome, which at the last was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betweene vs, should be a hundred and ten thousand Duckets for that which was yet standing, the Ducket valued at fiue shillings sixe pence ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge.</p>
            <p>This towne (though not halfe so bigge as S.

            <p>The ransome of an hundred and ten thousand Duckets thus concluded on, as is aforesayd, the same being written, &amp; expressing for nothing more then the towne of CARTAGENA, vpon the paiment of the sayd ransome, we left the sayd towne, and drewe some part of our souldiers into the Priorie or Abbey, standing a quarter of an English mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the towne vpon the harbour water side, the same being walled with a wall of stone, which we told the Spaniards was yet ours, and not redeemed by their composition: whereupon they finding the defect of their contract, were content to enter into onother raunsome for all places, but specially for the sayd house, as also the blocke house or Castle, which is vpon the mouth of the inner harbour. And when we asked as much for the one as for the other, they yeelded to giue a thousand crownes for the Abbey, leauing vs to take our pleasure vpon the blocke house, which they sayd they were not able to raunsome, hauing stretched them selues to the vttermost of their powers: and therefore the sayd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4858:33"/>
blocke house was by vs vndermined, and so with gun pouder blowen vp in peeces.</p>
            <p>VVhile this latter contract was in making, our whole Fleete of ships fell downe towards the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour mouth, where they ankered the third time, &amp; employed their men in fetching of fresh water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the ships for our voyage homewardes, which water was had in a great well, that is in the Island by the harbour mouth, which Island is a verie pleasant place as hath bene seene, hauing in it manie sorts of goodly and very pleasant fruits, as the orenge trees and others, being set orderly in walkes of great length together. Insomuch as the whole Island be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some two or three miles about, is cast into groundes of gardening and orchards.</p>
            <p>After sixe weekes abode in this place, we put to sea the last of March, where after two or three dayes a great ship which we had taken at S. DOMINGO, and thereupon was called the New yeares gift, fell into a great leake, being laden with ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hides, and other spoiles, and in the night she lost the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of our Fleete, which being missed the next morning by the Generall, he cast about with the whole Fleete, fearing some great mischaunce to be happened vnto her, as in verie deede it so fell out, for her leake was so great, and her men were all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with pomping. But at the last hauing found her

and the Barke Talbot in her companie, which stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by great hap with her, was readie to take their men out of her, for the sauing of them. And so the Generall being fully aduertised of their great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, made saile directly backe againe to CARTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENA with the whole Fleete, where hauing stayed eight or tenne dayes more, about the vnlading of this ship, and the bestowing thereof and her men, into other ships, we departed once againe to sea, directing our course towards the Cape S.

            <p>After three dayes spent in watering our ships, we departed now the second time from this Cape of S. ANTHONIE the thirteenth of May, and proceeding about the Cape of FLORIDA, we neuer touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> anie where, but coasting alongst FLORIDA, and keeping the shore still in sight, the eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of May early in the morning, we descried on the shore a place built like a Beacon, which was in deede a scaffold vpon foure long mastes, raised on ende for men to dicouer to the seaward, being in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4858:34"/>
the latitude of thirtie degrees, or verie neare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Our Pinnaces manned, and comming to the shore, we marched vp alongst the riuer side, to see what place the enemy held there: for none amongst vs had any knowledge thereof at all.</p>
            <p>Here the General tooke occasion to march with the companies him selfe in person, the Lieutenant generall hauing the Vantgard, and going a mile vp or somewhat more by the riuer side, we might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne on the other side of the riuer ouer against vs, a fort, which newly had bene built by the Spaniards, and some mile or three about aboue the fort, was a litle towne or village without walles, built of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den houses: we forthwith prepared to haue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the batterie, and one peece was a litle before the euening planted, and the first shot being made by the Lieutenant generall him selfe at their Ensigne, strake through the Ensigne, as we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vnderstood by a French man, which came vnto vs f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om them. One shot more was then made, which strake the foote of the fort wall, which was all massiue timber of great trees like mastes. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall was determined to passe the riuer this night with foure companies, and there to lodge him selfe intrenched as neare the fort, as that he might play with his muskets and smallest shot vpon anie that should appeare: and so afterwards to bring
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4858:35"/>
and plant the batterie with him, but the helpe of marriners for that sudden to make trenches could not be had, which was the cause that this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was remitted vntill the next night.</p>
            <p>In the night the Lieutenant general tooke a litle rowing Skiffe, and halfe a dosen well armed, as Captaine Morgan, and Captaine Sampson, with some others besides the rowers, and went to viewe what gard the enemie kept, as also to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ground. And albeit he went as couertly as might be, yet the enemy taking the Alarum, grew fearefull that the whole Force was approching to the assault, and therefore with all speede abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the place after the shooting of some of their peeces. They thus gone, and he being returned vnto vs againe, but nothing knowing of their flight from their fort, forthwith came a French man being a Phipher (who had bene prisoner with them) in a litle boate, playing on his phiph the tune of the Prince of Orenge his song, and being called vnto by the gard, he tolde them before he put foote out of the boate, what he was him selfe, and howe the Spaniards were gone from the fort, offering either to remaine in hands there, or else to returne to the place with them that would go.</p>
            <p>Vpon this intelligence the Generall, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall, with some of the Captaines in one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4858:35"/>
Skiffe, and the Vizeadmirall with some others in his Skiffe, and two or three Pinnaces furnished of souldiers with them, put presently ouer towards the fort, giuing order for the rest of the Pinnaces to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And in our approch, some of the enemie bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the rest, hauing stayed behind their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, shot off two peeces of ordinance at vs: but on shore we went, and entred the place without fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any man there.</p>
            <p>VVhen the day appeared, we found it built all of timber, the walles being none other then whole masts or bodies of trees set vpright and close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in maner of a pale, without anie ditch as yet made, but who intended with some more time, for they had not as yet finished all their worke, hauing begun the same some three or fower moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: so as to say the truth, they had no reason to keepe it, being subiect both to fier and easie assault.</p>
            <p>The platforme whereon the ordinance lay, was whole bodies of long pine trees, whereof there is great plentie, layed a crosse one on another, and some litle earth amongst. There was in it thirteene or fourreene great peeces of brasse ordinance, and a chest vnbroken vp, hauing in it the value of some two thousand pounds sterling, by estimation of the Kings treasure, to pay the souldiers of that place, who were a hundred and fiftie men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:4858:36"/>The fort thus wonne, which they called S. Iohns fort, and the day opened, we assayed to go to the towne, but could not by reason of some riuers and broken ground which was betweene the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and therefore enforced to imbarke againe into our Pinnaces, we went thither vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great maine riuer, which is called as also the towne by the name of S. AVGVSTINE.</p>
            <p>At our approching to land, there was some that began to shewe them selues, and to bestowe some fewe shot vpon vs, but presently withdrewe them selues. And in their running thus away, the Sergeant maior finding one of their horses readie sadled and bridled, tooke the same to follow the chase, and so ouergoing all his companie, was (by one layed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a bush) shot through the head, &amp; falling downe therewith, was by the same and two or three more, stabbed in three or foure places of his bodie with swords and daggers, before anie could come neere to his reskue. His death was much lamented, being in verie deede an honest wise Gentleman, and a souldier of good experience, and of as great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as anie man might be.</p>
            <p>In this place called S. AVGVSTINE, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the King did keepe as is before said, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie souldiers, and at an other place some dozen leagues beyond to the Northwardes, called

            <p>From whence the General wrote letters to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Rafe Lane, being Gouernour of those English in VIRGINIA, and then at his fort about six leagues from the rode in an Island, which they call ROA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOAC, wherein specially he shewed how readie he was to supply his necessities and wants, which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of, by those he had first talked withall.</p>
            <p>The morrowe after Maister Lane him selfe and some of his companie comming vnto him, with the consent of his Captaines, he gaue them the choise of two offers, that is to say: Either he would leaue a ship, a Pinnace, and certaine boates with sufficient Maisters and mariners, together furnished with a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4858:40"/>
moneths victuall to stay and make farther discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the country and coastes, and so much victuall likewise that might be sufficient for the bringing of them all (being an hundred and three persons) into England if they thought good after such time, with anie other thing they would desire, &amp; that he might be able to spare.</p>
            <p>Or else if they thought they had made sufficient discouerie alreadie, and did desire to returne into England, he would giue them passage. But they as it seemed, being desirous to stay, accepted verie thankefully, and with great gladnesse that which was offred first. VVherupon the ship being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; receaued into charge, by some of their owne companie sent into her by Maister Lane, before they had receaued from the rest of the Fleete, the prouision appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there arose a great storme (which they sayde was extraordinarie and verie straunge) that lasted three dayes together, and put all our Fleete in great daunger, to be driuen from their ankering vpon the coast. For we brake manie Cables, and lost manie ankers. And some of our Fleete which had lost all (of which number was the ship appointed for Maister Lane and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie) were driuen to put to sea in great danger, in auoiding the coast, and could neuer see vs againe vntill we met in England. Manie also of our small
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4858:41"/>
Pinnaces and boates were lost in this storme.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding after all this, the Generall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them (with consent of his Captaines) another ship with some prouision, although not such a one for their turnes, as might haue bene spared them before, this being vnable to be brought into their harbour. Or else if they would, to giue them passage into England, although he knewe he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it with greater difficultie then he might haue done before.</p>
            <p>But Maister Lane with those of the chiefest of his companie he had then with him, considering what should be best for them to doe, made request vnto the Generall vnder their handes, that they might haue passage for England: the which being graunted, and the rest sent for out of the countrey and shipped, we departed from that coast the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Iune.</p>
            <p>And so God be thanked, both they and we in good safetie arriued at Portesmouth the eight and twentieth of Iuly 1586. to the great glorie of God, and to no small honour to our Prince, our countrey and our selues.</p>
            <p>The totall value of that which was gotten in this voyage, is estimated at three score thousand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, whereof the companies which haue trauelled in the voyage were to haue twentie thousand pounds, the
