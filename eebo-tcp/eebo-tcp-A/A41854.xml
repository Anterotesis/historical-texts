            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto women the world

now a days it is grown a cuſtome ſo
common to undervalue the worth
of that ſexe (becauſe of the lewd and
allmoſt unparrald lives and examples
of <hi>ſome</hi>) that every rymer hath a

ſo often allſo is it the mother
of diſgrace. Particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
heereof, may be collected out
of the ſeverall humours of ſuch who
ſtand out in disloyaltie with them;
for ſome men will diſpraiſe that
woman whom before they adored,
becauſe her modeſty hath repelled
their un chaſte deſires. Some will turne
their amorous termes of wooing into
a barbarous ſtile of rayling, becauſe
for want of deſert they obtaine not
how to love them, and the greater
part of men, beeing evil themſelves,
love but few things that are good, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108730:7"/>

women: But O unmanlike men

point of your man hood, or any
ornament of your valour, to buiſy
your ſelves for the diſgrace of
women, whom nature hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
of corporall ſtrenth, and
education diſenabled of mentall
courage for revenge? Is this the
thankfull tribute you repaye unto
the author of your beeings? Is
this the beſt embraces you beſtow
on the papps that gave you ſuck?
Is this the gratefull allowance you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108730:8"/>
afforde them for their ſorrow, pains at
your birth, for their care and diligence
in your youth? And for that labour
of love which they have beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, throughout the ſeverall

runns may reade the truth of what we

            <p>My firſt grounds ſhall be the
<note n="a" place="margin">Cod. lib. 6. tit. 46. leg. 5. &amp;c.</note> ſuperiority of husbands

unto anſwereth the<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeq. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</note> reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of wives towards their

appeares firſt in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their wedlok, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the woman was made<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> out
of man, and<note n="d" place="margin">Ch. 2. 20.</note> for man, and
<note n="e" place="margin">v. 23.</note> given in Tuition by God
unto man. Secondly in the
difference of their ſexe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Nature,</hi> and the God of <hi>Nature</hi>
in every kinde hath given prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
unto the male. Thirdly in mans
univerſall ſoveraintie which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
over all creatures,<note n="f" place="margin">c. 1. 28.</note> when God
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108730:39"/>
enſtalled him his Vice-roy over all the
viſible Creation. And yet for all it
was not ſo abſolute a prerogative of
his fellow-woman, as it was in reſpect
of others, becauſe ſhe was joynd in
commiſſion with him,<note n="g" place="margin">S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt. hom. 9. in Gen. Rupertus l. 2. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate.</note> yet
ſuch it was as might well be
are the title of Superioritie
for the man, and require of

But neither is the one
ſo predominant, nor the other ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
as that from them ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
any other fruites but of a royall
Protection, and legall Subjection.</p>
            <p>My ſecond ground ſhall be the
<note n="h" place="margin">Digest. l. 38. tit. 1. leg. 48. Cod. loco ſuperius citato, &amp; Inſt. 2.</note> power and command of
husbands over their wives.

                  </gap> ff. de injur.</note> Which
the Law determines to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
partly in impoſing on
them convenient labours for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of their Eſtate, Chiefly in
exacting the rights of marriage for
the procreation of Children and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance
of luſt. To the former, as
much as in her lyeth, the wife muſt
yeeld obedience, To the latter (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
or ſome reſtrictions which my
modeſty forbears to mention) ſhe is
legally bound to give contentment.
Nevertheleſs in both, hard it is to be
judged whither the husband ſhould
command with greater Obeyſance,
or the wife obey with greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſo both entirely ſtrive to
expreſſe the lively effects of ſo
perfect an Union, and ſo both
interchangeably labour for the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108730:40"/>
building up of the <hi>Temple of
Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My third ground ſhall be, the
correction lawfully uſed by the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
againſt their wives, where unto
anſwereth the ſubmiſſion required of
wives unto their husbands. This
correction beeing a puniſhment, muſt
(according to the rule of law) be
proportioned unto the fault puniſhed.
The faults of wives towards their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
are all comprized under three
ſeverall Degrees, and therefore the
puniſhments muſt likewiſe be of three
ſeverall ſorts.</p>
            <p>In the firſt and higheſt degree, are
faults all together inexcuſable, never
committed by any vertuous or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
wife: never to be endured by
any loving or honeſt husband, ſuch
are defiling of his marriage bed, or
any treacherouſe exploits againſt his
life and perſon; Now for theiſe
the Law ſetts down direct puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For the former, divorce from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108730:41"/>
the bond of marriage for the Second
expulſion from the Community of
wedlock: And in neither caſe are
the husbands ingaged for the payment
of their dowrie, or any ways bound
for the reliefe of their povertie. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
me not I only intend that the
proſecution heerof lieth in the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
power, not the execution;
for that muſt be conſumate in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner, the fact prooved by
lawfull witneſſe: the verdict given
by a lawfull Judge; So that the
Jealouſie of husbands touching their
wives incontinencie, or ſuſpition
otherwiſe concerning their diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
&amp;c. before they are actually
prooved, are not to be accounted
actuall faults of the wife, but to be
adjudged as the braine ſick fancies of
their husbands. Be the ſuſpicion of
the one vehement, it beareth indeed
the better colour and deſerveth the
ſharper trial; But for the jealouſie
of the other, it is a common ill
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108730:41"/>
humour, and therefore in wiſdome
nothing at all to be eſteemed. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
is a Child conceived of ſelf
unworthyneſſe, and of anothers
worth, at whoſe birth feare made it
an abortive in nature, and a monſter
in love: for the jealouſe man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
loving a worthily beloved
Object, ſtands in feare of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his good unto another more
worthy; So that neither is his love
perfect becauſe mixed with feare,
(which love abhorreth) nor his fear
medicinable, becauſe conjoynd with
love, which feare impoiſoneth. But
of both ariſeth this <hi>mungrell</hi> kind of
Jealouſie, a loving feare or a fearfull
love; where in (contrary to all other
actions of man) we bend all our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and carefullnes to obtaine the
full ſight and perfect aſſurance of our
own miſery: we would needs (for
ſoth) know our ſelves to be <hi>Such</hi>
Homed Rationalls, as we fear our
ſelves to be, for of prevention there
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108730:42"/>
is no hope, as our Engliſh worthie
can tell us.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Seeing then that theiſe imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of husbands are not in law the
fault of a wife, and when it appeares
by evidence that they are guilty of
ſuch hainouſe crimes, the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
their proper Puniſhment
whatſoever is added beyond that,
is Illegal, and more then the Law
requires.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond degree are faults of
another nature, far inferiour to the
former, and it of reall moment too,
ſuch as may be their backwardneſs in
the religious ſervice of God, Careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in managing their houſe hold
affaires; Ill behaviour, towards their
neighbours and friends misdemeanure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108730:42"/>
of themſelves towards their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
&amp;c. Theiſe, I conceive to
be as ſo many rootes of weedes plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the fair garden, plott of a womans
minde, ſpreading it ſelfe into many
Crooked branches, and bearing much
bitter fruit.<note n="*" place="margin">Tex. in parag. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe est 47. diſt. &amp; facit C. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignantur in fine, 32. q. 6.

therefore the Law alloweth
husbands to uſe reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either ſharper or milder
according to the nature and
qualitie of the offence, and
as their own modeſt diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
findes convenient. Yet
nevertheleſs theiſe faults are
not ſo abſolutely evill, but
that they might admitt ſome
kind of excuſe, according
to the ſeverall circumſtances,
that may happen between
loving husbands and their loving
wives, only ſerving thereby ſome
what to extenuate theiſe faults, tho
not peremptorily to defend them, and
thereby to vindicate their ſpottleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:108730:43"/>
For the firſt, there is no man ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious,
but commends a religious
eſpecially a religious wife, in whom
religion is eſpecially needfull, both
for inſtruction of her maides, and the
education of her children. But if in
ſuch, an imagination of religion fall
into ſome peeviſh zeale thro igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or through ſome ſmall meaſure
of knowledg amount unto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manniſh
reſolution, it had been better
they had been leſs ſtudious in thoſe
pointes, where the beſt fruites of their
labours is a plentifull Sheafe of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
<q>Wherefore for my own part;
I could never yet bring my ſelf to
approove thooſe too too holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-goſpellers,
who weare their
teſtament at their apronſtringes (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteade
of Sciſſers) and will weekly
Catechiſe their husbands, citing
places, clearing difficulties, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holy ſermons &amp;c. when the ſpirit
of their devotion mooves them.</q>
For, ſure I am the Scripture (and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108730:43"/>
the examples of antiquity who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that Rule) held ſilence to be
a womans Chiefeſt Eloquence, and
thought it their part to heare more
then to ſpeak, and to learne rather
then to teach. As well then too much
curioſity of Religion, as too much
neglect is a fault in women; So that
if their frailtie leade them into either
extreames, the husband hath the
power of reprehenſion to keepe them
in the golden mean.</p>
            <p>Again, if a wife be over frugall, it
may be ſuppoſed it is for the augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her husbands eſtate, and the
benefit of his children: If ſhe be
very bountifull, it may be thought
ſhe intends her husbands credit, and
ſupportance of his eſtimation Likewiſe
if others mislike her carriage, it may
be her modeſty ſeemes proude unto
them, or her familiarity otherwiſe
breedeth contempt. Laſtly, if thro
infirmity ſhe fall into any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſome thing is to be imputed to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108730:44"/>
the weaknes of her ſexe, ſome matter
of excuſe there is in the reveneſs of
ſuch an offence. In all, or either of
theſe aggrievances the husband hath
allways the priviledge of reproove,
which yet ought to be given at all
times (and in the circumſtances and
occaſions under preſent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
with ſuch a ſpirit of wiſdom,
meeknes, tendernes, and diſcretion,
as that one ſoft word may ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
and work upon her minde then
a frowning Countenance, and a frown
of his ſooner then a ſowre and auſtere
demeanure; and then what more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
Balſome can there be in this
world, then the tender reprehenſion
of a loving husband? this muſt needs
be ſo farr from wounding that it
ſoftens, cleanſeth, heales, and
ſtrengthens, and yet the very <hi>wounds</hi>
of a reall conſtant and long approved
friend, (we reade) are more to be
preſerved then the kiſſes of an enemie,
and if this be true (as moſt undoutedly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108730:44"/>
it is,) how highly is the Precious Oyle
of ſoft reproof to be prized when
dropping ſo ſweetly (like that hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney)
from thoſe life breathing lipps
of a deare and tender Spouſe, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with greateſt diligence what may
make for the reall proſperity of his
wifes outward and inward man, with
all preſent and future hppynes that
can attend her wiſh, in whoſe felicity
the wellfare of his own Soule and life
is ſo much bound up; Certainly
there can not be found any woman ſo
devoid of reaſon and judgment, but
that ſhe will embrace ſuch ineſtimable

            <p>In the leaſt and loweſt degree
are ſome ſmall and trivial faults;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108730:45"/>
Indeed vertues in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but in their practiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
are tainted with ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of vice; Such may be the
nimbleneſs of womens tongues,
which allthough may ſometimes be
imployed to their husbands diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
yet for the moſt part are hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
good: In merchandizing for

their friends with the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
of compliments, whileſt ſhe is
performing many offices that belong

this ſort likewiſe, are womens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
curioſity of apparel, their

preheminence, their womaniſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likings,

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108730:45"/>
either by his wisdom in not
ſtooping ſo low as to take notice of
them, or from out of his love, but
mildely to touch them. How ever,
all that can or ought to be allowed the
husband for redreſſing theiſe ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
(not worth diſturbing
a wiſe mans thoughts,) is only

               <hi>Auguſtines</hi> councell,
that ſuch as we would have
our wives appeare unto us,
the ſame we ſhould firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove
our ſelves unto them. Would
we have them chaſte, Civile in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
courteous, and obliging, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
and unſpotted in the world? we
then muſt walke before them as
the patterns of Chaſtity, of Civilitie,
of Obſequiousnes, and of irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
For what reaſon have we to
expect more of them, then we can
performe our ſelves? It is a ſilly maſter
that offendeth in thoſe faults for
which he is offended with his pupil.
So is it an impudent and impious
fellow (ſayth<note n="b" place="margin">Sen. ad Lucil. Ep. 94.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca</hi>) who
of his wife requires an
undefiled bed, and yet
he himſelfe defiles it. By our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
demeanure then, we muſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108730:54"/>
direct them in the way of vertue,
for there are none of them ſo vicious
who will ſtick to tell us we are their
maſters, and ought to leade them
an example. It is reported by
<note n="c" place="margin">Guil. de Monte laud in Cl. cum ex eo Cardinal. Florm. 1. appo deſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er com.</note> eſteemed authors, that in
ſome places the huſbands
only are puniſhed, for the
faults of their wives. In
<hi>Catalonia</hi> whoſoever is Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koled
payeth a Sum of
money: in <hi>Parrice</hi> he rideth
in disgrace through the Citty, the
crier proclaiming theſe words before
him, <hi>So doe, ſo have.</hi> In ſome parts
of England I have ſeen a cuſtome not
much different. All which though
they are well neare worne out of date,
yet their primarie intent was ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
beeing to reſtrain huſbands
that they may love none but their
own wives, and dwell with them,
ſo that neither ſhould need any other
companie, but by their mutual
example one ſhould be a preſident
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108730:54"/>
to the other of true Chaſtity, and
Affection.</p>
            <p>Thus then (to draw to wards my
end) and only thus, may a husband
lawfully correct his wife. <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
is his firſt degree for ſmalleſt
faults, and this muſt proceede from
a pacient love, or a loving pacience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The next is <hi>Reprehenſion,</hi> in great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er
offences, which muſt aime at the
amendment of the faults, not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the faultie. And both of
theiſe muſt be ſeconded by our good
example that the world may ſee us doe
thoſe things which we would have
done by others. Laſtly in the laſt
and higheſt degree is <hi>Divorce</hi> in Such
caſes as are before alledged. Now
for further ſatisfaction to proove that
the Lawes allow not any verberall
Correction, I have added theiſe few
reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if a huſband may lawfully
beate his wife, then is the wife legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bound to indure his beating: for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108730:55"/>
the Law gives not authoritie to the
puniſher, but there with injoynes
Obedience on the puniſhed, But the
Law bindes not the wife to ſuch
blockiſh pacience; for in ſuch a caſe
it<note n="a" place="margin">Aegid. in Cura Par. Praeſ v. 2. q 195. 117.</note> allowes her to depart
from her husband,<note n="b" place="margin">Vincent de Franc. deciſ. 144. n. 4.</note> and to
obtaine ſufficient maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of her husband in the
time of her abſence;<note n="c" place="margin">Petr. de Ferrar. in aur. pr. p. 124. n. 4.</note> Neither
doth it limitt her any time
to returne, if ſhe feare his
Tyrannie: nor yet<note n="d" place="margin">Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus in Spec. Juris l. 1. de off. judg. par. 2. n. 8.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines
her to live againe
with him, unleſſe for her
good uſage good ſecuritie
be given her. In anſwer
whereof that ſhift will not
ſerve, to ſay the Law au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
the man to beate
his wife but ſlightly, and not with
ſuch crueltie as may cauſe her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;
This is too courſe a ſalve for
ſuch a ſore, for a little beating to ſame
women, is more then much unto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108730:55"/>
others, and therefore it will breed
the ſame or worſe effects: and how
little ſoever it is, they are not bound
to take it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<hi rend="sup">a</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">St. Bon. l. 4. diſt. 38. art. 2. q. 2.</note> The Law
decrees that he Leſs grievou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
offends who killeth his
mother, then he who killeth his
wife, though both be moſt haynouſe
and execrable ſinns. He by rule of
diſputation, I conclude, therefore
allſo he leſs grievouſly offends that
beates his mother then he who beates
his wife. But what a horrid and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſe
Crime is it for a man to beate
his mother (judge you) and then
allſo judge what the other is which is
worſe then that.</p>
            <p>And whatſoever is ſayd by Lawy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers
of the firſt propoſition, ſome
plainly affirming it, others mincing
it which diſtinction, availeth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing,
for if (as many doe) you hold
the offence greater in reſpect of the
greater puniſhment alloted it by Law,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108730:56"/>
but leſs in it ſelfe, and of his own
nature: I would demand of you,
whither the Law doth not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
every puniſhment to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of everie offence? To ſmall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
light puniſhments to greater,
puniſhments of a greater nature, and
to thoſe that are moſt haynous, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
of the Severeſt kind?
Which if you graunt, you muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarely
acknowledg the truth of the
firſt propoſition, if you deny this,
you accuſe the law, of Injuſtice;
Or otherwiſe if your reply be (as
moſt mens is) that heerin the Law
was moſt eſpecially mindfull, and
becauſe men are more prone to inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
their wives then their parents (as
very ſad accidents doe moſt uſually
teſtifie) therefore for greater terrour
to ſuch offenders, and more Evident
Examples to other ſpectators, the law
more ſeverely puniſhed the one then
the other. If thus you pleade, I then
joyne hands with you, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108730:56"/>
caſe give the ſame ſentence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men are more prone to beate
their wives then their parents, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in law the act ſhall be held more
hay nouſe, becauſe by law the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt be more grievouſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the name of a wife is a
name of dignitie; The Law ſtiles her
thy familiar friend, thy equal, thy
aſſociate, the Miſtreſs of thy houſe;
to ſpeack all in one word the ſame
perſon and <hi>Inviduum</hi> (as it were) tog<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ether
with thy ſelfe. If therefore ſhe
bear the name of dignity ſhe is to be
reſpected: If thy familiar friend,
ſhe is to be embraced: If thy equall
aſſociate ſhe is to be equally regarded
If thy Miſtreſſe ſhe is to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
if thy very ſelf, ſhe is as
entirely and dearly to be beloved as
thy ſelfe. All which duties of an
husband are neceſſarily intended by
the law, and are as contrarie to the
rough and unkinde uſage of a wife,
as fire unto water, heaven unto earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:108730:57"/>
And for the mittigation which is
heer by ſome men interpoſed in way
of anſwer unto this Objection (which
is, that in the ſtricktnes of law it is
lawfull for a husband to beate his wife
but it is very inconvenient and
undecent &amp;c.) it is a plaine and
peeviſh contradiction, and injuriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
robbeth the law, of the great end,
wherefore it was inſtituted. For the
end of the law is the happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Nation, and families, (of
which a State or Kingdome is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted)
which happynes is in not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing
more eminently Seen, then in
the decent conformitie of manners,
and orderly behaviour in all eſtates.
And hence it is that the Lawyer as a
laborious travellour goeth through
all eſtates to bring al unto decencie.
Hee ordereth the eſtate of Monarchs
and Princes, of Peeres and Nobles, of
Magiſtrates and Subjects, of parents
and children, of husbands and wives,
of maſters and ſervants. And in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108730:57"/>

is an abſolute breach and
violation of the Law, this
beeing one of the greateſt diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to mans peace and quiet that can
be offerd, nothing more disordering
every facultie of a mans ſoule, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing

and nothing more injurious to every

               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:108730:58"/>
Laſtly, Correction by way of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is meerely Servile, ſay the beſt
of it that any can, and in many mens
judgments ſo in human as that a wiſe
man (whoſe actions flow from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
premeditation,) will not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
it upon his very ſlaves or Swaines.
But Servilitie is only to be impoſed
on Such as be Servile, and therefore
not on wives, who are in the Law
<hi>free burgeſſes</hi> of the ſame Citty where
of their husbands are free: both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating
the ſame Rightes, both
enjoying the ſame Liberties.</p>
            <p>But heere again riſeth a cavill tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the precepts of the Law and
<hi>permiſſions</hi> of the Law; They ſay
that though indeed the Law comand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
not a man, yet it permitteth
him to beate his wife. Their reaſon
is becauſe it ſetts down no preciſe
penaltie in ſuch a caſe, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the law doth tollerate it not un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lawfull
and therefore this action allſo

            <p>And parallell allſo to the purity
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108730:70"/>
of this golden age was the perfection
of man and womans ſoule, For when
their bodies were firſt framed, God
created there in a lively ſoule,
which he ſtiled <hi>the breath of life,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ariſtot. li. drani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. cap. 6.</note> and that Spirit beeing of
an Angelical Eſſence diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it ſelf into each part,
giving motion, ſence and
reaſon to the whole. Now in this
naturall marriage of Souls and body
the Soul acts the body, and the body
ſupports the ſoule. The Soule brought
with her a rich dowry for the body,
quick apprehenſion, deepe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and a treaſurie fraught
with memory. The body brought a
faire poſeſſion for the ſoule, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her within his habitation, and
Seated her with in the warlike caſtle
of his heart, fortifyed her with the
thick bullwark of his breaſt, attended
her with waiting faculties as a family
of ſo many ſervants, made his eyes her
watchmen, his tongue her Orator, his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108730:71"/>
ear her ſentinel, his hands her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
his feet her lackies his common
parts her common vaſſals:</p>
            <p>Now whoſoever we pleaſe to take
a review of womans firſt Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
equal unto mans, having the ſame
maker the ſame manner of making,
better then mans, becauſe framd of a
better Subſtance, in a place more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and at a more remarkable
time; and of the Originall of mariage
equal to both, in as much as both
were one fleſh and one nature: more
expreſly binding the man unto the roy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all
Law of Love, Laſtly, of the purity
of that age, from whence all theiſe
teſtimonies are drawn, he will eaſily
Conclude, what I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to confirme; That man
and wife here lived a peaceable life,
they enjoyed a loving union, they
lived in pureſt Love; if ever there
was made an abſolute Law, if ever
Statute of ſuch perfection, as neither
errour could corrupt it, nor vice de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prave

the Law giver, &amp; man in his firſt

Obedient Conformiſt Thereunto.
Now whereas our imitation is to be
drawn from the beſt patterns, Here
may we reſt our ſelves, as at the
mouth of God, and draw ſweet
waters from the very Fountain head
of truth it ſelf; And that we may not
waver and fructurate as at uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
God hath pleaſed farther to

had broken it ten thouſand times,
yet we had not taſted death, and
as this is the Common received
Opinion of the learned Schoole

ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes the
matter (I think) beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
