            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that if in this life only we had hope in Chriſt, we were of all men moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> None being expoſed to ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This makes Chriſtians <hi>glory in tribulation,</hi> deſpiſe all the glory of the world, run as ſwiftly in waies of duty, as the <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of Aminadab;</hi> in a word, to enjoy a Heaven upon earth. They therefore are the greateſt enemies of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians comfort, that teach a doctrine of doubting; that a Chriſtian muſt alwaies hang in ſuſpenſe about his eternal ſtate; and can never arrive to any certainty, whether he ſhall be ſaved or no.</p>
            <p>But as this aſſurance is excellent, ſo it is hard to come by; <hi>Difficilia quae pulchar.</hi> 'Tis not to be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of labour and diligence. 'Tis uſually the fruit of much prayer, and care, and humiliation, and long-waiting; thoſe that come by it ſo eaſily, and get it ſo ſoon, have great cauſe to ſuſpect that their aſſurance is not of the right kinde; Carnal ſecurity and preſumption is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to every Chriſtian. What care do men take, and what diligence do they give to make ſure their lands, and goods, and worldly eſtates? They cannot be at reſt till they have ſecured theſe. But upon what uncertainties do they venture the ſalvation of their precious and immortal ſouls? They run the moſt deſperate hazard of their eternal ſalvation; never conſider whether they are in the way to heaven or hell, until they drop irrecoverably into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit. Oh what a ſtrange madneſſe poſſeſſeth the mindes of men, that they ſhould look no more to their own ſafety; that they think it wiſedom to ſecure every thing except their own ſoules. What evil have they deſerved of you, that you ſhould neglect them ſo much?</p>
            <p>The deſign of this Treatiſe is to awaken men from their ſecurity, and to ſtirre them up to give all diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure. It was handled by the Author as a juſt Conſectary from the doctrine of the <hi>Glory of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> (which Treatiſe is already publiſhed) as appeares in the Introduction to this diſcourſe; That ſeeing there is ſuch glory prepared for the Elect, and ſuch torments for the reprobate: it concerns every Chriſtian to give all diligence to make ſure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſhall attain the one, and eſcape the other; So that theſe three Treatiſes have dependance upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and together make up one compleat Syſteme. In this laſt thou ſhalt finde many practical caſes handled, of great ſoul-concernment, both for the comfort of ſuch as are ſincere, and the diſcovery of thoſe that are unſound. If thou wilt reap any profit by the peruſal hereof, let God have the praiſe, and let them have thy prayers, who are <hi>Ready to ſpend and be ſpent for the good of thy ſoul.</hi>

And to the end you might have aſſurance, that you ſhall be freed from the one, and ſhall enjoy the other; you muſt make it your work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of my Text, <hi>to make your calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure:</hi> Make but that ſure, and you are ſure of heaven. This is the reaſon why I pitch'd upon this ſubject: And it is my care in preaching the Word, not to chuſe thoſe Texts that are moſt for my eaſe in ſtudy, but for your profit in hearing; that ſo one Subject might back another, and one Subject might ſtrengthen another, and being put together, might more ſerve for your edification and knowledge.</p>

               <p n="1">1. What is meant by <hi>Calling</hi>; which, that you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; you muſt know there is a twofold Calling: an external, and an internal Calling.</p>
               <p>The external Calling is that general invitation, which by the Preaching of the Goſpel is made unto men, to invite them to come in to Jeſus Chriſt: and moſt in the world are called by this call, both good and bad.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The internal Calling, when the ſpirit of God accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the outward adminiſtration of the word, to call a man from ignorance to knowledge, and from a ſtate of nature to a ſtate of grace; and of this Calling my Text means. <hi>Make your Calling ſure</hi>; that is, you that live under the Preaching of the Goſpel, be ſure you be called thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Calling and Election</hi>:] Election is an act of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from all eternity he doth purpoſe within himſelf, of his own pleaſure and will, to bring a certain number of men unto ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But now, how can it be ſaid, We muſt make our calling and election ſure? Doth not <hi>the Foundation of God ſtand ſure</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith? And are not <hi>the gifts and calling of God without repentance?</hi> How then muſt we make our Election ſure, when all the Decrees of God ſtand ſure?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>Beloved, when it is ſaid you muſt make theſe ſure, you muſt take it in this ſenſe; not to make them ſure on Gods part, for it cannot be made more ſure then it is already; whom he hath elected, ſhal be glorified: But make it ſure on your parts; that is, Labour to have a real, bottom'd, and grounded aſſurance that you are effectually called, that you are elected by God in his eternal Decree, to obtain life and glory by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Calling in order of words is placed before Election, not as if it were in time before it; but to ſhew that we can never be ſure of our Election til God hath effectually called us by the Preaching of the Goſpel: and therefore <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> is ſet b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus I have opened the things moſt material, giving you the ſenſe of the words. The whole Verſe is made up of two parts.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the duty enjoyned there are ſeveral things obſervable:
<list>
                     <item>1. The matter of the duty: <hi>To make ſure your election and calling.</hi>
                     </item>

                     </item>
                     <item>3. The motive to draw you to it, in the word <hi>Wherefore.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. Here is the compariſon between this duty and all other duties; <hi>Wherefore the rather</hi>: do this rather then all other things in the world. And</item>

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Here is that loving compellation whereby <hi>Peter</hi> would gain them to ſet upon the ready practice of this duty, in that word, <hi>Brethren, Wherefore Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe five Parts there are five points obſervable.</p>

               <p>But I ſhould both confound your memory, and croſſe my uſual Method, ſhould I ſpeak of theſe five Doctrines thus drawn forth; I had rather then thus mangle the Text, give you the ſcope and ſubſtance thereof in fewer Doctrines.

               <p>I begin with the firſt, <hi>That in all matters of ſoul concernment, Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence.</hi> In the fifth verſe it is ſaid likewiſe, <hi>Give all diligence</hi>: as if all your chiefe endeavours ſhould be about the concernments of your ſoul.</p>
               <p>In the managing of this point, <hi>I</hi> ſhal lay down the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of it; then the reaſons; then apply it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the demonſtration of it: It appears that in all ſoul concernments you ſhould put forth a great deal of diligence, by thoſe reſemblances that the work belonging to the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul is compared to in Scripture. As</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. It is compared to wreſtling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers.</hi> And ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.

Now when men are fighting for their lives, what care, and what labour, and what diligence do they put forth to ſave themſelves? And the work of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the concernments of the ſoul is ſet forth by this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is compared to one being in an Agony; <hi>Luke</hi> 13 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate</hi>; The word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

Now put theſe together, that the work of Chriſtianity is reſembled to a Race, to a Fight, to be in an Agony, to Wreſtling, wherein men put forth the utmoſt of their ſtrength; the reſemblance wil hold forth this, That you muſt put forth a great deal of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in all matters of ſoul-concernment.</p>
               <p>Now for the Reaſons why you muſt be thus diligent in the matters of Chriſtianity. I ſhal lay down ten.</p>

I remember it was the ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> That when the Devil tempted a poor ſoul, ſhe came to him for advice to reſiſt the temptation, and he gave her this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Never be idle, but be alwaies well imployed; for in my own experience I found this, When the Devil came to tempt me, I would tell the Devil, I am not at leiſure to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thy temptations: and by this means I did reſiſt his aſſaults. Beloved, tell the Devil when he tempts you, you are not at leiſure to lend an eare to his temtations, and then he will never faſten upon you. The Devil never gets advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us, but either when we are out of Gods way, or idle, or have our hands in ſome ſinful inployment; and then the Devil gets power over us. If once you ſlack in diligence, in this ſpiritual induſtry, you do even tempt the Devil to tempt you: you lay your ſelves open to a world of ſin, and a world of ſnares. As you know it is with water, whileſt the ſtream keeps running, it keeps clear; but let it ſtand ſtill, it breeds frogs and toads, and all manner of filth. So while you keep going, you keep clear; but doe but once flag in your diligence, and ſtand ſtill, and O what a puddle

Then firſt in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this Doctrine, I muſt proceed by way of Caution, and I ſhal lay down four Cautions, that you may not run into any miſtakes about this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33775:11"/>Firſt, That though God calls for a great deal of diligence at your hands in the matters of your ſouls,<note place="margin">Caut. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> yet this doth no way preſuppoſe, as if you could draw out, or put forth this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce by your own native power; but that God that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands your ſtrength, that God muſt give you ſtrength to doe what he commands. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.28. <hi>Thy God hath commanded thy ſtrength</hi>: What then? can a man therefore put forth his own ſtrength? No, but the prayer followes; <hi>Strengthen O God, that which thou commandeſt us.</hi> Implying, that though God did command their ſtrength, they could not put it out by their own power: but they would make a prayer to back the command, <hi>Lord thou commandeſt us to be ſtrong, Lord, ſtrengthen that which thou commandeſt.</hi> So that though God cal for your diligence, &amp; cal for your ſtrength; yet cannot you put forth any ſtrength by your own power. <hi>Auſtine</hi> upon this conſideration hath this paſſage; when I have a will, ſaith he, to do good, I have not a power; and when I have power, I have not a wil; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſee my own weakneſſe, and that I muſt be beholding to Chriſt for ſtrength. You can as wel carry on the work of Creation, as the work of Converſion by your own ſtrength. You can as wel conquer a world of armed men alone, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer one Suggeſtion of the Divel by your own power. Though God doth cal for your obedience, and to put forth your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, yet this ſuppoſeth not, as if you could do this by your own ſtrength; but that God that Commands you diligence, that God muſt ſtir it up in you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When God calls for your diligence in matters of ſoul-concernment take this Caution; that you do not diſcharge your duty in expreſſing a great deal of zeal and diligence in matters of your ſoul, unleſſe you do it in a right manner, and to a right end. People think, if they can be diligent in hearing, and diligent in reading, and diligent in praying, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments; that then they diſcharge their duty, and anſwer the command of my Text, to be diligent. No Beloved, you do not anſwer your duty to God in expreſſing diligence in that which is materially good, unleſſe you do it in a right manner, and to a right end: You have an inſtance in <hi>Jehu</hi>: 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. He was a marvellous induſtrious man in many good

                  </hi> 10.31. So that you may put forth ſuch diligence in reading, and hearing, and in receiving, and the like; and yet, if not done in a right manner, and to a right end, you do not performe the duty of my Text. For take this as a rule in Divinity, that when God commands a duty, all the circumſtances included in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he duty muſt be obſerved or elſ that duty is not done aright. As when you pray, you muſt not leave out one circumſtance or quality required in a prayer; if ſo, God wil not accept your prayer. So here, God commands your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, if you are not diligent in a right manner, and to a right end, your diligence is not right.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33775:12"/>Becauſe <hi>(Firſt)</hi> We do them not as a free gift, but as a due debt: we owe God this diligence, and owe him this duty; and therefore cannot merit, becauſe we only pay God his due.

               <p>It is the Obſervation of a Rabbi, That the Snail above all other creatures, was by God pronounced unclean, becauſe of its ſlow and eaſie pace: God looks upon thee as an unclean man, and an unclean woman, that haſt a ſluggiſh and a ſlow ſpirit in matters of Chriſtianity. There are many men that like no life like an idle life; they are never weary ſo much, as they are weary of doing good, and weary of duties; an hour at a Sermon, a day at a Faſt, a little time at a prayer quite tires them; whereas waies of vanitie, and waies of pleaſure, they are never weary of.

It was the ſpeech of young King <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> lying upon his death bed: I have ſcarce yet begun to live, and now, woe is me, I am compelled to dye. Beloved, Many of you may have cauſe to ſay thus, you have ſcarce yet done one good action that may give you any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be happy with Chriſt another day: Happily you have not yet begun to be Chriſtians, and you may be ſoon called to dye: and what an affliction would this be to you, that you have hardly begun to live a life of grace, and yet you muſt dye the life of nature. This Diligence is converſant about many things: 1. In getting grace. Here you have a great work to do, to get grace, <hi>Above all gettings get underſtanding</hi>: And the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of getting grace, doth ſhew the goodneſſe of grace. As we ſay in nature, the moſt vile things are moſt obvious to the eye, and moſt common to be found; you have ſtones and dirt every where, but things of a more excellent nature are more hard to come by; if you would have Gold, you muſt dig into

Diligence is required not onely to get grace, but to keep it; and it is no leſſe skill to keep grace, then to get it, there are ſo many temptations lie in your way. And then, 3. To watch the heart, that doth conſpire againſt your grace, and againſt your ſoul: Prov. 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> 4. In exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart: <hi>Pſal</hi> 64.6. <hi>The heart is deep</hi>; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. All theſe conſidered, you have cauſe to take pains in all the matters of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thus having finiſh'd this Doctrine; I now paſs to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to which this diligence is applied. <hi>Give diligence</hi>: to what? Why, <hi>To make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> From whence, the ſecond Obſervation I ſhal draw, is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Doct. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>That Chriſtians that profess the Goſpel, ought to put forth a great deal of induſtry and diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually called, and eternally elected. Give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I cannot handle this Doctrine in the bulk of it, but muſt of neceſſity take it into parts, and handle it piece by piece, that ſo I may give you the ſtrength of the whole Obſervation in the Application of it. And ſeeing Calling lies in the front, I shal in a few Sermons treat of that. And the Point from thence, wil be this: That,</p>

                  <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually Called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, This is a very material Point I am now upon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this deceitful age, wherein men plunge themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gulfe of preſumption, wherein many times men take faith upon truſt, and Chriſt upon truſt. It is meet that you that live under the Goſpel, ſhould trie your Calling by the Goſpel, whether it be true or no; there may be an external Call, when there is no inward calling by the operation of the Spirit upon your hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:33775:14"/>In the managing of this Point, I ſhal ſhew you theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What effectual Calling is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why you are required to put forth a great deal of diligence to make your Calling ſure to your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By what Characters or Diſcoveries you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, What Effectual Calling is. You ſay we muſt make it ſure, therefore what is the nature of it? For anſwer, you may take this deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Effectual Calling is the fruit of Gods Election, whereby God of his free grace works a wonderful change in the heart of an Elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the inward operation of the Spirit accompanying the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miniſtry of the word; by vertue of which, the ſoul is brought from under the dominion of ſin and Satan into a ſtate of grace, and ſo made meet for the enjoyment of God in glory.</hi> Now <hi>I</hi> ſhal not take this apart, but commit it to your memory and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to apprehend: Onely in this deſcription there are laid down foure differences to diſtinguiſh effectual Calling from that ordinary or outward Calling that wicked men have by the Miniſtry of the word. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Effectual Calling in the deſcription, is ſaid to be a <hi>fruit of Gods Election</hi>; but outward or general Calling is a fruit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of common providence. God by an over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſends the Goſpel among a people, and thereby calls them to an outward compliance and conformity; but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling is a fruit of Gods Election.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid in the deſcription, that Effectual Calling, it changes the heart, <hi>whereby God works a wonderfull change in the heart</hi>: but an external Calling no way reacheth the heart, onely worketh ſome kind of civil or common alteration in the life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's ſaid, Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctual Calling is wrought <hi>by the inward ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit accompanying the outward Miniſtry of the word</hi>; whereas an External Call is onely by the word, but no inward ſaving worke of the Spirit at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It's ſaid of Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctual Calling, that it is from the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin</hi>; but External Calling is onely from the external

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble and external actings of ſin, but it no way works upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to take off the affection from ſin: whereas the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling works upon the heart, and works to the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying of the power of ſin, as well as the actings of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why doth God require, that we ſhould put forth ſuch great diligence in making ſure that we are effectually called, by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel? There are three Reaſons why this ſhould be?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>Firſt, Becauſe there are many profeſſing the Goſpel, that do harbour ungrounded perſwaſions that they are effectually called, when they are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if any men be deceived, why may not you? And if any are apt to be deceived about this matter, have not you great cauſe to be diligent, leſt you are deceived alſo? The Jewes of old, they boaſted of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and ſaid, <hi>We have Abraham to our father</hi>: but Chriſt confuts that; <hi>If you were Abrahams children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you would do the works of Abraham: but you ſeek to kill me, which Abraham did not.</hi> But then they go higher, <hi>John</hi> 8.46. they were effectually called, <hi>For God is our Father</hi>: No, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>You are of your father the Devil.</hi> Thus many men run into theſe groſſe miſtakes, to beleive they are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when they are not. Many are called outwardly that are not called effectually, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. And therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you, not to be deceived in this great buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>Secondly, Becauſe there is this natural aptneſſe in all of us, in things that are of any value concerning the body; you will be ſure to make ſure of them. It may be, if you have Braſſe and Pewter, or baſer Mettals, your Kitchin ſhall ſerve for that; but things of greater value, as Pearls and Diamonds, they muſt be in the Cloſet, and in a Cabinet in that Cloſet, you will be ſure to enſure them. Why how much more ſhould you enſure this great and precious Jewel of Effectual Calling, that ſo much concerns your immortal ſouls? When you buy Land, you will be ſure your Title is good; to draw up your evidences, ſo as to be firm in Law. You know Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,

if they venture a great or moſt part of their eſtate at ſea, where happily there may be hazard in the Voyage, they will run ſpeedily to enſure a great part of their Commodities. Beloved, this ſhould you do; this body of yours is the Ship, and the Merchandize and Freight in this Ship is your ſouls; and this Ship is going a great Voyage to Glory, Glory is the Port whither this Ship is to come, you ſhall meet with many dangers in your way, haply with ſtorms and tempeſts of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; yea, haply you may run upon the rocks of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or quick-ſands of deſpair. O now, run to the enſuring Office: what's that? why, run to ſeek the Teſtimony of Chriſts Spirit in your own ſpirit, by the word, to evidence unto you upon good ground, that the Ship ſhall be ſafe, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities brought ſecure to the Haven; that Ship, Body, Soul and all ſhall come ſafe to Heaven. Beloved, if men will thus enſure their Eſtates, you have much more reaſon to enſure your ſouls. For believe it, if you make not ſure your ſouls, if you ſuffer ſhipwrack, ye are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſaid of an old Uſurer, That when any man came to borrow money of him, he would hardly truſt one in twenty; and being ask'd the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Why he would do ſo? O (ſaith he) it is good to be ſure. Why (Beloved) ſhall a Uſurer in all his wayes be ſo ſecure, and ſo heedful in all his disburſments, that he could ſay, It is good to be ſure? and may not I much more ſay to you, It is good to be ſure of Heaven? it is good to be ſure you are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt; it is good to be ſure that you are Chriſtians in truth, not in name onely; that you are Chriſtians in Deed, not in Profeſſion onely.

               <p>Secondly, If the Lord hath wrought in you thoſe ſaving ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects or concomitants, which do ordinarily accompany thoſe that are thus effectually called: if theſe two things be done, you may have a ſeal and aſſurance in your own hearts that you alſo are effectually called. Beloved, it is not for Miniſters to flatter you: there are among many in the world but few that are called; among many that are called but few that are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore do not flatter your ſelves. If upon tryal you finde you are not in the number of Gods called ones, go home and bewail your unregenerate and unconverted eſtate. But before I can ſpeak of this method, I muſt firſt lay downe ſome miſtakes that are held by erroneous mindes about the method God takes in calling a ſinner home to himſelf.</p>
               <p>A fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt miſtake is of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who hold this, that a man is able to call and convert himſelf. Now this opinion doth quite exclude and juſtle out God from having any hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: they ſay a Chriſtian is able to call and convert himſelfe, having only a general concurrence and aſſiſtance from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and they hold this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conſiſts only in moral perſwaſions, and may be reſiſted by the perſon that is thus called; and that a man being called
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33775:16"/>
into a ſtate of grace, may fall from his calling and fall from his grace, and ſo have no profit by his calling at all; which is a moſt uncomfortable opinion: and ſurely God would never take this method in calling of his people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That of the Papiſts; and they ſay that God calls and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains a ſinner to glory, but it is upon the foreſight of his good works. God foreſaw how good and holy the man would be, and therefore God would chuſe and call him to glory: But this hath no ground from Scripture neither.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That of the <hi>Familiſts</hi>; and they hold this, That Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in calling a ſinner is not by the outward Miniſtry of the Word, but it is by Raptures and Revelations, and by divine inſpirations, and extraordinary wayes of working: but this is not Gods uſual method, though God ſometimes takes this way, as he did by <hi>Paul,</hi> who was called this way after an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner: Yet this is not Gods ordinary rule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is another miſtake, and that is of thoſe who preſſe a neceſſity of ſuch meaſures of legal horrour and terrour upon the conſciences of men, elſe they can never be ſaved. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Miniſters have been ſo harſh now and then, (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no ſuch cauſe to blame them as is pretended) yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times laſhes break out, that men muſt be ſo and ſo humbled, in ſuch a meaſure, and ſo long for duration. Now this is not Gods method to preſſe for meaſure, but a great miſtake about Gods manner of calling a ſinner; though I muſt confeſſe, this is the neareſt of all the five, to that rule God takes in calling a ſinner to glory. Having thus laid down the miſtakes, 'tis the eaſier now to finde out the truth. I come now to ſpeak of that method God takes in calling a ſinner. And here I ſhall lay down a ſixfold method, in which God proceeds with thoſe whom he doth effectually call, which if he doth ſo with you, you may go home with a ſeal upon your hearts, that you are effectually called to grace, and you ſhall one day come to glory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When God goes about effectually to call a poor ſinner into a ſtate of grace, he puts a clear light into his ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may ſee the hainous and aggravated nature of all his ſins, more then ever he did before. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 9, 13. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33775:17"/>
you, <hi>Before the commandment came, he was alive, and ſin was dead</hi>; that is, before the power of the word came upon his conſcience to convert him, he was alive; <hi>i.e.</hi> he thought he was a good man, and a juſt man, and he thought ſin was dead, ſin was deſtroied; he never knew ſin ſo ſinful: <hi>but when the commandment came, ſin revived, and I died</hi>: but when the word of God came with power upon my conſcience, and light upon my judgement, then I ſaw I was a dead man, ſin had kil'd me, and I ſaw ſin was raigning, and ſin was raging in me: and what then? ver. 13. <hi>I ſaw ſin exceeding ſinful:</hi> he never ſaw ſin ſo before converſion, before his Call, when he was a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi>; but when the word of God came with power upon his conſcience to call him, then ſaith he, <hi>I ſaw ſin to be exceeding ſinful.</hi> Now (O Beloved) hath ever God done thus with your ſouls? may be you look upon ſin with a tranſient and general view but do you look upon ſin ſo as to ſee more evil in ſin then ever you ſaw before? This is the courſe God uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally takes. Me thinks God deals with a converted ſinner, as it is ſpoken in <hi>Job</hi> 33.27, 28. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it doth not profit me, he will deliver his ſoul from going down into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light</hi>: that is, God looks upon the maſs of mankind in the world, and ſaith, if any man ſay he hath ſinned, and it did not profit him, that is, if he look upon ſin as an evil, and that he never did get good by it: then ſaith God, I will deliver his ſoul from hell, and bring him to heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>Yea, but you will ſay, May be ſometimes God may do thus to affright men, and trouble men in minde, make them ſee their ſins: but is this Gods uſual work?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>Yes, it is, ver. 29. <hi>Lo, theſe things worketh God oftentimes with men.</hi> Mark, it is not a ſeldom work, but it is Gods work of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he will make you ſee your ſins, ſee them to be fruitleſſe, and ſee them to be unprofitable; <hi>Lo, theſe things God worketh oftentimes with men.</hi> Hence you read, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. <hi>When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall come</hi> (mark his Office) <hi>he ſhall convince the world of ſin</hi>: The firſt act of the Spirit in converting a ſoul, and calling him, is to convince him of ſin. And I Remember <hi>Piſcator</hi> thinks this accompliſhed in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>When they ſaw their ſin in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33775:17"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; this is the firſt work of the Spirit of God, in you Calling; he will convince you of ſin. Now, O Beloved, to how many do I ſpeak this day, with whom God hath never taken this Method, ſince they were born into the world? How many are there that have been told of their drunkenneſſe, and told of their luſts, and of their deceits, and of their licencious living from day to day; and yet to this day they never ſaw ſin to be exceeding ſinful; they never were convinced of ſin to purpoſe? If they did indeed ſee their ſin, 1. it was but a tranſient ſight, ſoon come and ſoon gone; or elſe 2. it was but a general ſight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſay we are all ſinners: or 3. If they did ſee their ſin, it was but a confuſed ſight; no way diſtinct: or 4. If they did ſee ſin, it was an unhumbling ſight; the ſight of ſin did never humble them in Gods ſight. <hi>I</hi> intreat you, Beloved, do not lay hold or have hopes of being effectually call'd, if God hath not ſhewn you the hainous and aggravated nature of your ſins. There is a ſpeech, <hi>Job.</hi> 36.9, 10. <hi>He firſt ſhews to men their works, and their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded; and then he opens their ears to diſcipline, and commands them to return from evil.</hi> Mark, then the Lord doth it, when he makes them ſee their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded; Now, have you ſeen that you have exceeded in your Paſſions, and in your Pride? have you ſeen ſin to be exceeding ſinful? this is Gods firſt work; and happy are you that are brought into Chriſts School, that Chriſt doth take this Method withall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After God hath put a light into the ſoul, to make you ſee the ſinfulneſſe of ſin; then 2. God faſtens theſe thoughts on the ſoul, to make you ſenſible of the great miſery that your ſins have brought you into; to cry out with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>Wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death</hi>? There <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out of his wretchedneſſe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, by reaſon of that body of death, the ſinfulneſſe of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he confeſſes did as much trouble him as if a dead body ſhould be tied to his living body; alluding to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in puniſhing notorious Malefactors, which he takes to be a moſt grievous puniſhment. Why Beloved, have you ever ſeen this? did you ever ſee that miſery that ſin
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33775:18"/>
brought upon you? that ſin did deveſt you of righteouſneſſe, did rob you of your God, baniſh you from his preſence, intitle you to hell, and make you objects of his wrath? Now were you ſenſible of this miſery? this is Gods method, to make you ſee your miſery by reaſon of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God puts the ſoul into a kind of ſpiritual aſtoniſhment, that the poor ſinner doth not know where to go, what courſe to take, which way to turn, how he may get pardon for his ſin, and recovery from his miſerie. This you finde mentioned as Gods method, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. upon 3000 at once, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> They were even in amaze, the word wrought upon them, and they ſaw Jeſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to be their ſin; and now they crie out in great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> When God effectually calls a man, he will leave him a little to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he knows not which way in the world to turn him. Now when I ſpeak of ſpiritual Aſtoniſhment, miſtake me not; for firſt, I preſſe not ſuch a meaſure of Humiliation, nor ſuch a meaſure of trouble of minde, how great it muſt be; Nor Secondly do I preſſe the duration of it, how long it muſt be; that you muſt be ſo long and ſo long. Nor Thirdly, do I preſſe an abſolute neceſſitie of this, as if a man could not be call'd without it. Indeed we read of <hi>Lydia, that her heart was opened,</hi> and ſhe never troubled nor aſtoniſht; and God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times works thus in an extraordinary way: but I preſſe this, that ordinarily, its Gods Method in ſome meaſure or other, at ſome time or other, to put his People in ſuch a plunge, that they ſhall not know which way in the world to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And ſo were thoſe 3000 <hi>Acts</hi> 2. They could not tell what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>And here further, if you ask me, With whom doth God moſt of all take this courſe, to put them into ſuch ſpiritual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; to put them into horror and terror about their everlaſting eſtate? I Anſwer, firſt, Thoſe that have liv'd in a courſe of prophaneneſſe before Converſion; let them look to it: if thou haſt been a knottie and ſtout-hearted ſinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, God muſt give thee many a blow before he can hammer thee to his own will. You that have been guiltie of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33775:18"/>
Drunkenneſſe, and guiltie of Adultery, or guiltie of Sabbath-breaking in a groſſe and licencious way, that have made this world a ſtage to act wickedneſſe upon, look to it; boaſt not of your Calling: if God hath not brought you in this way, you have ground to ſuſpect you are not yet call'd. They that before Converſion were looſe in their lives, if they finde not this ſpiritual amazement, it is not likely they are call'd. And therefore I verily ſuſpect your Call, that can jump out of a courſe of Profaneneſſe, into a courſe of Profeſſion; that can jump from a courſe of Malignitie to delight to hear Sermons, and love Miniſters. You that have been oppoſers of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if you do not ſhew an eminent work in your Converſion, I greatly ſuſpect, whether you are converted or no: becauſe it is Gods uſual Method, if men have been men of groſſe lives before calling, to bring them to great aſhoniſhment when they are called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You that have often withſtood, and ſtill withſtand Gods call; that Sermon after Sermon, and invitation after invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not gain upon you; Do you look about you: God will give you many a blow, God will ſend you many a ſad hour, before he brings you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o your peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that have often ſinn'd againſt Conſcience, that do as it were lay Conſcience waſt; that are prodigall of ſinning, not caring for ſinning againſt never ſo much light, and never ſo much conviction. Beloved, you ſhall not have ſo eaſie a coming to heaven: God will firſt lay many ſtroaks upon you, and draw heavie groans from you. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>By reaſon of thy terrors I am afraid, and my bones are dried up</hi>: You are ſubject to moſt horror and aſtoniſhment, that do ſin againſt Conſcience. Again,</p>
               <p n="4">4. When God hath done thus, made you ſee the aggravated nature of ſin, ſhewn you your miſery by reaſon of ſin, and brought you into ſuch a condition that you cannot tell how to be ſaved; then 4. this is Gods Method, to take you off from your own bottom, beat you off from reſting on duties, and beat you off from dependance upon graces, and beat you off from every thing in your ſelves. This was Gods work in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>I was,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Circumciſed the eigth day, of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33775:19"/>
ſtock of Iſrael, of the Tribe of Benjamen, an Hebrew of the Hebrews</hi>; that is, my father and mother were Hebrews: what then? and <hi>I</hi> was, <hi>touching the Law, blameleſſe,</hi> Mark, he was ſo ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon his own legs, upon his own bottome; that he thought himſelfe a holy man, a man blameleſſe touching the Law. <hi>But now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what things were gain to me, I count loſs for Chriſt; yea doubtleſſe, I count all things loſt, that I might be found in Chriſt, not having mine own righteouſneſſe.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion depended upon his holy living, and honeſt dealing; but now <hi>I</hi> am converted, and ſee my folly; now <hi>I deſire to be found in Chriſt, not having mine own righteouſneſſe.</hi> See how God did unbottome <hi>Paul</hi> from any goodneſſe in himſelf, to make him reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt: and this is Gods work with thee; he will unbottome thee from thy ſelfe, and make thee ſee thou canſt not be thine own Saviour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After he hath unbottom'd thee from thy ſelfe, he puts thee upon earneſt longings and looking after Jeſus Chriſt. When the poor ſoul hath ranſack'd duties, and gone to this Miniſter, and the other Miniſter, to be ſatisfied; and he ſees duties cannot help him, and prayer wil not help him; now he thinks, I ſee none but Chriſt to lay my head upon: and I ſee none but a Chriſt I muſt make recourſe unto: And now he is ſo longing after Chriſt, that if all the ſtones in the ſtreets were gold, and all the building of his houſe were diamond, and all his garments beſpangled with pearle; none of theſe ſhould interrupt, or ſtay him from running after Jeſus Chriſt; and this, as <hi>I</hi> may ſay, is Gods ſecond work: The three firſt may be in wicked men, they may ſee their ſin and miſery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and be in a maze not knowing which way to goe: but theſe two are a form beyond the wicked; they never unbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom themſelves, nor ever have any longings or breathings after Chriſt at all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is Gods method after all this, to make them finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of contentment, and acquieſcence in Jeſus Chriſt; that they may have occaſion to ſay, I ſee <hi>I</hi> have laid my help upon one that is mightie; <hi>I</hi> ſee <hi>I</hi> have pitcht upon him that is both able and willing to do me good. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Hath given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:33775:19"/>
And now beloved, having ſpoken of theſe things, how many in the Congregation have <hi>I</hi> left behind, that haply the Lord hath uſed none of theſe methods with their ſoules? O Lord, I am not able to tell you your miſerie, but I intreat you take heed, and doe not nuzzle up your ſoules in Preſumption and groundleſs perſwaſions; for believe it, theſe are Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary methods he takes with moſt ſouls in bringing them to Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HAving finiſht the firſt part of the diſcoverie, in relation to the method God takes with thoſe whom he doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually call. I now proceed to the ſecond way of diſcovery, and that is, by thoſe ſaving Concomitants, that do and will accompany a ſoul that is effectually call'd: and theſe ſaving effects, I ſhal reduce under eight heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A man effectually call'd by Chriſt, he doth unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love the word of God, and the Miniſter that preached that word that God did uſe as an inſtrument of his call. Firſt, <hi>I</hi> ſay, he will love the word, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God,</hi> (that is, he that is calld by God) <hi>heareth Gods word, therefore you are not of God, becauſe you hear not his word.</hi> There the Scripture tels us, that they who are of God, effectually called by him, they hear his word with abundance of delight, and abundance of joy and love. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>He that is of God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth not us.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David,</hi> when he would evidence a work of God upon his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14. <hi>Thy word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is as great riches to me.</hi> And as if he did not vulue riches comparable to the word, <hi>verſ.</hi> 72. <hi>I love thy word above thouſands of gold and ſilver.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33775:20"/>
if you are converted and called by Jeſus Chriſt, you wil love the Word of God, that was an inſtrument of your Call. Wherefore all you that ſpurn againſt the Goſpel, that cannot endure to have the word come with power upon your conſciences; all you that are weary of Ordinances, and find no more ſavour in an Ordinance of God, then (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith) there is <hi>taſte in the white of an egge</hi>; this is an argument you are not yet called. What's the reaſon one man wil riſe early, goe far, take pains, and many times n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>glect his own lawful affairs, and all to enjoy the word: when another man will goe by the Church-door, and haply goe to a Tavern, and wil not goe to hear the word at all? What's the reaſon? One is call'd by the word, and the other not: one is called by the Word, and therefore loves it, another is not called, and that makes him neglect it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth not only love the word, but the Miniſter that by preaching the word was an inſtrument of his converſion. And therefore it is obſervable, which ſome Divines note, That of all men that we read of in Scripture, there was no man did love <hi>Paul</hi> ſo well as <hi>Timothy: For I have no man like minded,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2.22. <hi>No man that did ſo naturally care for him, and for the Church of God, as he; For as a ſon with his father hath he ſerved me.</hi> And what's the reaſon? Why, <hi>Paul</hi> was the inſtrument of <hi>Timothies</hi> converſion, and <hi>Timothy</hi> being a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and come to a great pitch in grace, he thought that of all Arguments in the world, that ſhould indear him to love <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was the Miniſter that did convert him: therefore he calls him (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>Timothy his beloved ſon in the Faith.</hi> And hence it is, that when the Apoſtle would draw love from the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to himſelf, and the Miniſters of Chriſt that were the means of their calling, he urgeth it upon this ground, that they were the means that did beget them to Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and as Stewards of the myſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ries of God.</hi> Why ſhould men ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them? <hi>For</hi> (ver. 15.) <hi>though you have ten thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers, yet have you not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> Hereby he would draw out
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33775:20"/>
their love to him, becauſe he was the inſtrument that did firſt convert them. Now then, put theſe two together: A man that is effectually called, he doth both love the Word of Chriſt, that was an inſtrument of his calling; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that preach'd that word, which was the meanes by which he was called: and try your ſelves by theſe. Many of you haply have ſome good wrought (as you think) upon you, and ſome change in you; but truly let me tell you this, if you are perſons that are out of love with the word, if you are out of love with thoſe Miniſters God made inſtrumental to convert you; you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect your calling; for you ſee throughout the whole courſe of Scripture, their hearts did cleave with love to them that called them: And therefore they that can ſlight and contemn thoſe Miniſters by whoſe Miniſtry they were brought home to Jeſus Chriſt, they have juſt cauſe of jealouſie to ſuſpect their Call. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God hath effectually called you, he will by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bring you out of a ſtate of ignorance and darkneſs, and give you ſome meaſure of knowledge, to be acquainted both with the myſteries of God and Chriſt, and the ſinfulneſſe of your ſelves more then ever you were before. This the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> intimates, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>You are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, a peculiar people, that you may ſhew forth the praiſe of him, who hath called you out of darknesse into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light: i.e.</hi> out of ignorance into a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

It is called marvellous, becauſe it is ſo contrary to that condition they were formerly in: As if a man that hath lain long in a dark dungeon, ſhould be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called into a glorious Palace, the Palace would ſeem more glorious, becauſe it is ſo contrary to the dark Priſon: So this work of God when he <hi>calls</hi> you, it is <hi>marvellous light,</hi> becauſe it is ſo contrary to the condition you were in before

It is a <hi>marvellous light,</hi> becauſe a light that ſhines out of darkneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God that commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe.</hi> 6. It is a <hi>marvellous light</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath more force then any other light: 'tis called <hi>the light of life,</hi> John 8.12.</p>
               <p>Now this call from darkneſs to light hath two branches:
<list>
                     <item>1. A man ſhal have more Light, to have more acquaintance with, and more clearneſs in the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt: And</item>
                     <item>2. more Light to know the ſinfulneſs of himſelf.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſhal have more Light to know the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt: And hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. <hi>It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to call me by his grace, and to reveal his Son in me</hi>; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that where God by his grace doth call a ſinner, he doth reveal his Son unto him. Wherefore, Beloved, if Jeſus Chriſt be not made known to your ſoules, if you have no competent meaſure of the knowledge of Chriſt; you may be under this conviction, that you are not yet called by Jeſus Chriſt. Nay further, he doth not only call you unto this Light, to manifeſt Jeſus Chriſt to you in ſome dim way; but you ſhal have a clear light: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This therefore is the firſt Branch, That God will put a light into thy ſoul, whereby thou ſhalt have a clear knowledge of the things appertaining to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſhall not only reveal Chriſt to thee; but this light ſhal alſo reveal thy Selfe to thee, the ſinfulneſs of thy ſelf. It is obſervable of <hi>Paul,</hi> that before his calling, <hi>he was after the law blameless</hi>; he thought himſelf to be a fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man; but when the word called him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he cries out,

And therefore, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, any of you that have not this <hi>marvellous light</hi> in your ſouls, neither to know God, nor to know Jeſus Chriſt, nor the matters appertaining to him, nor to know the ſinfulneſſe of your own hearts; take it from God, you are not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called: either theſe paſſages in Scripture muſt be raſed out, or elſe your call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians, if you were better acquainted with all that unſoundneſs, and that wretchedneſs of heart that is in you; and therefore (I intreat you) look about you: Though I would have no godly man diſcouraged by this that is ſpoken; but that you that are not yet called, might have your hearts a little ſtaggered by what is and wil be ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man effectually called is caſt out of himſelf, and cleaves to, and cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt, with more complacencie and contentment, then ever he could do in all his life before. <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>He that hath heard and learned of the father, ſhal come unto m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beloved, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hear the word, yet never goe out of themſelves, and never cloſe in with Chriſt: yea but all they that hear and learn, that hear and are called by hearing, they all come in to Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore all you, that in hearing cannot finde your hearts in love with Chriſt, cannot finde your hearts to cloſe in with Chriſt, and believe in Chriſt; you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect your call, that your calling is not effectual. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. The Apoſtle tels you, there were other men <hi>counted Chriſt fooliſhness; but to you that are called, Chriſt is the power and wiſdome of God</hi>: that is, you do acknowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

men think Chriſt to be fooliſh, and Chriſt weak: men uncall'd, they have low thoughts of Chriſt: <hi>but to you that are called, Chriſt is the power and wiſdome of God</hi>: You will have high thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt if you are effectually called.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That man that is effectually called, he ſhall be inabled by the ſpirit of Chriſt to call upon God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>To all in Corinth called to be Saints, with all that call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> There the Apoſtle joynes <hi>called to be Saints,</hi> with this phraſe, <hi>to call upon God</hi>: to ſhew, that whoever is effectually called to be a Saint, that man ſhall be inabled by the Spirit of Jeſus, to call upon God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>When thou ſaideſt, Seek my face; my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> Hence ye read, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. when <hi>Ananias</hi> doubted whether <hi>Paul</hi> was truly call'd or no, and Jeſus Chriſt would convince <hi>Ananias</hi> that he was truly call'd: what means doth he uſe? <hi>verſe</hi> 11. do not ſuſpect him, <hi>but ariſe</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and go to him into the ſtreet, called ſtraight, and inquire at the houſe of Judas for one Saul of Tarſus, for behold he prayeth.</hi> If he were not called, he would never go to God in ſuch a cordial way, and humble his ſoul before God for his by paſt failings: and beg ſtrength for time to come, and labour to have his peace made with me. Go to him, <hi>for behold he prayeth</hi>: and therefore all you that have not a ſpirit in any meaſure to call upon God, and to pour forth your requeſts in a ſolemn prayer; you have juſt cauſe of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to ſuſpect your Call.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you are effectually called, God hath wrought in your ſouls, an utter deteſtation and loathing of all the evils that in the former part of your lives before your calling you have committed and were guilty of. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, what have I any more to do with Idols</hi>? The interogation imports a vehement deteſtation of them, and indignation againſt them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of repentance, (the ſame with calling) when men come to have the work of grace in their hearts: and this is a branch of it: <hi>that godly ſorrow cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth care, and cauſeth feare, and cauſeth indignation</hi>: that is, if any man be a repenting man, and a converted man: this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion will cauſe indignation; that is, he will be even mad with himſelfe, and angry with himſelfe, that he ſhould be ſo

Another Martyr put that hand firſt into the fire, with which he had ſubſcribed a recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: ſaying, Burn thou, O hand, that didſt ſubſcribe to that which might have made me burn both body and ſoul in hell.

Hence it is, when God ſpeaks of <hi>Iſraels</hi> converſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.20. 'tis ſaid, <hi>they ſhall caſt away their Idols from them</hi>: they ſhall caſt away their ſins as with indignation againſt themſelves, becauſe they have ſinned.

                  </gap>ſt in general. This exhortation ſhould much ſway with you, if you would conſider theſe three things, 1. From what you are called. 2. To what you are called; and 3. For what you are called. I ſhall put the two firſt together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The conſideration of this, from what, and to what you are called, ſhould much heighten your magnifying of Gods grace: And here I ſhal name ſeven particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man effectually called, he is called from ignorance to knowledge, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>You are called from darkneſſe into marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light.</hi> Now ſhould not this make you magnifie mercy, that you that lay in your ſins uncalled, as in a dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, now God ſhould call you into a lightſome and pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable palace? thy minde was a faire builded houſe without windowes; or if any, but woodden windowes that would let in no light: now God hath opened theſe ſhuts, and let in the Sun of righteouſneſſe to ſhine upon thy ſoul; and brought thee from this dungeon of darkneſſe in thy ſoul, and given thee the light of his knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are called from a courſe of ſin to a courſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Before your calling you were the Divels Drudges, and did his work at wil; the Divel (in <hi>Pauls</hi> language to <hi>Timothy</hi>) had you <hi>Captive at his pleaſure</hi>; but when God calls you, he takes you from under the dominion and raign of ſin; and brings you into a courſe of holineſſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>You are called, not unto uncleannesse, but unto holineſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He hath called us to glory and vertue.</hi> Before calling, thou wert the receptacle or common ſhore of all filth and uncleanneſſe; when called, thou art ſwept with the beſome of ſanctification; yea beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and adorned as a pleaſant palace for thy God to delight in. And this ſhould cauſe you much to magnifie grace, that you are brought from being the Devils drudges, to be Gods freemen; from being the Devils ſlaves, to be Gods ſervants; from being the Devils taskeman, to pay thee thy wages in hel, to be Gods workman, for which he will give thee thy reward in heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God calls thee from bondage to libertie. In the time that thou art uncalled, thou art in bondage; 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.19. <hi>they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33775:25"/>
are the ſervants of Corruption, &amp;c.</hi> in bondage to thy luſts, and bondage to thy Paſſion, and a ſlave to the world; thou art in bondage under the Law, under the curſe and rigour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it; but now Jeſus Chriſt, if he have called thee, he hath called thee to liberty. <hi>Gal</hi> 5.13. <hi>You are called to liberty, only uſe not liberty as a Cloak to wickedness.</hi> Before calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. you are in <hi>Sathans ſnares</hi>; but after calling, you are ſet at liberty, you are freed from the guilt, and freed from the bondage of your ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You are called from a condition of eſtrangedneſſe, into an intimate familiaritie and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt. Before <hi>calling,</hi> you are <hi>Strangers from the life of grace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. You are <hi>without God in the world, ſtrangers to the Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. But when God <hi>calls</hi> you, he cals you from the condition of a ſtranger, and brings you into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by whom you are called into the fellowſhip of his Son</hi>: You who were without Chriſt before <hi>calling,</hi> being <hi>called,</hi> you enjoy neer familiaritie with his Son.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You are called from Sathan unto God. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. He hath ſent forth his word among you, <hi>to bring you from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Sathan to God.</hi> Sathan who was thy lord, and was thy maſter, and ruler, thou art now from under his clutches, and brought under the dominion and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of thy Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When God effectually calls thee, thou art brought from a ſtate of enmitie againſt God, to a ſtate of amitie and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation towards him, and Jeſus Chriſt, and all the things of God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, for to this ye are called; and be ye thankful.</hi> God hath called you to peace, he hath not called you to wrath. Before <hi>Calling,</hi> God and thy ſoul were the moſt inveterate enemies in all the world: After <hi>Calling,</hi> God and thou are of enemies become the greateſt friends: You are called to peace, therefore be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You are called from ſtate of ſhame to a ſtate of glory. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are called, you are vile &amp; ſhameful creatures in Gods ſight; when Gon cals you, he cals you into a condition of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, (which ſhall be accompliſhed in the end) you ſhall be called from earth to heaven, and from the grave to glory; this ſhall be your call after death. Now put all theſe Eight together: To be called from ignorance to knowledge; from ſin to grace; from bondage to liberty; from eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt: from a ſtate of enmitie to a ſtate of amitie and reconciliation with God and man; from ſhame to glory; and from earth to heaven: and ſhould not this mightily highten your joy, and greaten your praiſes in magnifying the grace of God in your hearts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, The conſideration of this, As, <hi>From what,</hi> and <hi>To what</hi>; ſo, <hi>For what you are called,</hi> ſhould greaten your praiſes. Now <hi>for what</hi> are you called? You are called meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the <hi>purpoſe of his own grace</hi>; neither foreſeen works, nor good education, nor grace in you, none of all theſe were motives in Gods breſt to call you. And hence you may ſee it was nothing in you, becauſe there were many things in us might move God not to call us: We have often withſtood his call; we have often ſtrangled the motions of his Spirit in our hearts: we have often carried gain-ſaying hearts to the wooings of the Miniſters of Chriſt: So that it is nothing in us, but meerly his own grace that conquers our unholineſſe, and conquers our unwillingneſſe, and overcomes that ſtoutneſſe of that is in us; meerly the grace and goodneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Now ſumm up all theſe together, and revolve them in your hearts, and you will ſee what great cauſe you have to live in magnifying of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the proſecution of theſe words, the Doctrine I drew from the firſt particular dutie injoyned, was this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the handling of which, I have gone over ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: I now come to lay down ſome Propoſitions or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about <hi>Effectuall Calling,</hi> and I ſhall name <hi>twenty</hi> in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Ten ſad Concluſions to all thoſe men who are not effectully called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ten conſolatory concluſions to all thoſe men that are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt; and mixing concluſions procuring terror to the wicked, and ſuch as procure comfort to the godly; one tempered with the other may be good to both. <hi>I</hi> begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſad Concluſion <hi>I</hi> ſhall lay down is this: That there are many men in the world, that are called outwardly by the word unto a profeſſion of Chriſt, that are not called effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually by the ſpirit to a poſſeſſion of Chriſt. My meaning is this: There are many men have the word of God working much upon them, to the changing of their lives, altering there courſe, and new moulding of them into an external profeſſion, that yet notwithſtanding all this never had ſaving grace wrought upon their hearts, which is effectual calling: <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33775:26"/>
this is a dreadful Concluſion to all you that are profeſſors, that have not a ſaving work upon your hearts: to you that flock unto the miniſtry of the word, yet are not called thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they who are called outwardly by the preaching of the word to a profeſſion Chriſt, and yet not called inwardly by the ſpirit, they ſhall endure greater damnation, and greater torments in hell, then thoſe that never heard a word of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Many ſhall come</hi> ſaith Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſt, <hi>from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaak, and Jacob, in the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> and what then? <hi>but the children of the Kingdome ſhall be caſt out into utter darkness, where ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Now, who are meant here by the children of the kingdome? not thoſe that have heaven prepared for them; but the profeſſing Jewes, who are called the children of the kingdome, becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a greater, and clearer, and fuller meaſure of the things of God, which ſhewed them the way to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then other men did. And when Chriſt calls them the children of the kingdome, he calls the heathen the children of the world. Now, many of the children of the kingdome ſhal be caſt into utter darkneſſe: If there be any more diſmal place then other, it ſhall be for the children of the kingdome; thoſe that have been as it were nurſed up under Gods elbow by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; the children of the kingdome, they ſhall have a more diſmal portion, and diſmal room in hell then other men ſhall have, that never enjoyed the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt. And O what a ſad word is this to you that live where ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do moſt abound, that you may be called the children of the kingdome, and yet you to be thruſt into utter darkneſſe!</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there are many men, who are onely called out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly into a bare profeſſion, that do harbour and nouriſh perſwaſions in their own hearts, that they are eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. It is a ſad word to thoſe that may enjoy the word, and yet ſlight it; they alſo are not likely to be called.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Its a ſad word to thoſe that leave the ordinary way of Gods calling by the preaching of the word, and truſt to rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, revelations, inſpirations, and extraordniary means for God to call them by: alas, they alſo are out of Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of calling; for God ordinarily takes this way to call a ſoul by the preaching of his word. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.22. When the Prodigal was effectually called home to his father, his father did not preſently comfort him himſelfe, but he ſends his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſaid, <hi>Go, take the beſt robe, and put it upon my Sonne</hi>; This ſon is a ſinner, the father is God Almighty, the ſervants are the miniſters: now God doth not his work by himſelfe, but he leaves it to his Miniſters; and they ſhal put on the ring and the garment; they ſhal be the inſtruments by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word to work grace in the heart. Hence 'tis that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. ſome are blamed that ſhould ſay, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and I of Chriſt</hi>; Why, are men blamed for ſaying they are for Chriſt? Is that blame-worthy, to cry up Chriſt? No: the fault is not ſimply in advancing Chriſt, but the fault was this, ſo to cry up Chriſt, as to cry down duties, and cry down the uſe of Miniſters, and the uſe of Ordinances, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were too blame; becauſe Chriſt would not immediatly by revelations and raptures cal any, but leaves the converſion and cal of a ſinner, to the ordinary way of preaching the word: and therefore a ſad word it is to all out of Gods way of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that either have not the word, or if they have it, never care to enjoy it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That if men continue long under the enjoyment of the word, and are not effectually called by it, they are likely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be called. I would commend to you that place to prove this, in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7. where Chriſt tels you <hi>of a fig-tree, he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33775:28"/>
prayed to ſpare it one year longer, and if it did not beare fruit then, he ſhould cut it down, and caſt it into the fire.</hi> Now, this Fig-tree were the profeſſing Jewes, who lay ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time under the Miniſtrie of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles; and this Fig-tree, if it were ſpared but one year, and brought not forth fruit, then it ſhould be cut down: and Chriſt did ſo; it ſeems he curſt it, and ſaid, <hi>never fruit grow more upon this tree.</hi> Now, you would ask what the meaning of all this is? Why, Beloved, a fig tree, if it beareth not fruit within four years after it is planted, it is likely never to bring forth fruit: And here the Parable comes home thus far, that if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome competencie of time, in which in all likelihood men may have ſome ſparks wrought in them by the miniſtrie of the word; if after all this they are not converted, the curſe of the fig-tree is like to fal upon that mans heart; never let the word doe that man good more, and never let grace grow in that mans heart more; <hi>let never fruit grow more upon that tree:</hi> this the Parable holds forth, that if you live under the enjoyment of the word long, and are not converted, it is an argument you ſhal not be called. And this is a heartcutting conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all ancient men, that have out-lived many Miniſters, and have ſeen their Miniſters laid in the grave; their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have ſpent their ſtrength, and waſted their lungs in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and yet they are as profane as ever, and as looſe as ever, and as regardleſs of God and grace as ever; truely, you are in a very ſad caſe if it be thus with you, you are likely never to be called by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33775:29"/>
on the work, and countenance his people; yet Gods effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling doth not ſo commonly come among rich men, as the poor of the world: <hi>the poor,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>receive the Goſpel</hi>; the Learned Scribes, and Doctors among the Jewes, and the rich Phariſees, they did all ſpurn at Jeſus Chriſt, when the poor and ignorant people that knew not the Law, they followed him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many wiſe, not many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not many mighty are called; but God hath choſen the poore things of this world, and things that are deſpiſed, yea and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> Here you ſee plainly this concluſion proved, that Gods effectual calling doth not ordinarilie and commonly run among the greater ſort of men in the world, but it runs among the poorer ſort of men, they ordinarilie give beſt entertainment to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And the reaſon of this is, 1. To magnifie the riches of his grace: if Chriſt ſhould cal rich men onely and chiefly, many would think, it was onely mens riches and mens ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did move Chriſt to call them: Now, Chriſt to vindicate and magnifie his grace, he wil call poor deſpicable wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that one would think there ſhould be nothing in the eye of reaſon or ſenſe, why God ſhould caſt an eye of favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To magnifie and manifeſt his power, that he wil preſerve a companie of poor contemptible people, among ſo many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſo potent, and ſo wealthy, that they ſhal never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overthrow them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe rich men lie under more temptations againſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling, then poor men do. Rich men think, ſhould I be called to be a Profeſſor, I may loſe my riches, endanger my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and eclipſe my honour; and theſe are great temptations to rich men to hinder their calling. Therefore you read <hi>Mark</hi> 10.22. of the young man, that when Chriſt called him, it is ſaid, <hi>he went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions</hi>; and would not follow Chriſt, who had not a houſe wherein to put his head. Many men for fear of loſing their eſtates, they lie under this ſore temptation, to hinder them from being called: And then alſo for their honour; men may think they ſhal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe their honour, ſhould they profeſſe a courſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33775:29"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 22. <hi>I preacht publikely among the ordinary ſort,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, but I</hi> preach <hi>privately to men of reputation, leſt I ſhould run in vain.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, men of qualitie and of repute, they would not own Chriſt publickly, they were afraid they ſhould loſe their honour and credit; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was enforc'd to indulge them ſo far, as to preach pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to them: hence <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a great man came to Jeſus by night.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If you are onely externally called to a profeſſion of Chriſt, and not called internally to a poſſeſſion of him, at one time or other before you die, God wil diſcover the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of your hearts, and the unſoundneſs of your call. There are many men who now are called; a man cannot diſcerne whether they be effectually called or no; but in likelihood before you die, you wil diſcover ſomewhat or other that may give juſt ground of ſuſpition you are not ſavingly called, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by falling into ſome errour in judgement, or running nto ſome ſcandalous ſin, or the like.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if God hath not, or intends not effectually to call thee, thou maieſt take this for an undeniable truth, God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intends to juſtifie thee, nor to ſave thee: <hi>Whom he calls, them be juſtifies,</hi> and none elſe; <hi>and whom he juſtifies, them he glorifies,</hi> and none elſe: So that Juſtification and Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depends upon calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. And thus I have done with theſe ten ſad concluſions.</p>
               <p>I ſhal now change my diſcourſe, and turn my ſpeech to a ſecond ſort of men, and to them I ſhal lay down ten conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory concluſions, for the comfort of you that are the called of Jeſus Chriſt. And here, before I lay theſe down, I ſhal firſt ſhew you what need there is that Miniſters ſhould preach com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to you that are effectually called. Becauſe firſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are called effectually, you are more expoſed to meet with perſecutions from men. Secondly, Temptations from the Devil. Thirdly, The ſtronger ſtruglings of corruptions from within, then ever you were before; therefore you had need of comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, After calling you are more expoſed to meet with perſecutions from men then ever you were before. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33775:30"/>
33. <hi>Call to remembrance the former dayes, in which after you were illuminated, you endured a ſore fight of affliction, partly by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and made a gazing-ſtock, &amp;c.</hi> They endured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before, but after they were enlightned, they endured a great fight of Affliction: had not you therefore need of comfort?</p>
               <p n="2">2. After calling, you are more expoſed to temptations from the Devil, then ever you were before. The Devil, when he finds all things at peace, he lets men alone; but when he finds a man comming out of his clutches to be called, then Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> troubles and aſſaults him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.10. <hi>Your Adverſary the Devil goes about like a roaring lyon, ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi> Theſe were they that <hi>the God of grace hath called to eternal glory.</hi> Yet theſe were they thay that the Devil rageth ſo againſt. Had not you therefore need of comfort, becauſe you are expoſed to more temptations from the Devil?</p>
               <p>And 3ly. You are to meet with more ſtrong and vigorous workings of inward corruptions in your own hearts; as <hi>Paul,</hi> before his calling was not troubled with his corruptions, ſin never troubled him, the powerful &amp; vigorous workings of this luſts never wearied him; <hi>but when the command came, then ſin revived</hi>: When the power of the word came with Authoritie upon his conſcience, then he ſaw ſin to revive and get ſtrength upon him. Beloved, I would appeal to any of you, whom God hath called to grace and glory, whether before you were called, you ever found ſin ſo ſtrong as after, and ever found the workings of your inward corruptions ſo violent as after? and therefore upon theſe three grounds, you have need that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſhould be preached unto you.</p>
               <p>I now paſs to the Concluſions, which I ſhal lay down for the comfort of all them that are effectually called.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt doth effectually cal a poor ſinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſinner doth look after Jeſus Chriſt. Should God entail heaven upon this condition, that you that had been firſt in the tranſgreſſion, ſhould be firſt in ſeeking reconciliation, we ſhould never have the difference ended betwixt God and us; but behold, here is mercie, and here is a ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that though we are the firſt in the tranſgreſſion, Chriſt is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33775:30"/>
the firſt in ſuing out Reconciliation: Jeſus Chriſt doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually cal poor ſinners, before they either cal or look after Jeſus Chriſt at all. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought me not; I ſaid, Behold me, Behold me, to a Nation that was not called by my name.</hi> Here you ſee, Jeſus Chriſt goeth out firſt to cal thee, before thou goeſt out to cal him. And O what c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mfort is this? Chriſt doth not ſtay til thou look after a Chriſt, but Chriſt caſts an eye upon thee before thou look after him. We read of <hi>Matthew</hi> the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, that while he was looking after his money at the receit of cuſtome, at that time Jeſus Chriſt was looking after his ſoul. We read of the Diſciples of Chriſt, whilſt they were mending their ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and looking after their fiſh, Jeſus Chriſt takes this occaſion with the hook of the Goſpel to catch them. We read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that whilſt he was breathing out perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Church of God, and raging with malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints of God, at that time he was even called to be a Saint: So that this is very comfortable. God doth firſt look after a ſinner in his effectual calling, before a ſinner looks out after Chriſt. God doth firſt look after thee, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning thee by a Sermon, and ſeizing upon thy conſcience by a command, before thou look after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt hath effectually called thee, when he hath left many thouſands in the world, of better parts, and better diſpoſitions, more natural good, and leſſe evil in them then thou haſt in thy ſelfe; and yet he hath rejected them and called thee. Jeſus Chriſt hath many times rejected a patient heathen, when he hath called thee, who art of a rigid and paſſionate diſpoſition. Jeſus Chriſt hath left many a curious wit, and pregnant Scholar, and many of ſingular parts, that had they grace to manage them, they might bring God much glory; and it may be he hath called thee, a poor ignorant ſottiſh creature. Jeſus Chriſt (it may be) hath rejected many that have had leſs ſin then thou haſt in thee. Jeſus Chriſt did reject many an honeſt heathen, when he would cal <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that had ſeven Devils in her: Chriſt rejected <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and rejected <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a half tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtian, and rejected <hi>Herod,</hi> who heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>

               <p n="3">3. God in calling thy ſoul, and bringing thee into a ſtate of grace, he doth it freely for his own names ſake; when there was nothing in thee to move him to cal thee; when there was much in thee to provoke him never to cal thee, yet his own grace compelled him, and his own mercie engaged him to cal thee. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. <hi>We are called according to the purpoſe of his own grace, not according to our own works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That they who are moſt ſenſible of their own vileneſſe, and ſee the moſt want and neceſſitie of Jeſus Chriſt, they of all people are moſt likely to be called by him. When Chriſt rejects civil honeſt men, and ſelf-conceited men, and morally good men, and they are no way likely to be called; yet thoſe men that are ſenſible of their wickedneſs, and ſee their want of Jeſus Chriſt, they are of all Men moſt likely to be called. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I came not to call the righteous</hi>; but whom? <hi>but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance.</hi> All men are ſinners, but he means ſuch as ſee their ſin, and ſee their need of Chriſt to pardon and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſin in them, for ſo the words import: <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick</hi>: They that are ſick of ſinne, and ſee their infirmities, they are moſt likely to be called by Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore this is moſt comfortable to you, all you that are drooping Chriſtians, that hang down your heads under the ſenſe of ſin, that ſee ſin to be exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; this is the end for which Chriſt came into the world, to cal you to glorie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That a man may be elected by God from all eternitie, and yet he may live a long time in a courſe of ſin, before he cal him, and yet before he dies he ſhal be called. <hi>John</hi> 10.16 <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep; and other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall heare my voice, and there ſhall be one fold under one ſhepherd, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is this; Chriſt told them his converted ones were his ſheep; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33775:31"/>
are not converted? yet I wil convert them, and bring them to the ſame fold alſo. So that Chriſt hath his ſheep among them that are not yet converted and called: and though many times you may go a long time in a courſe of ſin, yet before you die, you ſhal be effectually called, and brought home to the ſheepfold of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may be effectually called, when in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion he cannot finde any real and ſound evidence of his vocation. This that phraſe in <hi>Peter</hi> imports, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Whoſo doth not theſe things, is blind and cannot ſee afar off.</hi> It is ſpoken of a godly man, of a man that hath his election ſure, but doth not add grace to grace to make his calling ſure, that man is purblind and cannot ſee afar off; that is, cannot ſee as far as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33775:33"/>
deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the managing of which, I laid down the laſt Lords day twenty Propoſitions; ten in relation to wicked men not called, and ten Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions for the comfort of them that are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Jeſus Chriſt. I am now to proceed in the diſpatch of ſix caſes of conſcience, which I ſhal handle about effectual calling. Three of which concern men not effectually called, and three touching Believers, who are called by Chriſt to grace here, and to hopes of glory in the world to come.</p>
               <p>The three firſt caſes touching wicked men are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether a wicked man be able to reſiſt his own call?</p>
               <p>Secondly, What temptations doth the Devil ſuggeſt, to keep a wicked man from entertaining and embracing the cal of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What deluſions doth the Devil uſe to deceive Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, to make them preſumptuouſly believe that they are effectually called, when they are not?</p>
               <p>There are three caſes more touching godly men: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether may a man that is effectually called, be any way aſſured that he is ſo?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If a man may be aſſured, then what is the reaſon many a godly man is not aſſured of his effectual calling?</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, How may he come to get the aſſurance of his effectual calling? I begin with the firſt, about wicked men that are not called; and the caſe is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether may a wicked man, a man as yet not called, be able to reſiſt and keep off his own cal?</p>
               <p>And that you may underſtand the anſwer hereto, I muſt lay down this diſtinction; That there is a twofold callng of Chriſt:</p>
               <p>A Significative calling, and an Operative calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Significative calling, which is ſuch a calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt in the Miniſtry of the word, ſignifies and declares what he would have men to do: Now this kind of cal, wicked men may reſiſt; this cal, I ſay, and this revealed will of God, in declaring what grace he would have men act, and what ſin he would have men forbear: Therefore we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.5. <hi>You
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33775:33"/>
ſtiff-necked people, and uncircumciſed in heart and eares, you have alwaies reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; meaning the Preaching of the word, by the Miniſtry of his Apoſtles. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I have called, and ye have refuſed, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, There is an Operative calling, and that is ſuch a call, whereby God doth not onely ſignifie to a man what he muſt do, but with the ſignification of his wil, gives a man a power to do what he cals him to do, accompanying the word with his Spirit, making the heart ſtoop and yeild to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now this cal no man can reſiſt; Grace is irreſiſtible; and this effectual calling by the operation of the Spirit, a man cannot reſiſt. Al the gain-ſayings of the heart, and al the ſtoutneſſe of the will it muſt ſtoop, and muſt be brought under ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſaith Chriſt, ſhall come unto me.</hi> They ſhal not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withſtand Jeſus Chriſt, but they ſhal come in unto him. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10. <hi>As the rain comes down, and the ſnow from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and returns not thither again, but waters the earth, to make it bring forth, ſo ſhall my word be that goes out of my mouth, it ſhal not return in vain; but ſhall accompliſh that which I intended, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it.</hi> As al the world cannot hinder the rain from coming down on the earth, no more can any man in the world, if God hath an intent to convert and cal him, hinder the benefit of the word from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding upon his ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now the anſwering of this caſe thus briefly, wil admit of a double Uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an Uſe of Condemnation to wicked men,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that have often reſiſted the ſignicative call of Jeſus Chriſt. When Chriſt hath ſignified, this is my wil, I would have you leave theſe courſes, and I would have you walk in theſe waies; Chriſt ſignifies his will in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; yet let Chriſt ſignifie what he wil, you wil do what you lift; this is for thy great condemnation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The anſwering this <hi>Query,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> is for conſolation to elect men, who are not yet converted. Doſt thou belong to Gods Election? Why, before thou art converted, thou haſt a

ſtubborn wil, thou haſt a gainſaying heart, thou haſt a ſtout ſpirit againſt God, thy heart is as hard as an Adamant, as hard as the Rocks; yet here is thy comfort, all the gain-ſayings of thy ſpirit, and all the ſtubbornneſſe of thy wil, it ſhal not be able to keep off converting mercy, and ſhall not be able to keep off calling grace from thee: When God hath an intent to call thee, he wil come with Power by his call, and make thee do what he commands thee, and make thee embrace what he calls thee to. Did not Jeſus Chriſt uſe an operative call, as wel as a ſignificative cal, no man in the world would ever be called. And this is the reaſon, that in hearing the ſame Sermon, and following the ſame Preacher, one man is converted, the other is not. The reaſon is this, The cal of the Miniſtry is onely a ſignificative cal of a Reprobate; onely ſignifying what God would have him do: But there is no power conveyed with the invitation to make the man able to do what Chriſt cals him to; and therefore one is called, the other is not. Thus much in in Anſwer to the firſt caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Caſe.</note>Secondly, What temptations doth the Devil ſuggeſt to men, who are uncalled, that they ſhould not give entertainment to, or embrace the call of Jeſus Chriſt unto grace and glory? And in anſwer to this, I ſhal lay down onely four ſuggeſtions of the Devil, wherewith he entangles a man, that he ſhould not yeild to the cal of Jeſus Chriſt. And as I lay them down, I ſhal labour to take them a way. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt temptation the Devil wil ſuggeſt, is to you that are young men; and to you he wil ſuggeſt, that you are yet too young to embrace the call of Jeſus Chriſt: 'twil be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hereafter, and you may do it ſoon enough hereafter; you are two young now to be abridg'd of your pleaſure, and to mortifie your luſts, and to betake your ſelves unto ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a courſe as Chriſt cals you to: and by this temptation, the Devil prevails with young men more eſpecially. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, that this temptation of the Devil made him keep off for ſeven years together, from embracing the cal of Jeſus Chriſt; the Devil would ſtil tel him in his heart, thou art too young to leave thy Drunkenneſſe, and too young to leave thy Harlots; til at laſt he cryed out, How long ſhal I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33775:34"/>
ſay it is too ſoon? Why may I not repent to day? This temptation I ſay, it hath faſtened upon many before you, that they were too young to come in to Jeſus Chriſt; and to this end, the Devil wil ſuggeſt to you that old and falſe Proverb, <hi>A young Saint, and an old Devil</hi>: Whereas indeed, if you are young Devils, you wil be old <hi>Beelzebubs.</hi> And therefore this being a ſuggeſtion, prevailing wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many hearts, I ſhal lay down ſix conſiderations, to take off this temptation, that it may not prevail with you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the Devil tempt you, that you are too young to hearken to Chriſts cal, conſider, That the Devil cannot give you a Leaſe of your lives; if the Devil could give you a Leaſe of your lives, and tell you, you ſhould live til old age, you might then with more ſafety harken to his temptation; but your lives are not at the Devils diſpoſal: God is the Author of your life; the iſſues of life, and death are in his hands; you may die in youth uncalled, you may be damned, as wel as dead. You may be as theſe men, <hi>Job.</hi> 36.14. <hi>that ſhall die in their youth, and their lives ſhall be among the unclean.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Devil tempt you, that you are too young, ſeeing he canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> aſſure you of your lives, you have no reaſon to hearken to his temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the Devil could aſſure you, you ſhould live til old age; yet take this conſideration, that in putting off, your calling, and the work of converſion from your youth, this may ſo provoke God, that he may harden your hearts in your old daies, that you ſhal have no heart to think of, and embrace the call and invitation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>I ſpake to thee in thy proſperity, but thou wouldſt not hear, and this hath been thy manner fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m thy youth; Thou wouldſt not obey my voyce.</hi> God ſpake but they would not hear, and it was from their youth that they did thus; therefore God would never ſpeak more: God hardened their hearts, that they ſhould never receive or embrace the cal of Jeſus Chriſt. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. Seeing the Jewes from their youth were obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt the word of God, <hi>Go,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>make their ears heavy, and their hearts fat, and their eyes blind, that they ſhould not be called, and converted, and I ſhould ſave them.</hi> Let
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33775:35"/>
this therefore be a ſecond conſideration, that the putting off your cal til your old age, may ſo provoke God, as never to give you hearts to embrace his cal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe al this, that you could have a Leaſe of your lives, and you could be aſſured, that when you come to old age, your hearts ſhould not be hardened; yet conſider this, that the more ſinful and evil the daies of your youth have been, the more diſquietneſſe of minde, and horror of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will this breed in you when you are old, though you ſhal be called, and converted by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.24.25, 26. <hi>Thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, he was a wicked man, and had many ſins in his youth, and this in his old age made him cry out, and ſay, that God took him for his Enemy, and that God brake him like a leafe driven with the wind. O beloved, the ſins of your youth, though you ſhould be <hi>Jobs,</hi> converted, yet they wil bring great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, and great horro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, when you come to age; the luſts of youth, and the vanities of youth, and the ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of your youthful daies, they wil lay a foundation of ſorrow, when you come to gray hairs, to be neare your graves; ſo <hi>Job</hi> 20.11. And therefore, put the caſe you ſhould repent, and ſhould be called when you are old, you have no cauſe to put off the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing ſins of youth wil fill you with horror and diſquietneſſe of minde. Hence it is, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> after he was call'd by the power of the word, cries out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Lord, remember not the ſins of my youth</hi>; that gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and gall'd his conſcience,<note place="margin">Quae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:33775:35"/>4. If the Devil ſuggeſt, that you are too young to embrace the invitation of Chriſt: conſider, That Jeſus Chriſt wll take it moſt kindly at your hands, if while you are young you wil give entertainment to his cal, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I remember thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and the kindneſſe of thy youth, that thou wouldſt follow me in the Wilderneſſe, in a land that was not ſown.</hi> Mark how the Lord ſpeaks, and how kindly he takes it, that they would in their youth follow God; the Lord wil remember it, and take it acceptable from you, if while you are young, while the Marrow is in your bones, and ſtrength in your joynts, you wil embrace the waies of Jeſus Chriſt. It is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that ſome have, concerning the Beloved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> John 20. <hi>He is called the Diſciple whom Chriſt loved, and that leaned upon his breſt</hi>; of al the other eleven Diſciples, Chriſt did love <hi>John</hi> above the reſt; and Divines give this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, <hi>John</hi> was the youngeſt of al the Diſciples; he was converted and called by Chriſt, when he was a young man; and Chriſt ſeeing a young man follow him, took this very kindly at his hands, and cals him his beloved Diſciple. As you that are Parents, you let your little Children ſit in your lap, when your great ones ſhall not; ſo <hi>Iohn,</hi> he being a young man, Chriſt would let him lean upon his breſt, and lie in his boſome, expreſſing his kindneſſe to him.</p>
               <p>Now, O how ſhould this beat off this temptation that you are too young to follow Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt takes it ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at your hands, if you imbrace this call in time? nay, Chriſt doth take it ſo kindly, that he doth love bare Morality and Civility in young men; and therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Matthew,</hi> when Chriſt ſaw the young man, and he told him, <hi>I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe things from my youth, Chriſt look'd upon him, and loved him:</hi> Chriſt ſhewed a general love to the young man,<note place="margin">Matt. 19.20.</note> that was but a Moral man from his youth; and if Chriſt love Morality, he wil much more love Piety, and true Syncerity. It is obſerved of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that of one particular man, <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more love to <hi>Timothy</hi> then to any other: Read over al the book of God, you ſhal never finde <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſe ſo much love to any as to <hi>Timothy</hi>; he cals him <hi>Timothy my ſon,</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy <hi>who ſerveth me as a childe,</hi> and <hi>Timothy my dearly beloved</hi>;

               <p>Fifthly, Yield not to the Devils temptation, conſidering this, that though you ſhould be converted in your old age, yet Chriſt cannot but take this very unkindly at your hands, that you ſhould put him off until your laſt end, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (if any part, yet) the worſt part for his ſervice. You know when Chriſt ſtood all the night for his Spouſe, <hi>till his head was full of dew, and his locks were wet with the drops of the night,</hi> he got him gone becauſe ſhe came not, and would ſtay no longer.

               <p>Chriſt muſt needs take this unkindly, that you ſhould give the Devil the flower of your age, and give to Chriſt but the decrepit and infirm parts of your lives, that the Devil ſhould ſuck out the Marrow of your youth, and onely give God the dry bones, a palſie head, a dim eye, a weak body, and ſo all your ſervices muſt needs be weak alſo: and think but how unkindly Chriſt wil take your ſervices thus perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, conſider this, That from your Birth-day, to your dying day, you have time little enough to carry on the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

of your ſalvation, ſhould you live never ſo long; and therefore you have no cauſe to put off the cal of Ieſus Chriſt. And thus much be ſpoken by way of ſatisfaction, to take off the firſt temptation, that you are too young to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to the cal of Ieſus Chriſt: and this I doe for the ſake of young men, that they may take heed of being inſnar'd by this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, I am not taken with this temptation, therefore now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil comes upon them with this ſuggeſtion: Saith the Devil to them, You cannot now give entertainment to the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, for you have callings in the world to follow; you have a particular calling, and you muſt provide for Wife, and Children, and Familie, and lay up for future times, againſt old age and ſickneſſe, and therefore you cannot be at leaſure now to give entertainment to the cal of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; when I am more at leaſure, I may look after my effectual calling: And this alſo ſticks very cloſe to a great many.</p>
               <p>And to take off this ſuggeſtion of the Devil, I ſhal lay down ſix particulars alſo, by way of Anſwer. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, God never intended that our outward calling ſhould any way hinder us in the work of our converſion. God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended that our imployments upon earth, ſhould juſtle out the neceſſarie proviſion for heaven. But God hath ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out our callings here in the world, that he hath made and ordained them to be ſubordinate to our general and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling, to the great buſineſs of Gods glorie and our own ſalvation.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>he walked with God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>6.14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and was perfect in his generation.</hi> And yet <hi>Noah</hi> was imployed by God for ſome time, to wit for 120 years in a Handicraft-calling, to build an Hrk, to ſhew that God did never intend that <hi>Noah</hi>'s making an Ark ſhould any way hinder his walking with God, or carrying on the work of his ſoul. Though you have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to follow, and families to provide for, yet God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33775:37"/>
intend your outward calling ſhould juſtle out your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider you that make this plea, whether you doe not imbezel away much time from your outward calling, which you do not imploy in the concernments of your ſouls, but in the works of ſin and Satan. There is many a man that can plead he hath no leaſure to pray, nor no leaſure to hear a Sermon, he muſt follow his calling; yet this man can follow a Whore, and follow a Tavern, and theſe men can ſpend a whole day upon recreation, and yet can ſpare no time, finde no leaſure to hearken to Jeſus Chriſt. This now ſhould be a great conviction to you that pretend you muſt follow your calling, that you can neglect your calling, to follow your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and vain courſes, and yet can ſpare no time to make your ſouls happie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You that plead your outward calling in the world, to be an excuſe why you cannot hearken to your ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling by Jeſus Chriſt; conſider this, that this plea hath damned many a ſoul before you, and wil damn you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if you look not to it. This hath been an ancient plea, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. When Chriſt called a companie of men there to come to him, what excuſe have they? Saith one, <hi>I have bought a yoke of oxen, and I muſt prove them. I have bought a Farm,</hi> ſaith another, <hi>and I muſt manage that. I have marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a wife, and therefore cannot come,</hi> ſaith a third. All theſe were lawful callings, and yet theſe callings kept them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and kept them from Jeſus Chriſt. You read <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. When <hi>Paul</hi> did ſtartle <hi>Felix</hi>'s conſcience by a powerful Sermon of judgement to come, <hi>Felix</hi>'s <hi>heart trembled</hi>; but mark now, how did <hi>Felix</hi> put off the power of the word? Why, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am not at leaſure, but go thy waies, and in convenient time I will ſend for thee to ſpeak of this matter.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I am now to go about ſome other buſineſs, about the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of my Kingdome, and cannot have leaſure to hear thee now: and ſo by ſome outward imployment, he juſtled the power of the word from his heart, and had not convenient time to imbrace Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider this, That this plea of yours (in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33775:37"/>
your callings an excuſe to neglect your effectual calling) it is the only way to provoke God to curſe and blaſt all your outward callings to you, and to engage him to curſe all you put your hands unto. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.6 9. Becauſe they neglected Gods Worſhip, and Gods Ordinances, <hi>Therefore, ſaith God, you ſhall have much, but it ſhall come to nothing; and what you get, you ſhall put into a bag with holes</hi>: You ſhal loſe all you get, and all you ſow, and all you labour for, becauſe you would not look after Gods worſhip. So <hi>Micah</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>I will make thee ſick in ſmiting thee, and deſolate becauſe of thy ſins. Thou ſhalt eat, and not be ſatisfied: thou ſhalt ſow, and not reap: thou ſhalt tread Olives, and not anoint thy ſelfe with oyle; and make ſweet wine, but ſhalt not drink it. For the ſtatutes of</hi> Omri <hi>are kept, and all the manners of the houſe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and you walk in their counſels.</hi> As much as if the Lord ſhould ſay, You wil not hearken to my Statutes, and to my Counſels, but <hi>Omri</hi>'s ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and <hi>Ahabs</hi> counſel you wil hearken to, <hi>Therefore</hi> now, <hi>you ſhall eat, and not be ſatisfied; ſow, and not reap</hi>: That is, God wil curſe what you have, and what you doe, becauſe you wil not hearken to Gods cal and counſel. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.38. to 46. <hi>Thou ſhalt carry much ſeed into the field, and gather but little, the Locuſts ſhall conſume it</hi>; ther's one curſe: <hi>And ſhalt plant Vineyards, but ſhalt not drink the wine, nor gather the grapes, the worm ſhall eat them</hi>; another curſe. <hi>Thou ſhalt have Olive-trees throughout all thy coaſts, but ſhalt not anoint thy ſelfe with Oyl, for thy Olives ſhall fall</hi>; there's a third curſe. <hi>Thou ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſons and daughters, but ſhalt not enjoy them; all the trees and fruit of the Land ſhall be conſumed.</hi> Now what's the reaſon of all this, that God ſhould thus blaſt their callings and their comforts to them? Verſe 45. <hi>Yea all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee, and purſue thee, and overtake thee, becauſe thou hearknedſt not to the voice of thy God, to keep his commandements, and his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes which he commanded thee.</hi> Here is the reaſon, they would not hearken to God, nor obey God, and therefore God would blaſt their comforts to them. Now then, Beloved, think of this, you that make your callings a plea why you cannot hearken to the call of Chriſt; this plea is a great provocation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage God to blaſt, and to curſe your very callings to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:33775:38"/>Fifthly, Take this conſideration, that God will the more bleſſe you in your callings and proſper you in the work of your hands, the more conſciencious you are in hearkning to the call and invitation of Jeſus Chriſt. And the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Godlineſſe hath not onely a promiſe of the life to come, but of this life alſo.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Bring yea all the tythes into the Store-houſe, that there may be meat in my houſe</hi>; that is, ſaith God, Uſe all means, and take all care, that there may be meat in my houſe, that Ordinances may be on foot, that my worſhip may be maintained; and what then? And if you will take care of his Ordinances, God bids you <hi>prove him, and try him, if he will not take care of you.</hi> ver. 11. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rk the words, <hi>Let there be meat in my houſe, and prove me now, ſaith the Lord; if I will not open the windows of heaven, and poure forth a bleſſing upon you, and there ſhall not be room enough to receive it.</hi> A ſtrange bleſſing: that if men wil take care to have meat in Gods house, &amp; have a care of Gods ordinances, God would open the very win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en, and make the earth ſo fruitful, they ſhould not have room to receive Gods bleſſings. <hi>And I will rebuke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer for your ſakes, and all Nations ſhall call you bleſſed, and call you a delightſome land.</hi> Here now you ſee if you will take care of Gods Ordinances, and imbrace his cal, God wil bleſſe your outward calling the more; and give you in a more abundant increaſe, if you imbrace the cal of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You that urge your outward callings as a reaſon why you cannot hearken to the cal of Chriſt: take this for anſwer, that if truth were known, it is not the urgencie of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but the obſtinacie of your wils, and the ſlugiſhneſſe of your ſpirits is the cauſe, you do not give entertainment to the cal of Jeſus Chriſt. If it were mens callings urged them, they would not take pleaſure in ſin; therefore, it is not their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but the badneſſe of their hearts: they do not love Chriſt, and love his waie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but think it too induſtrious a work to labour for converſion; and therefore they make this plea. <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life:</hi> When will is wanting, ſaith Doctor <hi>Preſton,</hi> any vain excuſe wil be pretended. When wil is wanting to walk in the waies of God, any groundleſſe pretence wil be made to excuſe their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33775:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And thus much to take off the ſecond ſuggeſtion, that men have callings to follow in the world, and therefore they haue no leiſure to look after their effectual calling by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sug.</hi> Thirdly, The Devil ſuggeſts, if you give entertainment to the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, this wil expoſe you to a great deal of povertie, and perſecution in this world; and therefore you muſt not hearken to his cal: And he wil urge Scripture for this. Firſt, for poverty, the Devil wil urge <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.19, 20. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>the Foxes have holes, the Birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head</hi>: The Devil wil urge this Scripture, and tel you, you are expoſed to poverty, want, and beggery, if you follow Chriſt. And this we read in hiſtory likewiſe of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt Chriſtian King that ever <hi>England</hi> had; (and indeed the firſt Chriſtian King that ever any Nation had, to the glory of <hi>England</hi>; ſo <hi>Gildas</hi> in his life tels us) And this King though he was turned to Chriſtianity; yet for many years he had this temptation upon him, that the Chriſtians were poorer then the <hi>Romans,</hi> that did not embrace Jeſus Chriſt; and this temptation he could hardly ſhake off: the <hi>Romans</hi> were more wealthy, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were more warlick, and ſo had like to have been overcome with this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. <hi>Agolantus</hi> a heathen Prince, being taken priſoner by the Emperor and being in his Court, he ſaw thirty or forty poor men in poor clothes walking in the Palace; and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Emperor who thoſe poor men were, the Emperor told him they are the followers of Jeſus Chriſt; are they ſo, ſaith he? If Chriſt keep his followers in ſuch a low condition, I wil never follow Jeſus Chriſt. The poorneſſe of Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, made him ſtumble at Chriſtianity. There are many men, eſpecially the gallants of the times, they ſee a company of poor ſilly women come with a Bible under their armes; and they embrace the faith, and they love it; and this is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous great offence to them, that they wil not follow Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe of the poverty they are expoſed to in the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt: And then for perſecution alſo, that they are not onely expoſed to want, but to loſſe of liberty, and good name, and life alſo; <hi>Matth</hi> 10.38. You muſt take up the croſs:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33775:39"/>
theſe are tedious termes to fleſh and blood, and this doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully gravel and keep back men from entertaining of Chriſt. Now to take off this temptation of the Devil, that it might not ſeize upon your hearts, I ſhal lay down ſix paticulars by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſervants of God of old time, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y had rather chuſe poverty and perſecution with the people of God, then to enjoy the vanities and profits of this world with wicked men. And this was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s choice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24 25. <hi>Moſes when he came to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Daughter; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt better then all the riches of Aegypt. Moſes, when he came to years</hi>; it was no childiſh act, but an act of deliberation; and it was no conſtrained act, but <hi>Moſes choice rather,</hi> it was an act of his own choice, rather to have affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon. It was ſpoken of Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> his being in the Cole-houſe at <hi>Windſor,</hi> a diſmal and dark place. Saith one, I had rather be with <hi>Philpot</hi> in the Cole-houſe, then be with <hi>Bonner</hi> in his Palace. And being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, why? the one being ſo diſmal, the other ſo beautiful? ſaith he, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Bonners</hi> conſcience makes his Palace a cole-houſe; but <hi>Philpots</hi> God, and <hi>Philpots</hi> Chriſt makes his cole-houſe a Palace. And Beloved, this is a truth; though a man ſhould be a beggar, if he be <hi>rich in faith,</hi> he is the happieſt man in the world. Though a man ſhould beg his bread from door to door, if he can beg Chriſt and have it, and beg grace and have it; he is the richeſt man upon earth. This therefore is my firſt anſwer, that the ſervants of God, had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe afflictions with the people of God, then have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with wicked men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe you meet with poverty and perſecution in following Chriſt, yet conſider, Jeſus Chriſt doth make you abundant recompence with that inward peace, and inward joy he fils your hearts withal, for all the outward troubles you meet with in the world. <hi>John</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation</hi>; but mark the Cordial, <hi>In me ye ſhall have peace,</hi> therefore <hi>be of good chear, I have overcome the world.</hi> Though
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33775:39"/>
you have troubles in the world, yet you have joy in me, and peace in me; and therefore why ſhould you be offended?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, Though you want many things in the world, yet you ſhal want nothing that is good for you; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that live a godly life.</hi> If riches be good for thee, thou ſhalt not want it; if wealth be good for you, you ſhal not want it; if eſtate be good for you, you ſhal not want that; for he will with-hold nothing from them that live a godly life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A gracious heart, if he hath or can finde that he hath a real intereſt in Chriſt, though he wants much in the world, he thinks he wants nothing: but he hath all things in having a Chriſt; nor wil he complain of poverty, when endowed with riches of heaven. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. <hi>And Chriſt ſaid unto them, when I ſent you without purſe, and without ſcripe, and ſhooes, lacked you any thing?</hi> Mark the queſtion. Now, if a carnal man had been to anſwer this, what would he have ſaid? What? ſend a man without a purſe, then he wants money; ſend him without a ſcrip, he wants meat; ſend him without ſhooes, a man is a poor man indeed, that hath no ſhooes to his feet; a carnal man would have ſaid, Yes Lord, we want mony, and we want meat, and we want ſhooes; but ask the Diſciples, <hi>wanted you any thing? They ſaid Nothing.</hi> And why was this? Becauſe the Diſciples knew they had a grounded intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and a right to Jeſus Chriſt, and though they wanted theſe poor outward comforts, they did not want Chriſts comfort, and Chriſts graces; and therefore when they had neither purſe, ſcrip, nor ſhooes, they wanted nothing. Why, O Beloved, if you were of the temper of theſe gracious Diſciples, you would ſay ſo too; that if you can finde a grounded and real intereſt in Chriſt, though you want many of the comforts of this world, you will ſay you want nothing. <hi>Wanted you any thing? and they ſaid Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You that make poverty and perſecution a plea, Conſider this, that the poor are ordinarily the moſt people that Jeſus Chriſt doth call to embrace his Goſpel. <hi>The poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and bleſſed are you that are not offended at it; Not many wiſe, not many noble are called, but the poor things of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33775:40"/>
the world hath God choſen.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. And in <hi>James, God hath choſe the poor of this world to be rich in faith.</hi> Doe not therefore Beloved make this a plea to keep off from Chriſt, becauſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily they are the people Chriſt pitcheth moſt love upon, and doth delight to make them rich in grace, who are poore in goods.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, That if upon this ground you refuſe the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, you are expoſed to more povertie, and to worſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the following of Chriſt you are only expoſed to an outward povertie; but in neglecting the cal of Chriſt, you are expoſed to be poor in faith, and to be ſuch a beggar, as not to be endowed with one dram of grace, and then you are beggars indeed. As we ſay, he is a poore man that God hates: He that hath not Chriſt, and hath not the treaſures of heaven in him, he is expoſed to worſe poverty a thouſand times then he can be for imbracing the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. Yea, and he is expoſed to worſe perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo, that for fear of perſecution neglects Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.5. <hi>The Lord will perſecute them,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, with fury and wrath,</hi> ſpeaking of wicked men. All perſecution from man reaches but to the body, but this from God reaches to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And then laſtly, This ſhould not hinder you from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Jeſus Chriſt, conſidering, that though you ſhould be poor, and ſhould be perſecuted, yet heaven wil make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Heaven wil make amends for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, when you are endowed with all the riches of Chriſt, and Heaven wil make amends for perſecution, when there the weary ſhal be at reſt, and there the troubled ſhal be at ease. And thus much be ſpoken of the third ſuggeſtion of the Devil, that if you entertain the cal of Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhal be expoſed to much povertie, and perſecution here in the world.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which, I have reſolved one caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and am yet upon the ſecond caſe; namely, what ſuggeſtions the Devil doth uſe to keep men off from imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the cal of Jeſus Chriſt: I have laid down and anſwered three already.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now there is one ſuggeſtion more. When the Devil ſees either of theſe wil take place, then he comes in with a fourth, to diſſwade men from imbracing the call of Chriſt, and that is this: Why, ſaith the Devil, if you wil entertain the call of Chriſt, you wil abridge your ſelves of all the joy and comfort of your lives; you wil never have merry daies while you live upon earth: You ſee men that pretend to be converted, and doe hear Sermons, what lumpiſh and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly men they are, not ſo jocund and jolly as others are, that walk not ſo preciſely; if you follow Chriſt, and his Goſpel, this wil caſheer all your merry daies, and this wil put you into a ſad temper; all your jovial daies are gone. Therefore to take off this aſperſion, that the waies of Chriſt are ſad and melancholy waies, which hath been an aſperſion that from age to age, and generation to generation, hath been as a Gin the Devil hath uſed to keep men from Chriſtianity. And I remember it is one of the greateſt Engines Antichriſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33775:41"/>
uſeth to ſupport and uphold his Kingdom. The Papiſts, to deter men from Chriſtianity, and the Proteſtant Religion, they would hold their Diſciples in hand with this, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> is a ſad and lumpiſh ſpirit, and therefore they would diſſwade all Nations from turning to their Religion; and this the Prieſts were to tel in all the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> how ſad and melancholy they were that turned to the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and this did mightily ſtay the people from imbracing the truth. And this aſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſion hath paſſed from hand to hand, and is many times prevalent upon the ſpirits of men that are of the true Religion, that they muſt not be too forward in the practice of Religion, fearing leſt this ſhould work melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſad thoughts in them.</p>
               <p>Now, to take off this, I ſhal onely urge four or five heads briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whereas you ſay, they are melancholy &amp; ſad that are called by Chriſt to a profeſſion of his waies, I would anſwer thus, That they of all people in the world have moſt cauſe of mirth &amp; gladneſs, and they are the moſt truly joyful people in the world. That they have moſt cauſe of rejoycing is apparent. When the Diſciples came triumphing that they could caſt out Devils, heal the diſeaſed, and work Miracles: O but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, but rejoyce that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life, Luke</hi> 10.20. As much as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, All the endowments and extraordinary gifts of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they are no ſuch grounds of joy, if you had them all; but here is your joy, and cauſe of rejoycing, that your names are written in the book of Life; that you are in Chriſt, and your ſouls ſhal be ſaved. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, again I ſay rejoyce.</hi> The Apoſtle would not ſpeak it to them with a ſingle command, but doubtleſs his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, to ſhew, that they that are people that have their ſins pardoned; that have their ſouls reconciled; that have a title to glory, whoſe names are written in the book of Life; theſe of all men in the world have moſt cauſe of joy and gladneſs. And they have not onely moſt cauſe, but they doe moſt truly rejoyce, and have more real joy in their hearts in one day, then the wicked can have all their lives, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>They rejoyce
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33775:41"/>
with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> What joy you have in the world, the tongue is able to ſpeak of it, but the tongue is not able to ſpeak of that inward joy that godly men have in their hearts, upon the apprehenſion of the intereſt they have in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance.</hi> And <hi>Thou ſhalt put more gladness in mine heart, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 14.13. <hi>A good conſcience is a continual feaſt.</hi> Men are never more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then when they are at a feaſt; godly men, they carry clear conſciences about them, and that makes them as joyous and pleaſant, as if they were alwayes at a great and ſumptuous feaſt. Indeed this is true, they do not rejoyce with ſuch exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies of joy as wicked men do. Wicked men rejoyce in ſin, that they cannot do; wicked men rejoyce in their luſts, in their drunkeneſſe, and their adulteries, and wayes of ſin, that godly men dare not do. Such a rejoycing as this, is the foundation of ſorrow: This rejoycing (like the Prodigal) in a riotous courſe of living, is the foundation of ſorrow, and will meet with you, when you are to die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grant this ſhould be true; yet conſider, that this ſorrow that godly people have, it is ſuch a ſorrow, that they ſhal have no cauſe to repent thereof, but it is a foundation of future joy to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>I rejoyce</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in that I have made you ſorrowful.</hi> What, rejoyce to ſee them a ſad people? Yes, for the ſorrow I made you ſorrowful with, was <hi>a ſorrow never to be repented of,</hi> you wil never repent of that ſorrow; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would do it, becauſe it was a ſorrow, never to be ſorrowed for; nay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.</note> it is not ſuch a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as is not to be repented of, but it is a ſorrow that laies a foundation to a great deal of future joy, <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> But now al the joy of wicked men, is a joy to be repented of. They muſt repent of all their jovial bouts, and repent of all their merry paſtimes, this wil be ſadneſſe to their remembrance; whereas the ſorrow of the godly is never to be ſorrowed for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is true, it may be they are ſorrowful, but they are ſorrowful for ſin, which you have cauſe to be that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, as wel as they, and more: Now if a godly man be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful for ſin, this wil never prejudice him. Indeed, <hi>Worldly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33775:42"/>
ſorrow brings forth death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but godly ſorrow brings forth ſalvation never to be repented of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may be they are ſorrowful, but how is it? They are not ſorrowful becauſe they are good, but they are ſorrowful becauſe they are ſo bad. It is not profeſſion makes them ſorrowful, but it is becauſe they can profeſſe Chriſt no better, and profeſſe him no more zealouſly, this is their ſorrow; and this ſorrow ſhould be in all of us, that we can ſerve God no better, and bring God no more Glory.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They are ſorrowful, but it not for themſelves, but for thee; they are not ſorry becauſe they are good, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art ſo bad; they are ſorry becauſe of thy ſins, becauſe they ſee thee an uncalled man ſtil, and they ſee thee drunk, and ſee thee profane, and ſee thee diſhonour God, and damn thy ſoul; and this makes them more ſad then they would be. <hi>Lot, his righteous ſoul was vext within him, for the wickedneſſe of the Sodomites</hi>; 2 Pet. 2.8. And Jeremiah, <hi>his eyes run down with tears, for the iniquity of the people</hi> he lived amongſt. And ſo <hi>Paul, I told you before, and now tell you weeping</hi>; there are wicked livers among you, that walk not according to the truth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Paul</hi> did not weep becauſe he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; but becauſe he ſaw ſo many wicked, and abominable in their lives. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Mine eyes run down with water, becauſe men keep not thy Law.</hi> Ezek. 9.4.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Though you ſee ſome men ſad and melancholy, yet think not ill of the wayes of God; becauſe, this way of all other, doth moſt invite to joy and gladneſſe in the Lord. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore, and again I ſay, rejoyce, Phil.</hi> 4.4. And <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>These things I ſpeak,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that your joy might be full.</hi> In the profeſſion and following of Chriſt, it is the intendment of Chriſt to give you more joy, then ever you had before; there is no ſuch cauſe therefore to entertain a prejudice by the Devils temptation againſt the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt, when he cals you to profeſſe his Goſpel. And thus much be ſpoken to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe of conſcience in reference to wicked men.</p>
               <p>There is a third caſe touching men uncalled, and that is, What deluſions doth the Devil deceive hypocrites by, to make them nouriſh preſumptuous perſwaſions that they are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

And here the Devil would miſapply Scripture, as <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that heareth not my words,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is not of God; he that is of God, heareth my words.</hi> Now, here the Devil would miſapply this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tel you, you that hear Gods word, and delight to hear Sermons, this can be no other then an infallible evidence of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If your hearing the word, be but a bare hearing, and not a hearing with practice; if you have not practice joyned with what you hear; and know, your thus hearing the word with delight, is no evidence of your effectual calling. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They come before thee as my people cometh, thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, as one that can play well upon an inſtrument of muſick.</hi> Here the Lord ſets forth with what delight they heard <hi>Ezekiel</hi> preach; they heard him as a man that had a very lovely voice, and they heard him as a man that played upon an Inſtrument of Muſick; much delight they took in hearing.

               <p n="2">2. If your hearing be a partial hearing: I mean thus; if you hear, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be a partial hearing, as firſt, that you will hear ſome part, and will not hear other; to hear the promiſing part, and not the commanding part; to hear with delight the commanding part, and not hear the threatning part of the word: in this caſe, thus hearing will be no evidence of your call. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Herod</hi> it is ſaid of him, <hi>he heard John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt gladly, and did many things:</hi> There was his partial hearing: he heard him with joy in many things, but he would not do all. Now, if you ask, wherein was <hi>Herods</hi> failing? <hi>Herod</hi> heard the word with gladneſſe; yet this was no evidence of his effectual calling. Wherein did he fail? Why mark, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this Scripture with <hi>Luke</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. <hi>Herod,</hi> it is true, he heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, while he preached of ordinary matter; but when <hi>John</hi> came to reprove him of his ſins, and told him he was an Adulterer, then he could not endure to hear <hi>John</hi> preach, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Many things in his exhortation did</hi> John <hi>preach to the people, but</hi> Herod <hi>the Tetrarch being reproved by</hi> John, <hi>for</hi> Herodias <hi>his brother</hi> Philips <hi>wife, and for all the evils</hi> Herod <hi>had done, he added yet this above all, to ſhut up</hi> John <hi>in priſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for their ſins. They love to hear ſome part of Gods wil, not all; the promiſing part, not the reproving part: this is no evidence of effectual calling. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.17, 18. There were ſome lying Propheteſſes that did preach, but what did they doe? <hi>They ſowed Pillows under mens elbows</hi>; and the Lord char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them for it, <hi>that they did hunt after their ſouls.</hi> To preach ſmooth Doctrines, and plauſible comfortable Doctrines, is but to ſow pillows, and hunt after mens ſoules.

               <p n="3">3. Hearing the word with delight, is no evidence of your effectual calling, in caſe this be a fickle and unconſtant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To delight to hear the word, becauſe the word comes in requeſt, becauſe there is no danger in hearing; this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may delight to do, when yet if times of perſecution ſhould ariſe, they would be fickle, and leave off their hearing. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. It is ſaid of the ſtony ground, that <hi>the ſeed that fell among ſtones, are they that receive the word with joy</hi> (there is their delight to hear) <hi>but not having deep root, in times of perſecution fell away.</hi> Here the Scripture Anatomizeth a man, that he may hear the word with joy ſometimes, when the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the times run for Religion, when the word comes in faſhion among a people; but if perſecution ſhould attend the word, and a priſon attend hearing, you would then ſee how flag their delights would be in hearing the word: and in this caſe you may delight to hear the word, yet be no evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In caſe your hearing be a ſelfiſh hearing: As now, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men may hear the word with delight: why? Becauſe they may get profit by hearing, and praiſe and vain-glory by hearing the word, and this may make them wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to hear. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1. <hi>There was an innumerable company went to hear Jeſus Chriſt, inſomuch the croud was ſo great, that one trod upon another to hear him</hi>: yet Chriſt ſaith of them, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. <hi>They come to hear me preach, but not for the word I teach, or the miracles I doe, but for the loaves they eat of.</hi> It was not love to Chriſts perſon, or his Miniſtry, but onely beaauſe

Here was a ſelfiſh end, and thus men may hear, yet have no evidence of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If your hearing be a divided hearing, and your delight a divided delight, this can be no Argument of your call.

Now, to have a divided love, to delight in ſin, as wel as in Ordinances, this can be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of effectual calling; and your hearing the word in theſe five caſes, is but a meer deluſion. But on the contrary, if your hearing be not a bare hearing, but with your delight in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you joyn practice: If it be not a partial hearing, but the commanding and reproving part as welcome as any other: If it be ſuch a hearing as is not ſelfiſh, ſuch a hearing in which you aim more at Gods glory then your own advantage: If theſe be the qualifications, then your delight in hearing the Word is an evidence of your effectual calling.</p>

                  </note>Yea, but you wil urge further, Though this be not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of our effectual calling, yet we can goe one ſtep high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33775:44"/>
We doe not onely delight to hear the word, but we love the godly who are effectually called to grace and glory; and if we love them, we hope it is argument that we alſo are called: and they urge that Scripture for it, <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to Life, if we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14.</p>
               <p>Now, to ſpeak to this: I anſwer, It is clear in Scripture, that every kind of love to the people of God, is no Argument of effectual calling, but there may be a feigned and a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit love, as wel as any other grace. Hence the Apoſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Let your love be without diſſimulation</hi>; import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that men may diſſemble their love as wel as any grace elſe. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word and in tongue onely, but in deed and in truth.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.22: <hi>Let there be unfeigned love to the Brethren:</hi> intimating that there may be a feigned and falſe love. So that every kind of love is no evidence of effectual calling. And this I ſhal make out by this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; becauſe there are ſeveral acts or expreſſions of love, that men who are not effectually called, may ſhew to be godly men. Now if a man uncalled, may ſhew many expreſſions and acts of love to a man converted, then meer ſhewing love to a godly man, is no Argument of your effectual calling. I ſhal reduce what I have to ſay unto ſix heads. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may be frequently in the company of godly men, yet not be effectually called; and ſo <hi>Demas</hi> was a companion with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſpel, yet he not called, but imbraced the world, and fel away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may ſpeak wel of the people of God. And this <hi>John</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let us not love in word, or in tongue.</hi> This lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in word and tongue, was to ſpeak wel of a godly man; this a wicked man may do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may write Letters of commendation in the behalf of a godly man. And ſo you read of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Wife, which the Scripture gives as no evidence of her converſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.19. She wrote a Letter to her Husband in the morning before he was to arraign Chriſt, and told him, <hi>Have nothing to do with the blood of this juſt man.</hi> Here you ſee ſhe wrote in the behalf of a good man, of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo we read of <hi>Claudius
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33775:45"/>
Lyſias,</hi> that he wrote a Letter in the behalfe of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour: Here were great acts of love, yet theſe no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their effectual calling. Nay,</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may think nothing too much to give to good men, yet not be called. And ſo did the <hi>Galathians,</hi> whoſe calling <hi>Paul</hi> queſtions, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.15. <hi>They would pull out their own eyes, and not think them too dear for Paul</hi>: Yet at length how cold they did grow, <hi>and count Paul their enemy, for telling them the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They may expreſſe ſuch love, that in times of danger they may take care of the ſafety of godly men. So <hi>Acts</hi> 23.27. <hi>Claudias L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſias,</hi> when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of his life, he came with an Army of men to reſcue him, that they ſhould not take away his life from him; and yet <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> lived and died a Heathen, for ought the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They may relieve the neceſſities of the godly, yet not be effectually called. Now here are high expreſſions of love, yet it is evident, all theſe may be, where calling is not.</p>
               <p>But now its true, in ſome caſes love to the people of God, may prove a good evidence of ones effectual call; to wit, if it have theſe four qualifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you love the people of God under this notion, becauſe godly, it is an evidence of your effectual call, becauſe there is good in them, more then becauſe you receive good from them. Hence it is <hi>John</hi> tels us wicked men may love a godly man, becauſe they have good from him. 2 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>To the elect Lady, whom I love in the truth, for the truths ſake dwelling in her. Iohn</hi> did not love the Lady, becauſe ſhe was a Lady, or becauſe ſhe was a goodly woman, but <hi>for the riuths ſake that dwelt in her.</hi> Whereas wicked men they love a godly man, but not as godly, under that notion. Therefore you ſhal ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Iohns</hi> love to a godly perſon, and <hi>Claudius Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> a man unconverted. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.27. <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> tels you there, <hi>that Paul was in danger of his life, and with an Army I reſcued him.</hi> Now why was it he did ſo? did he love <hi>Paul</hi> becauſe a godly man? no, for mark the next words: <hi>With
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33775:45"/>
an Army I reſcued him, becauſe it was told me he was a Roman.</hi> He loved <hi>Paul</hi> for his Nation, not for his converſion: had he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> as a Chriſtian, this were an Argument of grace; but to love <hi>Paul</hi> as a Roman, becauſe of Country and Nation ſake, this was no evidence of his call. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.46, 47. <hi>If ye love them that love you, what reward have you? doe not even the Publicans ſo</hi>; So that you ſee a wide difference between the love of a godly man, and of a wicked man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To meaſure your love to them by their graces, that you love that man moſt that hath moſt grace, that's an Argument of effectual calling, becauſe it is grace in the man, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe you love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If your love be univerſal to all that are godly, of what ſort or condition ſoever they be, this is an evidence of your effectual calling; for then '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is evident, that grace, as grace, is the object of your love.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to love a man ſo, as to carry compaſſion in your breſts towards him, to have a ſympathizing heart with him in his ſufferings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Suffer one with another, love as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> This ſhews your love to be true, when it hath pity and compaſſion to attend it.</p>
               <p>I paſſe now to a third deluſion,<note place="margin">Deluſ. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> which indeed is a main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and hath deceived many, ſpecially thoſe that profeſſe the Goſpel, to make them believe they are effectually called, when they are not. And that is, becauſe they diſcern a change in their converſation, that they are not the ſame men they were in dayes paſt; and hereby the Devil props up this perſwaſion, that ſurely they muſt needs be effectually called, and he alledges Scripture for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. Now this being ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal a deluſion amongſt moſt men in the world, that if they have hopes of heaven, it is upon this ground, that they are not the ſame now they were in times paſt. I ſhall therefore a little enlarge my ſelf in ſpeaking of this particular, and ſhall lay down ſix or ſeven particulars wherein I ſhall ſhew, that this ground taken in general, is no infallible evidence of a mans effectual calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:33775:46"/>Firſt, Becauſe there are many gradual changes, which do not come up, or amount to a ſaving change or alteration of the heart of man. As there as a change from a Pagan to a Chriſtian, ſo was <hi>Julian</hi> chang'd, yet a man never called by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n there is a change from a perſecuter to be a countenancer of Religion, ſo we read <hi>Valerius Maximinus</hi> was chang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, who was the vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt perſecuter of all men in his time, and the hand of God lying ſo ſore upon him for that ſin, that his very bowels rotted within him, and the very worms crept out of them, and in horrour of conſcience he cryed out to his Nobles about him, perſwading them by his example, to take heed never to perſecute the Chriſtians more. Now both theſe were great changes, and yet they are but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual changes, that leave men abundantly ſhort of thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving changes that God works in them that are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Thirdly, There is a change from prophaneneſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and yet this is a ſtep below a ſaving change. Fourthly, there is a ſtep from profeſſion into ſincerity, into a real poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now thoſe three ſteps they fall ſhort of a ſaving change, and therefore every change of life doth not not argue a man to be effectually called becauſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gradual changes that do not amount to ſo high a pitch as this, to be ſavingly changed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be a change in the life, when there is no change in the nature, or in the heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. they may <hi>waſh the outſide of the cup, when within it is full of pollution.</hi> The life may be changed, the external acts and courſe may be changed, when the heart may not be changed, and the nature the ſame ſtill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be a great change in a mans life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, not from a change in their nature, but from the times wherein they live: the times are changed, therefore they are changed; the times do not favour ſuperſtition, therefore they will not ſhew their ſuperſtitious hearts; the times counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance not profaneneſſe, therefore they will not be profane. Beloved, a change in a mans life may flow many times from a change of the times wherein they live, and yet this change no Argument of a heart change, or of effectual calling by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:33775:46"/>Fourthly, A change in your life may proceed from a change in your ſin, not from a change in your heart: As thus. A man may be a Drunkard, may be an Adultery, may be a profane liver in times paſt, and may change theſe ſinnes for other ſins. He may change his Drunkenneſſe into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and be a covetous Worldling. He may change his Adultery for Idolatry, and be a ſuperſtitious m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n. He may change Profaneneſſe into Hypocriſie, and be an hypocritical man. He may change his looſe practice into a looſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be an erroneous man. Now this is no change of the heart, but onely a change of the ſin; you have not the ſame ſins you had, but you have other ſins in place of them; and men may thus have a change in their life, flowing from a change in their ſin, yet no Argument of effectual c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lling. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Why gaddeſt thou ſo much to change thy way?</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> they would be alwayes changing, now they would be for God, anon for <hi>Baal</hi>; now for Gods true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, an on for falſe worſhip; they would be ever changing their ſin, but never leaving it, onely change their old ſins for other ſort of ſins. And ſo there are many men now adayes changed, they are turned from Malignity, and are come to be Profeſſors; it may be they have not ſo groſs ſins now, as in times paſt; in times paſt they would oppoſe Religion, and now they profeſſe it; though they have left their oppoſition, they have ſome ſin more eminent then that. Many men have been looſe in practiſe, they have changed that to be looſe in judgment; this is no change of heart all this while: ſo that take this for a truth, there may be a change in the life, when the heart remains unchanged ſtill.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There may be a change in mens lives, ariſing from a change in the occaſions to ſin, and not from a change in the heart: As now, A Lion that will go ramping and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down, devouring his prey when he is at large, yet put this Lion in a Den, there he is quiet, and will offer no hurt: now the Lion is a Lion ſtill, and hath his rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous diſpoſition ſtill, only he hath not ſo fair an occaſion to ſhew his rage. It is thus with men, many men want a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions and opportunities to ſhew their wickedneſs, and the evil
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33775:47"/>
of their natures, and therefore doe not diſcover them: What's the reaſon many a man was a drunkard before, and is not ſo now? It may be drunkenneſs hath brought begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and now he hath not money to ſit upon an Ale-bench. What's the reaſon a man was an Adulterer before, and is not ſo n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w? It may be he hath ſpent his ſtock, and ſpent his ſtrength upon Whores, and now he hath neither ſtrength nor purſe to follow after them. It is no thanks to you, if God take away your occaſions of ſinning: men may be thus changed, yet have no change in the heart at all.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Many men may change their lives, becauſe they come into better company, haply their company is better then in times paſt,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 12.2</note> and this may work in them a change in their lives. As we read of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> all the while he was in <hi>Jehojada</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he was a well ordered man in his life; but when he was dead, and he came to have wicked men about him, then he ſhewed the wickedneſs of his heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Every change is not an evidence of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe there may be a change in the life, proceeding from a wrong principle, and tending to a wrong end: As thus, a man may change his life from a wrong principle; what's that? I will name two wrong principles of a change in unconverted men. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Men may change their lives, becauſe of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent outward affliction that lies upon them in this life, their afflictions may inforce them to change their wayes, and not be ſo bad as in former dayes, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. when they were in a ſtorm in the ſhip, <hi>every man went and prayed to his God.</hi> What a change was here? yet the change was only becauſe of the danger, they were in danger of death, and therefore they grew religious: Every man when a danger and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies upon him, that will make him betake himſelf to God, and be a better minded man. And ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when God ſent ten ſore plagues upon him, the plagues did inforce <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to confeſſe his ſin, and beg of <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him; and yet this change in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was only becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affliction that lay upon him which wrought this change <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Oh Inhabitants of Lebanon, how gracious wilt thou
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33775:47"/>
be when thy pangs come upon thee?</hi> When pangs and afflictions were upon them, then they would be a gracious people. There is many a man will change his life, when God brings pangs, and death, and ſickneſſe upon him; theſe are forc'd wayes that God takes, to make a wicked and ſtout-hearted wretch change his life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.12. Its ſaid there, <hi>When Moab is weary, Moab will come to my Eanctuary and pray.</hi> What a change was here in <hi>Moab? Moab,</hi> an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous company, that hated Gods people, and were enemies to all goodneſs; yet when they were weary, and Gods hand lay heavy upon them, then they would pray, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.12, So that you ſee clearly, though men do change their lives, yet if this change flow only from a preſent affliction they lie under, that Gods hand upon them doth even force them to change their courſe; this is no Argument of a ſaving change, and ſo by conſequence no evidence of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men may change their courſe from this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo, becauſe of that horrour of conſcience that ſeizeth on them, in the apprehenſion of hell, and the wrath of God; and from this principle a Heathen may change his courſe. It is noted by one upon that place <hi>Peter, It happens unto them, as the Dog that turns to his vomit, &amp;c.</hi> Upon thoſe words he hath this note, That the Dog in vomiting, carries reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to a wicked man leaving his ſin. Now, ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, the Dog when he vomits, it is by reaſon of ſome qualm and pang that is in his ſtomack, and when he hath that pang, he will diſgorge himſelf, and eaſe himſelf by vomit; not as if he loathed his meat, but if he could free himſelf from thoſe pangs, he would fain have the meat in his body to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh him. Thus a wicked man, he may diſgorge and vomit up his ſins, and leave his ſins, but why? it is not becauſe he hates his ſins, no, he would keep them <hi>as a ſweet morſel under his tongue</hi>; but it is becauſe thoſe ſins cauſe horrour and trouble of conſcience, he cannot deceive, nor he cannot follow his luſts, but conſcience will follow him. Now if thou change thy ſin, only to ſtop conſciences mouth, and muzzle conſcience, this is no Argument of effectual calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:33775:48"/>
                  <note place="margin">Deluſ. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>Fourthly, Men are tempted by the Devil to nouriſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous perſwaſions, that they are effectually called when they are not, becauſe they are miſcalled and reproached by the men of this world. Now think they, I ſhould never be miſcalled and reproached by wicked men, if I were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by my God.</p>
               <p>Now to take off this briefly, I anſwer: Every reproach from wicked men, can be no argument of an effectual call from God, becauſe men may be miſcalled upon a twofold ground: There are ſome men <hi>ſuffer as Chriſtians, and ſome as evil-doers</hi>; we may ſuffer either for Chriſts ſake, or for our own ſakes: The diſtinction is laid down 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a murtherer, as an evil doer, as a Thief, as a Buſie-body in other mens matters; but if any man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed.</hi> So that ſome men may be puniſhed for their own evils they have done, and ſo ſuffer no more then they have deſerved; but other men ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for their profeſſion, becauſe they profeſſe Jeſus Chriſt. Now to ſuffer becauſe of your evil doings, this can be no evidence; but to ſuffer for Chriſt, meerly for profeſſing his name, this is an argument of effectual calling. Therefore Chriſt pronounceth thoſe bleſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are you when men ſhall revile you, and ſpeak evil of you for my ſake:</hi> This is an evidence of your effectual calling by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

And hence it is, that in that Popiſh Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> they made this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that if any man doth ſay,<note place="margin">Si quis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum teneri ex fide ad credendum ſe certò eſſe ex numero Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorum, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema ſit. Seſſ. <hi>6.</hi> Can. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> that he is bound of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is certainly in the number of Gods called ones, or juſtified ones, or elect ones, let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> let him be accurſed. That man that would ſo much as take this aſſurance to himſelfe, they would hold that man accurſed. And the reaſon why they doe it, is, becauſe they hold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther errour, to wit, falling from grace; which they could not maintain, did they not hold this alſo: This is the firſt extream.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another extream is of the <hi>Lutherans</hi>; they being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this point of aſſurance, to confute them who deny all aſſurance, they run into this extream, to hold that aſſurance is of the nature of faith, and whoſoever hath faith, hath aſſurance: but this is another extream, and an uncomfortable Doctrine for doubting Chriſtians, were it true. Therefore to keep this truth in the middle betwixt two extreams, I ſhall lay down this poſition by way of Anſwer: That though ſometimes perſons effectually called, may be without a particular aſſurance of their own call, yet this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is attainable by Chriſtians in this life; and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be aſſured of their own effectual calling. And this I ſhall prove by four Mediums.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Apoſtle injoyns it here in my Text, <hi>Give dilig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ce to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> Now this is a rule in Divinity, No man is bound to doe a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and therefore in that we are commanded and bound to doe it, it is clear that it is poſſible, and may be made ſure</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is the office of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt to work this particular aſſurance in the hearts of thoſe that are effectually called, that they are in the ſtate of grace, and ſhall be brought to glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33775:49"/>
the Spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>He that believeth, he hath a witneſſe in himſelf</hi>; a witneſs to his own ſoul that he doth believe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. There the Spirit is called <hi>a Seal; you are ſealed by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>; and verſe 14. it is called <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance.</hi> Now a ſeal, and earneſt, is to give more aſſurance to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and here the Spirit of God is given to Believers as a ſeal, and earneſt-penny, that as they have the firſt fruits in grace, they ſhall have their harveſt in glory. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us his Spirit.</hi> It is the office of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt to aſſure our hearts in this particular. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelfe beareth witness with our ſpirits, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Particular ſervants of God in Scripture, that have been partakers of this mercy, they have had this firm aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their effectual calling, I ſhall inſtance in three. Firſt in <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Scripture tels us of him, that he had a clear evidence of his effectual calling, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me, who loved me, and gave himſelfe for me.</hi> There he had a particular aſſurance that Chriſt loved him, and gave himſelf for him. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded alſo, that what I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, he will keep till the laſt day.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is a Crown laid up for me.</hi> Nay not onely <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Job</hi> alſo, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and</hi> I <hi>ſhall ſtand up before him at the laſt day</hi>: he knew Jeſus Chriſt was his Redeemer. And ſo <hi>David</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>Thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee. Pſal.</hi> 118.28. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Surely the goodneſſe and mercy of God ſhall follow me all the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es of my life.</hi> So that put theſe together: God commands it, it is the Spirits office to work aſſurance in the heart, and particular ſervants of God have had this aſſurance, therefore why may it not be obtained? But if you ſay, theſe were not ordinary ſervants of God, theſe were ſervants of a higher rank and form; but may ordinary weak Chriſtians know this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? Yes. Therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:33775:50"/>Fourthly, Not onely particular Saints have had this, but the people of God in General; they have declared in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that they have enjoyed this particular aſſurance of their effectual calling, and ſafety of their condition by Chriſt. Inſtance in a few. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Father.</hi> They made no doubt of it, they were ſo perſwaded they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſſe and ſtrength. Surely</hi>: a word of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they were aſſured they had righteouſneſſe for their juſtification in Chriſt Jeſus. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know, that if our earthly Tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building of God eternal in the heavens.</hi> They knew that when they died, they ſhould ſee God in Heaven; not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but other godly Chriſtians with him. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>You know in your ſelves, that God hath provided for you a better and more enduring ſubſtance.</hi> They were aſſured within themſelves, that when they ſhould die, or loſe their Eſtates here, God had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them a more enduring ſubſtance. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>Hereby we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before God.</hi> So ver. 14. <hi>We know we are tranſlated from death to life, &amp;c.</hi> So that what can be more clearly proved then this, that this aſſurance is to be attained in this life: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commands it, it is the Spirits office to work it, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtians have had it; and the people of God in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they have enjoyed and profeſt this Temper.</p>

Then how much too blame are our Adverſaries the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who hold their followers in ſuſpenſe, that they muſt live without the aſſurance of their own eſtate, that their ſoules muſt hang in fears and doubts all their dayes, that the moſt they can have is only a conjecture: Oh into what a gulph of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33775:50"/>
peradventure not; when the Scripture is ſo clear in this thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let not the thoughts either of the impoſſibility or the difficulty of attaining this aſſurance, diſcourage you from looking after it. It is not impoſſible, though it is difficult indeed; and the difficulty ſhould be ſo far from diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging you, that it ſhould quicken your endeavours, to make your calling and election ſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Seeing aſſurance is attainable in this life, enquire into the cauſe why you who are effectually called, have not attained this aſſurance before now. And this puts me upon handling of the ſecond caſe of conſcience, ſeeing this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is attainable, Therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, what is the reaſon that many Chriſtians who are called effectually by Jeſus Chriſt, do live in many doubts and fears about their effectual calling?</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to this I ſhall lay down theſe three particulars, that the doubts that do ariſe in Chriſtians about their calling they flow from this threefold fountain.</p>
               <p>Either firſt from ſome ſeeming defect they apprehend in the manner of their calling. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome ſeeming defect they apprehend to be in the means of their calling. Or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſome ſeeming defects they apprehend in the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts of their calling; and theſe three grounds are the riſe from whence many Chriſtians effectually called, do doubt of their call, and are not aſſured of it,</p>
               <p>Firſt, it doth ariſe from ſome ſeeming defect they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be in the manner of their calling: They ſay, I am not called in ſuch a manner a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I ſee others are. As thus. Think they, I ſee other men when they are converted, that their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations are great, I ſee that they have horrour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they are wrought upon by the terrors of the Law, that they are exceedingly humbled before God: Now for my part, I never found this manner of Gods working in my ſoul, I never found that I could ſee my ſins clearly, or could b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctually called or no. Now to take off this, I ſhall onely ſpeak three things by way of Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is true; God doth proceed after this manner with ſome, yet God is not ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d and confin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to one and the ſame way of working with all. What if he come to you in a calm, when he comes to others in a Tempeſt, if God come to me to you in a more peaceable and peaceable and quiet way? What if God do not pierce your heart, as he did thoſe 3000 in the <hi>Acts,</hi> if he kindly open thy heart like <hi>Lidia</hi>'s without noiſe? God is not to be tied to one and the ſame way in converting all. As 'tis ſaid <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> ſo how it liſteth alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You have no cauſe to doubt for this; becauſe it's Gods uſual manner to proceed after this way, only with ſuch men who have been looſe in their lives, who have been obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in their wils, who have been very ſcandalous in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation before their converſion and call. But it is not Gods uſual way to work thus upon Chriſtians who have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly brought up from their youth; it is not Gods way to dowſe them into ſuch a pit of horror, and plunge them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a depth of fears, that have been of a fair and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and moral life before their call. As you know it is with Carpenters, they give more blows to knot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y Timber, then they will do to ſmooth and tender wood; thus doth God when he meets with a knotty ſinner, a wretched ſtout-hearted ſinner, God muſt give many blows by humiliation, before he will be humbled, before he can bring him to be a ſerviceable piece in Gods building, whereas Chriſtians of a milde and ſofter temper, they ſhall have fewer blows, and ſhall not have the terrors of God ſtick ſo faſt in their hearts, as others ſhall. Hence you read that phraſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will hew them by my Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> God doth hew ſome men, hew them with judgments, and hew them with terrour: Yea, but others that are not ſo looſe as they: <hi>I taught Ephraim to go, I led Ephraim by the Arms, and I drew him with cords of a man, and with the bands of love, Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. God you ſee would hack and hew ſome men with terrour and wrath, but others
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33775:51"/>
he would draw with love, and the cords of a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God hath not hacked and hewed thee with judgments, if God melt thee with loving kindneſſe, and if God gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſoul with mercy, and with love and grace, thou muſt not blame God, thou muſt not confine God; for this is Gods way of working ſometimes, as well as by wrath. God works upon ſome with wrath; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he will allure others with loving kindneſſe; so that you have no cauſe or ground of fear that you are not effectually called, becauſe you apprehend ſome defects in the manner of your call; becauſe it is Gods uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way to plunge them in moſt humiliation, and moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that have been moſt wicked liv'd men before their call, and ſo ordinarily with men religiouſly trained up from their youth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God when he goes to call a ſinner to converſion, he looks upon the temper of thoſe that are to be called, and God ſees ſome men of a rugged temper, that their tempers will not be won but by wrath, and by fire, and by hell, and by judgment. And ſo it's like <hi>Felix</hi> was, his temper was ſuch that nothing could conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t him but wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, terrible Doctrines. Some are of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that nothing but wrath and hel-fire can work upon them. As children, there are ſome that are of ſuch ſoft and tender tempers that the ſhaking of a rod may doe them good; there are other children, if a man ſhould whip them every day, they would never leave their childiſh tricks: It is ſo with ſinners, God ſees ſome of a more tender and ſoft temper, that love will gain upon them; others are of a rugged diſpoſition, that nothing but wrath can affright them: Now God in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his grace, he obſerves their temper, and if he ſeeth love will gain more upon them then wrath will do, he will take that courſe; but if God ſee nothing but wrath, and fire, and horrour wil doe it, then he wil work that way. This you read in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 22, 23. <hi>On ſome,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>have compaſſion, making a difference; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> The meaning is this, There are ſome that you muſt ſhew tenderneſſe and compaſſion to; in calling and working upon them, they are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33775:52"/>
of a tend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r temper; but others there are that you muſt ſave with fear, that is, preach terrible Sermons to them, and fright them with hel-fire and judgment to come. For God doth obſerve the different tempers in men, and hereupon doth proceed in different wayes of Adminiſtration in working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Now it may be, thou that doſt thus complain, thou never hadſt theſe terrours in thy ſoul, and yet art effectually called, it may be God ſaw thy temper more to be won by kindneſſe,
and more gained upon in a way of love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrought upon thee this way; God is not bound to one way: And therefore we may juſtly count them blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy who preach onely free grace, and Gods love, and ſo tie God to one Method: and they are too blame on the other ſide likewiſe (if there be any ſuch) that preach only terror and wrath; for God obſerves the temper of mens diſpoſitions, ſome to be knotty, and ſome ſoft, and accordingly proceeds ceeds in his way of working with them. This ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for your doubts is inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond ground that makes men doubt of their effectual calling, is upon the apprehenſion of ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming defect that may be in the means of their calling. As thus: Think they, I have read in the Word, that it doth pleaſe God to uſe preaching as the ordinary means to call and convert ſinners to Chriſt. <hi>It pleaſed God by preaching to ſave them that beleeve.</hi> I read this alſo that <hi>faith comes by hearing.</hi> (Now many a poor ſoul hath this that gravels his conſcience, and troubles his ſpirit) but alas I finde a defect in this means. For my part I cannot ſay I was converted by hearing a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that which did work upon me was ſome other means. One of theſe three, either I was converted (ſaith one) by living in a godly family, among good Chriſtians, ſeeing their example, that firſt gained upon me: Or, ſaith another, I was gained upon by reading a Chapter in the Bible, or in ſome good Book, and that firſt wrought upon me: Or, ſaith a third, it may be, if it was the Word, it was the Word preached by a wicked man, that is now turned either erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in judgment, or prophane in practice: and this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneth a great deal of jealouſie. The word preacht by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33775:52"/>
the mouth of a godly Miniſter is Gods ordinary way, but I was altogether out of this way, and therefore this doth make him ſuſpect the truth of his effectual calling. Now Beloved, I beſeech you lend me your thoughts a little, for I would fain make this Doctrine as comfortable to every called one as I can. I ſhall ſpeak of all theſe in order, and ſhew you, that put caſe either of theſe have been the meanes of thy calling, yet thou haſt no reaſon to doubt of thine effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt thou ſuſpecteſt thy call, becauſe the means hath been, ſayeſt thou, not by hearing a Sermon, or the word preacht, but by living among good Chriſtians, and ſeeing their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and their living, thou cameſt by this means to love the wayes of God; and this was the firſt meanes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted thee. Beloved, I doubt not but I ſpeak to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that cannot ſay a Sermon ever converted them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were gained to Gods wayes, to imbrace the truth, this way: now what ſhall I ſay to ſuch men as theſe? why, I would ſay thus much; that though the Lord did not uſe his Word preached, the ordinary meanes of converting ſoules, in calling thee, yet God is not tied and bound up to his word preacht, but he may uſe other means to convert thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, that living among good people, and ſeeing of their example both in life and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we finde in Scripture to be a very efficatious meanes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to convince, ſometimes to convert; and if you can finde out this in Scripture, you may have abundance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. It hath been a means oftentimes to convince, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They ſhall be aſhamed to ſpeak evil of you, while they behold your converſation in Chriſt.</hi> When they ſhall ſee that you live-in Chriſt, and walk according to Chriſt, they ſhall be aſhae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med; aſhamed of what they have done, and what they have ſpoken; it ſhall convince them. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. And the Apoſtle when he ſpeaks of the orderly and regular mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the worſhip of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23.25. <hi>If there comes an unbeliever among you, and he ſees your order</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſhall fall down in the midſt of you, he ſhall be convinced, and ſhall ſay,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33775:53"/>
Of a truth God is among you.</hi> Seeing this, (ſaith the Apoſtle) godly men holy in their lives, and holy in their worſhip, though he be an unbeleiver, he ſhall fall down and ſay, Of a truth God is among you: that is, by way of conviction. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes God doth bleſſe the gracious lives, and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe example of Chriſtians to be a means to convert ſome, when the Goſpel cannot do it; and you would think this very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, could it be made good. I would commend but one Text of Scripture to you, to prove what a bleſſing it is to live in a good family, where either husband or wife, or any one in the family is godly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Wives be ſubject unto your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi> what then? <hi>that your husbands that are not wonne by the Word, may be wonne without the Word, whileſt they behold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of their wives.</hi> A notable text, There were many wicked Husbands, that all the Sermons they heard would not convert them; yet the Apoſtle tells them, that if the wife did live a godly and holy life, their lives ſometimes ſhould be more efficatious to convert their Husbands, then the Word ſhould be. And this, Beloved, doth clearly take off this firſt plea of yours, that becauſe you were converted by example, and by living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong good Chriſtians, and ſeeing their walkings, this gained upon you; this is no cauſe of diſcouragement, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (I ſay) the Lord doth bleſſe examples of gracious lives, to make them winne and gain upon men that are brought home to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they go yet further, There is another poor ſoul brought home to Jeſus Chriſt, and what ſaith he? I do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt the means of my call, for a Sermon never wrought upon me; the firſt thing of all that ever gained upon me, it was the reading ſome Chapters in the Bible, or ſome other holy mans book, and that made me firſt to hate ſin, and love the waies of God, and look after his Word for my ſalvation. And here I doubt not but many Chriſtians have found the Word read the firſt means of gaining upon their hearts. And therefore to take off this likewiſe, I ſhall ſpeak two or three things in way of Anſwer. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, that God is not tyed to any means, but can work with the meaneſt means to bring home people to Jeſus Chriſt. If

                  <hi>Peters</hi> converſion was by a Cock; a Cock crowing, and a look of Chriſts eye, why may not Chriſt uſe the Scriptures read to be a means of a mans call? If from ſtones God can raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> why cannot <hi>God</hi> do it by the Word alſo? to make the Word read a means in his own hands to effect it? God that can do all things with nothing, without means, can bring to paſſe great things by weak means.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, That though ordinarily preaching, and hearing of the Word preached be ordained by God, and crowned by him cheifly to be a means inſtrumental to convert ſouls, yet God ſometimes hath bleſſed the reading of the Word to be a means of converting ſouls likewiſe. Yet, Beloved, I would not do as the Prelates did, who would fain have brought in reading to juſtle our preaching. Preaching is the more noble work, and muſt be higheſt in our thoughts, yet if God will go out in an unuſual way, who can control him? If God will do it by a Chapter read, when not by a Sermon preached, who can reſiſt God? if he will ſhew his power by weaker means. Who ſhal gainſay it? God ſometimes honours the reading of the Word, to give encouragement to reading, to be a means of ſome mens call. I have read of S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> that he was converted, not by hearing a Sermon, but by opening the Bible, and reading that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Let us walk honeſtly as in the day time, not in rioting and drunkeness, not in chambering and wantouneſſe:</hi> and the reading of this verſe wrought upon him. I have read of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by reading the Propheſie of <hi>Jonas,</hi> hearing of Gods mercy to ſave ſuch a wicked people, and of Gods mercy to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> when he was in ſo pettiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a mood as to be angry with God. I have known likewiſe another famous Miniſter, that going by a Book-binders ſhop, he was converted by reading a Sermon of Repentance that coſt but two pence; and hath been a famous Miniſter ſince for the converſion of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Junius</hi> was converted by reading the firſt of <hi>John</hi>; ſo the Eunuch was converted by reading <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. Beloved, God is not bound to any one way in ſaving man; He that wrought upon <hi>Auſtin</hi> by a verſe reading, and upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Sermon, he can do ſo by thee. Reading is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33775:54"/>
of God, and God is not bound up, but may uſe that as a means of thy effectual call likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yea but, ſaith another doubting ſoul, Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I was never wrought upon, neither by ſeeing godly people among whom I lived, and obſerving their example, nor was I wrought upon by reading good books; but I was firſt wrought upon by hearing ſuch a Miniſter, that I now ſee is run into error; or a Miniſter that is grown looſe in his practice, (hapily in theſe preſent times gone to joyn with the enemy againſt the Kingdom) and become a vile liver; and the Miniſter being bad that wrought upon me, makes me queſtion, whether the work be not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and bad work alſo, and this gravels many a Chriſtian likewiſe. To which I anſwer briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſuppoſe the Miniſter were bad that wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, yet the badneſſe of the Miniſter is no juſt ground of making us ſuſpect our calling. For then we ſhould never be ſure of our call. A man may be ſure of his own converſion, though a man may not be ſure of the converſion of him by whoſe means he was called.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Again in is clear in Scripture, God may uſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that are wicked themſelves to convert others. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> doubtleſſe ſome of them were bad men; <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. <hi>I keep under my body, leſt when I preach to others, I my ſelf may be a caſtaway.</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that a man may preach to others, and may be a means to ſave others, and yet not be ſaved himſelf. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in this caſe may be as Cooks are. A Cook may dreſſe many a diſh, and let them go through his hands to furniſh a large and ſtately Table, yet of all theſe diſhes himſelf hardly taſte one; So Miniſters, they may dreſſe many a diſh for their hearers, yet they not lick their fingers, or taſte of this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al food themſelves. As in the building of the Ark, there were many men built <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, to ſave others, that were drowned themſelves; ſo many men may build an Ark by preaching the Word, and the waies of God to ſave other mens ſouls, when they may be drowned themſelves. Hence it is the Scripture tells us of Stars that fell from heaven; many Miniſters, that ſeemed godly Miniſters, like Stars in their Generation, yet they fell,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33775:54"/>
and became wicked and looſe. And I remember Doctor <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleton</hi> a famous Miniſter in the daies of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and a man whoſe Miniſtry had converted many Chriſtians, yet at length he himſelf turned to be a Papiſt. Now theſe Chriſtians did never miſdoubt or ſuſpect their converſion, becauſe the man that converted them, was a bad man; They might be good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though he was a bad Miniſter: ſo that this is no ground in the world; though I confeſſe it is not ordinary, that God makes wicked men means of converſion, but God ordinarily crowns the Word moſt in the mouth of a godly Miniſter, yet ſometimes I ſay, God may uſe a means to convert ſouls. And I would give you theſe reaſons to prove, that a wicked man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſouls, and that God ties not converſion to a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Becauſe firſt, the efficacy of the word doth not depend upon men, but upon Jeſus Chriſt; and Chriſt may make uſe of whom he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If only a good man could convert, then this would follow, that we could be as well ſure of another mans converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we are of our own; which is a thing moſt untrue. For if only a godly man could convert, then if I were ſure of my own converſion, I were as well ſure of his converſion that wrought upon me alſo; which cannot be, ſo that clearly this ſhould lay no block in your way becauſe you diſcern the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that wrought upon you to be no good man, ſeeing conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not tied onely to a godly Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a third ground from whence doubts ariſe in called ones, is from ſome ſeeming defects they apprehend to be in the concomitants that acompany, or in the effects that ſhould follow effectual calling: and this makes them fear, that ſure they are not effectually called. I will name to you three or four.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (ſaith a doubting Chriſtian) I do hear in Scripture what effects will follow, and what will accompany a man effectually called, and I finde them not wrought in my ſoul. As now firſt, I apprehend that when a man is effectually called, he ſhall be inabled by God to call upon him in prayer: I finde in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. That <hi>all that are called to be Saints, they ſhall call upon the Lord in every place</hi>; but alas, woe is me, I do not finde this in my ſoul. I finde I have a dull, dead, liſtleſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praying
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33775:55"/>
heart all the daies of my life; and therefore I doubt whether I am effectually called or no. Now to this I ſhall lay down three things for anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, peradventure you judge that you are not enabled to pray, becauſe you want expreſſions in prayer, though you have affections. Now if you judge your inability to pray, becauſe you want expreſſions only, you judge amiſſe, becauſe prayer is to be judged by the affections, not by the expreſſions. Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they are but the breath of nature, a natural voluble tongue may tumble out expreſſions; whereas affections in prayer, they are the breath and fruit of the holy Spirit. Therefore do not judge you cannot pray, becauſe you have not ſuch fluent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as others uſe, for the very eſſence of a prayer lies in the heart, and therefore it is ſaid, when the Spirit of God teacheth men to pray, it teacheth them not onely in expreſſions, but <hi>with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered. Rom.</hi> 8.26. When the Spirit moves the heart, and makes you ſigh out your requeſts, and ſorrow out your ſupplications, you pray beſt of all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you that judge your inablity to pray, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think you are not called, becauſe you cannot call upon God, I would ſay this unto you: That the beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have found a great difference in their ſpirits in reference to paying duties; the beſt of Gods children do not alwaies pray alike. Sometimes the affections of godly men are as ſwift in prayer, as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab</hi>; otherwhiles they drive as heavily as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots when the wheels were off. Sometime the people of God are burning in their affections, hot as fire; otherwhiles they are frozen in their affections, cold as ice. None of Gods people are in their carriage alwaies alike towards God in prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Aſaph, O Lord, my ſpirit is overwhelmed within me, I am ſore troubled, I cannot ſpeak.</hi> The man was ſo troubled, he could not ſpeak, yet <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſpake theſe words with his mouth; but the meaning is, though <hi>Aſaph</hi> was a godly man, yet he was ſo overwhelmed with trouble, he could not ſpeak to God, he could not call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God with that inward vigor of ſpirit. Though thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſometime call upon God with affection, yet when trouble reſts upon thee, thy heart may be out of frame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:33775:55"/>Thirdly, many times Gods people are ſubject to a ſtate of deſertion, and abatements in their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iritual affections, and then they are out of a praying vein; when you looſe affections, the wheels of prayer are knocked off. Many times it falls out with Gods people, that they are even brought into a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and low condition, they are in ſuch a ſwoune as if they had neither a principle, nor the actings of ſpiritual life. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Strengthen that which remaines,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt; <hi>that is ready to die.</hi> Godly people may be a dying people, and then the tongue failes, when it is a dying: the people of God may be in a dying condition; though they never die wholly in grace, yet they may be ſo weakned in their ſpirits, that they cannot pour out their requeſts to God as in wonted time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Jehoſophat he walked in the firſt waies of David his father</hi>: implying that <hi>Davids</hi> firſt waies were better then his laſt. So many men may have their firſt waies good, yet ſometime in the end before they die, they may have much failing, and deadneſs of ſpirit upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If a man doth but mourn, that he cannot call upon God, God looks upon that as calling upon him. If you can but ſigh out your requeſts, and mourn that you cannot mourn, and pray that you might pray; the Lord hears your prayer. This is the moſt melodious muſick you can make in the ears of God. Therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping</hi>: There is a voice in Teares, as well as in Words. If the Lord ſee thee to weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thine own ſtreightneſſe, and mourn over thine own dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Lord looks upon this with a more pleaſing eye, then if thou couldſt pour out the enlargements of thy tongue, with moſt fluent and voluble expreſſions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine I am yet upon, is this, <hi>That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſoules, that they are effectually called by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the proſecution of which I have gone over many particulars, and anſwered ſome doubts, in reference to godly men who are effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

               <p>Secondly, They apprehend that thoſe that are effectually called, they have this to accompany their calling, that they are brought out of a ſtate of ignorance into a ſtate of knowledge, out of a ſtate of darkneſſe into a ſtate of light; hence they will urge this againſt themſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ye are to ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alas, my heart is like a dungeon of darkneſſe, and like a houſe that hath no inlets, no windows to let in the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel upon it: and many times

this gravelleth many a godly minde. Now to thoſe that make this doubt, I ſhall onely ſpeak two or three things to take it off.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, to you that make this complaint, I would ſay this: that thoſe that know moſt, they know but little in the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt; as you are not perfect in other graces, ſo you are not here perfect in knowledge; <hi>You know but in part.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. therefore you have no need to be diſcouraged at this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, you that complain of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; though you are ignorant, and cannot finde that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light ſhine in your ſouls, which you exſpect, yet if your ignorance have not theſe three ill qualities, you may reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident your ignorance will never prove a damning ſin unto you, but it may be conſiſtent with your effectual calling; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, If your ignorance be not a ſtubborn and wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Secondly, If it be not a ſottiſh and brutiſh ignorance. And thirdly, If it be not a fundamental ignorance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be not a ſtubborn and wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Though you are ignorant, yet if you are willing to learn, and know the waies of God revealed in his Word, ſuch an ignorance will never damn you: But when ignorance comes to be wilful, that a man doth not know, and he will not learn; a man is an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man yet he thinks he knows more then all the Preachers can tell him; this is a ſad ſign you are not effectually called Hence you read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will you lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſimplicity, &amp;c</hi>? Godly people may be in a ſtate of ignorancee but they love it not; therefore, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. the Scripture tells, us of wicked men, that <hi>they are wilfully ignorant.</hi> So that if your ignorance have not this bad quality in it, to be a ſtubborn and wilful ignorance, it may ſtand with your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Provided that your ignorance be not a ſottiſh and brutiſh ignorance; that is, that you do not ſo lie clouded in a ſtate of darkneſſe, that you are uncapable to diſcerne the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Word, and uncapable to apprehend any thing that is taught you; that you are not like thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>My peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no underſtanding, they are a ſottiſh people, wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no underſtanding.</hi> Many men are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, yet not ſo ſottiſhly ignorant, as not to be capable of learning; if you will teach him, he is willing to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In caſe your ignorance be not a fundamental ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, I mean ſuch an ignorance, as not to know thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and fundamental points in the Word, that muſt be known, if ever you be ſaved; as about Jeſus Chriſt and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and juſtification by his blood, and faith in his Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, &amp;c. though you may be ignorant about circumſtantials, yet if it be not in fundamentals your ignorance may be conſiſtent with effectual calling. But now</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a godly man be ſatisfied in theſe two points, and thinks happily I may have the firſt concomitant to call upon God, and ſo evidence my effectual call; and then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the ſecond may not be wanting in me, that I do not lie under the ſtate of a wilful ſottiſh &amp; fundamental ignorance. But alas ſaith he, I want a third concomitant that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies effectually calling, and that is; I finde in the Word, that they that are effectually called, they are brought into an Obediential frame of heart to all the wayes of God, that what ever God commands them to do, their hearts can readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and this I finde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.6. <hi>God hath called them by his grace unto the obedience of faith.</hi> Now alas, ſaith a poore ſoul I finde a defect in this concomitant likewiſe, I cannot diſcern that I am called to an obedience flowing from faith as its prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciple, I cannot finde this frame of heart to be in me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt of my effectual calling. This I ſhall labour to take off likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When I ſay that obedience is a concomitant that will accompany one effectually called, I do not ſay nor intend it of obedience in the actings of it, but of obediential frame of ſpirit in the purpoſes of it. Many men may be effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when they may not alwayes live in the acting of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, but every man effectually called hath an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent frame of heart; that is, he hath purpoſes &amp; intentions and reſolutions to obey God, though he cannot act what he would do; he hath obedience in the habit, and obedience
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33775:57"/>
in his purpoſes and reſolutions always attending him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you find in Scripture, that the ſtrongeſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Chriſtians who have done moſt for God, have ſometimes been very defective in the Actings of obedience, that they could not do what they would do for God. And therfore <hi>Paul</hi> complaines, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The good that we would do, we cannot do. Paul</hi> himſelf that was a pillar in Gods houſe, yet he tels you, he could not go out in thoſe Actings of obedience which in his heart he would do; &amp; therefore if you would willingly do more then you do, God accepts of the little you do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though you can not put forth many Actings of obedience to God; where there is readineſſe of mind and heart, God accepts the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a note <hi>Perkins</hi> hath upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he ate graſſe like a beaſt; he writing upon that place thinks, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was in a deep Melancholy, and that did ſo poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe him, that he could not tell whether he was a man or a beaſt, though ſaith he, he did not eat graſſe, but his deep perplexity ſeazing upon him did make him think that he was from a man turned into a Beaſt. Beloved, Melancholy in a Chriſtian, it will make him think himſelf an Hypocrite, when he is a Saint; and therefore take heed of a Melancholy, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and ſad temper; it is a very great hinderance to this grace of aſſurance. This I lay down only as a Natural remedy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A mind filled with worldly cares, and running into incumbring imployments in the world, this is a great hindrance of aſſurance. The cares of this life, Mat. 13.15. are compared to thorns: Now thornes they choake the ſeed, by drawing the juyce that is in the ſeed to themſelves, and ſo the Corn doth not grow, where thorns ſpring. The cares of this life they are like thorns in this, they are of an attractive power to ſuck and draw the juyce of your ſpirits and comforts to themſelves, ſo that you cannot have the juyce of your ſpirits in gathering your evidences for heaven; the more incumbred you are in the world, the leſſe clear you will be touching the evidence of your elerlaſting condition; The cares of this life, <hi>they peirce the ſoul through with many ſorrowes.</hi> Now when a man is pierced through with many ſorrows, he is in a very unfit temper to be raiſed up in ſpiritual joy; the more you incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your ſelves in the employments of this world, the leſſe you will be in the comforts of heaven. I remember it was the ſpeech of a Pope when he lay a dying, When I was a painful preaching Miniſter, then I had hopes of my ſalvation; when I came to be a Cardinal, I doubted of it: but when I came to be a Pope, I deſpaired of it; I was ſo entangled in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irs of this life: Beloved, ſo I may ſay to you, When you were but ordinarie Chriſtians in the world, you were in a way to get aſſurance of your ſalvation, but ſince you have been taken up with the affairs of the world, it doth ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract

your minde, that y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d temper to have any ſetledneſſe of heart about your everlaſting eſtate. It is the obſervation of Philoſophers, that the Sun is eclipſed by the interpoſition of the Moon, the Moon coming between the Sun and our ſight: Beloved, the Sun of your comforts comes to be eclipſed by the Moon, (which is made an Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9.) Now if the Moon of the world comes between your comforts and you, it will miſerably darken and eclipſe your comforts to you. Nothing in the world doth ſo much impede your comfort in aſſurance, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbring and carking cares about the things of this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take heed you do not harbour the guilt of any one known ſin upon your conſcience. Keeping of ſin upon the conſcience, is a great impediment to your inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. You will never be aſſured while you do thus; and therefore if ever you would have aſſurance, remove this. It is an obſervation of Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12, 14. What doth <hi>David</hi> do, when he prayes for aſſurance? ſaying, <hi>Reſtore to me the joyes of thy ſalvation, eſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit</hi>; Reſtore my comforts, and my evidences to me. And what courſe doth he take? Read verſe 14. <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltineſſe, O Lord:</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, All the while that ſin lay upon conſcience unrepented of, (as it did for nine monthes together) all that while <hi>David</hi> loſt the joyes of the Spirit, and loſt the comforts of Heaven; And therefore when he comes to renew his comforts, and reſtore his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he doth with begging of God for aſſurance, beg of God alſo to deliver him from blood-guiltineſſe; as knowing, that if this ſin ſhould be upon conſcience unrepented of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, he ſhould never have the joyes of Gods Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Beloved, you will never have aſſurance of your effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, till your conſciences are freed from having ſin upon them with approbation. It is an obſervation that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> hath about earth-quakes, that they are occaſioned by winde got into the Caverns and hollow places of the earth; which having no place for vent again, it makes rupturs, and overturns houſes and mountains and all before it: Sin upon the conſcience unrepented of, is like winde in the earth, it will
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33775:59"/>
make a heart quake there, that there ſhall not be that calmneſs, and quietneſſe, and ſetledneſſe of minde which there would be, were ſin away. Hence we read, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>6. <hi>The ſinners in Sion are afraid, and fearfullness hath ſurpriſed the Hypocrite.</hi> The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are afraid; thoſe who had guilt upon them, their ſins bred terrour and fear; and hypocrites that are conſcious to themſelves of their own guilt, fearfulneſſe ſurpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is juſt with God it ſhould be ſo; becauſe if you keep ſin in your hearts, that will be ever jarring with Heaven, it is juſt with God to be at oddes with you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Avoid the eaſting of your eye, in a way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, upon others, who are more eminent in grace then you, and have got a precedency of you in the wayes of godlineſſe. 'Tis true indeed, a man that is given to ſpiritual pride, and ſelf-conceitedneſſe touching his own goodneſſe, it is fit that he ſhould look upon thoſe that have a precedency before him in grace, the more to humble him: But for a man that lies under trouble of minde, and doubtings touching his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting eſtate, that man ſhould not look upon others more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then he in grace, becauſe it will rather increaſe diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, then any way work aſſurance in you. If you look up-the glittering beames of the Sun ſhinning in its full ſtrength, the more you look upon that orient and reſplendent body, the more it will dazle your eyes, that you can behold but dimly things upon the earth: It is ſo with Chriſtians; ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans they ſhine like ſo many Suns in the firmament, their graces do ſo ſhine and ſparkle, that if you look upon them, they will even dazle your eyes, and make you blinde, that you cannot ſee thoſe ſmall ſcantlings and ſparks of grace that are in your own hearts. In caſe therefore you would get aſſurance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the caſting of your eye too much upon thoſe that have a precedency in grace before you.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed you make not ſenſe and feeling the Touchſtone to try your effectual calling by; ſenſe and feeling will deceive you in the matters of your calling. I may allude

You may think when you have <hi>Jacob</hi> by the hand, I mean grace in the heart, that it is but an <hi>Eſau,</hi> it is but a reprobate. Therefore take heed of making ſenſe and feeling the Touchſtone to try your calling by. A childe is born, yet knows not that it is born; lives yet knowes not that it lives; but thoſe about it do: ſo a Chriſtian may be born again, live the life of grace, and yet not be ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Give diligence to remove this hinderance, to wit, Pride in your guifts, and dependance upon you graces. Pride and dependance, they are not onely murderers of comforts, but they murder our graces alſo; and if God ſees you ſwell with pride, becauſe you abound in grace, he will ſoon prick that ſwelling bladder. It is the obſervation of a Modern Divine, that exaltings of ſpirit after aſſurance attained, it will inevitably expoſe a Chriſtian, either to great diſcomforts, or to great ſins. Hence the Scripture makes mention, that pride of your gifts is not onely an enemy to the comfort, but an enemy to grace; not onely an enemy to the comforts from grace, but to the very having of grace. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>If a mans heart be exalted, his ſpirit is not upright within him.</hi> James 4.6. <hi>God reſiſts the proud, and gives grace to the humble.</hi> So that pride is not onely an enemy to your comforts, but to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry getting of grace likewiſe; when the branches of a Vine grow luxuriant, they ſhall have the pruning hook. And thus you have the firſt ſort of helps laid down to you; In caſe you would get aſſurance, you muſt uſe diligence to avoid thoſe things that may be a hinderance to you in getting aſſurance of your call.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond ſort of helps in caſe you would get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, is to uſe diligence in the practice of thoſe things that may be helps and furtherances to the obtaining of aſſurance about your effectual calling. And here I ſhall name onely ſix or ſeven particulars.</p>

                  </gap> feelings, If ſo be that you will once enter the liſts to diſpute with the devil, he will out-cavill you, and <hi>Non-plus</hi> you. The devil is a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Logician, and it is not ſafe, ſaith Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> to argue with the devil; the devil will out-diſpute, and out-argue you. It is a Chriſtians work to exalt arguments of Faith againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feelings. In caſe you would get aſſurance, you are to do as <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful did, when he was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing that ſenſe and reaſon would tell him ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to paſſe; It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19. That <hi>in hope he believed againſt hope.</hi> He would exalt faith againſt ſenſe. And how was it? God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a childe; reaſon and ſenſe would have told <hi>Abraham, Abraham,</hi> thou art a hundred years old, thy wife ninety nine, her womb is barren, and it is not likely you ſhould have children; but <hi>Abraham</hi> would not argue thus, but would exalt arguments of faith, and apply Gods Promiſes, and Gods Word, exalting theſe; <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe in hope againſt hope. Beloved, ſo muſt you: though you ſay you have barren womb, Grace is not likely to grow in you, and though you are old, and decrepit, and feeble Chriſtians, yet advance arguments of faith from Gods love, and from Gods power, and from Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and Gods Promiſes, and that's the way to get your comforts clear and full. I may apply what <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts and Monuments reports of a good woman, that was called before <hi>Bonner,</hi> and the reſt in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign that ſate in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about her Religion; they ſee her, though a poor and ſilly woman, yet keep firm to her principles, and would not deny her Religion.

Beloved I would have you anſwer the devil thus.

               <p>Secondly, Keep conſcience clear, that no ſin be harboured there, and you are in the way to get your comforts full. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, will ſpeak peace to his people, but they muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto folly.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, though God doth ſpeak peace, and aſſure you of your pardon and ſalvation; yet if you return to ſin, God can tell how to break your peace, and turn his ſmiles into frowns and angry looks. Take heed of ſin, and keep your conſcience clear, and thats the way to have peace ſetled in thine heart. <hi>Job</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſſe dwell in thy Tabernacle.</hi> What follows? <hi>and then ſhalt thou lift up thy face before God without ſpot, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and ſhalt not fear.</hi> A ſtrange expreſſion, That if you will keep ſin far away, then you ſhall be ſtedfaſt before God, and not fear; that is, you ſhall not be expoſed to thoſe fears and doubts and anxieties which other men are expoſed to. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw neer to God with an upright heart, in full assurance of faith.</hi> Now what ſhall a man doe to come to God in full aſſurance? Mark the next words, <hi>Draw nigh to God in full assurance of faith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience.</hi> Here is the way, if you are ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, you may be bold to come to God in full aſſurance. Whereas, alas, if thy conſcience tell thee thou art a Whoremaſter, and thou art a deceiver, and a liar, and looſe liver, thou canſt not come with full aſſurance; thou mayeſt come in preſumption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not with the aſſurance of faith: and therfore keep a

conſcience clear from harbouring guilt upon it, and that's the way to have the heart full of joy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Be diligent in keeping company with the moſt godly experienced Chriſtians where you live, this is a very ſpecial way to encreaſe your comforts. Ye read an excellent paſſage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> that famous Martyr, who was in priſon about his profeſſion of Chriſt, the ſtory ſaith, he lay a long time under trouble of minde, and horrour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he could not finde a real and clear evidence of his effectual calling: there came many men to him, and could not ſettle him. Yet a poor Weaver, an ancient and experienced Chriſtian, that did uſually accompany Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by his frequent communion with this poor man, he got more inward comfort then ever he got all his life before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this I ſpeak to you to make you the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to ſtudy the the worth of godly ſociety, and the more you are converſant with Chriſtians that live in the enjoyment of the light of Gods countenanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and in the aſſurance of his favour all the day long, the more you are in the ready way to encreaſe your comforts and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Submit thy ſelfe to the approbation of others, and be willing to have them paſſe a verdict upon thee. When thou art aſleep or in a ſwoun, then thou canſt not tell thy ſelf what thou doſt, but others muſt tell thee; So it may fall out with the godly; they may be in ſuch a ſpiritual ſwoun, that they are not fit judges of their own condition; in this caſe ſubmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:33775:61"/>Fifthly, live in the dayly improvement of grace, and that's the way to get aſſurance. And this meanes the Holy Ghoſt layes down in the Chapter out of which my Text is taken, <hi>Adde grace to grace.</hi> And I remember that <hi>Beza</hi> upon this Text doth write, that in the Greek Tranſlations theſe words are put in, <hi>Give diligence by good works to make your calling ſure</hi>: whether it be ſo or no, I cannot affirm, but this I am ſure of, and the context will clearly prove it, that the way to make your calling ſure, is to adde grace to grace. For after the Apoſtle had ſpoken of adding grace to grace, he comes in with this, <hi>Give diligence to make your calling ſure</hi>: Implying, that the more you live in the actings of grace, the more you ſhall live in the enjoyment of comforts. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The works of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace.</hi> Not the habit, but the work; if you act righteouſneſſe, and live in the workings and thrivings in grace, this ſhall be peace, and the effect of it qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe and aſſurance for ever. So <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>The more you pray, the more you encreaſe your joy.</hi> So that the more you live in the improvement of grace, the more likely way you are in to get aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If you would get aſſurance, ſpend more time in ſtrengthening your evidences for heaven, then in queſtioning of them. It is the great fault of many Chriſtians, they will ſpend much time in queſtioning and not in ſtrengthening their comforts. They will reaſon themſelves into unbeliefe, and ſay, Lord, why ſhould I beleeve? why ſhould I take hold of a promiſe, that am ſo unholy and ſo unmortified a creature? And ſo by this they reaſon themſelves to ſuch a paſſe, that they dare not lay hold upon Chriſt; whereas it ſhould be your work to reaſon your ſelves into Chriſt as much as you can. Labour to ſtrengthen your comforts, and reaſon thus, Why ſhould I not beleeve in Chriſt? Thus <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>Why art thou troubled O my ſoule, and why art thou caſt down within me?</hi> Is not the mercy of God more then ſin in the creature? Is not there free grace where there is guilt?

of them. You would count him a very unwiſe man, that hath a Leafe of much land, and he himſelfe ſhall create ſcruples and doubts, and ſhall uſe no meanes to make his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good: And truly many Chriſtians are as unwiſe for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; they have, as I may ſay, good bond and ſeal that God will bring them to heaven, and yet they will queſtion, and cavil themſelves into unbeliefe. Beloved, this ſhould not be, but you ought rather to ſtrengthen your comforts, then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Be diligent in the earneſt ſtudy of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: Beloved, all a Chriſtians doubts ariſe from ignorance of the Covenant of grace. And here that I may ſpeak a little to it, I beſeech you follow me, ſtudy the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; which if you do, you ſhall diſcern five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar props in it to bear up your hearts againſt diſcomforts, and to ſtrengthen you in a way of aſſurance touching your effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all call.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Covenant of works it commands perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon pain of damnation; but the Covenant of grace doth command and accept of imperfect obedience, if it be ſincere: there's your firſt prop.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Covenant of works is not contented with good deſires, unleſſe there be good works; the Covenant of grace áccepts the good will and good deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res; when the deed is wanting, and is content with the will for the deed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Covenant of works doth require that you ſhould obey the will of God perfectly in your own perſon; the Covenant of grace requires onely that you obey in the perſon of Chriſt; ſo Chriſt obeys for you, it is accepted, though you do not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Covenant of works requires you to obey the whole will of God by your own ſtrength; the Covenant of grace accepts of it, though not our own ſtrength, but the ſtrength of Chriſt be put forth in doing any ſpiritual action.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Covenant of works requires the performance of the condition, before it gives the Promiſe; As, <hi>Do this and live</hi>; you cannot live, ſaith the covenant of works, without you doe this: but the covenant of grace, it firſt tenders the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33775:62"/>
Promiſe, and then requires the condition: Bids you firſt take Chriſt, and firſt believe, and then ſhew forth the effects of faith. Firſt, lay hold upon the promiſe, and then hold forth and practice the condition of that Promiſe. Firſt believe, and then take Chriſt, though thou art unworthy, and a wretched creature, if after taking of him thou wilt be conſciencious to practice thoſe obligations that lies upon thee, and I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thee. Now would you lay theſe to your heart, to ſtudy that vaſt difference between the Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace, doubtleſſe theſe would be great props for your inward comforts.</p>

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God had broken <hi>Davids</hi> heart under the ſenſe of that uncleanneſſe he had committed: O ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Thou haſt broken my heart, now let my broken ſpirit rejoyce; and God gave him comfort, and did reſtore the joy of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to him. You have a phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart, to ſave them that are of a contrite ſpirit.</hi> The Lord is nigh to them. Nigh, what to do? not onely to give them deliverance from outward trouble, but from inward ſorrows; to give them inward joy, and inward comforts, <hi>that the bones which he hath broken might rejoyce.</hi> The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken ſpirit, to give them comfort. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. It's ſaid there, that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord was upon Chriſt,</hi> what to do? It was <hi>to binde up the broken in heart, and to comfort thoſe that mourn.</hi> So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. <hi>To thoſe that mourn, he ſhould preach comfort, and binde up the broken-hearted.</hi> When the Lord hath broken you under ſin, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled you under the ſight of your evils, then is the time when God will break in upon you with great joy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt</hi>; Reſt, there hath not onely reference to our reſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that we ſhall reſt there from ſin, and reſt there from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and reſt there from temptation, but <hi>I will give you reſt</hi>; it hath reference alſo to a promiſe in this life, that if you are heavy laden, that you count your iniquities a burden too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33775:63"/>
for you to bear, Chriſt hath promiſed you peace, inward peace in your own conſciences, in the aſſurance of your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting eſtate, in aſſurance that you are called to a ſtate of grace, and ſhall come to a ſtate of glory. You know when the ground is plowed, the clods are broken, and the breaking of the clods makes way for the deeper rooting of the corn, and that it may ſpring up with greater increaſe. It is ſo when ye <hi>plow up,</hi> in the Prophets language, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. <hi>the fallow ground of your hearts</hi>; when you break the clods of your hearts by humiliations, this makes way for the corn and grain, that precious grain of aſſurance to ſpring and grow up to a fuller meaſure; ſo that you are out of Gods way then to have ſtrong aſſurance, that never have been humbled in the ſight of ſin. I ſay it's Gods ordinary way. I doe not deny but God may bring you to heaven, though you have no legal work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and horrors upon you; yet God will never give you ſuch ſtrong aſſurance, and ſuch raviſhing comforts, as he gives them that are moſt broken in ſpirit. Look through the whole verge of Scripture, and you ſhall finde that thoſe that were moſt broken in heart, they were moſt ſtrong in comfort. That houſe that hath the deepeſt foundation, is like to be the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Fabrick and Building; whereas your tents and leſſer cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, a little rooting in the earth will ſerve their turn: It is likely God may make thee as a little cottage, though not deeply rooted; but thou wilt never be reared up a beautifull building, to become an amiable Chriſtian in point of comfort and aſſurance, if God have not bottomed thee low in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It's a true rule in grace, <hi>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy.</hi> The deeper you are in ſorrow, the higher you ſhall be lifted up in joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after the people of God have been toſſed and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and turmoiled with the violent aſſaults and temptations of the devil, then is Gods time of filling his people with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt joy and moſt comfort. You know at the Mill, at the Flood-gate, when the ſtream goes ſtrongeſt, then the Mill goes faſteſt. Beloved, God lets the ſtream of temptation grow ſtrong againſt thee, but to make thy Mill to go, to make thee grinde thy luſts to powder, and to make thee grinde thy ſinnes as corne
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33775:64"/>
under the Milſtone. God doth but make the flood to be ſtrong at the gate, to make thy comforts to be more ſtrong, and thy graces to be more firm. When God lets in a flood of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and toſſeth thee upon thoſe waves and billows, then is the time for God to give thee in ſtrongeſt comforts. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with Tempeſt, and not comforted.</hi> Mark their eſtate. Now what will God do with a ſoul thus toſſed with a Temptation? Read the verſe before, <hi>My Covenant of peace ſhall not depart from thee, O thou afflicted.</hi> God doth here ſpeak moſt peace, and tenders moſt freely his Covenant in this condition, when they were moſt toſſed and tumbled. And verſe 13. <hi>Thy children ſhall be all taught of God, and great ſhall be their peace.</hi> And verſe 14. <hi>In righteouſness thou ſhalt be eſtabliſhed, and thou ſhalt not fear.</hi> Here you ſee how God as it were boulſters and bears up a dejected heart; <hi>O thou toſſed with a Tempeſt, Behold, I have made a Covenant of peace with thee,</hi> and <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt not fear.</hi> See how God keeps up the hearts of his people in this condition; when you are moſt toſſed and tumbled with the tempeſt of temptation, then doth God ordinarily ſpeak to you moſt inward peace and ſtrongeſt aſſurance. As you know it is with an Oake, the more they are ſhaken by tempeſtuous windes, the firmer and faſter are they rooted in the bowels of the earth: It is ſo with Chriſtians; they are compared in Scripture to an Oak, whoſe fruit and ſap is in them: Now a Chriſtian, the more he is ſhaken by a tempeſtuous temptation, the Lord makes him by that to be the more firm, and to be the more faſtened and ſetled in ſtrong comforts and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when God hath any extraordinary work for his people, either to do or ſuffer, this is a time when he fills his people with moſt aſſurance. Should God put his people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward ſufferings, and give them inward fears, they were not in a capacity to undergoe the condition with joy or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: and therefore when he calls his people to ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meaſure of ſuffering, this is the time when God will fill them with more then ordinary comforts. I have read in the book of Martyrs of Mr. <hi>Robert Glover,</hi> a famous man in his generation, who during the time of his impriſonment, was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33775:64"/>
much troubled in minde for want of his aſſurance, yet the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells us, when he was brought to the ſtake to be burnt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as ever he ſaw the fire, he broke out in the hearing of the people and ſaid, He is corne, he is come; I am now as full of joy as my heart can hold. All the while he was in priſon, he was blubbring and much troubled, till God brought him to an eminent ſuffering, to ſuffer death for him, and then he was full of comfort. I have read alſo of one <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> who was a man ſubject to Melancholy, and lay under many doubts and fears, yet aſſoon as ever he was brought to the ſtake he openly declared to the people, I have been naturally of a ſad Temper, but now I profeſſe before you all, I think there is not a merrier heart in all the World then mine is. Thus they being to goe through extraordinary ſufferings, God gave them extraordinary aſsurance. Beloved, this is Gods time, when he will give you moſt aſſurance, when he calls you to moſt ſufferings. When you are to goe through an Ocean of ſufferings and afflictions, the Lord will make you ſwim in a Sea of inward peace and ſpiritual joyes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God gives his people moſt ſtrong aſſurance, when they walk moſt cloſely in communion with their God. <hi>Great peace ſhall they have,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, that love thy Law</hi>; they ſhall have peace, and great peace, while they walk in love to God and his wayes. Keep in communion with your God, and that's the time for God to give you greateſt comfort; If ye laſh out from God and break his Law, he will break your hearts. When the ſhepherd hath a Lamb, or a Sheep, that ſtraggles from the fold, it ſhall meet with a Crook, happly with the bite of a dog. It may be God may catch you with his hook, happily you ſhall be bitten with a Temptation, and bitten with deſertion, if you ſtraggle from his fold; but the more you keep in communion with God, the more likely you are to keep in your comforts; walking with God is the very fewel that kindles the fire of comfort in a Chriſtians breſt, that keeps comfort alive. The more you flag in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the more shall you flag in your aſſurance, and the more ſhall your comforts die. Communion with your God, it hath two particulars in it. Firſt, in keeping you free from

Now, the more you keep out ſin, the more you keep in comforts; the more you increaſe in grace, the more you increaſe in comforts.

               <p>Fiftly, VVherein appears the difference between that man that hath aſſurance of his effectual calling upon good ground, and between thoſe men that onely have preſumptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of their effectual c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, That man that hath ſound and true aſſurance of his effectual calling, he is very careful to take heed of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, that ſo he might not eclipſe his comforts, or loſe his aſſurance. He is careful (I ſay) to free his heart from ſin as much as may be, as conſidering, that though he cannot ſin away his ſoul, he may ſin away hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To perſwade your ſelves that God is your Father, and yet to do wickedneſſe as much as you can, and to be drunk as often as you can, and ſwear as often as you can; alas, you deceive your own hearts in this: for God cannot be your Father in this ſenſe. And Beloved, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you in my going over theſe heads, that you would lay them to your own hearts, and ſee if you my be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe preſumptuous perſwaſions, that goe over the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that hath reall aſſurance of his effectual calling, that man meets with more aſſaults and Temptations from the devil to annoy him in his peace, then other men do that have only a counterfeit aſſurance, As you know thoſe ſhops that have the beſt wares, and richeſt Treaſures, Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths ſhops, they are moſt expoſed to Robbery; when men will not meddle with a petty ſtall. Thoſe ſhips that are moſt richly laden, they are in moſt danger to meet with Pirats at Sea, when your ſmaller barks laden with goods of leſſer value ſcape free: It is ſo with Chriſtians. Thoſe Chriſtians, that are moſt richly laden with the Treaſure of aſſurance, that have in their hearts this precious Jewel, they are in moſt danger of the devils temptations, to be as a Pirat or Robber by force to ſet upon them, to annoy them. It is thoſe that have moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the devil doth envy moſt, that he will never let them alone, but hunts them as a Partridge over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines by dejections, and by ſuggeſtions, and by variety of Temptations.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33775:66"/>
preſſeth that Chriſtians ſhould not caſt away their confidence, (a Metaphor ſome think drawn from a Ship at Sea;<note place="margin">

Now ſome in alluſion to this, think that the devil ſo toſſeth a poor ſoul in point of comfort, as a ſhip is toſſed upon the Sea by the winde. Now if you are toſſed upon the Sea of Temptation, and upon the waves of Trouble and Aſſaults, do not caſt away your wares, do not throw away your comforts) which implies, that godly men are often ſet upon, and often aſſaulted; that though the devil cannot bring you to hell, he would fain have you to have a hell in your conſciences while you live; he doth not onely envy your happineſſe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts alſo: Whereas on the contrary, men that harbour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions they are called, when they are not; the devil lulls them aſleep, he lets them alone, and never troubles them. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>When the ſtrong man poſſeſſeth the houſe, the goods are at peace:</hi> That is, when the devil of hell hath whole poſſeſſion of the ſoul of a man, he is no whit tempted, his thoughts are at quiet. When the devil ſees a man build upon a ſandy and corrupt foundation, he will never ſhake that by a Temptation leſt you ſhould by ſhaking be awakened to look after <hi>a better and more induring ſubſtance.</hi> VVhen the devil ſees you lul'd aſleep in a golden dream of preſumption, he will never awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you by temptation, but lets you ſleep on, becauſe he knows that ſleep will be a ſleep to death.

We ſay thoſe Oxen that are fed in greeneſt paſtures, they are neereſt the ſlaughter; when the poor lean Oxe that hath the yoke &amp; whip every day, and is at daily labour, is long-liv'd, and in a better condition. Thoſe men that the Devil lets alone, and never tempts, that are as fatted Oxen, never come under the whip and yoke, and never are troubled; it is an argument they are neer the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and under a great deal of danger of their ſouls: but thoſe that are under the yoke, that are often tempted, and the pricks of Satan lie upon them; this is an argument their comforts are right, and their evidence good, becauſe ſo aſſaulted and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Devil.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, true aſſurance is more or leſſe in a mans ſpirit, by how much more or leſſe that man keeps in communion with God. If a man doth remit in his converſe with God, and grow careleſſe and formal, and a ſtranger to God, he ſhall grow a ſtranger to himſelfe in the end, and to his comforts alſo: but if a man keep cloſe to God, and keep cloſe to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, can retire and recollect himſelfe to converſe with God in a more ſolemn and ſerious manner, is preparedly and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſed in Ordinances, can poure out his ſoule into Gods boſome; that man is in the way to have his comforts raiſed up. Whereas now for men that have falſe comfort and perſwaſions, whether they are much or little with God, all is one to them, their comforts are at the ſame ſtand ſtill. Come to a man that hath falſe comforts, and at all times he is alike peremptory, he is in the ſame perſwaſion he was 3.4.7. years ago. Ask him any week in the year, any day in the week, any hour in the day, and he will tell you he hath the ſame comforts, and the ſame evidences ſtill: he had a ſtrong faith in God, and he hath it ſtill; he had ſtrong hopes to be ſaved, and ſo he hath ſtill; he is ſtill peremptory in his comforts, though he never ſo much alter in communion with his God: this is an argument thy perſwaſions are falſe, becauſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33775:67"/>
communion and converſe with God doth feed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Now as the body, by how much the more or leſſe it is fed, by ſo much the more it is weakened or ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo it is with your comforts; ſo much as they are che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by your walking with God, ſo much they grow weak or ſtrong. Now let a wicked man grow never ſo vile, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſinfull, it interrupts not his peace; he hath hopes and aſſurance ſtill, and he will truſt in God ſtill, though he ſin ever; this is an argument his comforts are unſound. You have a lively picture of this, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The heads of the people judge for reward, the Prieſts teach for hire, and the Prophets divine for money: and yet they will lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us</hi>? That is, though they have theſe ſins among them, and did walk thus and thus, yet they would hope in God God to be ſaved for all this. Why, Beloved, thou wilt finde God to fail thee; though he never faild an aſſured Chriſtian, yet he will fail that man that leans upon him, when he belongs not to him. When thou doſt intermit walking with God and doſt lanch forth into a gulph and ſea of luſts, and yet canſt ſtill ſay thou art the ſame in thy comforts, and the ſame in thy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; it is an argument all thy comforts are but falſe, and thy evidence unſound.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Reall aſſurance of your eſtate, it doth bear up the ſoule under the greateſt outward ſorrow and ſufferings that it can meet with in this world. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10:34. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y ſuffered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing in themſelves that they had in heaven a better and more enduring ſubſtance.</hi> What made them ſo to rejoyce to ſee their houſes plundered before them, their eſtates taken from them, but this, they knew in their own ſelves, and had aſſurance in their own hearts that Chriſt was theirs, and heaven was theirs; and this made them ſuffer joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50: <hi>This is my comfort in affliction, that thy word doth quicken me</hi>: That is, this bears up my heart when I am afflicted, that I have a word to build upon, that I have aſſurance, I have intereſt in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to build upon; this quickens and bears me up under my ſorrows. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81. <hi>My ſpirit had fainted within me, onely that I hoped in thy word.</hi> That is, I had hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33775:67"/>
built upon thy Word, and that kept me from fears, and fainting, and diſcouragement under my affliction. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; the people that dwell therein, ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The ſenſe of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their ſin ſhall take away the ſenſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</note> Beloved, Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will lift up and bear up the heart under all ſorrowes. Aſſurance in a Chriſtian is like oile. Now pour oile into a ſea or ocean of water, and the oile will never be kept under, but ſtill be uppermoſt; ſo this oile of comfort, and this oile aſſurance, it will bear thee up on the top, though thou ſhouldſt be caſt into a flood of troubles, and an ocean of ſorrowes. I have read in <hi>Latimers</hi> writings a notable ſaying of his to <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> that famous Martyr. Sometime, ſaith he, when I live in a ſetled and ſtedfaſt aſſurance about the ſtate of my ſoule, me thinks then I am as bold as a Lion, I can can laugh at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no affliction daunts me; but when I am eclipſed in my comforts, I am of ſo fearfull a ſpirit, that I could run into a very mouſe-hole. Beloved, it is ſo with godly men, when they want aſſurance of their eſtate, and the ſoundneſſe of their call, every affliction daunts, and every trouble ſtartles them. O but when they can live in a ſetled aſſurance of their intereſt in Chriſt, and calling by him; they are as bold as Lions and they are born up with comfort, under all the ſorrows, and ſufferings they meet withal. But now men that have falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, their perſwaſions can never bear up the heart under a trouble, and at a loſſe, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a pinch; becauſe it is not a ſaving and inward comfort, it can never create inward peace. The co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>forts of wicked men when they come to ſuffer, they are like cloth that is ill woven. Cloth that is well made, let a man be in a ſhowre of rain, it will never ſhrink; but ill woven cloth, let it be but in a ſhow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uble, and that man will not ſhrink under his trouble; but bring an ill wrought &amp; unſound aſſurance, and that will ſhrink, and fail, and pull in, and will not bear up the heart under the ſorrows and ſufferings he may meet withall. Preſuming <hi>Pindleton,</hi> that boaſted his fat fleſh ſhould fry in the fire before he would forſake his Relgion; when he came to the trial, flagged pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:33775:68"/>Fifthly, Sound aſſurance, whereever it is, makes the heart more humble towards God and man, and makes men more vile in their own eyes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. There you have this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; <hi>I live,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, by the faith of the Son of God; and Chriſt hath loved me, and given himſelfe for me.</hi> Here is his aſſurance: what then? Doth this lift up <hi>Paul?</hi> No, it makes him more vile; <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects himſelfe, I live, no; it is not I that live, but Chriſt that liveth in me. See how <hi>Paul</hi> was beaten off from a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious pride and exaltation of ſpirit in himſelfe. It is not I that live. The thoughts of his comforts made him recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelfe, and ſeem vile in his own eyes: Whereas (alas) falſe perſwaſions puffe up the ſoul with pride, and makes a man ſupercilious, and high conceited, crying out as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> did, <hi>Jonadab, is thy heart like mine? Come ſee my zeale for the Lord</hi>; they make him proud like <hi>Jehu</hi> in his falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, ſound comforts, and real aſſurance do engage the ſoule to walk before God in a courſe of holineſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is before mine eyes</hi>; that is, I am aſſured, if I ſaw the thing with mine eye, that Gods loving kindneſſe is towards me. What then? <hi>and I will walk in thy truth.</hi> I will walk before thee with a holy and ſincere heart; and <hi>I wil not haunt with vain perſons,</hi> ver. 4, And <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency,</hi> ver. 6 &amp;c. So that you ſee <hi>David</hi> would walk in a courſe of holineſſe, becauſe he had an evidence and aſſurance of Gods love to him. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelfe, even as Chriſt is pure</hi>; that is, a man that doth nouriſh hopes and perſwaſions of heaven, his hopes will make him a Chriſtian endeavouring to purifie his owne heart, and to be holy as Chriſt is holy. This is the nature of true aſſurance. But now for falſe aſſurance, the man that hath it, doth not look after holineſſe at all; he thinks himſelf well enough,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si dixeris ſufficit periiſti. Aug. de verb. Apoſt. Serm.</hi> 18.</note> that he hath attained that which every wiſe man ſhould reſt in, without medling any furth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r; nay, he is ſo far laying bonds upon himſelfe to walk in a courſe of holineſſe, that he will rather take encouragement from thence to walk in a way of looſeneſſe and profaneneſſe: Becauſe grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33775:68"/>
he will abound in ſin; this is the ill uſe that falſe comfort makes of Gods grace. And therefore, Beloved, look over your hearts. Do the comforts you pretend to have, and the aſſurance you pretend to enjoy, make you more to purſue holineſſe? that you can ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I ſee thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is before me,</hi> and therefore <hi>I will love thy wayes; and hate ſinfulneſſe</hi>; or can you ſay, you have comforts, therefore yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> will run into ſin, and wallow in wickedneſs? this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy comforts are not true.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, True aſſurance, it is got and kept with a great deal of diligence and induſtry. Your beſt things are hardeſt to get, and hardeſt to keep. Stones are to be had in every place; but gold you muſt dig deep, and take paines to dive into the bowels of the earth, before you can get that. Weeds grow eaſily, but your fine garden-flowers, they muſt be often wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and carefully looked unto, or elſe they will not grow: Beloved, this weed of falſe perſwaſion and aſſurance, it is a weed that will grow under every hedge, and thrive in every garden without looking after; whereas alas, the flower of true comforts and ſaving aſſurance, it is hard to make it grow; and when it is grown, it is hard to keep it from withering and blaſting. Aſſurance it coſts a man the waiting many a yeare, the ſhedding many a teare, the making of many a prayer, before he can get or keep it; whereas alas, falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance it is eaſily gotten, and eaſily kept. A man may get preſumption without any paines at all; the Devil will egge you on both to get and keep it: Therefore you that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily get your comforts without prayers, and keep your comforts without pains, you may be ſure your comforts are but falſe.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, True aſſurance it is gotten by the Word, and grounded upon the Word. It is got by the Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lip, peace, peace, to them that are nigh, and to them that are afar off.</hi> The fruit of the lips, that is, the fruit of the Miniſters preaching; the word which falls from the lips of a godly Miniſter, God hath ordained and created that to be the way to work and create peace, peace; that is a ſound peace in the hearts of his people. And it is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33775:69"/>
not onely got, but it is bottomed upon the Word alſo. It is the Word, and ſomewhat in the Word, that beares up the hearts of the people of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord, wherein thou haſt cauſed thy ſervant to hope.</hi> So ver. 50, 51. It is the Word of God that bottoms the comforts of the people of God; whereas look now upon wicked men, and they neither got their comforts by the Word, nor do they ground upon the Word; but firſt, they have had ſtrong hopes in God ever ſince they could remember; and ſecondly, they keep and ground them either upon their good meaning, that they mean well towards God; or elſe thirdly, they ground them upon this, that they are not ſo bad as other men are. A poor weak ground. The Phariſee could ſay ſo; <hi>I am no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, no drunkard, no adulterer, and the like</hi>: yet never came to heaven for all this. Or elſe fourthly, they ground their comforts on this, becauſe they receive from God abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of outward mercies. And this you finde was their ground of preſumption, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Ephraim ſaid, I am become rich, and I have found me out ſubſtance; in all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they ſhall finde no iniquity in me, that is, ſin. Ephraim</hi> would ſay, I am become rich, and have gotten me an eſtate, and now I am an honeſt man, and they ſhall finde no ſin in me: yet this was a meer preſumption, becauſe God tels us, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1. <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by the things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> And <hi>ſometimes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, God gives m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n riches to their hurt</hi>; And therefore this can be no evidence of a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, That man that hath a good aſſurance, he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be tried either by God or man, touching the truth of his aſſurance. This you finde, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 26.2, 3. <hi>Try me, O Lord, examine me, prove me; and try my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, and my heart, for thy loving kindneſſe is before me.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I make a profeſſion, that I have thy loving kindneſſe in mine eye, that I am aſſured thou loveſt me; Lord, I put my ſoule upon the trial: Doe thou try me, if my heart be not right in my aſſurance. And not by God onely, but they are willing to be tried by man alſo. And therefore you have that phraſe of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>that when men ask you an account of the hope that is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33775:69"/>
in you, you ſhould be ready to give anſwer</hi>; that is, when men ask you what hopes you have of heaven, and upon what ground do you hope to be ſaved? the Apoſtle ſaith, you ſhould be ready to give anſwer of that hope that is in you. And who were they that ſhould do ſo? they were thoſe that <hi>had a good conſcience,</hi> thoſe men that had conſciences free from ſin, and had evidence in their own conſciences, that they belonged to God, they were ready, whoever asked them, to give a reaſon why they hoped for heaven. Whereas a man that hath falſe perſwaſions of heaven and of his effectual calling, that man cannot endure to be tried either by God or man. He is like the man that hath ſtolen goods in his houſe. A man that is an honeſt man, let the Conſtable come, let ſearch be made, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubles him, becauſe they are his own goods that he hath bought with his own money: but the Thief, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable comes, and ſearch is made, every Trunk that is opened, his heart trembles: It is ſo with an unſound-hearted man; a man that hath falſe aſſurance, leſt there ſhould be a flaw found in it. Come to a man that hath falſe perſwaſions, (as to you Formaliſts, and thoſe that are preſumptuous wretches) come to theſe men, and put this queſtion unto them, Upon what ground do you hope for ſalvation? What evidence can you give of your effectual calling? How can you make out upon Scripture-grounds, that you ſhall goe to heaven? Such queſtions as theſe will puzzle an unſound heart, that he cannot give you any reaſonable anſwer at all. And herein the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is palpable between a grounded aſſurance and thoſe falſe perſwaſions that wicked men have.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, True aſſurance, wherever it is, it makes a man ſo to value the comforts of the Spirit of God, that he doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value all other comforts in the world in compariſon of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me</hi>; what then? <hi>and this ſhall more glad my heart, then when my corn and wine and oile increaſeth.</hi> Beloved, aſſurance, it doth ſo tranſport and raiſe up the heart, that it makes all things in the world, all comforts here below to be nothing in compariſon of that. The favour of Princes is nothing to that man that hath the favour of God; Life, and all the comforts of life, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33775:70"/>
to that man that hath comfort in referrence to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindness, O Lord, is better then life. David</hi> did not value his life, nor all the comforts of it, ſo as he valued the loving kindneſſe of his God. But now, a man that hath falſe perſwaſions, theſe do not ſo tranſport his ſpirit, and take up the whole man, and fill the ſoul <hi>with j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y unſpeakable and full of glory</hi>; theſe do no whit abate his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the world. A man you know that hath taſted hony, other things are of an unpleaſant taſte to him that are eaten after: Beloved, aſſurance is like hony; nothing ſo ſweet to a godly palate, as that is. Now when a godly perſon taſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the hony of aſſurance, all other outward comforts, they are but as gall and wormwood, things unpleaſant to his taſte and palate. And thus you ſee I have laid down ten particulars to you. I would intreat you to diſtinguiſh in your own hearts, whether you are the people that have a true aſſurance, or one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe perſwaſions of your effectual calling. And let me tell you, the reaſon why I ſpeak of this, is, becauſe the moſt of men in the world do miſſe of heaven by falſe perſwaſions. VVhere deſperation damnes one ſoul, preſumption damnes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. I might ſay of this, as it was ſung in the Triumphant ſong of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul, Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, but David his ten thouſands</hi>: So I might ſay, deſparation hath ſlain a thouſand, but preſumption ten thouſand. Thouſands and ten thouſands are ſlain and undone for ever, by harbouring preſumptuous and groundleſſe perſwaſions of their effectual calling, when they are not.</p>

                  </gap>ight particulars, as concomitants, or gracious qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which muſt accompany you in a condition of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt uſe and manage your aſſurance with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in caſe you uſe it well. Aſſured Chriſtians muſt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtians. The more high you are in comforts, the more low you ſhould be in Spirit. You know the fulleſt eares of corn hang down their head loweſt, when light and flaſhy dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel that hath nothing of worth in it, lifts up its head on high. Aſſured Chriſtians, they are like your full and ripe eares of corn; the more full they are of this fruit of the Spirit, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the more low do they, and ſhould they hang down their heads. It is your empty barrels make a noiſe, when your full veſſels though you ſtrike them, will not ſound: It is thoſe Chriſtians that are moſt empty of faith, and moſt empty of aſſurance, that make moſt noiſe, and are moſt proud of their guifts and graces; when your aſſured Chriſtians they are like veſſels full of the beſt liquor; that make the leaſt noiſe. The fuller God hath fil'd you with this comfort, the more you ſhould ſhine forth in humility. As <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt loved him, and gave himſelfe for him</hi>; when he was moſt full of comforts, he was moſt fill'd with humility, and ſaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt manage your aſſurance with a high valuation of the comforts of God in you. A man that hath received a benefit, if he do not value it, it is a provocation to the man that gave it, either to repent of his gift, or take it away. <hi>David</hi> when he had aſſurance, mark how he values it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindness is better then life.</hi> He valued the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his God, and the ſhinings of Gods countenance better then life. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me, and that ſhall more glad me, then when my corn and wine and oile increaſeth. David</hi> would more value the comforts of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33775:71"/>
Gods Spirit, then any other comfort in the world. Aſſured Chriſtians, that uſe aſſurance rightly, they muſt put a high valuation and worth upon it. And the reaſon is, Becauſe you will not then eaſily part with your aſſurance for a baſe and beggerly luſt, and for a fruitleſſe ſin, if once you know the value and worth of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Your aſſurance muſt make you to live with a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heart from the comforts of this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. the laſt verſe, compared with Chapt. 5.1. The Apoſtle tells you, <hi>We do not look after the things that are ſeen, that are temporal.</hi> What made the Apoſtle not to look after worldly things; he gives the reaſon, <hi>For when this houſe of ours is diſſolved, we have a dwelling with God, eternall in the heavens.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, That's the reaſon we do not look after the world as worldly men do; for we know that when we leave this world, we have a heaven to go to. The aſſurance of the bleſſedneſſe of their future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did make them undervalue the world, as a thing not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the glance of the eye; Perſons that have aſſurance, can ſay as <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.8. <hi>Shew us</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it ſufficeth us.</hi> Thus ſaith a gracious heart, O ſweet Jeſus, ſhew us but thy favour; aſſure but my ſoul, that thy Father is a reconciled Father to me in thy ſelfe, that he is my Father as well as thy Father; Shew me but the Father, and it ſufficeth me; though I have little or nothing in the world, this ſhall ſuffice me. Gracious hearts, that live in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of aſſurance, they ought to live with a weaned heart from the comforts of this world. Men that have taſted hony or ſome other ſweet morſel, they do diſtaſte all other things, though of themſelves very pleaſant: So men that have taſted of this hony of Gods love, and the ſweetneſſe of this grace of aſſurance; it will make them diſtaſte and diſreliſh all the things of this world, though of themſelves pleaſant and good. If a man look on the Sun it dazles hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.39. <hi>No man</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>having drunk old wine, ſtraight way deſireth new; for he ſaith, The old is better.</hi> His meaning is this, No man that hath had a taſte of Jeſus
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33775:72"/>
Chriſt, and hath had communion and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, and lain under the Miniſtery of Jeſus Chriſt; no man that hath drunk of this old wine, will ſay, new is better; to have other comforts, and other pleaſures, is better; no man will ſay this, ſaith Chriſt. And ſo he compares his Miniſtery, and his Doctrine, and the comfort Gods people have thereby, to old wine: Beloved, ſo I ſay, men that have drunk draughts of this wine of conſolation, and men that are ſetledly aſſured, and have had a <hi>taſte that the Lord is gracious,</hi> no man will now ſay, that the world is better, and the comforts below better. No, the aſſuance of Gods love ſhould wean a mans heart from all the comforts of the world. As old <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, when he ſaw his ſonne <hi>Joſeph</hi> in his old age, after he had made many a prayer, and ſhed many a tear; <hi>O Joſeph my ſonne is yet alive, I have enough.</hi> As was the carriage of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the ſame ſhould be the carriage of a Chriſtian towards Chriſt. If he can ſay, My <hi>Joſeph,</hi> my Jeſus is alive in my heart; I having him, have enough; this comfort ſhould raviſh his ſpirit. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was rapt up into the third heaven, was ſo tranſported that he knew not whether he was in the body or no; ſo are the people of God raviſhed with heavenly conſolations,<note place="margin">Cui incipit dulceſcere Chriſtus, ei neceſſe eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a ſpeech that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> hath, That to whoſoever Jeſus Chriſt once becomes ſweet, that he can taſte the ſweetneſſe of his love, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his mercy, the very ſweetneſſe in Chriſts love will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter the world unto him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you are to manage and uſe your aſſurance with tenderneſs of conſcience againſt ſin. Aſſured Chriſtians ſhould be tender-conſcienced Chriſtians. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>God will ſpeak peace to his people</hi>; but mark the duty: <hi>they muſt not turn again unto folly.</hi> They muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, they that are aſſured Chriſtians, they know how difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did attain this aſſurance, and they know how ſweetly they enjoy this aſſurance, and that will make them very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they do not loſe a thing ſo hardly gotten and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed for a trivial luſt; that thy loſe not their former evidences, and revive former ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aſſured Chriſtians muſt be patient Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They ſuffered joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing that they had in heaven a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tter and more enduring ſubſtance</hi>; and that made the Saints of God tuſh and ſcorn at all the loſſes they met with in the world. Suppoſe a man be at Sea, and have precious Jewels and Pearles aboard with him; if the man can be but ſure he ſhall ſave his own life, and ſave his Jewels, though he loſe the Casket, though he loſe the box, that will not much trouble him: Thou that art ſure of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou canſt never loſe that Pearle, thy ſoul; thou maieſt loſe the ſhell, thy life; thou maiſt loſe the Casket, thou ſhalt never loſe the Jewel; and ſhall that trouble thee? If thou art an aſſured Chriſtian, be ſure whatever ſtorme of Temptation blow upon thee, thou ſhalt onely loſe the box, never loſe the Pearle. This therefore ſhould make aſſured Chriſtians to be patient Chriſtians, what ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r they ſhall undergoe here in the world. I have read a ſtory in <hi>Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments, of a woman, who when ſhe came to be tried for her Religion before <hi>Bonner,</hi> that bloody Biſhop; he threatened her, he would take away her husband from her; ſaith ſhe, Chriſt is my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; I will take away thy childe: Chriſt, ſaith ſhe, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me then ten ſonnes; I will ſtrip thee, ſaith he, of all thy outward comforts: yea but Chriſt is mine, and you cannot ſtrip me of him, ſaith ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was the ſpeech of that famous ſervant of God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Bradford,</hi> when a company of his fellow-priſoners were that morning to goe to be burnt, ſaith <hi>Bradford,</hi> O my fellow-ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here you ſee how aſſured Chriſtians, their comforts in God did ſo tranſport their hearts, that it made them overlook, and with patience bear all afflictions they were to meet with. You have a remarkable phraſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The Inhabitants of Sion ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, the people that dwel therein, ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> A ſtrange paſſage; he doth not ſay, they were not ſick, but the Text ſaith, they ſhould not ſay ſo. And what's the reaſon? why ſhould the people forget their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and forget their pains? this ſhould make them, the Lord had forgiven them their iniquities. The ſenſe of pardon took away the ſenſe of pain. And Beloved, Chriſtians ſhould walk thus to ſhew that trouble ſhould not daunt them, and afflictions never ſtartle them; you that are aſſured Chriſtians, you ſhould be patient Chriſtians under all ſufferings. And take this for a rule, that God takes impatience more unkindly at aſſured Chriſtians hands, then at the hands of any men in the world beſides: Becauſe if God give thee aſſurance, he hath given thee a ſeal in thy own breſt, that all ſhall work for thy good; and wilt thou be impatient? He hath given thee a ſeale in thy own breſt, that heaven ſhall make amends for all; and wilt thou be angry? God will take this more unkindly at them then any.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Aſſurance ſhould be managed with indeared love to Jeſus Chriſt. Aſſured Chriſtians ſhould be Chriſt-loving Chriſtians: When Chriſt told <hi>Mary Magdalen, Thy ſins which are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny are forgiven thee.</hi> When ſhe had aſſurance her ſins were pardoned, what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Much was forgiven her therefore ſhe loved much</hi>: becauſe ſhe was ſenſible much was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her, ſhe would ſhew forth much love to Jeſus Chriſt. And the reaſon is, becauſe it was Chriſts love brought thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33775:73"/>
into a ſtate of ſalvation, and his love likewiſe that gave them aſſurance of their own call, and this ſhould indear their hearts to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Aſſurance ſhould be managed with abundance of compaſſion towards thoſe Chriſtians that are tempted and troubled by Satan. Aſſured Chriſtians ſhould be compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Chriſtians. If God have given you aſſurance of his love, you ſhould carry compaſſionate breſts towards your Brethren, who remain behinde in great diſtreſs and perplexity, that lie toſſed and turmoiled by Temptations. When a ſhip is brought ſafe to the Haven, if they have any bowels, when they ſee another ſhip in the main Ocean ſtrugling for life in the midſt of the waters, they will pity them: You that have got aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you are come to a ſafe harbour; but your tempted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they are toſſed upon the waves and tempeſts of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you ſhould now have compaſſionate hearts towards tempted Chriſtians. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>The Lord hath comforted us in all our tribulation, that we might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort others with the ſame comforts, wherewith we our ſelves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted of God,</hi> It was the work and task of the Apoſtle, and them with him, that they having comforts and aſſurance from God, they would labour to comfort others, and bear up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and eſtabliſh others, that they might rejoyce, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame comforts with themſelves. Hence you read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Be pitifull, be compaſſionate to your Brethren, love as Brethren.</hi> Now upon what ground doth the Apoſtle preſſe this compaſſion? Read verſe 9. <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that as you are hereunto called, that you ſhould inherit a bleſſing.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, upon this ground I woo you to be compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, becauſe you are called to inherit a bleſſing; that is, you know and are aſſured that you are a bleſſed people, and you ſhall be a ſaved people, therefore have compaſſion on your Brethren, who are tempted and troubled, that you might bring them to the ſame pitch of comfort you are brought to.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Aſſurance ſhould be managed with cheerfulneſs of heart: Aſſured Chriſtians ſhould be cheerfull Chriſtians. We read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.1, 2. That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> all the while he was

Now to this I would allude: If the preſence and face of King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did make <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that for a long time he was not ſad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; Oh how much more ſhould the face of God, and the preſence of God in a mans ſoul, and the favour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a man, how much more ſhould this keep thee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſad in Gods preſence, from a lumpiſh and melancholy and ſad ſpirit?

None in the world have greater grounds of joy then thoſe that live in a conſtant aſſurance of the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. It is for condemned men, that are condemned to the gallows, to hang down their heads and wring their hands; but let the pardoned people of the Lord rejoyce. The man that is condemned, he hangs down his head; but the man that comes pardoned from the bar, with what a cheerful countenance will that man come? You are all a people par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by your God, you may well be a rejoycing people: I remember a paſſage I have read in D. <hi>Halls</hi> Works, in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations upon the Creatures, ſpeaking of a little Bird called Robbin-red-breſt, that when he was in his ſtudy, came chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the window, and leaping upon his book, and ſinging a great while together; upon this fight he breaks out into this contemplation.

                  </gap> an aſſurance in thy own breſt thou ſhalt go to heaven, and go to God, this ſhould much more make thee in thy ſpirit bleſſe thy God. It is a ſpeech of the Prophet <hi>David, My ſoule, bleſſe thou the Lord for his marvellous loving kindnesse.</hi> Thou haſt kindneſs, and thou haſt marvellous loving kindneſſe; My ſoule bleſs God for this. <hi>David</hi> would not keep back Gods praiſes, ſeeing God would not keep back <hi>Davids</hi> comforts. In heaven we ſhall break forth into admiration, becauſe we have good things in poſſeſſion; here we ſhould break forth into thankſgiving, becauſe we have them in expectation. And thus I have done with the firſt part of my direction to you that are aſſured Chriſtians, you ſhould labour firſt rightly to uſe your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</p>
               <p>Secondly, All you that are aſſured Chriſtians, you are to be directed carfully to keep and preſerve your aſſurance. There is no leſs skill, ſaith the Poet, to be put forth in keeping ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, then in getting of it. It is ſaid of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non minor eſt virtus quàm quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere parta tueri.</note> he was a a skilful Souldier to get Victories, but he had no skill to keep them, when gotten: It may be ſaid ſo of us, Chriſtians can get aſſurance, but they have not the skill to keep it when they have got it. This therefore therefore I am now to preſs, that you would be car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>full to preſerve your aſſurance. And here in ſpeaking of this, I ſhall lay down two particulars; that in caſe you would keep your aſſurance, there are ſome things you muſt doe; and ſome things you muſt avoid and take heed of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:33775:75"/>Firſt, There are ſome things you muſt do, and thoſe I ſhall comprize under two or three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In caſe you would keep aſſurance, you are to keep cloſe in communion with your God, in the exerciſe of the duty of godlineſs. The more you keep grace, the more you will keep your comforts. And here that I may branch out this direction, I ſhall comprize theſe duties under four heads, and ſhew you from Scripture, that keeping cloſe to God in the uſe of four duties, will be a ready way to keep your aſſurance in you.</p>
               <p>As firſt, keep cloſe to God in the duty of prayer, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ask,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and your joy ſhall be full.</hi> Ask, that your joy may be full; implying that if you keep cloſe to God in the duty of prayer, after aſſurance; your ſpirits ſhall be compleat and full.</p>
               <p>Secondly, keep cloſe to God, in the duty of reading the Word often. By often reading the Word you will often meet with Promiſes and Supports for your comfort. That's the reaſon men leſſen in comforts, becauſe men do not frequently read the Word; you cannot read a Chapter, but you will finde there a prop for faith, and a prop for aſſurance. Keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the Word, and that's the way to keep your aſſurance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe, that you might know that you have eternal life.</hi> Theſe things have I writ, not only that you have life, but that you might know it. By reading the writings of <hi>John, John</hi> tels them they might the better know they ſhould live for ever, and everlaſtingly be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Keep cloſe to God in reading his written Word, and this will be of great uſe. Becauſe there are promiſes ſcattered throughout the veins of Scripture. Not a Scripture almoſt you can read, but there is a promiſe or ſupport for your faith one way or other,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Keep cloſe to God in a conſtant and conſcientious hearing of his Word, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O live under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and under <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> Miniſtery, that preacheth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and humiliation, and that is the Miniſtery will give moſt aſſurance of your ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Keep in communion with God, in a daily trying and examining your own hearts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>If any man think himſelf to be ſomewhat, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf; but let every man prove his own works, and then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelfe.</hi> That is, let a man examine himſelfe, and prove his heart, and this will be a meanes to work joy in the heart, that they ſhall have comfort and joy in themſelves in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their happineſs. Beloved, what's the reaſon you do not keep aſſurance? the reaſon is, you keep not cloſe to God in a way of communion in theſe duties of holineſs, you keep not to God in a way of prayer, and reading, and examining your hearts, and proving your comforts, and your own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and that's the reaſon you are no more full, and no more firm.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would keep your comforts, keep your conſcience clear from harbouring the guilt of ſinne, <hi>Iob</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hands, put it far away</hi>; if ſinne be in thy converſation, away with it. Let not ſinne be in thy heart, nor in thy houſe, <hi>then ſhalt thou lift up thy face to God without ſpot, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt before him, and not feare.</hi> This will ballance thy ſpirit, and keep thy heart from feare, and keep thee in a ſtedfaſt aſſurance, if thou keep thy conſcience clear.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if thou wouldſt keep aſſurance, gather and heap together all the experiences thou haſt had of God in thy heart in times paſt. <hi>I called to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e are the particulars you muſt practice, in caſe you would preſerve in your breſts this aſsurance of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are ſome things you are to avoid and take heed of, in caſe you would perpetuate aſsurance in your hearts, and thoſe I ſhall comprize under ſix heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take heed you do not wallow in, and give your ſelves to ſenſual joy and pleaſure. There is nothing in the world will more eat out ſpiritual joy and that effectual aſsurance in your hearts, then giving your ſelyes too much to carnal joy and ſenſual pleaſure, which takes away the hearts. The more your joy runs in that channel after ſenſual pleaſure, the leſs it runs towards God, and the comforts that are above; godly ſorrow is the ſeed-plot of ſpiritual joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The evil of earthly-mindedneſs, take heed of that, if ever you would keep your comforts. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world will more blaſt your comforts, then an earthly minde to be ſtill poring upon the things of the world. What the Philoſophers ſay of the Eclipſe of the Sun, that it is occaſioned by the intervening of the Moon between the Sun and our ſight is is true in this caſe. The Moon is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of the world. If the world get between Chriſt <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſſe</hi> and our fight, it will darken our ſight of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and bring Eclipſes upon our comforts and graces. Thoſe men that dig deep nito the bowels of the earth, they are oftentimes choaked and ſtifled by damps that come from the earth: So it is with Chriſtians, thoſe that will be ever poring and digging about the things of this world, it is a thouſand to one if from worldly things a damp doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to ſmother their comforts, and quench their graces; the world pierceth with ſorrow, therefore muſt needs damp your joyes. A candle, though it may ſhine to the view of all, yet put it but under ground, and (though there be not a puff of wind) the very damps will ſtifle the light of the flame. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though you ſhine like candles in your comforts, yet bring them but under the earth, and a clod of earth will ſtifle
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33775:76"/>
your candle, will damp your comforts. There is nothing lays a Chriſtian under more loſs in his aſſurance then worldly-mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, avoid remiſſeneſs in Religious duties. If you ſlack in duties, you will ſlack in comforts; leſs duties and leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts goe together. If a man doth let looſe the tacklings of his ſhip, and let ſlack the ſailes, that ſhip cannot goe with ſo ſwift a motion; ſpecially if wind and tide be againſt it, the ſhip muſt needs goe backward: Believers that are aſſured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they are like a ſhip under ſaile; you goe againſt wind and tide, againſt nature, and againſt corruption, againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and the devil and all: now if you let ſlack your ſails, and grow remiſs in duties, you will quickly ſlack in your comforts; whatever weakens your graces, and ſtraitens your duties, will impaire your aſſurances, and eclipſe your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and therefore take heed of remiſſeneſs in a way of duties; oh do not leſs work, when you have moſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Take heed of ſpiritual pride. If once you begin to admire your ſelves, then you loſe your ſelves. If once you are proud of your graces, it is a provocation to make God take away your comforts, and to make you loſe your graces; I mean, loſe them, not in the very being, but in the comfort and exerciſe of them; pride it is the great murderer of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans comforts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed of grieving the ſpirit of God; <hi>Grieve not the holy ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whereby you are ſeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to the day of Redemption.</hi> The Spirit of God is a ſealing Spirit; O grieve not this Spirit. The Spirit deals with us, as we deale with it; if we grieve the ſpirit of God, God will grieve you, and your ſpirits ſhall be grieved, that you ſhall not keep the joyes of the Lord in your br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt in the aſſurance of his love and favour to you. You read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They grieved his Spirit, ſo he was turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though God may be your friend, yet he will frown upon you as an enemy, and ſeem to fight againſt you too, in caſe you grieve his Spirit; if thou grieve Gods Spirit, God will grieve thine, and when thy ſpirit is grieved, thou muſt needs loſe thy comforts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:33775:77"/>Sixthly, Take heed of the ſin of hypocriſie, falſe grace will breed a falſe joy. Falſe hearts muſt needs have falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. You will never keep true comforts, if you have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart, <hi>The upright in heart they ſhall ſhout upon their beds for joy</hi>; they ſhall doe it, but hypocrites ſhall not. Take heed therefore of this evil, and you are in a way to preſerve your aſſurance.</p>

read, that in the ſalutation of every Epiſtle, the Apoſtle puts both together, <hi>Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied to you in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.3.

You have a paſſage, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 11. compared together, <hi>Adde to your faith vertue, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle there urgeth our diligence to adde grace to grace; that is, to live in the improvement of grace.

               <p>Firſt; Improve the grace of humility, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. The Lord doth promiſe there <hi>to revive the ſpirit of the humble.</hi> It is a particular promiſe to that grace, that God will revive you, and give you a new life if you have it. And reviving there, is not meant of the firſt life of grace, but of a life of comfort. They had grace before, but God would give them a life of comfort, he will reſtore your conſolation to you in caſe you are an humble people. Hence it is, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Lord gives grace to the humble.</hi> Yea, <hi>he gives more grace.</hi> The Lord gives more grace to the humble perſon then to any man in the world. Now the more grace you have, the more comfort you muſt needs have. Humility is a foundation of more grace, therefore needs muſt be a foundation of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>That building whoſe foundation is laid loweſt, is of all the moſt beautiful and comely Fabrick above ground: So thoſe Chriſtians that lay a foundation low in humility, they are likely to reare up a moſt beautiful Building in way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Improve the grace of faith in beleeving, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33775:78"/>
that is the way to increaſe comfort. 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom though you have not ſeen, yet believing, you rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Though they did never ſee Chriſt, yet believing in Chriſt, and improving their faith, they had not onely an ordinary meaſure of comfort, but they had more comfort in their hearts, then they could utter with their Tongue; <hi>They rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of peace fill you with all joy and peace in Believing, that you may abound in hope through the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Believing makes you full of all joy, and makes you abound in it. The more you are in Believing, the more you will be in aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Improve the grace of love to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>If any man love me, my Father ſhall love him, and we will come in unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> If you improve in your love to Jeſus Chriſt, God the Father and God the Son will make their dwelling in your hearts. Now he muſt needs be a comfortable Chriſtian, that hath ſo good a gueſt as God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt to come in, and make their abode with him. As you know, to your boſome-friend whom you love, and you know loves you, you will communicate all your ſecrets: Thus will God the Father, if he knowes you are his boſome-friends, and ſeeth you love him, he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate all his comforts to you; you ſhall never want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, if you increaſe in love to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Improve the grace of godly ſorrow; you will never finde ſweeter muſick in comfort, then when you are laid down in teares. As the ſound of the Trumpet is never more pleaſant then when they are upon the water; ſo when God ſeeth you flow with the water of repentance and godly ſorrow, then you are likely to hear the moſt melodious harmony in the apprehenſion of Gods love; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. <hi>They that ſow in teares, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> You ſhall not onely have a dram, but a handful of joy; as Reapers they cut down handfuls of corn at once. And as you know in ſeed, though you ſowe but one grain of corn, there may a dozen eares come from that one ſeed: ſo if you ſowe but a little godly ſorrow, a grain of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow may be a root to a great deal of ſpiritual joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:33775:78"/>Secondly. If you would improve your aſſurance, preſerve a clear conſcience, both towards God and man. <hi>A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a continual Feaſt, Prov.</hi> 15.15. Aſſurance, I may ſay of it as the Father ſpeaks of the Holy Ghoſt, and the comforts thereof, The Spirit of God is a very nice thing, every thing will give the comforts of Gods Spirit a check and diſtaſte;<note place="margin">Res d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>a eſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Dei.</note> now if you harbour ſin upon conſcience, you will never thrive in comfort; every thing will give comfortable motions a check. And as Philoſophers ſay when the Aire is foggy, it ariſeth from vapours that are exhaled from the earth, which makes the Aire ſo cloudy as it is; So it is filth drawn from our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearts, that makes ſuch foggy miſts to ariſe between our comforts and us, and between God and us. You muſt keep conſcience clear, elſe you will never keep heaven clear. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be clouded, if the heart be filthy. <hi>Job.</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away</hi>; If ſin be upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, harbour it not; <hi>for then thou ſhalt lift up thy face before God, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and not fear.</hi> You ſhall not onely not fear but you ſhall have a degree of aſſurance. You ſhall be ſtedfaſt, if you put ſin far away from you. A ſullied and a polluted conſcience ſhall never be in a Chriſtian ſtrong in aſſurance. You will not grow in aſſurance, if your conſcience harbour guilt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you would improve your aſſurance, keep cloſe in communion with God. Nothing that feeds comforts ſo much as a Chriſtians holy walking. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace, and the effect thereof quietneſſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for ever.</hi> If you walk in works of righteouſneſſe, and in a way of keeping loſe communion with God; this ſhall be peace, and this ſhall be quietneſſe, and great aſſurance. Mark how the Holy Ghoſt makes a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adation; not onely peace and quietneſſe, but aſſurance alſo: you ſhall have the higheſt degree of peace, and the higheſt ſtep of comfort, if you walk diligently in a way of holineſſe with your God. And thus much be ſpoken to the firſt ſort of men, thoſe that live in the enjoyment of the aſſurance of their effectual calling.</p>
               <p>I have now a word to thoſe men that live in the want of this aſſurance, who happily have in times paſt had ſome glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33775:79"/>
and ſome dimme ſight of comfort, touching their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting eſtate, and yet are now much clouded and eclipſed in their comforts, or have loſt the comforts they once h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall by way of direction ſpeak onely four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That you would ſet upon ſearching work. Secondly, Upon humbling work. Thirdly, Upon praying work. And fourthly, that you would ſet upon meditating work: Theſe four helps will through Gods bleſſing be very conducible to reſtore your wonted comforts to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, My counſel ſhall be to you, that you would ſet upon ſearching and examining work. When you have loſt any thing, the firſt thing you do is to look after it, where you have loſt it, that you may finde it again. If you have loſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel of aſſurance, be thus wiſe for your ſelves; O ſet upon ſeeking and ſearching work. The Scripture gives you this hint, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man ſearch his own work, and then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelfe.</hi> This is the way to bring in ſpiritual joy and ſpiritual comfort, to be often dealing with your own hearts. <hi>David</hi> when he lay under ſome foul diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, mark how he deales with his own ſoul: <hi>Why art thou troubled, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> he puts his heart upon the trial. And here in your ſearching work, I would commend five things to your examination.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Search how you got your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Search how you grounded your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Search how you managed your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Search what ſhould provoke God to take away your aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, Search what you would give to God, ſo you might regain your former and wonted aſſurance. Put theſe queſtions to your hearts; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Put upon the ſearch, how you go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> your aſſurance. It may be it was ſuch an aſſurance as you have had ever ſince you were born from your mothers womb: that you got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care, and without pain; and if ſo, this is preſumption, not aſſurance: and if you have loſt this, it is well. It is better to be in a ſtate of diſcouragement, then in a ſtate of preſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:33775:79"/>Secondly, Examine how you grounded your aſſurance. It may be you bottomed it but upon ſelf, not upon Chriſt. It may be, you bottom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d it but upon the fantaſtical deluſions of your own hearts, and not upon the grounded evidence of Gods Word; if ſo, that your aſſurance have had an ill bottome, it is no wonder if God turn it upſide-down. If it be not rightly grounded, it will never long be continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. Examine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon what grounds you have bottomed your aſſurance, and if you finde the fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dation of your comforts to be ill laid, you muſt pluck up all again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Search how you managed your aſſurance. It may be you managed your aſſurance with pride, not humility; it may be with unwatchfulneſs, and careleſneſſe of ſpirit, and did not take notice of thoſe temptations and ſuggeſtions that might impair your comforts; &amp; if ſo, it is no wonder if the devil ſows tares among your wheat; it is no wonder if the devil have ſtolen away your comforts, if you have laid down your watch.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Examine what ſpecial cauſe there was in your hearts, that might provoke God to cloud you in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and to take away your aſſurance from you. And here that you might a little be directed in this ſearch, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of your eclipſe, and of the removal of your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, unto this twofold head. Either it hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſome great tranſgreſſion, or elſe the omiſſion of ſome weighty duty, that may provoke God to darken your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the commiſſion of ſome great tranſgreſſion. Great ſins they lay a foundation for great diſcomforts in tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Great ſins they lay the conſcience waſte; to make it that was as a well-trimmed and impaled garden, to be as a ruinous wilderneſſe. Great relapſes they bring ordinarily dark eclipſes upon the ſoul. And here that I might put you on this ſearch, I would adviſe you to ſeach what particular ſin it was, and how you might know the tranſgreſſion that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, to take away your comforts from you. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if ſo be God did take away your comforts immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the committing of any groſſe ſin, then you may be ſure that ſin was the occaſion. Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:33775:80"/>Secondly, If the commiſſion of one ſin, do bring upon you more then an ordinary meaſure of hardneſs of heart, then you may be ſure that was the ſin, Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any ſin makes you remiſſe in ſpiritual duties, that was the ſin provoked God to take away your comforts from you. And by ſuch a ſearch as this, you might finde out, and give a ſhrewd gueſs at the particular provocation.</p>
               <p>And here the particular tranſgreſſions I would have you ſearch about, they are ordinarily theſe four, that ingages God to take away comforts from a people. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſin of ſuperciliouſneſs, and uncompaſſionateneſs of ſpirit towards doubting Chriſtians. If a ſoul carries a proud and ſupercilious eye over poor Chriſtians, and carries no compaſſion towards doubting ſouls. God for that ſin of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bowels of compaſſion, may bring him to the ſame eſtate, which he could not compaſſionate in other men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſin of grieving the Spirit; if you grieve Gods Spirit, God will grieve yours, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.10. Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſin of ſpiritual pride; ordinarily this may be the ſin. Or,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſin of worldly-mindedneſſe, or eager purſuit after the things of this world. As digging in the earth doth endanger a man to be ſtifled with damps; ſo digging and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the world brings but a damp upon a Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and many times ſtifles their aſſurance. As the Sun is eclipſed by the interpoſition of the Moon between it and our ſight, ſo if the world once get between the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and you, it will eclipſe the Sun that you ſhall not ſee the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall not perceive nor gain that intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt you had in former time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another cauſe you are to ſearch; If it be not the commiſſion of ſome great tranſgreſſion, yet it may be the omiſſion of neceſſary and weighty duty, and the Lord may bring you upon the ſtage of diſcomfort for omiſſion as well as commiſſion. If a man do let but a wound go undreſſed, he may as well die, as if you knock him with a Beetle upon the head: Beloved, If you let your wounds be undreſſed, and let your diſcomforts be unlooked after, and let all run at ſixes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33775:80"/>
and ſevens; if you interrupt in your duties, it is juſt with God to interrupt you in your comforts. If you keep not your watch, 'tis no wonder if you are ſurprized. There are many Chriſtians that grow careleſſe in keeping communion with God, that love ſeldome reading, and ſeldome praying, and ſeldome examining their own hearts; (alas) men caſting away their duties, it makes God in judgement make ſtoppage in a way of comfort.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In your ſearching work examine your ſelves what you would do in caſe God ſhould reſtore to you your former evidences; could you bring your hearts to this temper, that you would think no pain; too much to take, no coſt too much to give, nothing ſhould be irkſom to you that God would have you perform, in caſe he would give you your wonted comforts? If you finde this temper of ſpirit in you, this is a very ready way to bring on your comforts, and reſtore the joyes of your ſalvation to you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Set upon humbling work: the onely way to gain what you have loſt, is to mourn over your loſſes. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. See how <hi>Ephraim</hi> comes to have his comforts reſtored, when he wept over his own diſcomforts: <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelfe,</hi> ſaith God, and I ſaid, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſonne, I ſaw him ſmitting upon his thigh,</hi> humbling his ſoul for his ſins; <hi>and ſince I ſaw him, I do earneſtly remember him, and I will ſhew mercy to him.</hi> Here you ſee lamenting <hi>Ephraim</hi>; God in the very time of his bemoaning himſelfe, reſtored his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to him: we hear many lament for their outward loſſes, but who laments for the loſſe of inward comforts? And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> after he had loſt his comforts by that great ſin of adultery, makes ſeven penitential Pſalmes, Pſalmes of lamentation or repentance; and he calls one of them, <hi>A Pſalm to call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi> And as an Author well notes, when <hi>David</hi> came to renew his comforts, he makes a Pſalm to call to rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thoſe ſins that might provoke God to take away his comforts from him: So Beloved, let it be your work to make ſuch Pſalmes in your Cloſets, and make it your practice to call to remembrance thoſe evils that provoke God to eclipſe your comforts to you, and let that humble you.

finde out the Particular ſin, labour to humble your ſoules for every ſin, and then to be ſure you cannot miſſe that.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Would you reſtore your wonted comforts? then ſet upon praying work. This courſe you ſinde <hi>David</hi> took; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me, O Lord, to hear the voice of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken might rejoyce. Create in me a new heart, and eſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit,</hi> verſe 12. Here you read of <hi>Davids</hi> praying work, how he poured forth his ſoul in prayer, that God would reſtore to him the joyes of his ſalvation. And here in your praying work I would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt in three directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, pray for a diſtinct ſight of thoſe evils that provoked God to take your comforts from you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After you have got a ſight, bend the ſtrength of your prayers moſt againſt thoſe evils that did ſo provoke God to cloud your comforts. Pray againſt them, as againſt the deadlieſt enemy you have in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Pray for attaining thoſe graces that may be inlets to ſpiritual comfort, as the graces before named: the grace of godly ſorrow, the grace of humiliation, the grace of faith, and of love to Jeſus Chriſt. Thus if you ſet upon ſearching, upon humbling, and upon praying work, you are in a likely way to have your comforts reſtored.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Set upon the work of Meditation; and in this work, I ſhall commend four meditations you are to take into your thoughts, which may be very helpful and uſeful to you in reſtoring your comforts. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let your meditations run upon this, that ſometimes you are not ſo competent Judges of your own ſpiritual eſtate, as others may be; As,</p>
               <p>Firſt In a time of deſertion, when God hath left you and frownes upon you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In times of temptation, when the devils temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are violent againſt you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In times of Relapſe, when you are fallen into ſome great ſin; at this time you are not ſo competent Judges of your own eſtate, but ſtanders by may ſee more of your own good, and your own ſincerity, then your ſelves may do; as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33775:83"/>
the Proverb is: Many tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, when thou canſt not do it thy ſelfe. A childe when it blubbers and cries, can ſee nothing of his book: So when Chriſtians are ſad, and ſullen, and lumpiſh, they can hardly read any thing of their evidence. Mr. <hi>Throgmorten</hi> got his aſſurance this way, by the Teſtimony of a company of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, Meditate and think upon the comforts God gave you in wonted time, and call them to minde. Do as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>I called to minde the dayes of old, and the years of many generations.</hi> Call to minde ancient dayes, did not God ſhew thee his face? did not God bear thee in the palmes of his hands? did not God give thee many a ſmile of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and many a pledge of his love, even by affliction it ſelfe? did not God ſet many a ſeal upon thy heart, that thy comforts were true, thy evidence clear, and thy ends ſincere towards God? Beloved, call to minde the former frame of thy ſpirit, how thou waft in wonted times, and this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being backed by Gods Spirit, may be a great meanes to reſtore thy comforts to thee; paſt goodneſſe ſhould be preſent encouragement.</p>

What Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſay of the body, We are nouriſhed of thoſe things, of which we are begotten and generated. So I ſay of comforts: The very ſame thing that begot comforts, the ſame will reſtore your comforts again. Now think upon this in your practice, and conſider, What way did I gain my comforts in yeares paſt? did I gain my comforts by godly ſorrow, and by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting after God, and by mourning over thoſe abominable failings in my practice? now take the ſame courſe to reſtore

thy evidences. Goe and mourn in thy cloſet over thy uneven walking before God. Goe lament for thy ſins, mourn after thy Father, and tell him thou art grieved at the heart that he is ſo great a ſtranger to thy ſoul. Didſt thou gain thy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in dayes paſt by humbling thy ſoul often before God? Set upon humbling work again. Didſt thou gain thy comforts in dayes paſt by walking cloſely with thy God? Amend thy paths, and direct thy waies unto thy Maker for daies to come there is the very ſame way to reſtore your comforts, that was at firſt to gain your comforts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let your Meditations work upon thoſe comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Promiſes in the Goſpel, that hold forth moſt comfort to a dejected ſoule. And truly I am perſwaded, Chriſtians Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations running more upon their own failings, and their own jealouſies, and upon their own miſtakes, then upon Goſpel-promiſes, hath been the great occaſion they have layn ſo long under a ſpirit of bondage, and under a dark eclipſe in the want of the comforts of Gods Spirit. Therefore now let your Meditations work upon thoſe Promiſes that hold forth moſt comfort to a dejected and deſerted ſoule. And here I ſhall name five or ſix moſt comforatble Promiſes in the Word; As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15 <hi>The Lord that dwels in the high and holy places, he doth revive the ſpirit of the humble, and of the contrite one.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>The Lord dwels in the Heavens, and yet with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, that trembles at his Word</hi>; with him will God dwell.

Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>anointed,</hi> that is, appointed by God the Father, <hi>to preach the Goſpel to the poor, to binde up the broken in heart, and to comfort them that mourn.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.10. <hi>The Lord will reſtore comfort to thee, and to thy Mourners.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. <hi>The Lord will ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Say unto the weak Chriſtian in grace, comfort, and confirm and ſtrengthen them: <hi>And ſay
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33775:84"/>
unto them that are of a fearful heart, Be ſtrong</hi>; Poor fearfull doubting ſoules, that feare every temptation, and feare every corruption, and feare they ſhall loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their reward: Say unto that fearful heart, Be ſtrong and fear not. <hi>For your God will come with vengeance, even God will come with recompence and ſave you. And then the eyes of the blinde ſhall be open, and the eares of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped</hi>; it is not meant of the bodily eye, but thoſe that were blinde, and could not ſee the myſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies of Chriſt, and could not read their own comforts; then their eyes ſhall be open. And the deaf that, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, refuſed to be comforted, that would not hearken to comfort, but would ſtop their eares againſt all comfortable doctrines, and onely give way to ſorrow, their eares ſhall be unſtopped. <hi>And the lame men ſhall leap like a Hart</hi>; the poor halting Chriſtian, that halts in his comforts, that is now believing, anon ſtaggering; now rejoycing, anon deſpairing; the poor lame man ſhall leap like a Hart: <hi>And the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing</hi>: the poor man that could not ſpeak one word of his own graces, and of his own comforts, and touching his own evidence, <hi>The tongue of the dumb ſhal ſing.</hi> O Beloved, here is your work, in caſe you would be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to reſtore your comforts again; ſet upon the work of Meditation, to think upon theſe precious Promiſes of the Goſpel, that hold forth moſt comfort to a drooping and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſinner.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note>There remains now onely one Uſe more to diſpatch about this ſubject, and then I paſſe to the third point drawn from theſe words. And the Uſe ſhall be of Conſolation; from all that hath been ſaid touching the aſſurance of our effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ſhall only direct my diſcourſe to lay down ſix or ſeven Conſolatory Concluſions to thoſe Chriſtians who are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, yet happily have not a ſenſible aſſurance of their own calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, take this for a truth, that Aſſurance is neceſſary, not for the being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for the wel-being of a Chriſtian. It is not neceſſary to his eſtate, but to his comfort. It is not neceſſary as food is to the life, but only as Phyſick is to the body. A man cannot live without food; a man may live without Phyſick. Aſſurance is but as a comfortable cordial to the ſoul; Grace is as food to keep the ſoul alive; though you doe want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, this Cordial to bear you up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that many of Gods dear children, they may lie a very long time in the want of this aſſurance, touching their effectual calling. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. It is ſaid of <hi>Heman,</hi> 14, 15, 16. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33775:85"/>
                  <hi>Lord, why haſt thou caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ff my ſoule? and why haſt thou hid thy face from me?</hi> Mark his complaint: <hi>I am ready to die.</hi> And was this only a fit of deſertion, or was it a continued act? yes; Verſ. 16. <hi>From my youth up I ſuffer thy terrours, I am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and thy fierce wrath goes over me. Heman</hi> lay under the ſtate of deſertion from his childhood; for here he tels you his eſtate, that he was not troubled for a day, or two, or three, and then his troubles were over; but from his youth up he lay under this perplexity, that he thought God had caſt off his ſoule, and the terrours of God lay upon him: And yet this man none queſtions his goodneſſe. For he was the man, as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> thinks, that made this Pſalm; and ſure God would never honour a wicked man to be a Pen-man of the Scripture. The Pſalm is called a golden Pſalm; and it is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby he would teach afflicted conſciences, that they may from their youth up lie under great horrour, and lie under ſad ſuſpence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning their everlaſting eſtate, and yet they may have grace at the root for all this. And <hi>Heman</hi> doth not only expreſſe it, as if he had an ordinary trouble of minde; but he expreſſeth it, that he lay under an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weight of Gods wrath, Verſ. 7. <hi>Thou haſt laid me in the loweſt pit of darkneſs, and in the deep, and thy wrath it lies heavy upon me.</hi> He did even lie, and ſink, in his own thoughts under the ſenſe af Gods wrath upon him. This therefor is another comfortable concluſion, That godly men may not onely by fits and ſtarts, but for a long time, for many years together lie under a ſtate of ſpiritual deſertion. For ſome men think of <hi>Heman,</hi> that he was above threeſcore yeares of age, when he wrote this Pſalm; yet from his youth up till that age, he lay under this horror and perplexity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That many of Gods dear children may be ſo long plunged under deſertion, and under the want of Aſſurance, that they may refuſe and withſtand comforts, when God offers it to them in the Goſpel, and yet may have grace ſtill. As a man in a feaver, or diſtracted by ſome violent diſeaſe, though you bring him a Cordial that may abate his diſeaſe, the man in a fit will through the glaſſe againſt the wall, though it be the only meanes of his remedy. It is ſo with godly men;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33775:86"/>
many times they are ſo accuſtomed to ſadneſſe in the want of aſſurance, that they may refuſe comforts when God offers them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Aſaph, my ſoule refuſeth to be comforted</hi>; a ſtrange ſpeech: Though he was offered comfort, yet his ſoule refuſed it. Here then, Beloved, this may be a very great prop to thee, that thou mayſt ſo long be accuſtomed to a courſe of doubting, that thou mayſt refuſe comfort when God tenders it, and yet be a gracious heart ſtill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and this is more comfortable yet. That rather then God will let his people live and die without aſſurance, he will work aſſurance in you by a miracle, or by ſome unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or extraordinary way. A famous inſtance you have for this, of a Gentlewoman that once lived in this City, (its Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> that relates the ſtory) one Mris <hi>Honywood</hi>; who was a famous profeſſor of Religion, and a woman that for many yeares was much troubled in mind for the want of her aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. At length there came a Miniſter to her, who endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſettle her hopes and comforts in Jeſus Chriſt; and he urging promiſes to her, ſhe took it with a kind of indignation and anger, that he ſhould offer to preſent any promiſe to her, to whom ſhe thought it did not belong; and having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Venice glaſs in her hand, ſhe holds up the glaſſe and ſaid, Speak no more to me of ſalvation, for I ſhall as ſurely be damned as this poor Venice glaſs ſhall be broken againſt the wall, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with all her force to break it. But it pleaſed God, by a miraculous providence to preſerve the glaſſe whole. The Miniſter ſeeing this, took up the glaſs, and ſaid, Behold, God muſt by a miracle work faith in you, before you will believe. And from that day, the ſtory ſaith, ſhe was a woman very ſtrong in the aſſurance of Gods love. Here you ſee how God did indulge the infirmity of his poor ſervant. Rather then thou ſhalt live and die without aſſurance, God will bring it about even by a Miracle, this woman, it may be, had died unaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if God had not confirmed her by ſome unuſual way. I have read likewiſe in the Book of Martyrs, of Mr. <hi>Glove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> that all the while he was in priſon, he was under a ſtate of deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and very much clouded in his comforts, and could not have any apprehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſion of Gods love to his ſoule. Yet when
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33775:86"/>
he came to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and ſaw the ſtake, and the fire in which he was to be burnt, he cried out, I have found him, I have found him; and profeſt of himſelfe, he was as full of joy as his heart could hold. The Lord made the very ſight of the ſtake to be an inlet to preſent joy. One would have thought that the ſight of the ſtake ſhould have daunted him; whereas he then grew moſt confident.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That though grace in thy heart be unchangeable, yet the ſenſe and feeling of thy own graces is ſubject to great variation and change. Grace in it ſelfe is unchangeable. All the Devils in hell cannot pluck the meaneſt believer out of Chriſts hand. <hi>Thoſe whom thou haſt given me, I will keep,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and none ſhall take them from me. The foundation of God ſtands ſure</hi>; though thy knowledge that thou buildeſt upon that foundation may not be ſure to thee. <hi>The Lord knows who are his,</hi> though thou mayſt not. Grace it ſelfe is not changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though thy feeling of grace is ſubject to many alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and changes. Though grace it ſelfe be an unſhaken foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, yet our feeling of grace is not ſo. In our feeling of grace, we are like the aire, ſometimes clear, ſometimes clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; we are like the Sea, ſometimes ebbing, ſometimes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ebbing in your comforts, as well as flowing in your graces. Believers in their feeling of grace, are like the trees of the field, ſometimes flouriſhing green and growing; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time at the fall of the leafe, like a withered ſtump. So are Chriſtians touching their own feeling; their apprehenſion of their graces is ſubject to much change, though their graces be not ſo.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That the want of Aſſurance is not ſimply prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian, though it be prejudicial to the conſolation of a Chriſtian. It is no way prejudicial to your ſalvation, but you may be ſaved, though you are not aſſured. For firſt, this want of aſſurance is no prejudice to your free acceſſe to the Throne of grace: you may come freely to preſent your requeſts to God, though you are not aſſured of acceptance. As it is the ſaying of an Authour: Though God ſhewes thee not his face, yet he may lend thee his eare, when thou commeſt to him in prayer; God lends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33775:87"/>
a Chriſtian an ear in prayer, though they ſee not his face, nor the glimpſe of his favour. Secondly, Thy want of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall not hinder thy ſucceſs in prayer, but thou maiſt go away with an ample returne, though thou doeſt not go away with fulneſs of comfort. <hi>Benjamin</hi> when he was with <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Aegypt, he had a token of love from <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a golden Cup in his ſack, though he knew it not. This is a lively Embleme of the carriage of our <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, to his young <hi>Benjamins,</hi> who may put a love token in your hearts, and may give you a golden cup, and give you grace, and you not know that grace is there. And laſtly, It doth not hinder your recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, but you may be at peace with God, though you know not that the agreement is made up; there may be reall friendſhip between God and a Believer, though there may be ſome ſeeming enmitie. <hi>Thou holdeſt me for thine enemy,</hi> ſatth <hi>Job,</hi> yet God did not, though he thought ſo. <hi>Zion</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me,</hi> Iſa. 49.14. But God had not done ſo, for he tels them a little before, almoſt in one breath, <hi>Though a Mother may forget her ſucking childe, yet will I not forget you</hi>: So that there may be ſome ſeeming jars when there is no enmity at all between God and you.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Chriſtians, who have attained the ſtrongeſt and higheſt degree of faith, have yet had many defects and doubtings mingled with their faith. <hi>Lord, I believe,</hi> Mark 9. <hi>Yet help my unbeliefe,</hi> yet that man attained to a high pitch of faith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Night and day we pray exceedingly for you, that we may ſee your face, and perfect that which is wanting in your faith.</hi> Now you muſt not take theſe <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> as if they were new Converts, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a people weak in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith; but herein lies the Emphaſis, that though theſe <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were the moſt eminent Chriſtians of all the world, yet they had a great defect in their faith. Therefore compare this with 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>You were examples to all that believe in</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>for from you ſounded out the word of the Lord not onely in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>but alſo in every place your faith to Godward is ſpread abroad.</hi> The people in every place ſpake of the great meaſure of faith that was in the godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Church, and yet though their faith was ſo eminent,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33775:87"/>
and they Chriſtians ſo eminent as they were, yet they had ſome defects, and they had ſomewhat lacking in their faith for all this. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.5. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. So that here is very great comfort for Believers, that the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians in the Faith have had great defects that have attended their graces.</p>
               <p>Thus having finiſhed theſe ſeven comfortable Concluſions, becauſe I would have no deluded ſinner nuzzled up in preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous perſwaſions of his own bleſſedneſſe, when he is a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man, and deſigned for hell; I have two or three ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions to lay down, for all you that harbour groundleſſe and preſumptuous perſwaſions of your effectual calling, when you are not. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, You that nouriſh preſumptuous perſwaſions of your effectual calling, when you are not, take this concluſion to dread your hearts, That it is likely you ſhall never be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by Jeſus Chriſt. There is no man ſo unlikely to be truly called by Chriſt, as that man that thinks he is called, when he is not. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Righteous men <hi>i.e.</hi> that thought they were righteous, and in their own eye thought they had grace, and were as good as the beſt, <hi>I came not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to call them, but ſinners, i.e.</hi> ſinners that ſee their ſin, and ſee their need of a Saviour, and are ſenſible of their loſt and undone condition without Chriſt, Chriſt came to ſave them, and to call them to repentance: Of all men in the world, you are moſt unlikely to be called that nouriſh ungrounded perſwaſions of your effectual calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whilſt you live in this world, you are meere ſtrangers to that inward and ſpiritual joy which every true Believer feeles and findeth by Jeſus Chriſt. You <hi>do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with thoſe inward ſolaces, and ſweet enjoyments of heart,</hi> which every ſincere Believer hath in Jeſus Chriſt. A man that hath aſſurance upon good ground, he is ſo filled with joy, that it will bear him up againſt all the ſufferings and ſorrowes he may meet with here in the world. He that hath aſſurance, no ſuffering can daunt him. As <hi>Adolphus Clarebachius,</hi> when he was burning at the ſtake, he was ſo filled with the aſſurance of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33775:88"/>
Gods love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſaith of himſelf, I think in my heart, there is not a merrier heart in the world, then mine is. And ſo another Martyr burning at the ſtake ſaith, I taſte as much ſweetneſs, and finde as much eaſe now I am in the flames, as if I lay upon a bed of Roſes. The fulneſs of his joy in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love, made him willingly undergoe any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> was in priſon, till he was in priſon; <hi>Bainam</hi> ſaid when he was in the fire, I feel no more then if I were in a bed of down. Whereas, thou that harboureſt falſe perſwaſions, thy hopes will ſhrink when thou commeſt to ſuffer, like cloth not well woven, on a rainy day; thy deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will never bear up thy ſpirit to ſo high a pitch as theſe are, This is thy miſery, thou wilt never have that ſweet peace and rejoycing in thy heart Believers have, who are aſſured upon Scripture grounds.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take this for thy dread, that thou wilt be thrown into hell before thou art aware. It is the ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Bolton.</hi> That man that takes up a falſe perſwaſion of his effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when he is not, he is like unto a man that is in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dream, who dreames he is a King, and hath a Kingdome, and hath Treaſures full of Silver and Gold; yet when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes, behold the man hath nothing. He compares him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to a man that is aſleep upon the Maſt of a Ship; he is in a golden dream, and dreams of Kingdoms, and of thouſands which he hath, and happily in a moment the wind ariſeth, the ſhip is toſſed upon the waves, and the man is tumbled into the Ocean and drowned. It is ſo with many men, who nouriſh golden dreames and hopes that heaven is theirs, and Chriſt theirs; when as (alas) they are tumbled and thrown into hell, before they are aware. And this ſhould be a dreadful medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy heart, that harboureſt preſumptuous perſwaſions of thy effectual calling, when thou art not.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done in eleven Sermons with this Doctrine, touching effectual calling. I paſs now to the third and laſt point, drawn from theſe word: and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſtians ought to put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are eternally elected by God to life and ſalvation.</hi> Give diligence to make your calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:33775:88"/>There are many profitable points to be handled in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of this Doctrine, I ſhall only in this remnant of time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a few. And firſt I ſhall ſhew you what rlection is:</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether a man may be ſure of his own Election, ſeeing election is an act from eternity. How can a man be ſure of that which was done in Gods councel before we had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Thirdly, by what diſcoveries may a man infallibly judge that he is elected.</p>
               <p>In the diſcuſſion of this Doctrine, I begin with the firſt, What election is?</p>
               <p>Which that you may know, I ſhall lay down this brief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Election is an eternal decree or purpoſe of God, whereby he hath freely choſen out of the maſs of mankinde, a ſmall eompany of men and women, that ſhall come to everlaſting life and ſalvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> This is election.</p>
               <p>And here in this deſcription there are theſe things to be taken notice of. Firſt, I call it an <hi>eternal purpoſe</hi>; becauſe, though a man be not juſtified from eternity; yet he is elected from eternity. God from eternity had a purpoſe that man ſhould be juſtified, and ſhould be called, and ſhould be ſaved. Election is from eternity, though vocation, juſtification, and glorification be not ſo. Hence you read in Scripture, when it ſpeaks of Election, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath elected us in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world.</hi> But it is never ſaid ſo of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God had a purpoſe to make us happy, and a purpoſe to call us in time, and a purpoſe to juſtifie us from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Secondly, I call it <hi>a purpoſe, whereby he doth freely chuſe.</hi> And this I doe in oppoſition to that Papiſtical Tenet, that God doth predeſtinate or elect men to ſalvation upon the foreſight of good works. A moſt abominable opinion, and takes off the freeneſſe of this act of Gods election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace</hi>: ſo I ſay thirdly, <hi>Whereby God doth freely chuſe out of the maſſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde a few to obtain life and ſalvation.</hi> In oppoſition to thoſe that hold for univerſal redemption, and univerſal Grace; As <hi>Origen,</hi> and from him many more have been tainted with this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:33775:89"/>
error, to hold Election univerſal. And ſo many of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: Now the Scripture tells us, that <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Election ſignifies a choice; now a choice, the very word emports a rejecting of ſome, and a culling out of others. The word Election imports, that all ſhall not be ſaved. <hi>Origen</hi> held this, that all men ſhould be ſaved; that Election ſhall extend to every man. Yea, the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils at the day of judgment ſhall be ſaved: which is an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among Chriſtians not to be named; for Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs but to a few.

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, Whether may a Chriſtian in this life be aſſured of his eternal Election; foraſmuch as Election was done in the decree of God, before ever he had a being, or the world was? Therefore ſeeing we are not privy to Gods decree and councel, how can it be ſaid, that we may know and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of our Eternal Election? Indeed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> they beat down this Doctrine. And hence it is that in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> there was this Canon made, that if any man ſhould ſay he was bound to believe that he was of the number of them that God hath predeſtinated, or elected to life, let him be an accurſed man. They did endeavour to beat down aſſurance, and held, that all that a man could have, muſt be onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural aſſurance, or ſome kinde of hopes of ſalvaiton, and no other. Now that you might not erre in this point, ſee what the Scripture ſpeaks in this caſe. That though Election be an act of God from eternity, yet a believer may firmly and fully know his own election: And this I ſhall make good by ſeveral places of Scripture. Read <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rejoyce not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples, <hi>that you have power to caſt out Devils, that they are ſubject to you, but rather rejoyce in this, that your names are written in the book of life.</hi> That is, rejoice not that you can work miracles; that wicked men can doe that are not elected; but rather rejoyce that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life; that is, that in Gods decree you are elected to ſalvation. Now, how could they rejoyce, unleſſe they knew this? So, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Knowing brethren, beloved,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33775:89"/>
your election of God.</hi> The Apoſtle takes it for granted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did know they were elected. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world was, having predeſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Many more Scriptures I might urge, but in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, it is enough to confirme every truth:</p>
               <p>But now, though the Scripture be thus clear, yet there are ſome objections that ſeemingly oppoſe this truth, which I muſt ſatisfie. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as far as I have read in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I finde five objections they draw from Scripture againſt this truth, that a man may be aſſured of his Election: for, ſay they, it was an act of Gods, done before we had a being, and how can we be aſſured of that? I will therefore, beloved, firſt produce thoſe Scriptures that they pretend wil overthrow this point, and then take off what ſeemes to make againſt it. The firſt Text they urge, is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Paſſe the time of your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here in fear.</hi> This Scripture (ſay they) bids us paſſe our time in fear; and if ſo, then we cannot be aſſured of our Election, but we muſt fear all the daies of our life, whether we are elected or no.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall anſwer briefly. You muſt know the fear that the holy Ghoſt here preſſeth, that men ſhould paſſe their time in fear, is not meant of a fear about our election; but it is meant of a feare of ſin; that we muſt not ſinne againſt God, but feare God, and feare to provoke God by our ſinne. And if you ask how this appeares, I make it appear plainly thus; for verſ. 18. it is ſaid, <hi>Knowing beloved, that you are not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Now this verſe proves clearly, that they knew they were redeemed by Chriſts blood, and ſo by conſequence knew their Election. Therefore the Apoſtle did not preſſe a fear, to beat down the knowledge of their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, <hi>paſſe your time in fear, i.e.</hi> fear to offend God, and fear to ſin againſt him.</p>
               <p>Another objection they urge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s this: The Scripture, ſay they doth often commend feare to us; and ſurely fear and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33775:90"/>
cannot ſtand together. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth alwaies.</hi> Now, if a man muſt alwaies fear, then the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt a man can have is hope; and ſo hang between hope and fear all our daies. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That the fearing alwaies, iwhich <hi>Solomon</hi> annexed bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not meant of the fear about a mans election, but only a fear to ſin againſt God. And if you ask me how that appeares, read the whole verſe, <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth alwayes, but he thaet hardens his heart ſhall run into miſchiefe.</hi> Now mark, by the Antitheſis it is apparent, that fear there, is not a fear of our everlaſting eſtate, but onely a feare in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to hardneſſe of heart in wicked men, that go on in a courſe of ſin.</p>
               <p>Another place they urge is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Now, ſay they, the Scripture tells us, that every man, though never ſo firm, as he thinks, about his election; yet he muſt take heed, he may fall from grace, and be damned for all this. Now by way of anſwer to this, I would lay down two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of men that have a grounded aſſurance of their election; but to men that lie in carnal ſecurity, and have deluded perſwaſions of their good eſtate, and this appeares by the Text; for he ſaith, <hi>let him that</hi> thinks <hi>he ſtands.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>let him that ſtands</hi>; for he cannot fall, but <hi>he that thinks he ſtands.</hi> Thoſe men that nouriſh preſumptuous and ungrounded perſwaſions, that they are in a good eſtate, and in a happy condition, let them take heed; leſt they fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the falling here is not meant a falling away from grace, or a falling away finally after election, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; but it is onely meant of a falling into ſin: and ſo the meaning is this, <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, i. e.</hi> that thinks he is ſtrong in grace, and ſtands upon his own legs, let that man take heed leſt he fall into ſinne. Now a man may take heed of falling into ſinne, yet no way queſtion his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And if you ask how I make it appear that this is the intendment and ſcope of the place; I anſwer, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Read the foregoing verſe, <hi>Let us not tempt Chriſt, as they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33775:90"/>

               <p>Secondly, fear and trembling may very well be conſiſtent with this grace of aſſurance; for we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord with trembling.</hi> You may fear, and yet rejoyce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

But then they object, how can this be? for <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>perfect love caſteth out feare.</hi> I anſwer, that though <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>perfect love caſteth out fear</hi>: yet <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay, that imperfect love caſteth out feare. Now in this life our love is imperfect, and therefore mixt with feare; but in Heaven our love is perfect, and ſo caſts out all feare.

               <p>One Scripture more (which indeed is the main Pillar they reſt upon) is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11 34. <hi>Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his Counſellour?</hi> Here, ſay the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture challengeth any man in the world to come forth, and ſay that he knows Gods mind; by Gods mind is meant Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. And here <hi>Paul</hi> challengeth all, that no man knows the decree of God from eternity. Therefore, if no man knowes the minde of God, then certainly none know their own Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that is Gods minde, and Gods decree: this they hold an undeniable Argument.</p>
               <p>And here to ſatisfie you in this Scripture, I ſhall lay down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hree things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When it is ſaid, <hi>No man knows the minde of God; nor no man is his Counſellour:</hi> this doth hold true, that no man knows the minde or decree of the Lord, touching other mens Election. The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak this, as if no man knew Gods minde about his own, but about other mens Election, who are elected, and who are not; for that is the ſcope of the place. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they thought all the <hi>Iewes</hi> were damned men; and they cenſured and vaunted over them. Now, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> None knows Gods minde concerning others, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey ſhall be ſaved or damned, while they are in this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no man knows the mind of the Lord in this ſenſe, that is, ſo as to give a reaſon of Gods decree; why God did decree this, and decree that; why God did chuſe <hi>Peter,</hi> and not elect <hi>Iudas</hi>; no man knows the reaſon of Gods decree, and of his wayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No man knows the mind of the Lord, that is, no man knows Gods decree, by looking upon it alone; but by bringing down Gods ſecret will to his revealed will; and ſo we may know his decree. I may make uſe of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Let no man ſay, I will aſcend up to heaven to fetch Chriſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33775:91"/>
thence, but what ſaith the word? the word is is nigh thee, even in thy mouth.</hi> Truſt to that. As if he ſhould ſay, Let no man think to know Gods decrees by going into heaven, and there ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into Gods decrees, for that he cannot doe; but look upon the word, and there he ſhall finde whom God hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and decreed to ſave, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. No man can know by looking barely upon the decree; but if we compare Gods decree with his word, and from the word look upon them that are elected, we may eaſily know whether we are elected or no. Which puts me upon the third head premiſed, How a man may be aſſured in his own ſoule, that he is elected to life and ſalvation by God the Father.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a man that is elected by God to life, ſooner or later God will ſanctifie him by renewing and regenerating grace: And this is onely different from the former in degree; for calling is ſanctifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion begun. Now, when God elects a man, he doth not onely begin the work of grace, but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it on in a courſe of ſanctification. And of this your read 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>We are bold to give thanks to God alwaies for you, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</hi> If God hath from the beginning choſen a man to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Lord doth it through ſanctification; not for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, or for faith foreſeen, but it is through it, as a means whereby we are brought to ſalvation; ſanctifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll runne through our lives, as water through a channel. So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. They that are <hi>elected according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by Chriſt, through ſanctification.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. And therefore beloved, if men live and die, and have not the power of ſanctifying grace upon their hearts and conſciences, and working in their lives, doubtleſs thoſe men are not elected; becauſe this you ſee clearly, that at one time or other God will work this in ſuch men. <hi>Jude</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men elected by God to life and ſalvation ſhal ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later be brought into a ſtate of believing, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> No man that is ordained to eternal life, but ſhall be brought to a believing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33775:93"/>
eſtate. And therefore men living and dying in a ſtate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, are not elected. Hence you read, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. it is called, <hi>the faith of Gods elect</hi>; implying, that all that are elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they die ſhall have faith; and none ſhall have faith, but onely they; and therefore in a peculiar manner, called <hi>the faith of Gods elect,</hi> appropriated only to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That man that is elected, ſooner, or later before he dies, God will work in his heart a ſpecial delight in, and an intire love to the word preached. This you have expreſſed, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods word; therefore ye are not of God, becauſe ye hear not his words.</hi> To be of God, that is, to belong to God by election. Now, he that is of God, God will in time make him hear his word with delight and love; but he that takes no delight therein, is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> elected of God. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Lord will ſooner or later work in the heart of an elect man, love to the people of God, and compaſſion to thoſe who are not the elect and choſen one of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy and loving kindneſs.</hi> The Apoſtle there by the manner of phraſe doth ſeem to intimate thus much, <hi>Put on as the elect of God, &amp;c.</hi> As if it were a thing ordained to, and inſeparable from an elect man, after his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, that he ſhould have bowels of mercy towards thoſe that are not called, and that he ſhould have loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards thoſe that are called. For a man that is once ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and hath the execution of that decree in effectual calling, it is proper to him to have bowels of mercy.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, God will ſooner or later work an elect man into a new courſe of living, and of obedience, from what he had in times paſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>You are elected according to the foreknowledg of God through ſanctification to obedience</hi>; that though you were diſobedient before, ſerving divers luſts, yet God, if he hath choſen you, will bring you in a courſe of obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29 <hi>He hath predeſtinated us.</hi> What to doe? <hi>that we might be conformable to the image of his Son.</hi> God intends, that that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he chooſeth to life, ſhould be conformable to Jeſus Chriſt, and that he ſhall live another manner of life then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that though he hath formerly been ſubject to ſinne and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33775:93"/>
ſatan, yet then he ſhall walk in waies of obedience to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus having briefly finiſht theſe heads, I have onely foure or five cautions to lay down, to bound what hath been ſaid within the limits of truth. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take notice, that theſe ſix defects do not extend to children who die while they are children, but to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are grown in years. A childe that cannot act reaſon, as he is a childe, cannot have any of theſe particulars wrough in him, at leaſt in that way and manner men of years have. A childe, as it is an infant, hath not converſion in that way a man hath, though it hath ſomewhat equivalent to it; as ſomewhat like ſanctification, and ſomewhat like that faith men of years have; but what that is, and how wrought, man cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. In preſſing of this therefore, I ſay, it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to children who die in their infancy, but onely to men come to years of diſcretion, if they live and die without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe ſix effects, they may conclude, they cannot be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the want of theſe ſix particulars for a time, is no Argument of a mans non-election; for before converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is Gods firſt dealing with a ſinner) an elect man may be as vile, and as bad as any wicked man alive. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>In times paſt we were alſo diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and ſerved divers luſts, and lived in pleaſure and excess, &amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. So that the want of this for a time, is no argument of a mans non-election, for then it would follow, a man unconverted is no elect man, which would croſſe the whole tenour of Scripture: But a man living and dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, doth not belong to the election of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I do not preſſe the having of theſe effects actually, if you have them habitually. My meaning is this: A man may be elected, and yet may not act any thing anſwerable to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, nor act with any delight and love to the word, nor act any thing in a way of ſanctification; yet, if you have theſe habitually, in the habit of them, theſe may be teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or evidences of election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I do not preſſe the having of theſe effects ſenſibly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33775:94"/>
to be an evidence of election, if ſo be you have them really. There are many men have theſe really, when they have them not in their own apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I do not preſſe the having of theſe effects gradually, ſo you have them ſincerely. My meaning is this, that a man may be elected; yea, and he may not onely be choſen in Gods eternal decree, but the execution of that decree may be paſſed upon him, that he may be effectually called, and yet he may not have all theſe ſix effects in a great meaſure in the higheſt degree, yet he may have them ſincerely, and ſo be a pledge to his own heart of his eternal election.</p>
               <p>And thus having finiſhed this third Quere, I come now to enter upon another, depending upon the former; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a very dreadful ſubject, and a point to be trembled at, while it is handling, and that is this: what probable gueſſe may be given of a man, that he is not within the compaſſe of Gods election? This is a very high point, and muſt be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a great deal of ſeariouſneſſe, and ſadneſſe; it being a point concerning the ſalvation or damnation of all the men upon earth. And therefore I would intreat you to look about you. Gods decrees they are in Heaven, and it is onely a reall, work of grace upon your hearts on earth, that can give you evidence that thoſe decrees are for good to you, As good wrought is an evidence of Gods purpoſe to ſave you; ſo the contrary work may be an evidence of Gods purpoſe never to ſave you, but of leaving you without the compaſſe of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal election. There can be nothing laid down abſolutely and certainly, yet there may be many probable gueſſes given of the men that are not within the compaſſe of Gods election: Of which I ſhal name but ſix or ſeven ſorts. And I wiſh to God that none of you that are before the Lord this day, have your names written in this black book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt you have juſt cauſe to fear your names are no written in the book of life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That man that falls back from a courſe of profeſſion to a courſe of profaneneſſe, without timely returning; the Scripture gives a ſhrewd gueſſe of ſuch a man, that he is not within the compaſſe of Gods purpoſe to ſave. I do not ſay, every backſliding, and every decaying affection, but a total
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33775:94"/>
and final relapſe; when a man falls, and riſeth not again; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a mans runs from God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eturns not again; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives a gueſſe at him, that he is not within the compaſſe of Gods election. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39. <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Interpreters obſerve, that in theſe words there is a figure, wherein there is leſſe expreſſed, then is intended, <hi>My ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> It is as much as if God ſhould have ſaid, My ſoule ſhall hate, or I will exceedingly hate him. <hi>But we are not of them that draw back to perdition; but of them that believe, to the ſaving of their ſouls</hi>: which words clearly import, that men that draw back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out returning, they draw back to perdition, to damnation; but we are not of them, ſaith the Apoſtle. And here then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, doth this word fall upon any man before God this day? Haſt thou left a courſe of ſtrictneſſe, and fallen into a courſe of prophaneſſe and looſneſſe? Haſt thou fallen from thy God, and never thinkeſt of a returning? I ſhall not cenſure thee now, but if thou liveſt and dieſt in this eſtate, it is an undoubted argument, thou art not within the compaſſe of Gods decree to ſave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men that do make the mercies and goodneſs of God as arguments to embolden them the more in ſin, ſuch men are not likely to be the perſons whom God hath elected to life and glory. In the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 4. It is ſpoken there of <hi>men, that turned the grace of God into wantonness.</hi> And what ſaith the Apoſtle of them, <hi>they are men ordained of old to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Scripture there makes it the badge of a man ordained of old to damnation, when he ſhall perſiſt in this ſinful temper, to turn Gods grace into laciviouſneſſe; that is, to take argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the grace, and mercy, and goodneſſe of God, to walk in waies of ſin. And therefore look to it, and with your hearts bewaile it, all you that are apt to abuſe doctrins of grace; and becauſe God is good you will be evil; becauſe God is merciful, therefore you will be ſinful; if you die in this temper, the Scripture declares, that you are the men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of old to condemnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man that doth walk in a courſe of ſin, wilfully, with malice, and knowingly againſt conſcience, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33775:95"/>
without reluctancy; and perſiſt in this, and live and die thus, that man is not within the compaſſe of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is a phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.5. <hi>Be not merciful, O Lord, unto wicked tranſgreſſors.</hi> It is in ſome tranſlations, <hi>be not merciful to them that ſin of wicked malice,</hi> or <hi>of malicious wickedness.</hi> Now there is this rule which Divines give; that thoſe prayers which were made by <hi>David,</hi> they are rather Propheſies of what ſhould be, then meere prayers that this might be. As <hi>David</hi> prayed againſt the Jewes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>that their table might be a ſnare to them, and that they ſhould alway bow down under their</hi> prayes which was a prophecie, and they did ſo. And ſo he <hi>burden:</hi> here, that God <hi>would not be merciful to men that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of wicked malice</hi>; which is as much as a prophecie, that God will not be merciful to men that ſin of malicious wickedneſſe. And therefore, beloved, all you that ſo live, and reſolve you will die, and haply do die, and yet ſin obſtinately; that, let God command what he can, you wil do what you pleaſe; let the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſay what he will, you will do what you lift; that ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt knowledge, and againſt conſcience, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy; reſolve to live and die in a courſe of ſin: the Lord be merciful to ſuch perſons; for certainly there muſt be no Bible, if ſuch men fall within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That man that by living under the powerful Miniſtry of the Word, is more hard in heart, and worſe in life; if a man grows thus, it is an argument, he is not within the purpoſe of Gods election. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>By hearing, you ſhall hear, but not underſtand; by ſeeing, you ſhall ſee, but not perceive; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33775:95"/>
is to condemn you. So <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and underſtand with their hearts, and be converted.</hi> Here is laid down as an act of Gods, that God did harden their hearts, and God did blind their eyes, leſt they ſhould be converted; Implying, that if men do live and die, in this temper, that they have lived year after year under a powerful Miniſtry, and yet they grow more blind in judgement, and more profane in life, and more hard in heart, after 20, 30, 40 years hearing, then they were before; that the word doth but draw out their wickedneſs, and makes them more profane, and more to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe godlineſs; the Lord have mercy upon ſuch ſoules, for certainly if God leave you thus, it is an argument he never intends to ſave you; for the Lord doth thus with ſuch, that they might not be ſaved. There is a paſſage <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeks for, but the election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the reſt were hardened.</hi> By election is meant the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, (the Abſtract put for the Concrete.) As often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Circumciſion put for Circumciſed; and ſo here; Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction put for elected, <hi>The elected have obtained it</hi>: what did they obtaine? they obtained ſalvation and glory; <hi>but the reſt</hi> that were not elected, <hi>they were hardened.</hi> The Lord there makes it the badge of them that are not elected, that they are a blinded people, and a hardned people. Imitating, that men that are not elected, they ſhall live under the word, yet ſhall be blind in mind, ſhall be hard in heart, ſhall be wicked in life, and the Miniſtry of the word ſhall never reform them. And if any of you be ſuch, O that the Lord would make you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this day, tremble leſt you are not in Gods thoughts, to do you any good another day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when God doth give up men to ſtrong deluſions, not only to believe lies themſelves, but to teach lies to ſeduce others, when the Lord leaves them to live and die in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the Scripture makes it an argument of them that are not choſen by God to life and glory. You ſhall read therefore in that great deluſion of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lies, that all might be damned, that believe not the truth?</hi> It is made a brand of damnation,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that are founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, that ſtrike at the foundation of Religion, wherein men runne ſo far, as never to repent of their errour; that, the Scripture makes the badge of a man, whoſe ſoul is in a world of danger. Read that Text, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>There were falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among the people, like as their ſhall be falſe teachers among you.</hi> And who are they? verſ. 2. <hi>They ſhall deny the Lord that bought them, they ſhall bring in damnable hereſies.</hi> (Every errour is not an hereſie,) but theſe men ſhall bring in damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, <hi>and many ſhall follow their pernicious waies.</hi> Now what is their cenſure? <hi>whoſe judgement now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation ſlumbers not.</hi> Their damnation was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, but for a long time damnation did attend them, and they were in danger of it. So that, beloved, it is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for men to be patrons of errour, eſpecially when they are groſſe and palpable; and when in Scripture language they may be called damnable hereſies. It is an argument, if men live and die thus, that they are not within the purpoſe of Gods Counſel to do them good.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Men that live and die in a continual ſpurning and oppoſition againſt the Goſpel, and word of God powerfully preached, it is a dreadful ſign they are not within the compaſs of Gods election. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>You are not of God, for you hear not his word.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>He that heareth the word, is of God, but you hear not his word, therefore you are not of God.</hi> Therefore you belong not to him. But more pregnant to this purpoſe, is that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46, 47, 48. <hi>It was necessary the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing you put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> Now compare this with verſ 48. <hi>And when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</hi> The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition lies thus: As many as God purpoſed to ſave, they glorified God for his word, and they rejoyced, and were glad in his word: but thoſe that were not decreed to ſalvation, they put off from them the word of the Lord, they ſpurned at
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33775:96"/>
it, and oppoſed it, and could not endure the word of the Lord. Therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>The Jewes ſtirred up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and honourable women, and they raiſed up perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coaſt.</hi> It was ſaid to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16. <hi>By this I know, that the Lord hath purpoſed to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt not harkned to my counſel.</hi> Thus you ſee, the Scripture makes it the badge of a man, that doth not fall within the compaſſe of Gods election, to bring him to life and glory, to live and die in oppoſition to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and this we may ſpeak more confidently and poſitively, that that man is not within the compaſſe of Gods election, who ſinnes the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. <hi>He ſhall neither be forgiven in this life, nor in the life to come.</hi> This is an unpardonable ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. Now I know there are many men, who confine this ſin only to the Phariſees, as if they onely were guilty of it. There are others, that ſay this ſin is ſeldome committed; and ſo many Divines ſpeak favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of it: but, Beloved, I am perſwaded, this ſin is oftner committed, then moſt men in the world dream of; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are plunged into this ſin, that think well of their own ſouls. The ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is only this:</p>
               <p>It is a wilful and deliberate act in a profeſſor of Religion, whereby he doth not onely fall from his profeſſion; but he runns into, a courſe of ſin knowingly, againſt conſcience; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately, againſt counſel; and maliciouſly, againſt Jeſus Chriſt. This is briefly a deſcrption of this ſin. Now I am perſwaded there are many in the world that have profeſſed Religion, that are, if not in this ſin, yet at the very next door to it. And if a man be gone thus farre, this is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>a ſin unto death</hi>; a ſin, which if a man fall into, he may be ſure he ſhall be damned. And thus I have in breif given you an account of theſe ſeven particulars, whereby every man may give a gueſſe in his own thoughts, whether he be within the purpoſe of Gods election unto ſalvation or no.</p>
               <p>I have now, from this ſad Doctrine, only a few comfortable poſitions to lay down, and ſo conclude. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though theſe part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>culars may give you a gueſſe of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33775:97"/>
thoſe that are not within the compaſſe of Gods election, yet no man is bound to make this ſure to himſelfe, that he is not elected. You are bound to make your election ſure, but you are not bound to make your reprobation ſure. For theſe heads I have given out, not to make any godly man queſtion his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to ſtartle wicked men, who live quite contrary, and oppoſite to the elect of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a man may come very nigh to the worſt of theſe ſins, and yet may be an elected man. <hi>We were</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ſometimes diſobedient, deceived, and ſerved divers luſts.</hi> Titus 3.3. And Eph. 2.2. <hi>In times paſt you walked according to the courſe of the world, according to the power of the Prince of the aire, who worketh mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the children of diſobedience.</hi> In times paſt ye were children of wrath, as well as others. In times paſt before calling, you may come very neer to theſe evils, yet be within the compaſs of Gods election, Provided that you do not live and die in thoſe evils. For if ſo, there is no hope of mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That for men to queſtion their election, meerly becauſe they do not finde the ſaving effects of election in their hearts and lives, is rather an argument of their being, then of their not being elected. Becauſe men not elected, they never look after their election, to make it ſure, they will truſt all upon the mercy of God, and grace of God, and never look after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſin never troubles them, profaneneſs never grieves them, want of holineſſe perplexes not them. The queſtioning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of your election ariſing from the evils of your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is rather a ſign that God hath choſen you to life and glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Election it runnes often times to thoſe, that are the worſt ſort of men in the world. Election runnes to them that have been worſt in their lives, before they were called.

Manaſſeh,</hi> that was a cruel murderer, and Idolater, yet election ran to him. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a common ſtrumpet, out of whom Chriſt caſt ſeven

Devils, yet election ran to her. <hi>Rahab,</hi> a Harlot; <hi>Paul,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, a blaſphemer, a man injurious to the Saints; yet <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>He was a choſen vessel unto God,</hi> and obtained mercy. God, to magnifie the riches of his free grace, lets election run to the worſt of men that are in the world. And this ſhould be great comfort to you; though you have been drunkards, and though you have been Sabbath breakers and adulterers, and though you have been profane, yet if you can but now cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, and look after heaven, if you can but now mourn over your condition, and repent of your former fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and come in to Jeſus Chriſt; Election hath run unto men as bad as you, and though you may be now men profane in your lives, yet you may be obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He laſt Doctrin I drew from theſe words was this, <hi>That Chriſtians ſhould put forth a great deal of diligence to make this ſure to their ſouls, that they are eternally ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God to life and glory.</hi> In the proſecution of which, I have gone over ſome queries. There are four difficulties or queries I am further to inſiſt upon in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this point. As namely,</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether this election be univerſal, or no?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether a man that is once elected by God to ſalvation, may come to be damned, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether God, in electing a man to life and glory,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33775:98"/>
doth it out of any foreſight of faith, or any other grace he ſees in man?</p>
               <p>And fourthly, whether this doctrine of election, that God in his own counſel hath determined who ſhall be damned, and who ſaved, doth not take men off from any endeavours after their own ſalvation, to make them deſperate, and neglect the uſe of means; that they ſhall ſay, if I ſhall be damned, I ſhall be damned; and if ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved, let me live as I lift? whether this doctrine will favour this deſperate concluſion, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether election be univerſal, or no? This is that the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> do mightily, drive at. And here they lay down this concluſion, which they make unqueſtionable: That there is ſuch a thing as a certain univerſal election of God, without limitation or reſtraint of perſons, whereby God did determine to ſave all mankind by Chriſt, who were fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi> This opinion was firſt drawn from <hi>Origen,</hi> who held that all creatures ſhould be ſaved; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> mincing the matter, to make it a little more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, then he did, they ſay, that God in his purpoſe did intend to ſave all mankind by Jeſus Chriſt; but man falling away, and walking contrary to their principles, the defect lies in them, that they are not ſaved: and this Divines call univerſal redemption.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this, I ſhall lay down ſeveral Scriptures and then take off the objections that ſeems to ſtrengthen this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for Scripture. In the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ 3. you read of <hi>ſome that were ordained of old to condemnation.</hi> Therefore ſure all could not be ſaved. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Some men are appointed to wrath, but we to obtain ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore all men could not be within the purpoſe of Gods firſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſave. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>The Jewes did not obtain what they ſought for, but the elect obtained it, and the reſt were hardened.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.20. <hi>There are vessels of honour, and vessels of diſhonour.</hi> The Scripture makes it a diſcriminating act in God, that ſome he choſe to life; and others from eternity in his counſel he choſe to wrath and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33775:98"/>
condemnation. And theſe Scriptures will fully overthrow this opinion. And indeed the very word <hi>chuſing</hi> confutes it, which intimates a taking off ſome, with an overlooking of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>But now let us view a little the Arguments of Script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es they abuſe, to ſtrengthen this unſound opinion of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ur</p>
               <p>One is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in Adam all died, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> Now, ſay they, Every man did die in <hi>Adam</hi>; every mothers childe by <hi>Adams</hi> fall became ſubject to death: even ſo, in Chriſt ſhal every man be made alive; the Lord did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that every man ſhould have benefit by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to take off this; I ſhall anſwer it in ſhewing you the true intent and ſcope of this Scripture. This univerſal phraſe of making alive, hath not reference to the ſaving of the ſoul, but to the reſurrection of the body: And ſo the ſence is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That as in <hi>Adam,</hi> by vertue of his ſin, every man came to die a natural death; So in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive; that is, ſo by Chriſts power ſhall every man riſe from the dead. And if you aske how I make that appear to be the intendment of the Text. I anſwer, the words themſelves will make it plain. Verſ. 11. It is ſaid, <hi>By man came death, by man alſo came the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead</hi>: that is, as by that man <hi>Adam</hi> came death, ſo by that man Chriſt ſhall come the reſurrection from the dead: <hi>for as in Adam all died,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that here you ſee, this is brought in as a proof of the 21. verſe: Intimating, that this being made alive, hath no reference to the life of the ſoul, but onely to the Reſurrection of the body; that as <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin brought death to all men, ſo Chriſt by his power ſhall raiſe all men from the dead; <hi>every man in his own order.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould this be granted, that this making alive ſhould have reference to the life of the ſoul; it would bear no more but this, that all that are damned, are damned as in <hi>Adams</hi> loines; and all that are ſaved, ſhall be ſaved as in the loins of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo make nothing at all to prove this which they call univerſal election.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture (undeniable they think) is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. where it ſaid, <hi>God hath concluded all men under unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> Now ſay they, If God did do an
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33775:99"/>
act to make men ſee their unbeliefe, and did intend by this action to have mercy upon all, then God in his counſel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſave all.</p>
               <p>Now to this, <hi>that he might have mercy upon all</hi>; I anſwer: This phraſe <hi>(all)</hi> is not to be taken in an unlimited ſence, that <hi>God ſhut up all men in unbeliefe</hi>; that is, God made all believers ſee their own miſery; that he might have mercy on all them that believe. And if you ask how I prove this to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Text, I anſwer: The Scripture makes it clear, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all men under ſin.</hi> (The very words forequoted.) But what's the limitation? Shall all men be ſaved? No, For mark the next words. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all men under ſin, that the faith of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be given to them that believe.</hi> Now, though <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay thus to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet the words being the ſame, the Reſtriction holds good in both places. So that it is clear, <hi>That he might ſave all,</hi> or <hi>have mercy upon all.</hi> It is not meant all univerſally; but all, with limitation of <hi>Paul</hi> here; all <hi>them that believe.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>Another objection, or Scripture, they abuſe is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This Text <hi>Origen</hi> doth groſly abuſe; holding hence, that it is the intendment and will of God, that all men ſhould be ſaved. Now, to take off this objection; We muſt firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh here of Gods will, and then of this phraſe, <hi>All. Who will have all men to be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, of Gods will; and the Schoolmen give this diſtinction about it. That there is a will of Gods good pleaſure; and there is God ſignifying will.</p>
               <p>Now the will of Gods good pleaſure is, that real purpoſe in God to ſave a man. And there is no man that in this ſence God wills to be ſaved, but he muſt be ſaved; but in this ſence God wills not all men to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, there is Gods ſignificative will, that is, wherby in Scriptures God tenders ſalvation to every man that will lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifying will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no man from ſalvation; but the Miniſters, if they preach to ten thouſand people, they muſt tender Chriſt univerſally
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33775:99"/>
to all, becauſe they know not which of them are elect, and which reprobate; which of them ſhall be ſaved, and which damned. This is Gods ſignifying will, and though God by this will tell you what Miniſters muſt do, to tender Chriſt and ſalvation to all; yet this doth no way follow, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate will of Gods good pleaſure is involved under this, as if all men ſhould be ſaved. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his writings hath this diſtinction of it. That there is Gods abſolute will, and ſo he wills not all men to be ſaved: and Gods conditionate will, that in caſe every man did believe, they ſhould be ſaved; for God envies no mans ſalvation; there is grace enough in God, to ſave every man in the world.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, there may be more diſtinct anſwer given to this place. <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved. All,</hi> is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a deſtributive ſence, and ſometimes in a collective ſence. In a deſtributive ſence, for every man under heaven; and ſo God wills not all men to be ſaved. But ſecondly, in a collective ſence; for all ſorts and degrees of men, and ſo God intends to ſave all; that is, ſome of all ſorts, and of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of men in the world. And this appears if you mark the context. <hi>He will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> that is, ſome of all ſorts. Some Kings, ſome great men, ſome rich, and ſome poor, ſome Princes, and ſome beggars. And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle bids them pray for all men. <hi>Pray,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for Kings and for them in authority: for God will have all men to be ſaved.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, Pray for Kings, becauſe God of his grace may ſave Kings, as well as poorer men, that have leſſe incumbrances, and leſſe imployments in the world, and leſſe withdrawings in their own ſoul, then they have. God will ſave all: ſalvation ſhall come to all ſorts of men, and therefore you may lawfully pray for them. And ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> judiciouſly expounds this place; that God will have all ſorts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f men to obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt: but it is not to be extended univerſally, as if every individual man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be ſaved. 3. Theſe words are to be taken with thoſe that follow after, <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowleg of the truth.</hi> Now that God will be willing to ſave thoſe that come to the knowledge of the truth, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable

all that repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. all oppoſition to the time of the old Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25.</p>

Then, to wrap up this quere in a ſhort uſe; this ſhould teach you all, who are in the Land of the living, not to deceive your ſelves; lull not your ſelves aſleep in ſecurity, for it may be, you may be in Gods counſel to ſave, it may be not.

So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. <hi>God hath not caſt away his people whom he foreknew.</hi> That is, whom God did predeſtinate, he caſts none of them away, none of them ſhall periſh. Many many more Scriptures I might multiply, to ſhew, that a man once elected, can never periſh; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 18.9.2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3. But I would name reaſons as well as Scriptures. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, if election were changeable, then God muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable; which to think, there is nothing more abſurd. If Gods decree be changeable, Gods eſſence and nature were ſo alſo; election being nothing elſe, but God himſelf cuſing: for every thing in God, is God. And this the Scripture tels us, is farre from him; for <hi>there is no variableness or ſhadow of change in God. Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Iſa</hi> 46.10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the elect could periſh, then Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be very unfaithful to his father, becauſe God the father hath given this charge to Chriſt, that whomſoever he elected, Chriſt ſhould preſerve them ſafe, to bring them to heaven. Now ſhould not this be accompliſhed, Chriſt would be unfaithful to his father. <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the fathers will, which hath ſent me into the world, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, ſhould this be true, then <hi>Pauls</hi> golden chain ſhould be broken. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Now to anſwer ſome tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of Scripture they abuſe, (which at firſt view you would think very plauſible) to maintain, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33775:101"/>
a man may be an elect man, and brought into Chriſt, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward damned. The firſt is, <hi>John</hi> 6.70. <hi>Have not I choſen twelve, and one of them is a Devil</hi>? Now ſay they, there were twelve choſen, or elected, and one of them is a devil, did periſh; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that men may be elected, yet periſh for all this. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That there is a double Electing. Firſt, a chuſing to ſome peculiar Office. Secondly, there is an electing to grace, life, and glory. Now, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Have I not choſen you twelve?</hi> it is meant of his chuſing of them to an Office, to the place of an Apoſtle, to be his diſciples. Now it is true, that a man may be choſen to ſome peculiar Office in the Church of God, and yet be a periſhing and damned man; but this phraſe hath no relation to the decree of God from eternity, only to a temporal electing of twelve men to a temporal Office, to the Office of an Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture they abuſe is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. it was <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer, <hi>If thou wilt not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to God) <hi>forgive their ſins, then blot my name out of the book of life.</hi> Now, ſay they, <hi>the book of life</hi> is Gods election: and here <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>that God would blot his name out of the book of life.</hi> Intimating, ſay they, a man may be elected and written in that book, and yet afterward blotted out and periſh.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. That this prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> is onely a wiſh or ſuppoſition, as <hi>Pauls</hi> was, when he wiſht <hi>he were accurſed from Chriſt, for his kindred in the fleſh.</hi> Now a man may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe mountains of Gold, and ſuppoſe things that never were, nor never ſhall be in being: bare ſuppoſitions put nothing in being; ſo here, that <hi>Moſes</hi> makes a ſuppoſition in a pathetical prayer, this doth no way argue, as if his name could be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the book of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Rivet</hi> he expounds it thus, that there is a double book of life. The book of life being ſometimes taken for the eternal councel and decree of God, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. ſometimes for the ſpecial providence of God over men, in preſerving them amongſt the living. So we read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>In thy book,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, were all my members written</hi>: meaning, not in the book of Gods decree, but only in the book of his providence, that all
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33775:101"/>
the members of <hi>Davids</hi> body, they were all under the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that none could hurt him. And ſo <hi>Rivet,</hi> with others, think that by the book of life here is meant, that God, would blot out <hi>Moſes</hi> from the book of his ſpecial protection and let him die as other men, rather then this evil ſhould come upon the people of <hi>Iſrael. q.d.</hi> Deſtroy my name from among men, and do not protect me any longer.</p>
               <p>Again, they object that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. it is ſaid, <hi>Let them be blotted out of the book of life.</hi> Now, ſay they, That is Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to be blotted out, implies, that a man may be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and yet periſh.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, as formerly, that the book of life in that place hath no reference to the decree of Gods Election, but onely to his book of providence, that God would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect wicked men, as he doth his own people, in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And other phraſes in Scripture will ſomewhat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this interpretation. As <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9. <hi>They ſhall not be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the writings of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael. Whats that? <hi>i. e.</hi> let them not any more be thought Iſraelites, nor numbred among the people. And <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> I remember compares <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.19. with this place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.9. and he makes the ſence to be one and the ſame; that to be blotted out of the book of life, is nothing elſe then to be out of Gods protection; to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the catalogue of the living, and have ones life in danger to be brought to death. And this wiſh <hi>David</hi> wiſhed for thoſe wicked men.</p>
               <p>But then they object further from <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19. <hi>If any man ſhall take away from the words of this book, God ſhall take away his part in the book of life.</hi> Here, ſay they, by book of life is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably meant Gods decree; and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>They that take any thing from this book, God will blot him out of the book of life,</hi> and will undoubtedly damn him.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer. I confeſſe in this place the book of life is taken for Gods decree; and that a man may be ſaid to be blotted out of this book, and yet this no way follow, that a man elected may be damned. And here let me give you <hi>Auſtins</hi> words upon the place, which is a very clear and ſatisfactory anſwer. That a man may be ſaid to be blotted out of the book
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33775:102"/>
of life in two regards: Firſt, it is equivalent to this phraſe, that this name ſhall never be written in the book of Life. And you have often ſuch phraſes in Scripture. As it is ſaid in <hi>Matthew, He that doth evill himſelf, and teacheth men ſo to doe, he ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Intimating, not as if he ſhould come to heaven, but that he ſhould not come there at all. To be leaſt there, is never to be there. So here, to be blotted out is equivalent to this, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A mans name may be ſaid to be blotted out of the book of life, not as if it were there in deed and in truth, but in their own opinion; they thought they were elected, and thought their names were written there, they had ſtrong conceits of this; and though they are now deluded, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, yet God will make them know one day, when they are in hell, that their names are blotted out of the book of life. Again,</p>
               <p>Another Scripture they abuſe is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Now, ſay they, if it were not poſſible for a man elected to fall, and fall finally, to what end is this caution of the Apoſtle? it were a needleſs caution, were it not poſſible to come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer two things. Firſt, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, Let him that ſtands, take heed left, &amp;c. but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that men that think they are elected, and think they are in a good condition, they ſhould take heed, leſt they miſcarry to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed leſt they fall.</hi> This falling here is not meant a falling from grace finally, and falling into hell, and periſhing; but the falling here is onely a falling into ſinne, and ſo an elect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an ſhould doe. An elect man, though he ſtand firme in Gods decree, yet he ſhould take heed all the dayes of his life, that he fall not into ſinne. And if you aske me, how I make that appeare, I anſwer, from the context. This is a concluſion, or caution the Apoſtle gives upon the enumeration of ſeveral inſtances of the people of God, that in former ages did ſin againſt God. <hi>As ſome that tempted Chriſt,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33775:102"/>
and fell in one day</hi> 23000. <hi>Others that fell to fornication, and provoked him in the Wildern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse.</hi> With many ſuch ſins reckoned up, and the ſumme of all is this, that ſeeing they that were Gods people fell into ſinne, and were puniſhed, therefore you that think you ſtand, and think you are elected, you ſhould take heed you fall not into ſinne, as they did. And thus I have done with reſolving this ſecond query.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Q.</note> whether doth God elect any man to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon foreſight of his faith or good works? foreſeeing that this man will believe, therefore I elect him to ſalvation; and the other man will not believe, therefore I chuſe him to damnation. Whether, I ſay, doth God in his eternal decree e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any man to life upon foreſight of works. Here the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> joyn both together in maintaining of this. The reaſon, ſay they, why God elects ſome, and not others, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did foreſee from eternity that that man would be holy, and would believe in Chriſt, and therefore God elected him to ſalvation. Theſe are the hard imputations they lay to Gods charge.</p>
               <p>And in the reſolving of this, I ſhall anſwer it in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. That God, in electing a certain number of men to life and ſalvation, did not doe it upon the foreſight of any good works he ſaw would be in them; whether Faith, Repentance, Sanctification, or any other grace. Indeed it is true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> many of them doe not groſly ſay that it was foreſight of good works in general, but the foreſight of faith only, and ſo the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, to overthrow this ungrounded opinion, Firſt, I ſhall lay down Scriptures to confirm this, that God in electing of men to ſalvation, doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> doe it upon foreſight of good works, and then lay down reaſons; and after that take off thoſe objections which ſeem to darken this truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the Scriptures that confirm this, we have <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>He hath ſaved a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that the remnant that are ſaved, it is onely of grace, not of foreſeen works. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 11. <hi>He hath elected us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Gods meer good will was the impulſive cauſe of mans e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ection, and nothing in man.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33775:103"/>
So likewise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. <hi>That Gods election might ſtand, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but according to the good pleaſure of him that called us.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Not of works, but according to his owne purpoſe and grace.</hi> Upon his good pleaſure, and his good will to mankinde, upon that ground election ſtands.</p>
               <p>But now to adde ſome reaſons why it cannot be that God ſhould determine in his own councel, to ſave man upon the foreſight of his works. <hi>I</hi> ſhall name four or five. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the inferiour priviledges that God beſtowes upon his peoples, as vocation, and juſtification, are not for their good works (though they are in actual being) therefore much leſſe is election for good works onely foreſeen. Firſt, for Vocation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We are called, not according to our owne works, but according to the purpoſe of his own grace.</hi> And then for Juſtification, we are not juſtified for works neither. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>We are juſtified freely by his grace, for by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> Now, if vocation and juſtification be not for works, much leſſe is election for works, and for works foreſeen, not being actually in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe then it would follow, that children dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in infancy could not be elected; for the childe being in the mothers wombe, if it hath life, it hath a ſoule, and ſo muſt either be ſaved, or damned. But a childe, while it is in the wombe, neither acts good or evil. Now if God did elect perſons to life upon foreſight of works, then children dying in the wombe could not be elected; becauſe there are no works God could foreſee in them. And then this would be a very uncomfortable doctrine for parents that have children dying young.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then would man have ſomewhat whereof to boaſt before his God, as if he could lay claim to ſalvation from him. If God were bound to chuſe men to ſalvation upon foreſight of good works, then man might ſay, I thank not God, but I thank my believing, and thank my good works, for theſe were the motives for which he choſe me to glory; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hus would poor man boaſt againſt his Maker.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe God hath elected the worſt of men; when others that have more natural worth and goodneſſe are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:33775:103"/>
paſſed by. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, &amp;c. and baſe things of the world, and things that are deſpiſed hath God choſen, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. <hi>I thank thee O Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> Thoſe that had the greateſt worldly wiſedome, and natural abilities, that moſt excelled in outward ſtrictneſſe, and moral vertues, are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when thoſe that are but babes in underſtanding, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times are the worſt for their moralities, are elected; which is a clear demonſtration, that election is not grounded upon faith, or works foreſeen; for then the beſt had been choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Our works carry no proportion to what God hath elected us unto; we are elected to eter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al glory, but our works are finite, imperfect, no more then our duty, yea not done by our own ſtrength, but by the power of Gods grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be that which moveth God to elect us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, becauſe God doth not chuſe men to life for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, therfore much leſs for their works ſake.</p>
               <p>It is true, and miſtake me not, I confeſſe, (and ſo all Divines that are confeſſe this) that God ſaves a man for Chriſts ſake, but God elects not a man for Chriſts ſake, but meerly for his own good pleaſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſake. God in chuſing a man to life, hath no reference to Chriſt, as if Chriſt were the motive. Chriſt was predeſtinated himſelfe, therefore could not be the cauſe of our predeſtination, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. We are choſen in him, its true, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. as the common perſon; God elected Chriſt firſt in order, and all believers in him, but it is not for Chriſts ſake, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will. As ſuppoſe a Kingdome to be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet up, a King is choſen, and his ſueceſſors to follow after; why then all the ſucceeding Kings are choſen in him that was firſt elected: ſo are we choſen in Chriſt. God doth chuſe a man as freely, as if Chriſt did never die; and yet God ſaves none, but for Chriſts ſake; and this makes election on Gods part moſt free. God doth not conſider Chriſt, nor the good works we have, but tis only his own good will engages him to ſave ſome, and neglect others. And thus much for proving
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:33775:104"/>
this point. There are ſome objections now that lie in the way which muſt be removed.</p>
               <p>God, ſay they, doth elect men upon the foreſight of their good works; and they alledge four Scriptures to prove this. <hi>James</hi> 2.2. <hi>Hath not God ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſed the poor of this world to be rich in faith?</hi> now, ſay they, their laying out their eſtates for good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo becoming poor, that is the reaſon why God chuſeth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, and neglects richer men.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>I</hi> anſwer. That poor here is onely ſpoken of, as the quality of the perſons that are choſen, not as the cauſe wherefore they are choſen. And this anſwer <hi>Mr. Perkins</hi> gives: that poverty is not the cauſe why, but the deſcription of the perſons that are choſen, that Gods decree of election doth commonly run among the poorer ſort of men, the more to advance his own grace; that man ſhall not ſay, election is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon works: for if poverty ſhould be the cauſe of their election, then all that are poor ſhould be elected, which is falſe.

immutable, whether doth not this give way to man to be ſecure, and careleſſe in the uſe of the means of grace, that they take no care to get grace, and to get heaven, while they are in the world? This is a very uſeful point to inſiſt upon, ſeeing the <hi>Arminians</hi> charge us with this, that if we hold election without reſpect to Gods foreſight of works in men, then this laies open a gap for men to live as they liſt; that they ſay, If God hath determined they ſhall be ſaved, they ſhall be ſaved; if that they ſhall be damned, they ſhall be damned, whether they are holy, or profane; if God hath elected them to life, they ſhall be ſaved, let them live as they lift. Thus the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> plead. This therefore is the quere, whether this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of election doth adminiſter any ground for ſuch a cavil as this to be in the minds of men?</p>
               <p>To anſwer which, I ſhall firſt lay down this general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That the decree, or the purpoſe of God about the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of man to life and ſalvation, doth no way adminiſter any iuſt ground to men, to make them live as they liſt, and to make them neglect the means of grace and ſalvation. In the cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aring of which, I ſhall lay down three particulars, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you about this matter. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Gods decree about Civil and Temporal matters, doth no way give encouragement to men to neglect the uſe of means, &amp; live careleſſe of the accompliſhment of his decree; and therefore not ſo in ſpiritual. As now for inſtance: God hath determined from all eternity, how long every one of us ſhall live in the world; our daies are numbred in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Now, though God hath determined how long we ſhall live, this no way gives us encouragement to ſay therefore I will never put on a rag of cloathes to cover me in Winter, and I will never put a morſel of meat in my mouth; for God hath determined how long I ſhall live, and therefore whether I eat or no, till then I ſhall not die. Again, God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all eternity, touching every one of us, whether we ſhall be poor or rich in this world, and therefore to draw this concluſion, that it is no matter whether I be induſtrious in following my calling, and looking after my trade, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſpend my eſtate in rioting and drunkeneſſe; God hath
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33775:105"/>
determined whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> I ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> be rich or poor; if he hath decreed I ſhall be poor, I ſhall be poor; or that I ſhall be rich, I ſhall be rich, let me live as I pleaſe: this reaſoning is very fond and fooliſh in Temporal things, therefore much more in Spiritual. God hath determined from all eternity thou ſhalt be ſaved or damned, and the decree of God cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but now to draw hence, that it is no matter how I live, whether in waies of holineſſe, or in waies of ſin, this is an abuſive collection from Gods decree. Becauſe, as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith, if a man doth not uſe thoſe means that may evidence to his ſoul that he is elected, it is an argument he is not elected. If thou ſay, if God hath determined it, he will ſave me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am holy or prophane, and therefore I will never hear Sermon, never pray in my family, never uſe holy duties; Saith <hi>Preſton,</hi> if thou neglect theſe means, it is an argument thou art not elected; becauſe, as God hath elected thee to the end, he hath alſo ordained thee to uſe the means. I have read a ſtory of an <hi>Italian,</hi> who lying upon his death-bed, fent for a Phyſician, the moſt exquiſit and exact Artiſt in all <hi>Italy</hi>; and this man held this opinion I am now ſpeaking of, that ſeeing Gods decrees were unal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erable, a man might live as he lift, and yet be ſaved; that let a man be as holy as he could be, if God had decreed his damnation, he ſhould be damned; and let a man be never ſo wicked, if God have decreed his ſalvation, he ſhould be ſaved; and that the decree of God took off the uſe of all means, that a man need not uſe any meanes, but onely truſt in God. The Phyſician being a man acquainted in the myſteries of Religion, after he had asked him the ſtate of his body, and where the diſeaſe lay, the party deſiring him to preſcribed ſome phyſick; the Phyſician gave him this anſwer: ſaith he, God hath determined how long you ſhall live; therefore, if I give you phyſick, if God hath determined you ſhall die, you ſhall die for all that; and if he hath decreed you ſhall live, though I give you no phyſick, yet you ſhall live. And this anſwer (ſaith the Hiſtorian) took ſuch place with the <hi>Italian,</hi> that it converted him in this very principle, and he became a man very diligent in following the means of grace, upon this very ſaying. And indeed, a

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe life here upon earth. Now then, for men to make this objection, that ſeeing God hath decreed men to life, therefore men may live as they liſt, is abſurd: for if men do live as they liſt, it is an argument God did not decree them to life, becauſe God in decreeing men to life and ſalvation, did decree they ſhould walk in a courſe of ſanctification, and holy living in this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe this ſhould be taken for granted, that God had decreed to damn thee for me; that God in his purpoſe had appointed he would not ſave us; yet God, as a Creator, deſerves thy ſervice. God, as a Creator, may lay claim to thy duties. Though God ſhould condemn us, yet he making us, deſerves obedience, and deſerves duties of thankfulneſſe from us. And therefore, under this notion onely, though no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration be looked after, this ſhould engage you to righteous living; and this ſhould engage you in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though he never ſave you. <hi>Adam,</hi> though he never ſhould

come to heaven, being in innocency, yet being made and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, was engaged to live a holy life. And ſo it is with every man alive, as we are creatures, and have a being from God, and the comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng toward God, though he ſhould throw us into hell, when we have done. And thus much for reſolving the fourth Quere, that the decree of God touching mans election to life, doth no way give encouragement to men to live as they liſt, upon the forementioned grounds. I now paſſe to the fifth Quere.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, what temptations doth the devil ſuggeſt into the mindes of godly men, to make them doubt within themſelves, that they are not elected by God, when indeed they are, to make them think they are <hi>reprobate ſilver,</hi> when they are <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour, meet for their Maſters uſe?</hi> Happily I may ſpeak to ſome, whoſe ſpirits are perplexed in this caſe. And the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hereunto, I ſhall reduce to three heads, and as I lay them down, labour to take them off, that they may be no juſt ground or reaſon to make you doubt of your election.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the devil tempts a godly man with this, that ſure you cannot be elected, Becauſe that before your calling you were ſo exceeding ſinful and prophane in your lives; ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profane, vile, wicked liver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that certainly (the devil will ſay) ſuch as you could not fall with in the compaſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods purpoſe to ſave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the devil will tell you, that certainly you cannot be elected to life, becauſe that after your calling into Jeſus Chriſt, you have fallen ſo fouly into capital, and ſcandalous crimes and ſins.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, becauſe that God doth continually purſue his people with outward and great afflctions; thence the devil will gather, you are not the choſen and beloved of God. Theſe three grand temptations he doth many times faſten upon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences, meerly to create a world of doubts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities in the choſen veſſels of mercy. I begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the devil tempts you, that ſure you are not elected, becauſe your lives were ſo exceedingly profane, and you were ſuch abominable ill livers, before you took upon you the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33775:107"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, this the devil laies before many a poor ſoul to ſtumble at.</p>
               <p>To ſatisfie you in this therefore, I ſhall lay down four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Many of the ſervants of God before their calling, have been very lewd, wicked, notorious, profane livers, and yet have been within the compaſſe of Gods election to life and glory. Caſt your eyes upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and there you ſhall finde what he was before his call. He tells you himſelf, <hi>I was a blaſphemer,</hi> (a horrible ſin) <hi>I was a perſecuter, I was injurious to Gods Church. I haled men to priſon for profeſſing the name of Jeſus.</hi> (Theſe are great ſins) Nay further, ſaith he, <hi>I was exceeding mad againſt the Church of God.</hi> A man enraged with malice againſt the people of God. Now what could be more vile then theſe? And yet you will finde this man, a chooſen veſſel of mercy. Nay, you ſhall finde, God to ſtrengthen the confidence of men upon their election, puts a ſcandalous liver and election toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make men ſee, that a ſcandalous life before converſion, is no prejudice to a mans election. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>And Ananias ſaid, Lord, we have heard of this man by many</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>how much evil he hath done to the Saints at Jeruſalem.</hi> We have heard by many what an evil man this is, <hi>and that he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uthority from the cheif Prieſts to binde all that call upon thy Name</hi>; and that this man did do it, did execute his commiſſion; here was a wicked liver: but now mark what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Goe thy way, for he is a choſen veſſel to me.</hi> Here you ſee <hi>Ananias</hi> laies his offence, and his wickedneſſe before him; and yet, <hi>Goe thy way,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>Goe thy way, for he is a choſen veſſel to me.</hi> The like inſtances we have in <hi>Manasseth</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> This therefore is my firſt anſwer, that many of the ſervants of God have been men of very ill and notorious lives, before converſion, and yet they have been within the compaſſe of Gods election to ſalvation:</p>
               <p>Secondly, though men have been notoriouſly wicked, in their lives before calling, yet if this notorious wickedneſs doth lay any engagement upon them, to make them labour to be more eminent in grace after calling; this is rather a ſign of election, then reprobation. It is obſervable in <hi>Paul,</hi> he was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33775:107"/>
a notorious wicked man before his call; but now this excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wickedneſſe of his before call, did engage him to labour to exceed all others in goodneſſe after he was converted; and the more evil he was before, the more holy he labours to be after. As he laboured before to hale men to priſon for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Jeſus Chriſt, he is now as zealous to draw men to Jeſus Chriſt after his call; he was very induſtrious to do evil before his call, and this made him after his call, as he ſaith himſelf, <hi>I was in labours more aboundant then they all.</hi> And ſo <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> who before her calling was a vile woman, one that was a common harlot; a woman out of whom Jeſus Chriſt caſt ſeven devils; and yet this woman, after her calling, ſhe laboured to be more eminent in godly ſorrow, then any woman before or ſince; <hi>ſhe waſhed Chriſts feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haires of her head.</hi> The like of which you do not read of any woman in Scripture. And this was a very good ſign; when your notoriouſneſs in waias of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, ſhall lay ſuch an engagement upon you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more eminent in grace after calling; this is a very good encouragement or evidence that you are within the compaſſe of Gods election; and therefore you have no cauſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Suppoſe before the word laid hold upon your conſcience, you were guilty of filthy ſins, not fit to be named in the congregation; if you will the more honour God, and praiſe God now, and walk more humbly, and labour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell each other in grace now, as you did in ſin in times paſt. This is a great ſign that you are in the compaſſe of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ones.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you that have been ſcandalous in your lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, for your comfort know, that God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counſel doth commonly make the profane and wicked and the worſt of men, the objects of his election, rather then civil honeſt men, rather then men that are of an honeſt and civil, and moral converſation here in this world. And the Lord doth it upon this ground, the more to magnifie the freeneſſe, and the riches of his own grace in electing men to life. For ſhould God only chuſe moderate and civil honeſt men in the world, men would be apt to think it is that mans morality,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33775:108"/>
and that mas civility, that was the motice which provoked God to elect them; and therefore God, to overthrow theſe thoughts, he lets electfon runne rather unto men that have been notoriouſly groſſe and ſinful in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods election, when many a civil man is left out. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi> a common harlot, yet choſen, when many a modeſt chaſte woman was caſt into hell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 32. That Chriſt urgeth a parable of two men. <hi>One that ſaid he would go and follow Chriſt, but did not; and the other ſaid he would not go, but did; now which of theſe twain did the will of Chriſt? and they ſaid, the firſt. And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that publicans and harlots ſhall go into heaven before you.</hi> But you will ſay, was this common? this was onely one ſingle time: therefore mark the next words, <hi>For Joh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> came to you in the way of righteouſness, and you believed not; but the publicans and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots believed in Chriſt. John</hi> came preaching, and you would not believe, you <hi>Phriſees,</hi> ſtrict moral men, that did not flie out into ſuch ſcandals as other men did, you would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſaith Chriſt, but <hi>Publicans,</hi> men that were moſt addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to extortion, and unconſcionable gain, <hi>they imbraced Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when moral men would not. This therefore ſhould be another comfort for you, that many times election runns rather to the profaner ſort of men, then to men that are civil and righteous dealing men here in the world; and this God hoth to magnifie the riches of his own grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that it is no matter what you were before your call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> So that no matter what you were before converſion, though guilty of great ſins, ſo you are now a reformed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, now a ſanctified people, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33775:108"/>
and living in malice and envy, &amp;c.</hi> You were ſo, <hi>but after the kindness &amp; love of God appeared to you,</hi> after they were converted they were not ſo. So that theſe four particulars wil clearly take off this objection, that no matter what you were before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if you are now a repentant people, and bewail your evils, and reform your waies, your former ill led life will be no hindrance at all to your election. Indeed this I muſt needs ſay, that you that have been moſt notorious in ſin, God expects this at your hands, that you be moſt eminent in grace, moſt deep in humiliation, moſt eminent in godly ſorrow, though your former evils do no way prejudice your election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the devil cannot faſten this upon you, he will come upon you with this aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ult, <hi>viz.</hi> your frequent falling into ſcandalous and foul, and groſſe enormities, after you took upon you a profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. And this the devil will lay cloſe: happily ſin before converſion was not ſo great; but now ſince you have followed Sermons, and ſince you have profeſſed Jeſus Chriſt, ſince that time you have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len foulely into groſſe and ſcandalous ſins, and ſurely this is inconſiſtent with grace, and cannot befal perſons within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>And I confeſſe this is both ſad and hazardous; yet I ſhall lay down three things to uphold thee, that yet for all this thou maieſt be within the compaſſe of Gods election. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that divers perſons that were within the compaſſe of Gods election, have fallen foulely into groſſe ſins after their call. <hi>Lot,</hi> after he was called, fell to be inceſtuous, and fell to drunkeneſſe; <hi>David,</hi> after he was called, fell into Adultery; <hi>Peter,</hi> after he was called, fell to a denial of Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, you read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.9. <hi>That his heart was tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned from the Lord, after the Lord had revealed himſelf unto him twice.</hi> After God had revealed himſelf to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and converted him; after that time he did evil againſt his God. Nay, you read further, <hi>Nebem.</hi> 13.26 27. That <hi>Solomons wives turned away his heart from the Lord, though he was the beloved of his God.</hi> Though he were beloved by God, and were elected by him, yet his wives turned away his heart from the Lord. The like phraſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you have <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.23. <hi>After all theſe works, I have done among
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33775:109"/>
them, and the miracles I have ſhewn them in Aegypt, and in the Wilderness, they have provoked me, ſaith the Lord, theſe ten times.</hi> After they were the Lords by covenant, and after they were a delivered people; after this they provoked him many a time, by ſinning againſt him, and yet divers of them were elect veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mercy. So that, I ſay, many of Gods ſervants after their calling, are fallen foulely into ſcandalous ſins, and yet have been within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you falling into groſſe and ſcandalous ſins, have not theſe four ſinful ingredients, your falling into ſin after calling, may be conſiſtent with election. Firſt, if you fall not into ſin voluntarily. Secondly, if you fall not into the ſame ſin frequently. Thirdly, if you fall not into ſin with complacency. And fourthly, if you lie not under your fall impenitently. If theſe ingredients be mixed with your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after your call, they are inconſiſtent with election. Firſt, if you fall into ſin voluntarily, <hi>that you ruſh into ſin, as a horſe into the battel.</hi> Secondly, if you fall into the ſame ſin frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then it is hazardous and dangerous. It is true <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, but it was but in one fit of a temptation. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vid</hi> fell into Adultery, but it was never but once; <hi>Lot</hi> was guilty of drunkenneſſe, but onely in one fit: For the Servants of God, though they fall, yet they fall not frequently into the ſame ſin, if groſſe and ſcandalous. Thirdly, if you fall into ſin with complacency, that you take pleaſure in the evils you fall into; if you do as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>wallow ſin under your tongue,</hi> counting it ſweet and delightſome to you. And laſtly, if all this be joyned with impenitency, that you have not a heart to repent of the evils you fall into, the Lord have mercy upon you; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you fall into ſin with theſe ingredients, you are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of Gods mercy to ſave. But now, though you do fall into ſin, if it be not voluntary, but through the force of temptation: if it be not with complacency, but a diſlike of the ſins you fall into; and as ſoon as you do fall, and ſee your ſins you repent and riſe again, though you doe fall in this way, it will be no prejudice to your election.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, falling into ſinne after calling and profeſſion made of Jeſus Chriſt, may be conſiſtent with Election in theſe foure
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33775:109"/>
caſes. Firſt, if the ſins you fall into be clearly diſcerned. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if they are ſenſibly bewailed. Thirdly, if they are ſtrongly reſiſted; and laſtly, if they are dayly laboured, and prayed againſt. Though you doe fall into ſinne, yet in theſe caſes ſin will not be damning to you, or be an impediment to your election. And thus I have done with the ſecond caſe of conſcience. Only let me urge this one thing before I leave it, (for I would not have you make this Doctrine a Doctrine of liberty; but I would have you lay this to heart) that if any of you fall foulely after converſion, believe it, God will make you ſmart for this, though not in hell, yet you ſhall have a hell in your conſcience, you ſhall have the very preguſtations of hell, a wounded conſcience, and God will expect deep humiliation, and great repentance, if you ſin after profeſſion made of Jeſus Chriſt. It may have that influence upon you, as upon <hi>David,</hi> who cried out, <hi>I have no quietnesse in my bones, by reaſon of my ſin.</hi> God will give you no reſt night nor day by reaſon of ſin, if you run into it after profeſſion made of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men do doubt of their election, becauſe God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues them with continual afflictions, and layes the continued ſtrokes of his heavy wrath upon them; and this makes many a godly man think that he is not in the number of Gods elect ones. To which I ſhall briefly anſwer.</p>
               <p>That this is nothing elſe but a temptation, and not a truth; and it was the very controverſie that <hi>Jobs</hi> friends had with him; they would faſten this upon <hi>Job,</hi> that he was a Reprobate, and an Hypocrite, becauſe God did ſo afflict him: yet <hi>Job</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his ſincerity, and ſhews his grounds, that God was his friend, and that he did not reject him, though he did afflict him. But to ſpeak more particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, no man can infallibly and certainly judge of Gods purpoſes about mans election, or reprobation, by any of the diſpenſations of God toward their bodies in the things of this life. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by any thing that is before him. All things fall alike to all. The ſame event to him that feareth God, and to him that feareth him not, to him that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and to him that feareth an oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:33775:110"/>Secondly, Afflictions from God are ſo far from being grounds, or evidences that a man is not elected, that in ſome caſes they may prove evidences that they are the very elect of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. <hi>He chaſteneth every ſon whom he receiveth; they are baſtards, and not ſons, whom he chaſtiſeth not. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>any as I love, I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and repent.</hi> Rev. 3.19. In ſome caſes afflictions from God are rather tokens of love from God, then the contrary. As now, in caſe afflictions be as a ſpur to you, to make you quicken your pace in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. 2. In caſe your afflictions be as pruning-hooks to you, to cut and lop off the luxuriant buddings and workings of ſinne in the heart. 3. In caſe affliction be as a hedge to you to keep you in, and to make you walk in a cloſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and not to wander or goe aſtray from him: 4. In caſe affliction be as a file to you, to file off that ruſt that cleaves to your nature. 5. In caſe affliction proves a furnace to refine you from that droſſe of corruption that is mixt with your ſervices. In theſe caſes afflictions are ſo farre from being grounds to doubt of your Election, that they may rather give you evidence, you are the very elect of God,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That God in his wiſedome doth many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his own people to greater troubles in this life, then he lets wicked and reprobate men undergoe. God will not give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates their hell here, that ſo he might give them hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. God will not give the elect heaven here, to make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more deſirable to them while they live here; and more welcome when they come there. It is Gods pleaſure in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his providence amongſt men, to let his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lie under more outward ſorrows, then wicked men ſhall do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.5. <hi>Their eyes burſt out with fatness, they are not in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as other men, neither are they plagued as other men are.</hi> The Lord in his diſpenſations doth ſo deal with wicked men, that they are not plagued, they are not troubled as godly men are in this world. And therefore ſurely affliction is no argument of Gods diſpleaſure, or of their not being within the compaſs of Gods purpoſe to do them good.</p>

No. Read ver. 14. and the Text tels you, <hi>the Publican went away juſtified rather the other</hi>; the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, though he was free from ſcandalous and groſſe enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in his life, yet he was not a juſtified man, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence not an elect man. You read of hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>that cleanſed the outſide of the cup, and of the platter,</hi> that is, cleanſed their converſations, and cleanſed the outward man of groſſe ſcandals, <hi>and yet within were full of filth</hi>; and Chriſt tels us, they were <hi>hypocrites,</hi> that <hi>ſhould have their portion in hell.</hi> And ſhould you view over Hiſtorians that write of the Scribes and Phariſees, and ſtrict men among the Jewes, they will tell you what wonderful holy-lived men they were; they were often in duties, faſted twice a week, prayed every day in the corners of the ſtreets; none ſo ſtrict as they in obſerving the Sabbath; would goe vailed, left they ſhould be enſnared by laſcivions objects; and yet theſe very men ſo wonderful ſtrict and cautious, were men that had no dram of grace in them at all. Though they were a people thus well dreſſed in their lives, yet the Scripture tels us of them, that Whores and Harlots ſhould goe to Heaven before them. This therefore is the firſt, that many men have had their lives free from groſſe ſcandals, and yet were men that were not elected by God to life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That a mans converſation may be free from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes, yet if this freedome from ſcandals proceed from a wrong principle, it may be in a perſon not elected. As I will
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33775:111"/>
make it appeare. There may be a freedome from groſſe ſins proceeding from a threefold principle, and yet a man be in a ſtate of da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nation and of reprobation. As firſt, There may be a freedome from ſcandals, proceeding from religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſecondly, from a natural diſpoſition; and thirdly, from the power of reſtraining grace. Firſt, there may be a freedome from groſſe ſinnes, proceeding from the power of education. So the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20. when Chriſt told him what the Law was. <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, thou ſhalt not ſteal, thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt doe no murder, thou ſhalt not beare falſe witnesse, &amp;c.</hi> Saith the young man, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> He was a Phariſee, and his parents ſtrict in their courſe of living, and brought him up ſo from his youth; and yet this man no elect man, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Secondly, a man may be free from ſcandalous ſins, ariſing from an ingenious natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition. A mans diſpoſition may ſometimes be utterly averſe to ſome ſinnes. <hi>Plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arch</hi> a heathen could ſay this, I had rather it were ſaid, there were no ſuch man as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the world, then to ſay that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was unchaſte, <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a drunkard, or <hi>Plutarch</hi> was a ſwearer. Mans natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may ſometimes be free from groſſe ſinnes, and yet he not an elect perſon for all this. And then thirdly, a man may be free from groſſe ſinnes, as proceeding from the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I alſo withheld Abimelech from ſinning againſt me.</hi> He was a Heathen, and a wicked man, and yet God, by the power of reſtraining grace, did keep <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> from running into that exorbitant courſe of ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. So that if a man be free from groſſe ſinnes, and yet proceeding from falſe principles, a man may not be an elect man for all this. Unleſſe your freedome from ſinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a renewed nature, from a ſanctified heart, and from the ſaving operation of the holy Ghoſt; unleſs it comes from theſe principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, your freedome from groſſe ſinnes can be no pledge to your ſoules, that you are elected by God to life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that a man having a good life, free from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes, if he have not a good heart, that is no argument
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33775:112"/>
of a man that is within the compaſſe of Gods election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; nor is that circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is of the heart, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> Intimating, that he is not a Chriſtian; he is not an elect Jew, that was one outwardly; that is, that was conformable to the rites and cuſtomes of the Jewes; but he was one that was one inwardly, that had his ſins mortified his nature changed, and his heart cleanſed, he was an elect Jew. So that to have a holy life, if a man have not an holy heart, is no ſign that a man is within the compaſſe of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God in electing men to life, doth paſs by moral and civil honeſt men, that truſt and depend upon their own righteouſneſſe and ſtrict living, rather then any ſort of men in the world. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21:31, 33. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John Baptiſt preached the Goſpel of repentance, but you believed not, but Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arlots believed.</hi> Thoſe Phariſees that did depend upon their own righteouſneſs, and their own goodneſs, Chriſt did not call them, Chriſt did not own them, God made them not the objects of his election. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs to repentance</hi>: that is, men depending upon their own righteouſneſſe, and their own parts, they are left out by Chriſt, as if he came not for them; but Chriſt came to call ſinners, that ſee their ſinne, and were vile in their own eyes, Chriſt came to call ſuch. Again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond deluſion, whereby the devil makes men think they are elected by God, is drawn from their external voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they are not onely civilized and moralized ones, but they finde the power of the word to call them; and upon this vocation they bottome the hopes of their election. And they have Scripture for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom God predeſtinates he calls.</hi> Now God hath called them by the word, and they have found the word come with power upon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to reforme the evils of their life. (And the power of vocation they deem higher (as indeed it is) then the power of education, or natural temper;) and therefore, think they, I
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33775:112"/>
having vocation, this is an evidence to me of my election. To this deluſion I ſhal only ſay two things, by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is true indeed, the Scripture ſaith, all whom God predeſtinates, he calls; but the Scripture doth not ſay, that all whom he calls, he predeſtinates. No man that God appoints to life, but before he dies, God will call him by the word; but God doth not ſay any where, that thoſe whom he calls, them he did predeſtinate to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, many men are outwardly called by the word into a profeſſion of Chriſt, when they are not eternally elected by God to ſalvation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi> Many are called, but all thoſe that are externally called by the word, are not choſen, nor all ordained to life. A man may be called from ignorance to knowledge, yet not elected <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>After they were enlightned, and had taſted the word of God, and the power of the world to come, yet they fell away.</hi> A man may be called from profaneſſe to profeſſion, from the world into the Church, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, yet not elected, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third deluſion whereby men are deceived by the Devil, to think they are elected, when they are not, is this. If they cannot plead their education, and moral manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or if they cannot plead their vocation, their laſt plea is, the mercy of God, they hope God is a merciful God, and God made them not all to damn them; they are Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made by him, and God that made them, will ſave them; and hereupon they faſten their hopes, that they are in the number of Gods elect ones. This is a ſtrong deluſion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt ignorant people. And to this I anſwer in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when as men ſay, God is a merciful God, therefore they hope they are elected, I anſwer: It is true, God is a merciful God, yet God is as juſt as merciful; he is merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, and juſtly merciful; his mercy cannot intench upon his Juſtice, nor ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll his Juſtice intrench upon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; one Attribute ſhall not claſh with another; he is no more merciful then he is juſt, nor is he more juſt then he is merciful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:33775:113"/>Secondly, though God be a merciful God, yet Gods ſaving mercy is not ſo large as to extend to all creatures that live, that he hath made. You read <hi>Iſay</hi> 27.11. <hi>This is a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercy upon them, and be that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> Here you ſee the Prophet tels them, that that God that made them, will damn them, and that God that formed them, that God will ſhew them no favour. So that Gods mercy extends not ſo far, as to reach to all the works of his hands; for if ſo, the devils might claim ſalvation as well as man; for God made them when they were glorious Angels, as well as man: and therefore, if all the works of Gods hands ſhould plead for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they might as well come within the compaſſe of Gods election as wicked men doe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee in theſe ſeveral Sermons, I have finiſhed the Doctrines of Effectual Vocation, and Eternal Election. I will now a little illuſtrate the point, by laying down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which will ſerve to clear the Doctrine of Election in many points about it, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That all men are not the objects of Gods election, or of Gods choice. And this propoſition doth confute the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Origen. Origen</hi> was of this minde, that all mankind ſhould be ſaved, nay, the very devils themſelves, they ſhould all be ſaved by Chriſt. A moſt groundleſſe and unheard of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; for all men are not elected to ſalvation. <hi>Jude</hi> tels us in his Epiſtle, there were ſome of old ordained to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if ſo, ſurely they could not fall within the compaſs of Gods election, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. There are ſome <hi>ordained to wrath</hi>; but we are not amongſt them, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but we are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to obain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All are not objects of Gods election to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the feweſt ſort of men and women that God hath made are the objects of his election. God in his owne councel hath elected to life and ſalvation the feweſt ſort of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33775:113"/>
propoſition: Firſt, that there are but few rich men choſen by God to life and ſalvation. Secondly, there are but few civil honeſt men choſen by God to life and ſalvation. There are but few rich men that fall within the compaſſe of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſave, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many mighty,</hi> (h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the words were a proverbial ſpeech among the Jewes, who had this proverb amongſt them, that when any one ſpake things either unlikely or unprobable, they would ſay, This can be as eaſily done, as a Camel can goe through a Needles eye. And Chriſt, alluding to this Proverb, ſaith, that rich men, that do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e upon their riches, and cleave to their wealth, and rather part with heaven and Chriſt, and ſoule and all, then part with their riches, Chriſt makes it an unpoſſible thing for ſuch rich men to come into heaven. As I once told what <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſaid, lying upon his death-bed in a meſſage to King <hi>James,</hi> I am going to that place, where few Kings come. And Beloved, the ſpeech is true, <hi>for not many wiſe, not many mighty, not many noble hath the Lord choſen.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, few civil hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt men doe fall within the compaſſe of Gods choice to ſave. Moral men, that truſt upon their civility and moral honeſty, and plain dealing; few or none of theſe come to heaven. <hi>Publicans and Harlots ſhall come to Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</hi> Matth. 21.32. Whores and Harlots believe in me, when you do not, ſaith Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That though God in his own counced hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or made choice but of the feweſt number of men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33775:114"/>
men to life and ſalvation, yet this doth no way intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mercy of God, this doth no way leſſen or impeach the mercy of God. Men may think, as if ſurely God had caſt off all bowels, and caſt off all mercy. What? God make ſuch a world of men as he hath done, and ſave but a few of theſe? Man might think, as if God were a hard Maſter, that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the deſtruction of man, that had forgotten to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſuch a hard charge will they be apt to lay upon God. But now, Beloved, that God hath elected ſo few a number to life, this doth no way impeach the mercy of God. And this I make appear thus: becauſe God was bound to ſave none at all; therefore you cannot challenge God either with unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe, or unfaithfulneſſe, if he ſhould ſave none. It was a meer act of his bounty and good will, that he would ſave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Nay, ſecondly, there is that in man, in the beſt of men, that might juſtly provoke God not to ſave any: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if God ſave any, it is of grace. And this is a certain rule, that God doth ſhew more mercy in ſaving of one, then he would have done rigour of Juſtice, had he damned all. As may be made plaine by this compariſon. Suppoſe forty men guilty of Rebellion were arraigned for their lives, and were condemned to die by the Law; if the Prince pardon foure of theſe forty he ſhewes more mercy in pardoning the foure, then he doth rigour of Juſtice in condemning the forty. Why? becauſe the Fact deſerved death in all alike. So it is with God: Every man upon earth deſerves death and damnation; and if God cull out any of the maſs of mankind, to ſave them, he ſhewes more mercy, then he had done rigorous Juſtice, ſhould he have deſtroyed all, becauſe he is bound to ſave none at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God in electing a certain number to life, doth it without foreſight of any good works which he ſaw would be in them. Indeed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> joyn their ſtrength, to maintain this; God, ſay they, foreſaw men would believe in Chriſt, and would be holy in their lives, and therefore God did chuſe them to life. This you may remember I ſpent ſome time in overthowing formerly, and therefore paſs it over now. <hi>viz.</hi> That God did not chuſe men to life, with reference to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33775:114"/>
any good works he foreſaw in them. This indead is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth; All men whom God did elect to life, he foreſaw they would have good works in them; but Gods foreſeeing of this, was no: the cauſe for which he did elect them. No, the motive was his own will, according to the pleaſure of his own grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>A remnant are ſaved according to the election of grace, for if it were of works, grace is no more grace.</hi> Were election upon foreſight of good works, then it would follow, that infants dying in infancy were not within the compaſſe of Gods election, becauſe an infant ſo dying, could not perform any good works; and ſo their caſe would be moſt miſerable. Beſides, we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by actual works, therefore not elected upon works fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. for there is the like reaſon of theſe two.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That Gods election is ſo free, that in chuſing and electing men to life and ſalvation, he doth not do it for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Underſtand this well, that therein you might both give Chriſt his due, and God the father his due: for miſtake me not. God doth ſave none but by Chriſt, but God did elect men without reference to Jeſus Chriſt as the motive of election, meerly according to the purpoſe of his own will. All modern and latter Divines lay down this for a truth, that it was the meer pleaſure, and good will of God to man, that was the motive of Gods electing us, and not Chriſt. Chriſt could not be the cauſe, becauſe he was the effect. Now what is the effect, cannot be the cauſe. Gods love in electing mankind, did produce Jeſus Chriſt to be the means of our ſalvation, and of bringing about Gods election, therefore he being the effect of election cannot be the cauſe. The cauſe of election was eternal, but the merits of Chriſt were not ſo. Again, Chriſt was elected himſelf. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>He was preordained of God before the world was.</hi> Now he that was elected himſelf, could not be the cauſe of our election. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the elect are ſaid to be given to Chriſt to be ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. therefore he was not the cauſe of our election. It is true, the Scripture tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4 <hi>We are elected in Chriſt,</hi> i. we are elected in Chriſt as a common perſon. God firſt choſe Chriſt, and then believers in Chriſt, as members of his body.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33775:115"/>
But God elects no man for Chriſts ſake, but man is choſen meerly of Gods bounty, without reference to Jeſus Chriſt. And here Divines ſay, Gods love in electing man to life was as free, as if Chriſt had never died; and it was ſo free, that man was not beholding to Chriſt for his election; and yet Chriſts ſufferings were ſo full, as if men were not bound to God for their election. Thus they are pleaſed to expreſſe it. And the reaſon why the Scripture ſpeaks thus, that we are onely choſen in Chriſt, not for Chriſt, is to give God the Father his due in electing men to life: that God did it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own grace, and therei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Gods love and favour is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all the world, that he did elect man without Chriſt, as the motive of his election: and yet Jeſus Chriſt being come into the world, he carries on our ſalvation, and he is the cauſe of it; though he was not the cauſe of Gods firſt thoughts, in electing man to life.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, All men that are elected by God to life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ſooner or later before they die be called into a ſtate of converſion, and believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>whom he did predeſtinate, them be alſo called</hi>: and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> So that God the father, in ordaining man to life, hath ordained this alſo, that before they die, they ſhall be a converted and believing people, and therefore men remaining unconverted, uncalled, unbelieving, they are not the obiects of Gods election.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, that God in chuſing or electing men to life, doth let his election runne ordinarily unto the meaneſt, and unto the worſt ſort of men in the world, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ninthly, that God for the great love he beares to his elect that are in the world, lets Reprobates and wicked men enjoy many mercies and outward deliverances, for their ſakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 13.19, 20. <hi>There ſhall be tribulation,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſuch as was not from the beginning of the world, nor ſhall be the end thereof: but for the elect ſake thoſe daies ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> For his elect ſake, God did mitigate, did ſhorten, God did take away that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from them. So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Had not God left us a ſmall remnant, we had been like Sodome, yea like unto Gomorrah.</hi> Had not God left a handful of his elect and godly men amongſt them, all the reſt had been deſtroyed. So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.8. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not the people, for a bleſſing is among them.</hi> That is, my people is among them, and my elect is among them, therefore deſtroy them not. God did not deſtroy the Nation of the Jewes, becauſe God had his own people mixed among them. Lo <hi>Job.</hi> 22.30. And this concluſion adminiſters matter of thankfulneſſe, to all men upon earth, to make you bleſſe God,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:33775:116"/>
that he keeps his people alive among you, for it is for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects ſake you have all the outward bleſſings and mercies you do enjoy.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and laſtly, take in this concluſion: That this world ſhall continue no longer, then till the number of Gods elect be accompliſhed; when God hath accompliſhed, and brought in to Chriſt the number of his elect; the world ſhall not ſtand one minute longer after this work is done. God doth but uphold the world, till the full numbers of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come in. If the number were filled, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt would ſurrender up the Kingdome to his Father.</hi> The Heavens ſhould gather together like a ſcrowle, and the Elements ſhould melt with fervent heat, and this world ſhould come to a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. It is the elect in the world, that keep up the world, that it doth not fall about our ears. And thus having ſpent theſe 16 Sermons touching mans Effectual calling, and eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, I have now brought all unto a concluſion. And I earneſtly intreat you, let it be your work, <hi>to put forth your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make this ſure to your own ſoules, that you are effectually called, and that you are eternally elected to obtain life and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
