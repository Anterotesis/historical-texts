            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Feaſt being made under your own Roof, I cannot chooſe ſo proper a Patron for this Entertainment, as your Self. This Performance, I confeſs, wants an Univerſal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For if Induſtry, Labour, and Expence, can deſerve a Smile, it ſtands high for a Favourite. So Great an Undertaking, I am ſure has never been on an Engliſh Stage; and I am not Traveller ſufficient to make Foreign Compariſons.</p>
            <p>And here I think my ſelf obliged to do the Pencil this Publick Right, to tell the World, That never was ſuch a Pile of Painting rais'd upon ſo Generous a Foundation; eſpecially under all the Hardſhips of ſo backward a Seaſon of the Year (our Misfortune, not Fault.) However, the Undertaker very well knows, he is in the Hands of Honour; and no
<pb facs="tcp:50799:3"/>
ways doubts of a ſuitable Encouragement, from ſo much Worth and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>As for my own part, I ſtand ſo highly Indebted for Favours received of You, that I only wiſh the Preſent I make You, were much more deſerving your Acceptance, to be the worthier Oblation of my Gratitude.</p>
            <p>As to the Entertainment it ſelf, I hope I ſhall not be vain to ſay, That the Model of the Scenes of this Play, are ſomething of an Original: I am ſure I have removed a long Heap of Rubbiſh, and thrown away all our old <hi>French</hi> Lumber, our Clouds of Clouts, and ſet the Theatrical Paintings at a much fairer Light. And therefore am an humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Generous Audience, for ſome Grains of Mercy.</p>
            <p>For as I dare confidently averr, the Proſpect of this Stage will put all the old Rags out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: So I hope the Town will graciouſly pleaſe to pardon the undeſerving Scribbler, for ſome ſmall Merit in the Projector. Otherwiſe it would be a little too hard to give me that Fate with my Play, as <hi>Middleton</hi> had with his Pipes, <hi>viz.</hi> By intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing that Project, as may Enrich my Succeſſors; and at the ſame time Starve my Self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50799:3"/>However, my Doom be what it will, yet ſtill I ſhall carry this Pride along with me, That I have endeavour'd to Pleaſe, in ſpreading ſo Gay a Table.</p>
            <p>And if this Eſſay, on the other ſide, does find Succeſs, it will bring me a double Pleaſure; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Gratification of my own Intereſt, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Satisfaction I ſhall receive, that this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acknowledgment of your Goodneſs, will be ſo much a more laſting Record of thoſe grateful Tenders, are here made you by,</p>

            <l>THEY ſay Young Actors on the Stage appear</l>
            <l>At their firſt Entry, with a trembling Fear.</l>
            <l>And yet, methinks, by all that I can find,</l>
            <l>The Ladies look ſo gay, and Men ſo kind;</l>
            <l>That all my trembling Pains are vaniſh'd quite;</l>
            <l>Are ſuch fine Folks ſo terrible a Sight?</l>
            <l>All that I ſee do rather pleaſe than fright.</l>
            <l>Then I'll be bold, and tell you I am ſent</l>
            <l>To make—Make what?—The Poets Compliment.</l>
            <l>Not I indeed.—Let him e'ne ſink or ſwim;</l>
            <l>Is't fit I ſhould Excuſes find for him?</l>
            <l>And be ſo vain to expect any Grace,</l>

            <l>I muſt confeſs I fain his Friend would be,</l>

            <l>He has, alas! been us'd to Fortune's Frown;</l>

            <l>Alas! I ſet up with a Stock ſo ſmall,</l>
            <l>The firſt Miſcarriage wou'd quite ruin all.</l>

            <l>Priviledg'd-Places are all quite put down.</l>
            <l>But there's a way for You to help me yet,</l>
            <l>For if I cannot All Your Favours get;</l>
            <l>I hope you'll grant one Thing in my Behalf,</l>

                  <speaker>Sir Dot.</speaker>
                  <p>An old doating fool to have no more ſenſe at theſe years than to pretend to make Womans Meat, when I am more fit for Worms-meat, my Lord. To be hankering after Young Fleſh, when I am going the way of all fleſh; and thus by the wicked inſtigation of the World, the Devil, and dry Bones, my Lord, with one Leg in my Grave I had no more Conſcience than think of ſlipping the other to Bed to a Girl of Nineteen; and to lay my old Froſt and Night-cap by her young Fruze and Top-knot.</p>

                  <p>And ſo falling in Love with a young Lady, and having a particular occaſion for a Necklace of Pearl, Locket of Diamonds, and ſome other Toys, to the Value of Six Thouſand Pounds, for a Preſent to your Young Miſtreſs, you made bold with Mr. Deputy.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir Dott.</speaker>
                  <p>I know nothing of Mr. Deputy's Lockets and Diamonds. I had no Deſign but upon that precious Jewel his Daughter there; that young Fury with her Snakes in Powder and Curl; that Cloven-foot in Lac'd Shooes, my Lord.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Dott.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot hold. I muſt confeſs my Sins, and repent, my Lord; and tell your Lordſhip, I have been galloping Headlong in the fair Road to the Devil, my Lord. For an Old Coxcomb of Eighty Eight, that has no more Wit than to Marry a Young Girl of Eighteen, heaps more Coals upon his Head

than another City Conflagration; and ought to be Marry'd on no Day but the Second of <hi>September,</hi> my Lord. For when the Firebrands of Whoredom and Cuckoldom are once lighted, they are unquencheable; and a Young Gipſie that takes Fire in her <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> is never to be ſtopt till ſhe burns down to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> my Lord.</p>

                  <p>Wrong! O Lord, no! She has done me a great deal of Right, my Lord. Alas, Sir, I have been an impertinent Old Fool, and have ſo tired and teized her, and haunted her, till the poor Thing, in her own Defence, when I would take no Warning, and receive no denial, has only drawn me into a Plot, Sir; to ſee my Back-ſide, Sir; to get a fair Riddance of me, by ſending me up <hi>High Holborn,</hi> and pleaſe your Lordſhip: I vow and ſwear that's all.</p>

               <l>

               <l>THE Author ſends me here, to win your Hearts</l>
               <l>VVith this full VVig, and not his own Deſerts;</l>
               <l>For he believes, and I ſuppoſe you know,</l>
               <l>There's nothing pleaſes more than a young Beau.</l>
               <l>But yet the Stage this day has done its best;</l>
               <l>For it has furniſh'd out a Miſer's Feaſt:</l>
               <l>And if this Charge and Pains ſhould now be lost,</l>
               <l>'Twere hard to Shipwrack on a Golden Coast.</l>
               <l>But, Gentlemen and Ladies, I muſt ſay,</l>
               <l>Since I am choſe Champion to defend this Play,</l>
               <l>I'll do't:
<stage>Draws her Sword.</stage>

               <l>And here, with Sword in Hand, declare</l>
               <l>To juſtifie it, againſt all that dare</l>
               <l>Strive to undo the Painter, and the Player.</l>
               <l>The Poet, he, alas! only depends</l>
               <l>On your Good Nature, to become his Friends.</l>
               <l>But now, perhaps, you may believe I fear</l>
               <l>To ſee this naked Weapon. But I ſwear</l>
               <l>I'd fight our Foes, did I not too well know</l>
               <l>'Twould ſpoil my Character of being a Beau.</l>
               <l>Therefore, ſince I'm good natur'd, be you kind;</l>
               <l>For, rat me, Gentlemen, 'twas well deſign'd.</l>
               <l>But, Pax upon 'em, 'tis all home-ſpun Cloth;</l>
               <l>All from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Web, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth.</l>
               <l>But if we'd let it make a coſtly Dance</l>
               <l>To <hi>Paris,</hi> and bring home ſome Scenes from <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
