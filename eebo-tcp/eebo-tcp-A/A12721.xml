            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this <hi>Platforme</hi> are contained (gentle Reader) the seueral battels fought by Sea and Land, at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times and in seuerall places of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, within these fiue hundred yeeres last past. Description of pictures after the manner of sight, as the plot will giue roomth I haue placed, and in the margent by numbers marked, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the time, yeere, and euent of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery battel, which being performed by me in satisfaction of the honorable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of certain Martial Gentlemen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Armes, &amp; louers of learning, were desirous to see these mixtures of matters of their owne profession, and the passed proceedings of their owne countries affaires, and desired me with my poore labour to further so good a worke: which being finished in large with the liking of the motioners, and good allowance of her <hi>Maiestie,</hi> to whose sacred person it was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and there contented to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. The counterfeit whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing much lessened and more bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, hath since come forth in print, either through the greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of gaine (the bane of all good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings) or the gainsaying mindes of such as are enuious to others pains, lest their owne profit thereby be empay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whose barren inuentions must be supported by other mens endeuours, and their shallow conceites carried through the currants of others springs otherwise runne they from little to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The silence of <hi>Englands</hi> ciuill wars I could haue wished, being the markes of our owne infamies, and staines to be washed away rather with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then againe to be renewed by remembrance: had not these drawne my paines to their owne headlesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and shot my shafts from their owne Bowes: for lucre making common that, which in priuate and for great Estates I intended: and by their indirect meanes am inforced to bring mine owne (yet much abridged) to the <hi>Presse.</hi> Wherein if it so fall out, as that this my endeuour doe yeeld contentment to them which hitherto haue allowed my labours, I meane in time to come (if God permit) to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the same with another plot of other Warres, performed by <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in other Countries, against others and forraine forces: a matter of more honour to our Country and pleasure

to our Countrey-men, in regard the same are accompanied with many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victories, vnder the Standers of whose Kings, mighty Kings many times haue beene forced to bowe, and Martiall men constrayned to yeeld to <hi>Englands</hi> glorious obtained victories. These being for the most part Ciuill Battels betweene meere <hi>English-men</hi> of one Nation, wherein the parties vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorers, besides the losse of their owne side, procured on the other, the fall and ruine of them that were all of his owne Countrey, many of them of his owne acquaintance and alliance, and most of them perhaps his owne friends in any other cause, then that in which hee contended for. But from this generall argument, to proceede to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, it shall not be amisse to make some diuision of them, according to their seuerall qualities, of the seuerall quarrels in them which are found to be diuers, and of three seuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Whereof the first were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasions attempted by forraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and enemies against the Kings and people of this Realme. The second were meere rebellions of Subiects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their annointed Princes. And the third dissensious factions betwixt Princes of the blood Royall: of these three, all these effusions of blood haue consisted.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the first battell in this plot, which was the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of gouernement of this state as it yet continueth. Such was the attempt of <hi>William</hi> Duke of Normandy against King <hi>Harold</hi> the sonne of Earle <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> who preuailed so against him in fight at Battaile in Sussex (a place so called by this euent) as the said Duke was afterward King of this Land, and brought the whole nation vnder his obedience, as it hath beene continued to his posterity euer since. Such was the arriuall of <hi>Lewes</hi> sonne and heyre to <hi>Philip</hi> King of France against <hi>Iohn</hi> King of England, who being carried by his owne ambition, accompanied with French forces, and assisted by the rebellious Barons of this Realme, after variable fortune of fight in seuerall skirmishes, battels, and assaults, was forced in the end, without all honour, or hope to preuaile, to make a very shameful retreat into his own country. Such was also the entrie made by <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth King of Scots, against King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of famous memory, his brother in law, and sworne allie, at that time absent in the wars of France, who contrary to his oath and alliance formerly made, entered the North frontires of England, with a mighty Army, had the same discomfited and ouerthrowne, and was himselfe slain in the field by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish forces, vnder the leading of the Earle of Surrey, at that time Lieutenant generall for King <hi>Henry.</hi> And especially such was the late enterprise remaining fresh in memory, of <hi>Phillip</hi> late King of Spaine, against our dread Soueraigne Lady now raigning, in the yeere of our Lord 1588. attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by his inuin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible Nauy as he thought, and so termed, vnder the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> which with great pride and cruelty entended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, arriued on our coasts to Englands inuasion and subuersion, had yet neuerthelesse here in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas, the one part of his Fleet discomfited, taken, and drowned, and the other part forced to their great shame in poore estate to make a fearefull and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flight about the coast of Ireland homeward so
that of 158. great ships furnished for warre, came to their owne coast of Spaine but few, and those so torn and beaten by the English Cannons, that it was thought they were vnseruiceable for euer, and eleuen of their ensignes or banners of Idolatry, prepared for triumph and pride in conquest, were contrariwise to their shame and dishonour shewed at <hi>Pauls</hi>-Crosse, and in other places of this Realme, to Gods glory, our ioy, and their endlesse infamy.</p>
            <p>The second sort of quarrels in these wars, were meer rebellions of subiects against their annointed Princes and Gouernors and of these some haue been priuate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some generall. Of the first kinde for priuate occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, was that of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of Lancaster, against King <hi>Edward</hi> the second his cosin-germane, vpon mislike of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> greatly fauoured by the King, and as much enuied of him, who hauing his forces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated at Burrowbridge, was there taken prisoner, &amp; after beheaded at Pomfret. Of the same kind was that of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Percie,</hi> surnamed <hi>Hot spurre,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thomas Percie</hi> Earle of Worcester his Vncle, against K. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, at Shrewesbury; where the said Lord <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was slaine, and the other taken prisoner, and after beheaded in the same towne. So was that of <hi>Michaell Ioseph</hi> the black-smith in Cornwal and his company against King <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, for a Subsidie gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Parliament to the same King, who gathered a head of rebellion so strong, that at Black-heath neare London, they abode battell against their Soueraigne, but were there taken, and afterward drawne, headed and quartered at Tiburne. Also such was that of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Ket</hi> the Tanner of Windham in Norfolk, against King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, pretended against inclosures and liberty to the weale publike, was at Norwich ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the field, and afterward hanged on the top of the castle of the same towne. And lastly, so was that of
<pb facs="tcp:25613:4"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈1 span duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> and the Kentishmen against Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for the bringing in of <hi>Phillip</hi> of Spaine, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off at S. <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; himself yeelded at the Court. Of the latter sort of Rebellions being generall, were those of the Barons against King <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; King <hi>Henry</hi> the third his son, in their seuerall raignes. Against the father, in bringing in of forraine powers; &amp; working a resignation of the Crowne &amp; Diadem, to the great blemish of their King &amp; Kingdome. And against the son so prosecuted their attempts, that their warres to this day are called and knowne by the name of the Barons-wars, which had so lamentable consequence,
as that after the ouerthrow &amp; consummation of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry most noble and ancient houses of England, and both parties wearied with warres: the conclusions of peace which ensued are reported in regard of the precedent murthers to be written with bloud.</p>
            <p>The third sort of these quarrels in these Ciuil-wars and dissentions, were factious dissentions betweene Princes themselues of the blood Royall, ambitiously aspiring the Crowne of this Kingdome, and titles of Kings thereof: Of which kinde there haue been two most notable knowne amongst vs. The first fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Stephen</hi> of Bloyse, Earle of Bolloigne, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully succeeding his vncle king <hi>Henry</hi> the first, in the Crowne of England, on the one party, and <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse, Daughter and sole heire to the said King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Normandie (his sonne and heyre, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward succeeded the same K. <hi>Stephen</hi>) on the other part, which was followed with such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable successe of fortune in many conflicts on both parts, that King <hi>Stephen</hi> himselfe was taken prisoner, &amp; laid in irons, with extremity vsed, and the Empresse to saue her life dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously aduentured thorow the Scouts of the
<pb facs="tcp:25613:2"/>
enemy, in the snow slenderly guarded, and before that was driuen to such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, that faining to be dead, she was laid as a liuelesse coarse in a coffin, and so conuaied away in a Horse-litter. But the second &amp; last of these two, being the greatest of all the rest, was that which happened between the House of <hi>Yorke</hi> descended of <hi>Lionell</hi> of Andwarpe, Duke of Clarence, second sonne to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third: and the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> issued of <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gaunt, the third son liuing of the same King; The occasion of a Ciuill warre that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged most cruelly for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but at that time most extreamely, when there raigned two Kings, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Family; one of <hi>Lancaster, Henry</hi> the sixt, another of <hi>Yorke, Edward</hi> the fourth: betweene whom with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers and followers, there were twelue seuerall battels fought in little more then twelue yeeres space. In so much as one of our owne writers <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hall,</hi> the great Chronicler, saith, that in these Ciuill wars betwixt these two Families it cost more English blood, then twice had done the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of France: and of forraine writers <hi>Phillip Comi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> Lord of Argentine in <hi>France,</hi> reporteth that it consumed no lesse then fourescore Princes of the bloud Royall: and <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Nouo Como</hi> in Italy, resembleth the state of these warres to the most tragicall story of the City Thebes.</p>
            <p>So let these few examples shewed in these three generall heads, suffice in this briefe Description in stead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that might be brought; for by these we may iudge of the rest.</p>
            <p>Now the benefit that may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by perusing the seuerall sorts of them, shall be to consider, in the first, the blessing of God poured vpon vs, in preseruing our Countrey and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the seuerall inuasions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enemies, notwithstanding their seuerall and many attempts. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the fall and ruine of rebellious Subiects taking armes against their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Kings, Princes &amp; Gouernors. And in the third the power of God and his heauy punishments inflicted vpon vs for our sinnes, in making the one party the scourge or maule of the other, with reuenging murder by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, working the depopulation of our fruitfull Country, and ruinating of our Cities at home, with losse and reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the territories in subiection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by iust title of inheritance and conquest abroad. And in all of them representing vnto vs the lamentable stories of the times fore-passed and gone, to compare with the same the peaceable estate of the happy times possest and present, wherein Martiall men haue leasure to winne honour abroad, the rest to liue in quiet and wealth at home, all factions forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
