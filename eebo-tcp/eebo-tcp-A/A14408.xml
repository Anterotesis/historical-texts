            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, as by ſtriking together of the ſteele &amp; flint, the fire is out forced: euen ſo by diſputation and conference, the truth is boulted out, and decyded. But becauſe it is hard for a blinde man to iudge of colours, and we being all blinde by nature, and ignorant of God and goodneſſe, are of our ſelues vncapable of right iudgement in matters of faith: for fleſh and bloud cannot attaine vnto it; neither can the naturall man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the things of God: we muſt therefore vſe the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meanes of our ſaluation; namely, hearing, reading, and meditating of Gods ſacred word: which is onely able to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation, and to enlighten the eyes of the ſimple. So that by this touchſtone, and faithfull inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God, in the name and ſole mediation of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for the direction of his holy ſpirit; wee ſhalbe enabled to know all things, and to trye the true and pure Gold from the falſe and counterfeit: and then (comparing the ſayings

Which thing waighing with my ſelfe, and finding in this Treatiſe, both the deepneſſe of Sathan, and the inuincible force of truth, which is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God vnto ſaluation of all true beleeuers, I reſolued at the ſpeciall inſtance of a religious friend, who had begun the Tranſlation, to attempt, effect, and finiſh the ſame: which by diuine aſsistance, I haue faithfully performed, and here preſent it to thy view.

            <p>My Lord the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> who (as each one knoweth) is very zealous of his Religion, and dearely loueth his children; ſeeing that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ducheſſe of <hi>Buillon</hi> was departed from the Komiſh Religion, thenceforth to follow that of Ieſus Chriſt: and that without chilling, ſhee ſtill perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and more and more increaſed in the knowledge and feare of God: in zeale, godlineſſe, and all other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19757:5"/>
good and commendable vertues; (his ſpeech he had in the beginning with her, and other meanes he had ſince aſſaied, to reduce and call her backe from the way wherein ſhee was, nought preuailing): willed for a laſt remedie, to attempt if he could, to winne her by the meanes and remonſtrance of a Doctor named <hi>Vigor,</hi> whom he much eſteemed. And to the end that the ſaid Lady ſhould remaine more ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hauing called my Lord of <hi>Buillon</hi> her husband, hee declared vnto him his minde, and ſaid; hee was contented that the ſaid remonſtrance ſhould bee made to his daughter, in the preſence of ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; as namely of <hi>Spina,</hi> &amp; ſuch others as ſhe ſhould pleaſe to chooſe: to the ende that had they any thing to ſay againſt the doctrine of the ſaide <hi>Vigor,</hi> they ſhould alleadge it; And if after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred together, they were not confuted by him, and wholly vanquiſhed, that his daughter ſhould then abide in her opinion; without that hee, or ſome others of his ſide would euer aſſay ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert her.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>de Buillon</hi> promiſed to accompliſh his commaund therein: and to ſhewe his obedience to him. Shortly after hee imparted the ſame to my Lord the Admirall; by whoſe aduice, and other Lords which hee ſpake too, <hi>De Spina</hi> was ſuddenly ſent for; who beeing come vnto them, and hauing vnderſtood all that aforeſaid, ſaid; that hee hoped for little fruite of all this Conference; conſidering the qualitie and humour of the man with whom hee was to deale: becauſe hee is much more partiall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19757:5"/>
for the Pope and his traditions, then zealous for the word of God, and truth of Ieſus Chriſt. Which thing, thoſe that were preſent did well approoue. Neuertheleſſe, hee was purpoſed for two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to preſent himſelfe at the ſaid Conference: the one, to ſupport and ſtabliſh my ſaid Lady <hi>de Buillon,</hi> againſt the Sophiſmes, and cauillations of the ſaid <hi>Vigor:</hi> the other, to take from him the occaſion to boaſt (as his cuſtome is) that the Miniſters durſt not appeare before him.</p>
            <p>And then was the proceeding and order aduiſed of, which they ſhould hold in the ſaid Conference. And that the ſaid <hi>De Spina</hi> ſhould firſt require, that it might be authorized by the Kings permiſſion: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that to auoyd all confuſion, it ſhould bee made in the preſence of a fewe perſons; Thirdly, that there ſhould bee ſome certaine theame and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect propoſed, wherof they ſhould conferre: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there ſhould be two Moderators of the whole Action, and two others deputed, faithfully to collect all the reaſons and arguments which ſhould bee brought forth by the parties.</p>
            <p>All which things hauing beene propoſed to my Lord the Duke of <hi>Buillon,</hi> as well by <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Admirall: as by the ſaid <hi>De Spina,</hi> hee found them very reaſonable, and promiſed to giue the beſt order he could to all the buſineſſe: admoniſhing <hi>De Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to be readie the firſt day of Iuly, 1566. for after dinner hee ſhould make the ſaid Conference. By meanes whereof, the ſame <hi>De Spina</hi> to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, went to finde out <hi>Monſieur Barbaste,</hi> Miniſter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19757:6"/>
to the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whom hee prayed to vouchſafe to accompany, and ſecond him in the ſaid conference. Which he graunting, both two, together with three other Gentlemen, left by my ſaid Lord <hi>de Buillon</hi> to conduct them; went after dinner, the day and yeare aboue ſaid, to the houſe of my Lord the Duke <hi>de Montpenſier;</hi> where when they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, the Duke <hi>de Buillon</hi> aduertiſed thereof by one of the ſaid Gentlemen, came vnto them in the Hall where they were.

He anſwered yea: and that neither he, nor his companion, could not, nor ought to attempt a thing of ſuch importance, as to handle the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion; without firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared therevnto by the inuocation of Gods name. That heard, hee entred the chamber where the Doctors were aſſembled: and hauing commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them the anſwere of the ſaid Miniſters, they appointed Doctor <hi>Ruze,</hi> to declare vnto them, that they would not be preſent at their prayers, and that no more reaſonable it was, that they ſhould bee there, then they at their Maſſe. The Miniſters anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: that they could not with good conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the conference, before they had prayed vnto God: and that it was in the Doctors choiſe &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be preſent, or abſent at their praiers; And they for their part would content themſelues to pray in the place &amp; aſſembly, wherin the conference ſhould
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19757:6"/>
be made. But neuertheleſſe, that their prayers, which are (as they themſelues confeſſe) conformable to the pure word of God; and their Maſſe, wherin are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things contrary therevnto, (as they may eaſily know and iudge that will trie and examine it by the rule of the ſcripture) were not like things; And ſo, by meanes of the impietie and Idolatrie which is in their Maſſe, they could not any way communicate thereat, without offence to God, and making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues highly culpable before him: but that he, and the other Doctors his companions could not be let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any ſuch difficulties to be preſent at their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: For as much as there was no article which (by their owne confeſſion) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not holy, and according to God. Herevpon replied Doctor <hi>Ruze,</hi> that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſtaied on a thing of ſmall moment. And they anſwered, that the principall exerciſe of Chriſtian Religion, was prayer: and that it is a neceſſarie mean to obtaine the fauour and grace of God; without which, men cannot attaine ſucceſſe, nor any good ſpeed in all their workes: and that therfore the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof was verie pernitious. And that they for their part were abaſhed, that he, which called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Doctor, and Diuine, ſhould make ſo litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of praier; which is the true practiſe, fruite, and vſe, of all the knowledge which can be had of God, and his word: and that therein one may know what was the iudgement of them, which meaſure diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by Idle and vaine ſpeculations. Then ſaid he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them: that the Duke <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi> would neuer ſuffer, he ſhould ſo be braued in his owne houſe: nor that it ſhould bee ſaid, that the Miniſters had made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19757:7"/>
their prayers. Wherevnto anſwered the Miniſters, that to braue, was a thing contrarie to their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that ſo farre off were they from brauing of Princes, (to whom they owed all honour, feare, and obedience) that they would condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues if ſo be they had vſed it, to a man of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt qualitie in the world. And added moreouer, that the Doctors, and ſuch others, which charged them with ſuch ſlaunders towards Princes, to ſtirre vp, and moue them againſt them, ſhould be aſſured they ſhould once anſwere before God for the ſame. Herevpon ſpake Doctor <hi>Ruze,</hi> and demaunded of the Miniſters, why they ſtood ſo ſtifly vppon that point of prayer. They f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> anſwere propoſed vnto him; firſt, that the end of the Conference, was to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the true meaning of the ſcripture, and make the hearers vnderſtand it: which thing could not be done, without the ſpirit of God; who enlightneth the minde and vnderſtanding to comprehend it; and openeth the mouthes to expreſſe the ſame: And therefore it behoueth to implore and obtaine his grace by prayers. Afterwards, that God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all thoſe that want wiſedome, to aske it of him; and to ſeeke what they would finde; and to knocke, if they would haue him to open vnto them. All which things cannot otherwiſe bee obtained, then by prayers. And therefore concluded, that for this cauſe they were neceſſary. They alledged further, that all things ought to be reduced to the glory of God: and that inuocation was therefore requiſite in the beginning, and thankeſgiuing at the ending and conſummation of all our workes, nor more, nor leſſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19757:7"/>
then wee beginne and finiſh our repaſt, in bleſſing and praiſing the name of God.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> vnto them, that they would not hinder them to pray vnto God: but that they ſhould do it in their hearts. And they anſwered: that it was not ſufficient; but that it behoued to pray alſo with the mouth, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth: withdraw your ſelues then into ſome place apart (ſaid hee) and make your praiers all alone. They anſwered: that in ſuch an act, it ought not ſo to be done: and that they were bound by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, to make their light to ſhine before men, to the end, that ſeeing their good works, they might haue means to glorifie God, and to be therby edified. Alſo that in ſo doing, they might giue occaſion of ſcandall to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, confirming the euil opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imprinted by their aduerſaries in ſome of their doctrine and exerciſes: to wit: that by reaſon of the errors and blaſphemies which were therein; they dared not to publiſh the ſame: and that to quite them of this ſlaunder, meet it was, that as they ſpake in publike, their praiers ſhould be alſo in publike. To be briefe, that they ought not, neither could they with reaſon refuſe that which the King had graunted vnto them in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Poiſſy:</hi> where, in all the aſſemblies there made, they were alwayes permitted to pray to GOD publikely, before they ſpake of any matter. And added for their laſt reaſon, that it was verie needefull to comprehend in theyr prayers them, and all thoſe that ſhould be preſent at the ſaid confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: to the end, that God might grant grace both to them and others, to diſpoile them wholly of all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19757:8"/>
their paſſions: and that there ſhould bee nothing which might hinder them, to iudge rightly of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould be propoſed on the one ſide, &amp; on the other: And that he would alſo make the hearers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and attentiue to gather to themſelues ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof. I ſhame here to recite one word which ſcaped from Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> in this behalfe: who in contempt of God, and his ſeruice, ſaid: that if the Miniſters would goe pray, he would go piſſe during the time of prayer. Wherevpon the Miniſters cryed out, ſaying: What reſolution? what counſell? what good word can be hoped for, of a heart filled with ſo an apparant contempt of God?</p>
            <p>My Lord the Duke of <hi>Buillon,</hi> and the ſaid Doctor <hi>Ruze,</hi> ſeeing the Miniſters ſetled, and firme in this, not to enter into any conference before prayers were made, in the preſence of the aſſembly, where the ſame ſhould be made: after they had reported the ſame to my Lord <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi> and the Doctors which were with him; they purpoſed to ſend them backe; and that on this condition they ſhould not conferre with them.</p>
            <p>Herevpon they departed: and as they were now arriued at the little Bridge of our Lady, they called them backe, and they forth with returned; ſuppoſing they would graunt them what they requeſted. But herein were they deceiued. For Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> came towards them to the gate, and for a finall reſolution, ſaid vnto them: that if they would pray, they would giue them a houſe neare at hand: but that my Lord <hi>de Montpenſier</hi> would not permit, they ſhould make them in his houſe; nor that any of his family ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19757:8"/>
be preſent thereat. Wherevnto they anſwered, that they now yeelded leſſe vnto them, then in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they had done: and therefore they could not anſwere otherwiſe then they had anſwered.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> addreſſed particularly his ſpeech to the Miniſter <hi>De Spina;</hi> to whom in ſcoffing maner, he ſaid two things: that he well ſaw, he had no great deſire to enter diſputations: and that in times paſt he had bene of their company; but that he was now cut off from them. Wherevnto anſwered <hi>De Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that had he fled the conference, he would not in that great heate, haue come eight long miles, nor left his Church, which was to him more deare and acceptable then any other thing, to finde them in their owne houſes. And as touching his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from them, that hee thanked God hee had withdrawne himſelfe from them: and that it was the greateſt good, that euer happened to him. And to the end that hee and his companions ſhould no way doubt but that hee was readie to conferre with them, he ſhewed them a way, by which both parties might be ſatisfied: to wit; that they ſhould confer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by writing: ſhewing, that it ſhould be much more profitable; for as much as by that meane, they ſhould withſtand all contentions: that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and anſweres ſhould better be meditated and digeſted: that many ſhould thereby be edified, and in ſo dooing, there ſhould be no daunger, that by adding or diminiſhing, they ſhould bee any way altered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruze</hi> anſwered, that they could write nothing which hath not beene written. And <hi>De Spina</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19757:9"/>
replied; that they could not alſo ſpeake ought, which hath not bene ſpoken. This was the end and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of al their ſpeeches. Wherby may be ſeene, what will the Doctors had to conferre with the Miniſters: to whom, at their arriuall (to ſtop their paſſage) they propoſed ſuch a condition, as they were well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhould neuer be accepted of them: namely to enter into publike conference of the ſcripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had publikely prayed to God in the place and aſſembly where it ſhould be made.</p>
            <p>Moreouer one may alſo iudge, what was their intention, by the order they had giuen, to direct their conference. For in ſtead of procuring ſome place and reſt to the ſaid Miniſters, which were come vnto them; there were at the leaſt, a hundred perſons of all qualities about the Miniſters, to aſtoniſh them: ſome by ſcoffes: others by iniuries: others by threats: So that, had it not bene the care which the three gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Duke of <hi>Buillon</hi> had of them, and to driue them often back, which approached too neare them; they had bene in danger to haue ſuffered out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. One may alſo imagine, how the Doctors do endeuour to ſerue God, and pray vnto him: ſeeing they cannot endure him to be prayed vnto in their preſence. And for concluſion, what vnderſtanding can they haue of the ſcripture? with what faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can they handle it? And what dexteritie and facultie can they haue to preach it, conſidering they diſdaine, and thinke it ſtraunge, that for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all theſe things, God ſhould be prayed vnto in their preſence? As though their ſufficiencie were in themſelues, and that it came not from him who is
<pb facs="tcp:19757:9"/>
the wel-ſpring and author of all light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It followeth: of the occaſions declared in the precedent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and firſt of the Diſpute on Wedneſday the ninth of Iuly, 1566.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Albeit the Doctors by the meanes heere before declared, had ſought occaſion to hinder the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which was to be made betweene them and the Miniſters, in the houſe of my Lord <hi>De Montpenſier:</hi> Neuertheleſſe, to auoyd the euil opinion that might be conceiued of them, by reaſon of their refuſall, to enter into the ſaid conference, they raiſed a rumour, that the Miniſters, perceiuing themſelues weake, and that their doctrine was vncertaine, had fled the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Which thing beeing come to the eares of the King and Queene, <hi>Mounſieur</hi> the Admirall, ſeeing it might bring ſome ſcandall and damage to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, if it were not preſently met with: knowing alſo, that it was a falſe reproach which they had put vpon the Miniſters, began to excuſe them: aſſuring the King and the Queene, that the Miniſters would alwaies be readie to conferre with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and to defend by the ſcripture, the confeſſion of their Churches, in what place ſoeuer, and before ſuch perſons, as they would it ſhould bee. So that they were permitted to pray vnto God (as they had required) in the beginning of their conference, and that they ſhould there obſerue the order and meanes which they had propoſed, or other better, as they ſhould thinke good: to the end to auoyd all wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and the confuſion of voyce and cries, as is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19757:10"/>
ſeene in ſchooles, and diſputes of Sophiſters, and contentious perſons.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> hauing vnderſtood theſe words of my Lord the Admirall, found them verie reaſonable; and perſwaded (as it is certaine) firſt by the ſpirit of God, and afterwards by a haughtineſſe and generoſitie of heart; which thruſt him forward, with a will to vnderſtand the truth of each thing, ſollicited the King and Queene, that by theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and vnder their authoritie, the ſaid Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence might bee eſtabliſhed: And ſo wrought he, that hee obtained of their Maieſties what hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. By meanes whereof, hauing aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Lord the Admirall of theyr pleaſures, they conſulted together, of the order ſhould bee held in the ſame conference. And reſolued in the end, that my Lord <hi>De Neuers,</hi> and my Lord the Duke of <hi>Buillon,</hi> ſhould bee the chiefe Iudges therein; and that of the one ſide, and the other, ſhould ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen be preſent, to bee witneſſes and beholders, of whatſoeuer ſhould bee done in the ſame. And further, that there ſhould be two Notaries of both ſides, of the litle fort at <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſhould put in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſigne whatſoeuer ſhould be alleadged, and propoſed by the parties.</p>
            <p>Theſe conditions thus conceiued, and agreed of among the ſaid Lords; were alſo accepted by the Doctors, <hi>Vigor</hi> and <hi>De Sanctes</hi> of the one partie, and by the Miniſters <hi>De Spina, &amp; Sureau,</hi> of the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Who began to aſſemble themſelues together on Tueſday the ninth of Iuly, 1566. in the houſe of my ſaid Lord of <hi>Neuers:</hi> where in his preſence, and of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19757:10"/>
other Lords which were with him, (after prayers made by the Miniſters, in the abſence of the Doctors, who becauſe they would not be preſent, had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelues apart) Doctor <hi>Vigor</hi> ſpake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by proteſtation: That the cauſe why hee and his companion were entred into Conference with the Miniſters, was not to be inſtructed in any point of Religion: nor any way to withſtand the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Councels, and chiefly that of <hi>Trent,</hi> by which they are forbidden to diſpute with heretikes: And that they for their part, were wholly reſolued to abide in the faith of the Romiſh Church: but that at the requeſt and purſuite of the Lord <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi> (who for the reducing of his daughter Madame <hi>de Buillon,</hi> had required the ſaid Conference) they were come thither to the end, to ſatisfie him, &amp; declare the holy zeale they haue to ſeeke and bring backe to the flocke, thoſe which are thence departed.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon (their ſpeeches ended) the Miniſters ſpeaking, proteſted likewiſe, that, that which had led the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conference with the Doctors, was not, becauſe they doubted of any article conteined in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which they knew to bee drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pure word of God: but that it was to maintaine the ſame, againſt the Sophiſtries and cauillations of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which would impugne it, and to retaine Madame <hi>de Buillon,</hi> in the good and holy inſtitution, which ſhee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the grace which God had giuen her.</p>
            <p>Thus the proteſtations on both ſides made, the Miniſters ſuppoſed that the Doctors (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following the intention of my Lord <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi> and the deſire of Madame <hi>de Buillon)</hi> ſhould haue begunne
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19757:11"/>
the Conference by the Diſpute of two points, the Supper, and the Maſſe. But as they that will beſiege and batter a Towne, begin a farre off to make their Trenches, and approaches: to prepare themſelues to the deciding and conference of the ſaid two points, they began to lay their foundation, by the authoritie of the Church: wherevpon they would eſtabliſh the certaintie of the Articles of faith, and generally of all the holy Scripture. And therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds and objections were propoſed by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And the anſweres giuen by the Miniſters; <hi>De Sainctes</hi> beginning, and <hi>De Spina</hi> anſwering; as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

               <p>Very eaſie it is to auoyd ſuch daunger, in following the counſell which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth giue vs in his firſt Catholike Epiſtle; not to beleeue indifferently all ſpirits, but to proue and diligently to examine them, before wee receiue or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue what they propoſe. And the triall to be made in ſuch a caſe is, firſt to regard the ende wherevnto a doctrine ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which ſhall be declared vnto vs: or a booke that ſhall be preſented vnto vs: For if it tend to eſtabliſh and aduance the glory of God; it is true: as Ieſus Chriſt ſaieth in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> That he which ſeeketh the glory of God, is truth, and there is no vnrighteouſneſſe in him.</p>

Touching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, where the Doctors reproach the Miniſters, that they doo doubt (as it ſeemeth by their anſwere) of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſpirit of God to the church. The anſwer is: that that is not the doubt: but to know which is the true Church. And touching the third point, whereof (ſay the Doctors) might bee inferred, that particular perſons could not erre. The conſequence is naught: for as much as the ſpirite of God may ſometimes depart from particular perſons, and in <note place="margin">

To the fourth point, the Miniſters do anſwere: that they no way contradict the alledged Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their confeſſion: for that compariſon is made in the anſwere, of two reuelations of the holy Ghoſt: the one made to the bodie, and the other to the members: which they maintaine to bee of like waight, touching the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof. And in the confeſſion mention is made of the reuelation of GOD his ſpirite, which is the cauſe of the Churches conſent, which doth follow as the effect thereof. Now ſo it is, that the cauſe being preferred before his effect: there is great reaſon, that the reuelation of God his ſpirit, compared with the conſent of his Church, be preferred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: as the cauſe, to the effect which it produceth. And touching the contrarietie which they pretend to happen in the confeſſions, printed at diuers times, and by diuers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they ſhall bee anſwered, when it ſhall pleaſe them to debate the Articles particularly.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19757:18"/>
contradict the fourth article of their confeſſion, it ſeemeth in ſhew, that there is contradiction: for as much as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the particular reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the conſent of the church: as by their anſwere appeareth. Alſo that which is alledged, that reuelation is cauſe of conſent; to preferre it to that, as the cauſe to the effect, ſeemeth to ſerue to ſmall purpoſe: for it is, as if one ſhuld ſay, that the reuelation is to be preferred to the word of God, and the holy ſcripture. For very certaine it is, that reuelation goeth before the word, and ſcripture. And as it appeareth in the text of the Confeſſion, (as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one may eaſily iudge) the authors thereof, ſpeake of the certaintie and infallibilitie of two reuelations: as holding themſelues more aſſured of that they haue in their owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then that which is of the iudgement of the Church. And touching an other point; where it is ſaid, that particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may ſometimes faile, when the holy Ghoſt doth leaue them; By that wee may conclude, that wee muſt not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly reſt on the pretended inſpirations of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: becauſe we may doubt of them, whether they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of God his ſpirit, or no, which cannot be done of the Church. Wherefore more ſure it is, to ſtay vpon the Church, (infallably gouerned by the holy Ghoſt) then vpon priuate pretended inſpirations. And ſo do the Catholikes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, neuer following their priuate iudgement, and therefore cannot be eſteemed phantaſticke. But rather thoſe, which preferre their proper iudgement, which they ſhrowde with the title of particular inſpiration. The Doctors require one text of the ſcripture, by the which, the holy Ghoſt is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto euery one in particular, as it is to the Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, to know, and iudge, and diſcerne which are the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

For the ſecond point: the compariſon of the Doctors is not proper, which thus they haue made: as who

ſhould ſay, that reuelation is to bee preferred to the word of God, &amp;c. Foraſmuch as the word of God, &amp; all the writings aſwell of the Prophets as of the Apoſtles, are as much of the reuelations of the Spirit of God, &amp; that no more difference there is betweene the one and the other, then is betweene <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species.</hi> And touching that which is added in this article, that the reuelation precedeth the Scripture.

And alſo that God, albeit hee had power to reueale and imprint in each one the true knowledge neceſſarie to ſaluation: yet hath he ordained a certaine meane, whereby faith is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which is a reuealed truth: that is to ſay, by hearing of the word of God, preached by lawfull Miniſters, ſent by the Paſtors of the true Church: as by the text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. appeareth.

And contrariwiſe, that euery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended inward inſpiration, particular and priuate, is a falſe perſwaſion, if it bee different from the common conſent of the Church: For the ſpirite of God is not particular, but common.

            <p>The Miniſters ſay, that they iudge by their inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, that they be not Canonicall. The Doctors leaue it to iudgement, which men ought rather beleeue: whether the inſpiration of the auncient Fathers, receiued by the Church for ſo many hundred yeares vntill now: or elſe the priuate and particular inſpiration of the new Miniſters. They adde further: that they ſubmit themſelues to proue, that the auncient Fathers, yea neare the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (as <hi>Ireneus,</hi> S. <hi>Ciprian, Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and others) doo vſe the teſtimonies of the bookes reiected by the Miniſters: yea for proofe of the doctrine againſt the heretikes.

               <p>Touching the article following, they adde that the true marke whereby one may certainly iudge of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is rather the word of God, then the conſent of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for as much as it oft times happeneth, that the multitude in the Church, declining from the word doo altogether erre: as in the time of <hi>Micheas,</hi> the time of Ieſus Chriſt, and afterward alſo of <hi>Constance</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

But great difference muſt bee put betweene the reuelations and teſtimonies of the ſpirit of God, and the vaine imaginations of the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>Touching that which the Doctors haue ſet foorth, that heretikes (as Anabaptiſts and others) doo vſe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their errors, the texts of ſcripture alledged by the Miniſters.

This it ſeemeth cannot well ſerue the Doctors, ſeeing they maintaine all the bookes of the Bible to bee Canonicall: and neuertheleſſe by that they haue ſaid of <hi>Brentius</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> it appeareth that the

one and the other, following the tradition (as they ſay) put a diſtinction therein: calling the one Canonicall, and the other Apocrypha.</p>
               <p>Touching the Article following, wherein the Doctors alledge certaine textes of the auntient Fathers, to take away the difference betweene the bookes Canonicall and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha. The Miniſters do anſwer, that as they haue alledged ſome to proue the ſame; ſo can they alſo for their part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſome to that purpoſe: as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Prologue called <hi>Galeatus;</hi> and in an other which beginneth <hi>Frater Ambroſius:</hi> vnto whom, writing the ſumme of euery booke of the Bible, hee mentioneth thoſe onely which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters call Canonicall.</p>
               <p>They may alledge alſo two or three Catalogues recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Euſebius:</hi> which they receiue not for Canonicall bookes; but thoſe which the Miniſters themſelues approue. Moreouer, the Councell of <hi>Laodicia,</hi> which the Doctors haue alledged, is for the Miniſters: for as much as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth not the bookes in queſtion. And touching the experience, they anſwere: that it is a queſtion of fact: and that it may be alledged, rather againſt the Doctors, then the Miniſters. And finally, that they looſe not more time in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeating of one ſelfe-ſame thing, but haſten to conferre of the points of the confeſſion, which the Doctors will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. The Miniſters do ſhewe, that the 24. bookes of the old Teſtament, which are in the Canon of the Hebrewes, with all the bookes of the new Teſtament, be on both ſides approued Canonicall. And they are wholly ſufficient to decide all the points of their confeſſion, &amp; all that in generall which appertaineth to true religion. And by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they haue no cauſe at all to drawe backe from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for the difference betweene both parties, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diſtinction of the bookes Canonicall and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.</p>

               <p>Touching the other Article, wherein they finde fault that the Doctors haue ſaid, that faith is obtained by hearing of the word of God, it ſeemeth they will ſtay vpon ſmall things, becauſe they will not goe to the principall.

It troubleth them to deale with the vocation of lawfull Miniſters of the Church; and to eſchew that matter, would not alledge (what they might without ſtraying) that firſt before we receiue their doctrine, it was meete to examine, whether they were Miniſters lawfully ſent from the true Church, to preach the word of God, and in their preachings to be heard of the people, according to the text of S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

Which thing, had they of the new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion well conſidered, a very ſufficient argument ſhould they haue had for not receiuing of their doctrine, becauſe it is more cleare then the day, that they be not Miniſters ſent by the Paſtors of the Church but thruſt in themſelues to preach, vnable to ſhewe any ſigne of their calling from men, and much leſſe from God. And were it lawfull for euery one to preach the word, which ſaith he is ſent, there would be infinite Sects: as we ſee at this time haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

               <p>Touching the Article, where mention is made, how a man may knowe that a reuelation is of Ood: where it is ſaid by the Miniſters, that men ſhould rather know it by the word, then by the conſent of many: that maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe of the Doctors.

To that Article which beginneth, <hi>touching that which is produced of</hi> Brentius, &amp;c. The Doctors ſay: that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters haue not well conceiued their meaning. For they bring not the ſaying of <hi>Brentius</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay, that they know the Canonicall bookes of the holy Scripture, by the tradition of the Church, and not by particular inſpiration, as the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Touching the Article following, the Doctors ſay: there was a time when ſome made doubt of certaine bookes of the Scripture: as of the Apocalips, the Canonicall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and others. But in time the Church guided by the holy Ghoſt, with common conſent receiued indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently for Canonicall, all the bookes that bee in the Bible; which conſent (continued by ſo many hundred yeares) hath more authoritie then the ſayings of one or two: the which neuertheleſſe, ſpake not but of their owne time. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is no compariſon betweene the ſayings of one or two particular men, &amp; the determinations of Councels, and conſent of the Church: as hath already beene ſayd. And it will be found, that S. <hi>Ierom</hi> hath approoued theſe bookes as Canonicall. And for the ſame, will referre themſelues to the Prologue which hee made vpon the bookes of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees, where he ſaith: Touching the Hebrewes, they are not Canonicall hiſtories of the Church: or other wordes to the like effect.

For the Article beginning, <hi>Touching the experience,</hi> &amp;c. Although it be a queſtion of fact: yet it ceaſeth not to be much auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And if it be found as the Doctors haue propoſed, (of which they doubt nothing) the foundation of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reuelation is ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>Touching the Miniſters concluſion: the Doctors doo ſhew, that they haue oft times complained, they fell into by-matters. They referre themſelues to the iudgement of all men, that their laſt reſolution was deducted all of one thread, continuing without ſtraying, in the ſame matter:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19757:25"/>
In which, albeit they had found ſomething wherein diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie had beene, had the Miniſters ſo much deſired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the conference of the chiefe pointes; they might briefely haue admoniſhed them of the ſaid difficultie. The Doctors vpon theſe articles had verily ſaid ſomething: but to haſten the buſines for the which they bee called, they do forbeare to multiply words.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters ſhew, that they receiue the 24. bookes of the old Teſtament, with all the bookes of the Newe. The Doctors ſay: that that is not the point. For all the conference they haue made hitherto, that is to ſay: by what rules men might diſcerne ſome bookes from other ſome, and iudge whether they were of the Scripture or not, was to raunge them in this point, that they receiued them by the tradition of the Church: which is iudge of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the bookes: and by the ſame meanes, when the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould bee, of the vnderſtanding of the word of God (euen in the conference of the places of the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) the Miniſters and Doctors ſhould haue ſuch reuerence to the Catholique Church, that ſhe ſhould be of both parts accepted for iudge, of the vnderſtanding of the Scripture, which they acknowledg to haue receiued of the ſame: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe is an infallible iudge, and more certaine, then the one or the other. And notwithſtanding the Doctors doo make offer to the Miniſters, that they will not vſe at this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but thoſe bookes onely, which they receiue for Canonicall. But when they ſhall fall into difficultie of the interpretation of ſome text, or of the conference of many: the Doctors eſteeme it more reaſonable to haue recourſe to the Catholique Church, and to the auncient Fathers, then to their proper ſence, or that of the Miniſters.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19757:26"/>

Ir els, if they will propoſe all their arguments and reaſons together, that one whole day may bee graunted vnto them, wherein they may doo that without any interruption: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally that the Miniſters may haue the day following to anſwere by order to all their arguments.</p>
            <p>The Doctors ſay, by that which is aboue written in the behalfe of the Miniſters: That it is eaſie to know, they haue alwayes recoyled, and yet do recoyle from conference of the things which they haue put in controuerſie: and they are maruellouſly abaſhed, that they will not now permit the articles of their confeſſion to be examined by order: as the day of the firſt Conference they had required (my Lord of <hi>Neuers,</hi> my Lord and Lady of <hi>Buillion,</hi> and other Lords and Gentlemen being preſent) in preſenting their ſaid confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contained in a little guilded booke, making offer to the Doctors to examine them in order (if they pleaſed) which they found very reaſonable. And indeed the Miniſters themſelues hauing demanded of the Doctors whereof they would intreate, departed yeſterday, contented to begin this day to examine the Articles of the Creed. And as touching their ſpeeche of the proteſtation that the aſſembly was made for the inſtruction of my <hi>Lady,</hi> who deſireth (as they ſay in her abſence) to bee firſt inſtructed concerning the Maſſe: The Doctors ſay; that the Miniſters by word of mouth, haue inſtructed the ſaid Lady, not onely in the error which concerneth their Supper: but alſo in many others, as they will make it appeare, when they ſhall handle the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Confeſſion by them exhibited. Then willing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19757:26"/>
to inſtruct the Lady by order in the Catholique Religion: they purpoſe to follow the order held by the Fathers of the Church; that is to ſay: to ſhew vnto her, how many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors againſt the Articles of the faith, are contained in the Catechiſme of their Ghurch: although they ſhew to them of their religion, that they differ in theſe articles nothing from the Catholiques. And becauſe to catechiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct one, it behooueth to beginne at the foundation, and that of certaine articles of the Creed (in which the Miniſters &amp; their like do erre) dependeth the beginning of the proofe of the reall preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Aultar: they will holde the order which all good teachers or inſtructors doo keepe in all diſcipline, and the Miniſters themſelues do obſerue, following in their Catechiſme this method. And rightly were the Doctors to bee mocked (whom men doo take for inſtructors) if they ſhould beginne (for the Miniſters pleaſure) to inſtruct one in that point, wherein they ought to ende: as endeth the ſame Catechiſme of the Miniſters vpon the matter of the Supper.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, ſeeing the Miniſters are content (as they ſay) that all the articles of their confeſſion bee examined: no priuiledge haue they, but that one begin at the firſt, for as much as all order ſo requireth: and it is alwayes at the choice of the Apponent to propound (in ſuch order as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth beſt to him) the queſtions for the Diſpute, were there any. And for as much as they are bound to giue a reaſon of their faith, as often as they be therof required: expedient it were for the good of the Lady, &amp; for the inſtruction of thoſe that ſhall read the Conference, to follow this method. And if they refuſe what the Doctors doo offer, they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd it, but all the world will iudge (by the eye) that diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting their owne doctrine (which they dare not vphold) they confound the Conference.</p>
            <p>Whereas they require, that the Doctors in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, put foorth but one reaſon at once: wherevnto they may anſwere without confuſion: or elſe, that in one day the

Doctors put forth all their reaſons, and on an other day the Miniſters may come to anſwere. The Doctors do ſay, that the firſt offer is reaſonable; and to auoyd length of ſpeech, they accept it: but they neuer heard ſay, that the ſecond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath bene practiſed: and no need it were to aſſemble together in one place for that purpoſe, but to ſend their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the one to the other.</p>

of the Creed, or propoſing it to be beleeued, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth to be inſtructed, or to inſtruct an other, in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles and Prophets. Now that is contrary to all the order euer holden in the Church, and contrary to that which is contained in the forme, preſcribed for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments in the Church at <hi>Geneua,</hi> made by <hi>Caluin,</hi> and inſerted amongſt his workes; which beareth theſe words, addreſſed to them that haue charge of the childe they baptiſe: For as much as the matter wee haue in hand, is to receiue this childe into the fellowſhip of the Chriſtian Church, yea do promiſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhal come to yeares of diſcretion, to inſtruct it in the doctrine which is receiued and approued of Gods people.

Alſo they place not the foundation of the beleeuing of the Creed, vpon the knowledge and conformitie of the ſcripture, but vpon the doctrine receiued and approued by the people of God. As the auncient Church, yea before the ſcriptures of the new Teſtament were written, did wontedly propoſe both to great and ſmall, the beliefe of the Creed, before they propoſed the holy ſcriptures vnto them, as by Chriſtian antiquities appeareth. And therefore the beliefe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian touching the Creed, dependeth not on the written word, but vpon the word reuealed to the people and church of God.</p>

               <p>Touching the firſt article, it is very neceſſarie that in teaching a childe, or any other ignorant perſon, the Creed of the Apoſtles, they alſo forthwith teach him the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, ſeeing that which is contained
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19757:29"/>
in the Creed, is no other thing, but the ſelfe-ſame doctrine: and that they are things not onely conioyned, but alſo like, if not in words, yet at leaſt in ſence and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond article, they denie that that aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, is any way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the eſtabliſhed order in the church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> or any other well gouerned Church. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reaſon drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme of the Baptiſme vſed in the ſaid Churches, it followeth not, by the alledged words and ſayings thereof, that <hi>Caluin</hi> propoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to exclude the Creed, and to ſeperate the ſame from the writings and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, (which is impoſſible) but plainly to ſhewe, that when he added that word, hee meant therin to comprehend it, and generally (which the Doctors haue omitted in their allegation) to comprehend that which remaineth in the holy ſcriptures, after the deduction he had made of the points of doctrine, particularly compriſed in the Creed. And for the other reaſon added, that the Creed was propoſed to thoſe that were catechiſed, before any booke of the new Teſtament was written, they grant it. But it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not therefore, that it was not founded on the word and doctrine which the Apoſtles did preach: (although then not put in writing) And likewiſe on the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, wherevpon is founded the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19757:30"/>
or others, to beleeue the articles of the Creed, without being firſt inſtructed by them, that there are certaine Apoſtolike writings, vnto which, the Articles of the Creed are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.

               <p>THe Doctors enſuing the order alreadie begun, and their charge which is to conferre with the Miniſters, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to giue a reſolution for the inſtruction of my Lady of <hi>Buillon,</hi> vpon the two points propoſed yeſterday: to wit, whether the Apoſtles were authors of the Creed. And why we ought to beleeue it. They ſay, that to know whether the Apoſtles did make and erect the Creed, ought no more to be eſteemed a thing indifferent, then to know whether the Apoſtles be authors of their owne writings. For much more is the authoritie of them, when a man is aſſured that they are certainly proceeded from the Apoſtles. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it ſhould be far leſſe, if men did doubt therof, or eſteem it a thing indifferent. Moreouer they ſay, that it is no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to call this Creed Apoſtolike, and to intitle it, the Creed of the Apoſtles: in regard of the conformitie it hath with their writings. For by this reaſon, the other Creeds (as that of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore ſay the Doctors, it muſt be beleeued, that the Apoſtles did make it, and gaue the ſame Creed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it muſt be beleeued, as being a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting compoſed by the Apoſtles. And their proofe thereof is, that they alwayes finde ſince the Apoſtles time vntil now, that this Creed hath bene propoſed in Baptiſme and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme: as it appeareth by the authors which haue beene from the Apoſtles vnto vs. And alſo that no man can name, or note any Author or Councell (but euen before that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or Councell, immediately to the Apoſtles time) that Creed hath beene propoſed in Baptiſme and Cat chiſme, and called among Chriſtians, the rule of faith. And the like argument S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in many places againſt the Donatiſts, doth eſteeme to be firme and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Miniſters following that which before hath bene propoſed, and alwaies by them maintained; and for the confirmation alſo of the faith of the Lady of <hi>Buillon,</hi> ſay
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19757:33"/>
that it is vncertaine (as S. <hi>Ciprien</hi> hath written) whether the Creed, called the Apoſtles, was made &amp; compoſed by them: or elſe drawne or gathered out of their doctrine: and why alſo it is called the Apoſtles Creed: or whether it is becauſe each of them added his part and portion therevnto: or elſe whether it be becauſe it is a marke and certaine enſigne of Chriſtian Religion. And as touching the ſame; that it is a thing indifferent to ſaluation: in as much as it hath alwaies one waight and authoritie, be it that the Apoſtles haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, or that it hath beene faithfully gathered out of theyr writings. So haue alſo the Creeds, as well of <hi>Nice,</hi> as of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> whereof the Church hath neuer doubted, but that they containe a pure Apoſtolike doctrine, as ſhee hath eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declared, in ordaining that the ſaid <hi>Nicen</hi> Creede ſhould bee publikely propoſed and publiſhed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on the dayes of theyr aſſembly to communicate, which at this day is yet obſerued in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> where that Creed is read or ſung euery Sabaoth in their Churches. And did it not containe Apoſtolike doctrine, it ſhould withſtand the 59. Article of the Councell of <hi>Laodicia:</hi> in which it is forbidden to read in the Church, any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of priuate inuention, but onely the doctrine compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Canonicall bookes of the old and new Teſtament, the number whereof is there made.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters ſay further, that the reaſon and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall motiue of the faith which Chriſtians giue to the Creed, is the knowledge they haue, that it is the pure word of God, and him that teacheth it, do they alſo maintaine, to bee the word of God: as may appeare by that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: who after he had propoſed to the Corinthians, the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note>death, buriall, and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, which be the chiefe articles of the Creed, and thoſe vpon which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally iuſtification is grounded, addeth theſe words. That hee deliuered vnto them, that which he receiued: to wit, that Chriſt died for our ſinnes according to the ſcriptures; and that he was afterwards buried: and that he aroſe againe the third day, according to the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:19757:34"/>
Ieſus Chriſt alſo propoſing his death and reſurrection to the two Diſciples, alledged to them the ſcriptures, thereby <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.</note>to aſſure them, ſaying: O fooles and ſlowe of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all that the Prophets haue ſpoken, ought not Chriſt to haue ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glorie? And hee began at <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them in all the ſcriptures, the things that were written of him. In the ſelfe-ſame Chapter, appearing after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, euen before the Creed was made, propoſing vnto them his death and reſurrection; to aſſure them thereof, hee alledged vnto them the ſcriptures, ſaying: It is thus written, and thus it behoued Chriſt to ſuffer and riſe againe from the dead the third day. Whence may be inferred, that for the foundation of faith, and aſſurance of the articles of the ſame, there is no better means then to propoſe the ſcriptures. And although in the time of the birth of the Church, the Creed was propoſed to thoſe that were Catechiſed, before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Euangeliſts had put any thing in writing: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not therefore that there were no other ſcriptures, wherevpon euery article of the faith might be builded.

By this diſcourſe, and places of ſcripture quoted, it may appeare to euery man, that there were cleare and euident ſcriptures to ground all the articles of the faith vpon, before the Creed was put in writing: and that men might &amp; ought to alledge them to thoſe that were catechiſed, to aſſure them of that which was propoſed vnto them to be beleeued. And it is not poſſible that a man can beleeue, that hath not firſt heard and vnderſtood the Word: and that is not aſſured thereof, and holdeth it as certaine, and more alſo (were it poſſible) then things conceiued and compriſed by Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall demonſtration: as it appeareth by the definition of faith, when the Apoſtle calleth it <hi>Hypoſtaſin, &amp; elenchon.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note>That is to ſay, the euidence of things which are not ſeene. The Miniſters do adde, that it implyeth a contradiction, to call the Creed a doctrine not written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet to affirme that the Apoſtles haue written it. And they cannot ſhewe how long it was an vnwritten doctrine, and at what time it began to be written. And the Miniſters are much diſpleaſed, in that they which conferre with them, doo not more propoſe the edification as well of thoſe that bee preſent at this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as of others which may ſee and read the Acts thereof. For where as they might handle and decide points tending to edification of the ſimple, they ſtay on propoſing and handling ſome things whereof they no way doubt: which is as much, as to proue a thing confeſſed, and reſolued on, and to light a candle at noone-day. And they aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they which ſhal read the acts of this Conference, will not at all bee abaſhed, becauſe they decline to treat of that point, whereof they be ſo oft required: for that (as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſaith) he that doth euill, fleeth the light.</p>
               <p>For concluſion, the Miniſters do proteſt to confeſſe and beleeue, that the Creed of the Apoſtles, in euery article ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is the pure word of God, and in the faith wherof, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth euery faithfull man to ſtay and petſeuere vnto the end.

The ſecond is againſt the article of the creation, when as they ſay, that God not onely permitteth euil and ſinne to be done, but alſo himſelfe doth it. The third is, that one while they denie, and an other while they confeſſe for an article of faith, that the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> remaineth a Virgin after her childe-birth. The fourth, that Ieſus Chriſt deſcended not into hell, but by imagination, and not really. Alſo ſay the Miniſters againſt the ſaid article, that Ieſus Chriſt diſpaired of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vppon the tree of the Croſſe: that hee was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in conſcience, fearing to bee damned: and many other errors contained in this Article.

For S. <hi>Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> doubteth not, nor putteth in doubt as a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, whether it bee the Apoſtles or no; but ſheweth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that before they departed aſunder, they compoſed the ſaid Creed: as in the Preface of his expoſition may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>The Doctors demaund further vpon the article of the omnipotencie, (which is the foundation of the Supper, and the holy Sacrament) why the article of omnipotencie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt and principall article of faith, is not contained in the confeſſion, propoſed by the mouth of <hi>Beza</hi> at <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> before the King, and many times ſince, and inſerted in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bookes?</p>

               <p>And concerning that they propoſe touching the Creed, the Miniſters neuer doubted, nor yet do they doubt but that it is a pure Apoſtolike doctrine.

And that which they haue maintained to be doubtfull, is onely, whether the Creed were written by the Apoſtles themſelues, or not: whereof nothing can appeare to be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Doctors. And S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> himſelfe, whom the Doctors haue produced, in his Preface doth aduertiſe the readers of the great varietie there is touching the ſaid Creed: for as much as diuers Churches haue added therevnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers articles: He doth alſo aduertiſe them, that he followeth in his explication, the order of the Church of <hi>Aquilea.</hi> Yea and expounding the article of the diſcention into hell, (of which the Doctors make ſo much adoo) he ſpecially ſaith: that it is not in the Creed of the Romane Church, nor yet of the Eaſterne Churches. Whence may bee gathered the incertaintie of that aboue ſaid: and that there is no article of which men may reaſonably doubt, whether it be of the number of thoſe which the Apoſtles haue written, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Church hath added the ſame: or elſe it muſt bee ſaid, that the Apoſtles had written diuers Creeds. And for the difference which the Doctors doo pretend to be in the confeſſions of the reformed Churches, printed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at ſundry times, the Miniſters denie them, as touching the ſence, to differ one from the other: although for more ample declaration thereof, ſome tearmes haue poſſibly bene chaunged. And where they propoſe that in ſome of them the article of the omnipotencie of God was omitted, the Miniſters doo denie it, and require the Doctors to bring forth a copie of the confeſſion, in which they maintaine the ſame to haue bene omitted: for were it ſo, it ſhould be falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupted. Adding that there is nothing in their confeſſion, doubtfull or obſcure: which ſome of the ſaid Doctors haue well declared, when they made a forme of confeſſion by the patterne of that of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vſing the proper tearmes and ſentences: vnto which they added nothing to make it varie, that excepted for which they are in difference with the Miniſters, and which they would hardly ground vpon the ſcriptures.</p>

               <p>The Doctors ſay, that the Miniſters by their deniall that S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> holdeth the Apoſtles were Authors, makers, and compoſers of the Creed, do ſufficiently ſhewe, how bolde they are to denie things manifeſt. All which, they referre to the auditory preſent, and to the readers of this writing. For ground of which deniall, they reſt vpon a ſimple reaſon: to wit, vpon the article of the diſcention into hell, whether it were inſerted by the Apoſtles, or added by others to make it doubtfull, whether they are Authors of all the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.

the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of the ſentences, ſaying: In that is God omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, wherein his power is of might, and not of infirmitie. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writing to <hi>Eustochius,</hi> and confirming that aboue ſaid, ſaith as followeth. I will boldly ſay, although God can do all things, yet can he not reſtore and reeſtabliſh a virgin after her fall. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> likewiſe writeth in the fift booke of the Citie of God, cap. 10. in theſe words. The power of God is in nothing leſſened, when it is ſaid, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, nor be beguiled. And a litle after, God is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, becauſe there be things which he cannot do. The ſame Author in the 26. of the ſame worke, cap. 8. thus ſaith: He that ſaith, if God be almightie, let him cauſe the things which be made, that they be not made. Perceiueth not, that it is as much as if he ſaid: if hee be almightie, let him make the things which are true, in as much as they be true, to be falſe. <hi>Teodoret</hi> alſo in his third Dialogue, conformable to that aboue ſaid, ſaith: We muſt not without determination, ſay that all things generally, are poſſible to God. For hee that ſo ſaieth, abſolutely comprehendeth things good and euill, which are contrary in themſelues. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee affirmeth: that God cannot ſinne, becauſe it is a thing contrary to his nature. Wherevpon hee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that although many things there be which he cannot do (for as much as there bee many ſinnes) yet for all that doth he not ceaſe to be almightie.</p>

               <p>The Doctors ſay, that the reaſons formerly brought, do auaile and ſerue to ſhewe, that the Miniſters doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the antecedent, which ſeemed onely to be ſuppoſed: to wit, God cannot cauſe one body at one ſelfe inſtant to bee in two places, no more then hee can make the things by them alledged. For to this end doo they alledge them, to declare that ſomething there is which God cannot doo. And to the preſent queſtion (to wit, that one body cannot be in two places) can they not apply them, but to ſhew that the ſame is impoſſible to God.</p>
               <p>And as touching the reaſons alledged out of the holy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19757:38"/>
ſcriptures: God cannot lye, nor denie himſelfe: theſe places (vnder correction) ſerue nought to this purpoſe. For, as they haue brought out of the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of the ſentences, power to lye, power to ſinne, is not power, but impotencie: contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rather, if God could ſinne, he ſhould be impotent and weake: and ſuch thing alſo God cannot do, for then ſhould he repugne and deſtroy himſelfe. And as touching the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples brought out of S. <hi>Ierome</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that God cannot make a virgin deflowred to bee yet a virgin, or a thing done, not to be done, that vnderſtood as the Logitians ſay, <hi>In ſenſu Compoſito,</hi> (that is to ſay, the things beeing ſuch, and ſo made) is true. And the reaſon is, for that it would otherwiſe imply a contradiction. But in the queſtion propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is nothing like therevnto: for the queſtion onely demandeth, whether God by his power, can alter &amp; change the nature and qualitie of things created: as whether he can make a thing heauie and maſly, abiding in it qualitie of waight and maſſineſſe (which naturally tendeth downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) by the onely power of God, to hang in the ayre: as in the holy ſcripture we read, that the fire which naturally aſcendeth, doth deſcend by the power of God. Alſo that the fire naturally hot, and burning, cooleth, the qualitie thereof (that is to ſay the heate) remaining in the ſubſtance. As alſo that two bodies bee in one ſelfe-ſame place: as appeared when our Lord did enter where the Apoſtles were, the the doores being ſhut: or that a groſſe and large body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in it groſſeneſſe and largeneſſe, do paſſe through a place vnproportionable to it greatneſſe and largeneſſe, as a cable through the eye of a needle. All theſe examples are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the holy ſcripture. And if it muſt be, that God cannot make one body to be in two places at once, no more ſhould he be able to do the things aforeſaid: for, the reaſons to this purpoſe they will afterwards declare. And it will not be found, that it hath euer entered into the braine of any Interpreter, to denie ſuch a power: And the firſt that euer did openly denie it, was firſt <hi>Peter Marter:</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19757:38"/>
The Doctors further ſay, that the forme of the argument which the Miniſters do vſe, doth withſtand and deſtroy that which God vſeth in the holy ſcripture, and the Angell ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the virgin. For God ordinarily when he will aſſure ſomething impoſſible to nature, and which men cannot comprehend, he generally alledgeth his power. And the Angell willing to make a ground of the incarnation of our Lord, doth alledge in generall, that there is nothing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, in regard of the creatures, as the Angell ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Now ſo it is, that the generalitie of an argument is deſtroyed by particular exceptions, and is made by this meane vnprofitable and forceleſſe. When God then alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in generall, that his power can do it, one may doubt thereof, and eſteeme the thing propoſed of God, to bee of thoſe, which are to him impoſſible, as wel as the exceptions by the Miniſters alledged. And that ſhould be falſe which the Angell ſaith: That there is nothing impoſſible to God: becauſe men do alledge &amp; propoſe many things to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. To the end therefore, that God and his Angels bee maintained true in their words, it muſt not be doubted, but God can much more eaſily change and alter his creatures, and all their qualities, then a Potter can play with his clay, and forme at his pleaſure ſome veſſell thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there is daunger, that if we limit Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er towards his creatures, wee fall to denie him his Lordſhip and dominion ouer them. For no other thing is it to be Lord of a creature, then to haue power to change, alter, and giue it ſuch a nature and qualitie, beſt pleaſing to him: as hauing the ſame in his owne power. And therefore God in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.</note>to ſhewe that hee had power to deſtroy and ruinate, or to maintaine <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as ſeemed him good, ſaith: I am the Lord of all fleſh: is there any thing too hard for me? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctors do conclude, that there is daunger (if this queſtion bee maintained, as impoſſible to God) that each one therein will dare as much: alledging the ſame examples which the Miniſters do, to exempt from the power of God, euery thing ſhall diſpleaſe him. And when men ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19757:39"/>
vnto him ſuch things out of the ſcripture, he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the ſcripture in an other ſence, ſaying: that ſuch a thing ſhall be impoſſible to God by the naturall ſence of the words of the ſcripture: Euen as the Miniſters doo change and alter the ſcripture, which ſaith that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is in two places. To wit, the word of the Supper, compared with that of the Aſcention: and ſay, that that of the Supper ought not to bee vnderſtood litterally: for, that one body ſhould be in two places, is impoſſible to God. So ſay the Doctors, that each one wil corrupt the litterall ſence of the ſcriptures, ſaying: that the thing is impoſſible vnto God. And therefore muſt the ſcriptures be otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. And notwithſtanding it may bee becauſe it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth him: and yet will hee bring forth the ſelfe-ſame reaſons and allegations as do the Miniſters, to ſhewe that all things are not poſſible to God. The Doctors do againe conclude, that it is better to maintaine the ſcripture in the truth thereof, (albeit it propoſe in our iudgements incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible and impoſſible things, then to open a gap for euery one, to depraue the word of God, to raunge and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it to his will and iudgement, vnder ſhadow of ſaying, that it is impoſſible to God: and alledging for the ſame ſome examples. They will not omit that the Miniſters, who haue often proteſted to relye vpon the pure word of God, do alledge only auncient Doctors againſt the power of God, flying for aide to them, againſt Gods expreſſe word, which importeth, that generally without exception there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſſible to him.</p>

               <p>The Miniſter anſwere, that the Doctors proue not their conſequence, and that they leaue it for ſome diſtruſt they haue (as is likely) that they are not able to proue it. They mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but the antecedent of their ſaid conſequence: to the confeſſion whereof, it is not poſſible for them to lead the Miniſters, by their reaſons and authorities alledged to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their ſaid conſequence: for as much as of one particular, they inferre a generall: which is contrary to the rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19757:39"/>
And where they ſay that the authorities alledged by the Miniſters, nothing ſerue to reproue their conſequence, and to ſhew that God leaueth not to be almightie, although he cannot do any thing which doth derogate to his nature, they referre themſerues therein to the ſaid auncient authors; which for the ſame end and reaſons as the Miniſters, doo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and propoſe the aboue ſaid exceptions.</p>
               <p>Where they pretend that the authorities and ſentences alledged out of the auncient Fathers, do nought appertaine to the preſent queſtion: for as much as they denie that they ſhould be vnderſtood of other things, but thoſe only which do containe in themſelues contradiction. The Miniſters do anſwere, that ſo alſo doth that which they propoſe of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that at on ſelfe inſtant, it may be in diuers places. For as much is it, as if they ſhould ſay, that a body is, and is not, at one ſelfe-ſame time: and that a body is one, and is not one. Alſo that a creature is incircumſcriptible, and not incloſed within certaine limits: which happening, it ſhould no more be a creature, but God. As may bee gathered of that which S. <hi>Baſil</hi> writeth in his booke of the holy Ghoſt, Chapter 22. ſaying thus: The Angell that appeared to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> was not in the ſame place where <hi>Phillip</hi> was. And he that ſpake to <hi>Zacharie</hi> from the Aultar, filled not whiles hee ſpake vnto him, his ſeate and place in heauen. But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is in <hi>Habacuck,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehiel</hi> vpon the floud of <hi>Chobar,</hi> for the ſpirit of God doth fill the earth. And the Prophet writing thereof, ſaith: Where ſhall I hide me from thy ſpirit? or whither ſhall I flye from thy preſence? <hi>Didymus</hi> in his booke of the holy Ghoſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that aboue ſaid, ſaith thus: Were the ſpirit of God a creature, his ſubſtance ſhould he haue circumſcript and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as haue all things made and created. As then ſo it is, that the ſpirit of God doth fill the world, and is not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcript, nor in any place limitted: therof it followeth, that he is God. <hi>Vigilius</hi> in the diſputation hee wrote betweene <hi>Sabellius, Photius, Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> vnder the perſon of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> thus writeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:19757:40"/>
Thereby may it chiefly appeare, that the ſpirit of God, is God: that he is euerie where, and is not contained in any one place, as the Prophet writeth: Whither ſhall I flye to hide me from thy ſpirit? Of theſe places may we conclude, that if a body bee not circumſcript, finiſhed and cloſed in certaine limits, it is not a creature: which ought to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, not onely of other bodies, but of that alſo of Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe: as appeareth by that which <hi>Theodoret</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his ſecond Dialogue, where hee thus ſaith: Then is the body of our Lord riſen, exempted from all corruption, impaſſible and immortall, adorned with diuine glory, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and worſhipped of the heauenly powers. Neuertheleſſe, albeit it be in ſuch ſort qualified, yet ceaſeth it not therefore to be circumſcript, as it was before it was glorified: whereof it followeth, that being a true body, and a creature, it cannot be in diuers places at one inſtance.</p>
               <p>Whereas they alledge that the foreſaid examples do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pertaine to the queſtion propoſed: for as much as in it, the queſtion is onely to know, whether God can chaunge the qualities in a ſubſtance, the ſubſtance remaining. The Miniſters do denie it, becauſe in the queſtion there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a body, which cannot be without hs meaſure. Now the meaſures and demenſions are not as qualities and accidents which may happen to a body, and depart from it without corrupting thereof, (which is the nature and condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents) but are of it proper eſſence. So that it is impoſſible that a body ſhould bee a body, which is not meaſured and circumſcript.</p>
               <p>The firſt example they produce for confirmation of their ſaying is, that a maſſie thing (which naturally for the waight thereof declineth downward) may be lifted on high. Wherevnto the Miniſters do anſwere, that it may be done, and that by violent motion. But that this example nought ſerueth to ouerthrow that they haue ſaid, for as much as ſuch things in themſelues containe no contradiction; and that they are not contrary to the eſſence of the thing where they happen. For a ſtone which a man throweth vpward, doth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19757:40"/>
not therefore ceaſe to be a ſtone, neither by ſuch a mouing, is it not depriued of the waightineſſe thereof. To the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the fire, they anſwere: that it is one ſelfeſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of light, as of heauie things: and that without any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their eſſence, their naturall mouings may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſome force and violence done vnto them. And as touching that they alledge of fire, which (contrary to it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, namely to heat and burne) refreſhed the three Iewes in the <hi>Babilonian</hi> furnace: they anſwere, that the fire therefore was nothing altered in the eſſence nor qualiries thereof: which may eaſily appeare, in that it ſpared the three Iewes, and burned and conſumed thoſe which kindled the ſame. Whereof may be inferred, that the cauſe why it did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, proceeded not becauſe the nature or qualities thereof were any way changed, but onely becauſe the action thereof was ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>And where they alledge, that two bodies may be at one inſtant in one ſelfe-ſame place together: and for proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, propoſe that which is written in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that Ieſus Chriſt did enter where his Diſciples were, the doores beeing ſhut: the Miniſters do anſwere, that it is not ſo in the text: but the text ſheweth that the Diſciples beeing aſſembled in a place, Ieſus Chriſt ſtood &amp; appeared in the middeſt of them. Whereof can be no way inferred, that hee entred into the place where they were, without opening of the doores, nor that hee pierced them to enter therein. And very like it is, that they were opened and ſhut againe, as well as thoſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.</note>which the Angell did open and ſhut againe, when hee was ſent to deliuer S. <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon: and when likewiſe hee was ſent for the Apoſtles deliuerance.</p>
               <p>As touching that they propoſe of a groſſe body paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through a ſtraight place, alledging the example of a Cable through the eye of a needle. The Miniſters anſwere, that it is ill to the purpoſe alledged, and is an argument grounded vpon a thing impoſſible. They ſay moreouer that the Doctors haue all vnderſtood the word <hi>Camilos:</hi> vſurped in the ſcripture, not for a Cable, but for a Camell: as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19757:41"/>
to them it is manifeſt, which are but meanely ſeene in the antiquities of the Hebrewes. And as appeareth by that which <hi>Angelius Caninius</hi> writeth in the end of his <hi>Caldean</hi> Grammer. And for the concluſion which the Doctors drawe from the precedent examples, it is from the purpoſe, and founded vppon preſuppoſed antecedents and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes by them brought; which in the ſence they alledge them for the reaſons aboue declared, they neither haue, nor will confeſſe vnto them.</p>
               <p>Where they ſay, that what the Miniſters haue ſaid tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a body, that it cannot be in two places at one inſtant, were it the body of Ieſus Chriſt it ſelfe, was neuer written by any of the auncient Fathers, nor propoſed before the comming of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret Beza.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do maintaine that it was. And that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> ſaith the ſame in theſe tearmes: According to this forme (meaning the corporall forme of Ieſus Chriſt) we muſt not thinke that it is euery where. And wee muſt beware leaſt in eſtabliſhing in him his diuinitie, we take not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the veritie of his body. And elſe-where hee ſaith: That by reaſon of the nature and meaſure of a true body, hee is in one place in heauen. The ſelfe-ſame thing ſaith <hi>Therdoret</hi> in his ſecond Dialogue, as hath bene before alledged. And ſo doth <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilius</hi> in his fourth booke againſt <hi>Eutiches:</hi> where hee writeth as followeth. If the word and fleſh be but of one nature, how commeth it to paſſe that the fleſh is not found euery where as the word (of which word it was taken, to conſtitute one ſelfe-ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and <hi>Hypostaly)</hi> is euery where? for when it was on the earth, it was not in heauen: and now that it is in heauen, ſurely it is not on the earth. And ſo farre off is it that he is there, that we attend Ieſus Chriſt to come according to his fleſh: whom neuertheleſſe we beleeue as he is the word, to be here on earth with vs.</p>
               <p>By theſe and other like authorities, often found in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers, men may know that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Theodoret Beza</hi> are not the firſt authors of this doctrine, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19757:41"/>
that it is falſly imputed to them: for as much as they haue but drawne, and word by word, copied (as it were) the ſame, out of the bookes of the auncient Fathers.</p>
               <p>To that which the Doctors pretend, that the forme of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing which the Miniſters haue vſed, affirming ſome things to be impoſſible to God, doth not derogate his omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie: ouerthroweth the forme of the argument which the Angell ſpeaking to the virgin, vſeth for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which he declared vnto her: that is, that nothing is impoſſible to God. The Miniſters do anſwere, that it is nothing to the purpoſe, for as much as the queſtion is neither of a thing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it ſelf any contradiction, nor that is contrary to the truth of God: which be the two matters they haue alledged, and yet do alledge for the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the omnipotencie of God. And touching that which the Doctors do adde, that God can change the nature and qualitie of things, there is no man doubteth the ſame. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is done, it behoueth alſo to auow, that the things be changed, &amp; that they remain not in their firſt nature. And the Miniſters ſay, that it is not all one with the thing here propoſed: for as much as the Doctors wil haue a thing to remain in it eſſence and nature, although the eſſentiall parts therof be changed, &amp; altogether extinct and aboliſhed. Touching the limitation of the power of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his creatures, there is none ſo preſumptuous to attempt to limit the ſame, in whatſoeuer he wil: and which confeſſeth not, that he may ordaine &amp; diſpoſe of all his creatures in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as it pleaſeth him, &amp; as a Potter doth of his earth. And thervnto (ſay they) ought the authoritie of <hi>Ieremy</hi> to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: as it appeareth very clearly by theſe Hebrew words. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Concerning the danger which the Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend may come of the aboueſaid anſweres of the Miniſters, they anſwer, that men of ſound and good judgement wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer drawe thereof any euill conſequence, ſeeing that all this doctrine is true, and doth containe no manner of obſcuritie. And if any peraduenture take harme thereby, it muſt bee imputed to themſelues, and their euill vnderſtanding;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19757:42"/>
whereby not onely ſome doctrine, but alſo the word of God it ſelfe, may be ſometimes peruerted and corrupted. To be <note place="margin">

And where the Doctors alledge that one may take occaſion by the doctrine aboueſaid, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ſcriptures according to his owne ſence and fantaſie, the Miniſters ſay no. And where ſome one would attempt the ſame, they ſay it ſhall be eaſie to reiect his interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as not anſwerable to the rules and analogie of faith: as the foreſaid doctrine and interpretation of the Miniſters is anſwerable therevnto. Where the Doctors ſay, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do change and alter the ſcriptures. The Miniſters anſwere, that it is a ſlaunder, which can no way bee proued againſt them: neither by their writings, nor by their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor by any thing they euer ſaid or thought. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what they adde, that the ſcripture ſaith that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is in two places, the Miniſters denie it, and do ſay, that contrariwiſe the ſcriptures do eſtabliſh it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and nor elſe-where: according as it is written.

And where they alledge that the ſcripture ought not to bee interpreted according to euery mans ſence and phantaſie; the Miniſters do confeſſe it, adding that all interpretations ought to bee examined, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: but that ſuch examination muſt bee done by conference of the ſcriptures. And where the Doctors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Miniſters not to haue alledged any paſſages of the ſcripture for confirmation of the foreſaid doctrine, before they produced the auncient Fathers. The Miniſters do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it is a falſe accuſation: and that they ſhould well haue remembred in the beginning of their diſcourſe, that they alledged to this end, S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctors obiect, that they haue made ſuch an argument, God cannot cauſe one body to be in two places. God is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Omnipotent. That this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence is neceſſarie it is moſt manifeſt: without other proofe, by the lawe of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For according to the rule holden in all ſchooles of Philoſophie, two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions cannot be true: To haue power to do all things, and to haue no power in certain particular things, be contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For this particular thing, is a part of all. If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent be true, of neceſſitie the conſequence muſt be falſe, according to the lawe of contradiction: for they two as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories cannot be true together. And notwithſtanding, albeit that by the knowledge of the termes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, a man might iudge the conſequence to be good: neuertheleſſe, it is plainly knowne by the deduction of the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the anſwere of the Miniſters, that the Doctors haue proued the conſequence. The reaſon of the Miniſters was thus: God cannot lye: hee cannot ſinne: hee cannot cauſe that things made, be not made. Therfore it either repugneth his nature, or there is repugnancie on the behalf of the creatures: bicauſe there is a folded contradiction. Now the Doctors in their obiection haue ſaid, that there is nothing like in the queſtion propoſed: that is to ſay, whether one bodie may be in two places. Whervpon they make ſuch an argument, taken from their obiection, God can do all things which are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his nature, or where there is no repugnancie in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19757:43"/>
behalfe of things created: and that no contradiction is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in implyed. But to affirme one body, may be in two places, at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant, is not a thing repugnant to the nature of God, and on the behalfe of the body, implyeth no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: God therefore can do it. Or elſe thus. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it: It followeth therefore, that God is not Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And ſo is propoſed the reaſon and deduction of the antecedent and conſequent. Yea and the proofe of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſecond propoſition: For they haue proued there is no contradiction in ſaying that one body might be in two places; and that it doth not repugne the nature of GOD, whereof the probation hath bene made, by example of like things. As God can cauſe two bodies to be in one place, and other like reaſons deducted in the Obiection.</p>
            <p>And where the Doctors (ſay they) prepoſterouſly argue from a particular to a generall, It ſeemeth (vnder correction) they haue forgotten the rules of Lodgicke. For very certaine it is, that this rule hath place in affirming, and not in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But contrariwiſe, when there is ſome thing affirmed in generall, and the default in particular proued, (as ſay Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) <hi>Ad negationem particularis, ſequitur negatio eius quod vniuerſaliter affirmatuum est.</hi> Likewiſe when there is ſome of a whole thing which hath many parts affirmed: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault is proued in one part, the deſtruction of the whole fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. As if one ſhould ſay: All the bodie is ſound. Hee that ſhould proue one part of the bodie diſeaſed, ſhould proue this propoſition <hi>[All the bodie is ſound]</hi> to be falſe.</p>
            <p>Such is the argument which the Doctors haue made (to wit): If God cannot do one particular thing (as to cauſe one bodie to be in two places) then he cannot do all things. Or if he can do all things, he can do that alſo.</p>
            <p>They are agrieued to be ſent backe to their Logicke. For they regarded no other ende, but to make the antecent to be graunted: to wit, that God cannot make one bodie to be in two places. And are verie glad, to haue vnderſtood the reſolution of the Miniſters vpon this Article: that is to ſay, That God cannot cauſe, nor will one bodie to bee in two
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19757:43"/>
places: for as much as it implyeth contradiction. And where the Miniſters doo ſay, that the Doctors by their reaſons, could not thereof inferre the truth of the antecedent: The Doctors confeſſe the ſame. And thereby doo the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alſo ſufficiently perceiue, that the reaſons they haue brought, are nothing worth to the confirmation of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, which is their reſolution. But the Doctors ſay: that theſe reaſons, albeit they be nought, were to this end neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe produced by the Miniſters, to proue, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to God, to make one bodie to be in two places.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Article, which beginneth <hi>[Touching that which they ſay that the authorities,</hi> &amp;c.] The Doctors ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that the auncient Fathers neuer thought to make excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing, which is not ſubiect to the power of God. For (as it is manifeſt) hee that ſaith all, excepteth nothing. Therefore, when the Scripture ſaith, that God is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it giueth ſufficiently to vnderſtand, that there is no exception. And to giue exception therein, ſhould be to contradict to many places of the word of God, and to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme againſt his power. But well ſay the Doctors, that the Fathers haue interpreted the Omnipoteucie of God: not to comprehend that which toucheth the perfection of his nature, but that only which concerneth the Creatures: So that there were not on their part too apparant contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and repugnancie.</p>
            <p>Now the preſent queſtion importeth not, that there is contradiction for a bodie to be a bodie, and in diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant. For concerning the eſſence of bodies, in ſpeaking of a bodie hauing it dimenſions, as ſpeake the Philoſophers, <hi>De praedicamento quantitatis:</hi> Certaine it is, that the dimenſions are of the eſſence of a bodie; but to be circumſcript and incloſed in a place, that is an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Which thing is ſhewed by Philoſophie it ſelfe: For the moſt high heauen, according to all, is a bodie, and neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe is it not in place according to it all. Therefore is it not an eſſentiall thing, for a bodie to be encloſed in one place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:19757:44"/>
And to ſpeake of the preſent matter, the Miniſters ſhould be very much troubled to prooue, that the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt is in one place in heauen: ſeeing it is written in the 4. Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he is mounted aboue all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: out of which, there is no place, as they ſpeak of places, in regard of bodies, according to nature. And were it ſo, that it ſhould be eſſential to a body, to be in one place (according to the rule which the Miniſters deliuer) an other blaſphemy would follow againſt the Omniporencie of God, that God could not make a body, and place the ſame aboue all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. And to ſpeake more vniuerſally, that God could not make a bodie without place, and roomth equall to it greatnes.</p>
            <p>Touching the Allegations propoſed by the Miniſters, of certaine auncient Authors, The Doctors do obiect, that the ſaid Allegations are againſt themſelues: For as much as to be incloſed in a place, doth not depend of the eſſence of a bodie, nor of it meaſures: as appeareth by the authorities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, wherein there is mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of Angels, which haue not bodies. It is not therefore an eſſentiall reaſon for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of a body to be contained in a place. And all this furniture of authorities maketh nothing to the purpoſe: For they tend but to ſhewe, that the naturall proprietie of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is different from the diuine nature, as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the place by the Miniſters alledged. And S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in his firſt booke of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. where the ſame Authors doo declare, that God by his nature may be euery where: and the creatures by their natures, not ſo. But the ſaid Authors pretend not, that God by his Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie cannot make one body to be in diuers places: For the ſame Authors (or their like) when they come to ſpeak of the power of God in the holy Sacrament, they affirme, that the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt is in heauen, and in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And affirme, that the Angels and ſpirits of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, may by the ſame power, be in many places. As the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will ſhew in their reſolution.</p>
            <p>Where the Miniſters ſay, that a body muſt be circumſcript without place, according to the eſſentiall proprietie: that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19757:44"/>
hath bene formerly ſhewed to be falſe. And the Miniſters do confound the name of body: which ſometimes doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſubſtance, ſometimes quantitie, hauing it dimenſions, breadth, length, and deepneſſe: which dimenſions be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in a body, taking the body for a kinde of quantitie: and not in a ſubſtantiall body: for it is an accident. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that God can ſeperate the accidents from a body, and make a ſubſtance without accidents: otherwiſe there would follow an other blaſphemie: that God could not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the accident, from a ſubiect and ſubſtance. And where the Miniſters ſay, that a ſtone by a violent mouing, may bee caſt on high, that is no anſwere to the queſtion. For the Doctors doo demaund (for as much as it is eſſentiall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to a maſſy and terreſtriall body, in regard of the maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and waight thereof tending downeward) whether God by his onely power, contrary to the naturall proprietie of a maſſy and waightie body, cannot hold and hang it vp on high?</p>
            <p>And as touching the euaſion which the Miniſters make from a very ſtrong and mightie argument againſt their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that two bodies may be in one place, by the proofe that is made, taken from the ſcripture, (not onely to proue that God can cauſe two bodies to be in one place, but euen that he hath done it) ſerueth nothing to couer their error, in ſaying that it is not ſaid in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that our Lord did enter by <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 19.</note>the ſhut doores: but that he was found ſtanding in the midſt of them: where the ſaid Miniſters haue concealed and omitted this verbe <hi>venit:</hi> and do ſtay onely vpon the verbe <hi>ſtetit.</hi> For the expreſſe text in S. <hi>Iohn. cap.</hi> 21. 19. ſaieth: That the doores being ſhut, Ieſus came into the place where the Diſciples were aſſembled, and was there in the middeſt of them. They demaund of them, for as much as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, that he came thither, the doores beeing ſhut, and that hee was found in the middeſt of them: whether hee were found in the middeſt of them, and in the ſaid place, without entring thereinto: or whether hee there entered, for as much as the text ſaith; that the doores were ſhut
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19757:45"/>
when he came; How they will proue by the ſcripture that he entred, if not by the ſhut doores? For a much greater myracle ſhould it be, to be found in the middeſt of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, without being entred into the place where they were. Too light is that ſhift, to ſay it is not written that he entred. For S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>De agone Chriſtiano, cap.</hi> 24. ſaieth thus. <hi>Nec nos moueat quod clauſis hoſtijs ſubitò eum apparuiſſe Dicipulis ſcriptum eſt: vt propterea negemus illud fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe corpus humanum, quia contra naturam huius corporis vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus illudper clauſa hostia intrare. Omnia enim poſſibilia ſunt Deo, Nam &amp; ambulare ſuper aquas contra naturam huius cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris eſſe manifeſtum eſt, &amp; tamen non ſolum ipſe Dominus ante paſſionem ambulauit, ſed etiam Petrum ambulare fecit.</hi> Let it not moue vs, becauſe it is written, that the doores being ſhut, he ſuddenly appeared to his Diſciples; that we therefore denie that body to haue bene humane, becauſe wee ſee it againſt the nature of this body, to enter by the cloſed doores. For to God are all things poſſible. For to walke alſo vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is manifeſtly againſt the nature of this body: And yet the Lord himſelfe not onely walked before his paſſion, but alſo cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> to walke.</p>
            <p>Where it appeareth, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith plainly, that our Lord did enter by the ſhut doores: and referreth all to the omnipotencie of God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the text of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> ioyned with that of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> doth ſhewe that he entred through the doores. For no reaſonable occaſion had the Apoſtles had, to thinke it was a ſpirit, and not a body, ſeeeing him before them in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a man: but for that he was entred otherwiſe then a true body, and very man could enter. That is, for that he was entred by the cloſed doores: which thing a true man, and a true body in no wiſe can doo. To ſay that the doores were opened, and afterwards ſhut again by myracle, or otherwiſe, ſhould nothing auaile. For ſo may a true man, and a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be there: and therefore no cauſe can a man haue to think it a ſpirit, or vaine viſion.</p>
            <p>The Doctors ſay moreouer, that all the auncient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19757:45"/>
and Chriſtians, did commonly agree, that Ieſus Chriſt paſſed through: but ſuch was their difference, as now it is between the Miniſters &amp; Doctors. The auncient heretikes ſaid, that Ieſus Chriſt after his reſurrection, had not a true body, becauſe he did workes contrary to the nature of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which implied contradiction to a naturall body: to wit, that at one ſelfe inſtant, he was in one ſelfe-ſame place with an other body: as when he paſſed through the doores. The auncient Catholike Chriſtians anſwered, that ſuch indeed was the nature of a body, that it could not paſſe through the doores: through the body of the virgin in his birth, without fracture: through the ſtone of the Sepulchre in it reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but neuertheleſſe, that two bodies ſhould be together, by the omnipotencie of God, implied no contradiction: for as much as it ſo hapned in the three caſes done and recited.</p>
            <p>The firſt that ſpeaketh therof, is <hi>Iuſtine Martir,</hi> in the 117. queſtion againſt the Gentiles: where hee ſaith. If a thicke body be hindred to paſſe through the doores, how did our Lord after his reſurrection enter the ſhut doores? And if it bee ſo, why was the ſtone remoued by the Angell from off the Sepulchre, to the end his body might riſe againe? He anſwereth thus. That euen as our Lord without changing his body into a ſpirit, walked vpon the ſea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by his diuine power he made the ſea ſolide to walke vpon; not onely for his owne body, but for that of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> So by his diuine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he came forth of the ſepulchre, the ſtone remaining ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, and entered to his Diſciples, the doores beeing ſhut. Hereby we vnderſtand, that the things which proceed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vertues, ought to haue the ſame faith. And we muſt know, that the things which ſurpaſſe nature, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are wrought in it by diuine power, ought not to be meaſured according to the reaſon &amp; proprietie of nature. For this cauſe, our Lord ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Diſciples troubled at ſuch an entry, did propoſe vnto them the parts of his body, and the places and markes of his wounds, to be touched, to ſhew he was not entred by change of his body into a ſpirite: but with his body compoſed of it dimenſions and thickneſſe: and by his diuine almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe,

The body of our Lord was not quite vaniſhed, to bee eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones taken and made of nothing. Whence then commeth it, that he is found in the middeſt of them without opening? Sence and ſpeech do herein faile, and the truth of the deed, is beyond humane reaſon.

The deed is falſe ſay we, it ſo happened not, becauſe we cannot vnderſtand the reaſon thereof: and for that our ſence and iudgemenr faileth, we ſay there is no ſuch deed. But the faith and beliefe of the deed, doth conuince our lying. The Lord (the doores being ſhut) is found in the middeſt of the Apoſtles, and the ſonne of God is borne of his Father. Denie not that hee thus entred, becauſe by the infirmitie of thy ſpirit, thou canſt not comprehend ſuch an entrie.</p>
            <p>I could amplifie like deeds in all the creatures: but the Lord hath well prouided for himſelfe, to haue contained vs in neceſſitie and modeſtie, by the nature of our bodies.

And thus ſaith: Tell me, thou ſubtill diſputer, which is greater, to hang the huge greatneſſe of the earth vpon nothing, and to ballance it aboue the brickleneſſe of the waters: or for God to paſſe through a ſhut doore, &amp; a creature to obey his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? To that which is the greater thou eaſily agreeſt, and ſlaundereſt that which is leſſer. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 13.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainct the Valentinians and others, which denied the true ſubſtance of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, for that contrary to the nature of a body, he ſo paſſed. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke called <hi>De agone Christiano,</hi> alledgeth the ſame deed. <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the 2.

That ſuch an effect importeth not contradiction to the nature of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for as much as it proceeded of the omnipotencie of God, and not of the nature of the body. <hi>Cirell</hi> in his 12. booke vpon S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> reprehendeth thoſe alſo which will meaſure the myracles and works of God according to their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the proprietie of creatures: and very ſharply ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againſt them. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Iulian, cap.</hi> 2. recyteth, That <hi>Iouinian</hi> was an heretike, becauſe he ſaid, that there was fraction in the virgin in her childbirth. And ſo ſaid he, for feare of falling into the hereſie of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachees, who thought that Ieſus Chriſt had not a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe he was borne without fraction of his mother. To auoyd then this hereſie, hee rather denied that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By theſe teſtimonies do the Doctors conclude, that two bodies to pierce themſelues, and be in one ſelf-ſame place, by diuine power doth not imply any contradiction. Which places were they wel conſidered, they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a new interpretation againſt the very expreſſe word of God: ſeeing the text without contradiction doth beare that Ieſus Chriſt came to his Diſciples, the doores being ſhut.</p>

               </note> How <hi>Caluin</hi> in his Inſtitution hath deptaued the ſence of that place of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> with other like, may plainly appeare, where he ſaith thus. That which they eftſoones alledge, that Ieſus Chriſt came out of the Sepulchre without opening the ſame, and that hee entred in to his Diſciples the doores of the chamber beeing ſhut, is of no value, further to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their error. For as the water ſerued Ieſus Chriſt for a firme pauement, to walke vpon the lake: ſo alſo ought it not ſeeme ſtraunge, if the hardneſſe of the ſtone were ſoftned to giue him paſſage. And <hi>Beza</hi> in his ſecond Dialogue againſt <hi>Heſhuſius</hi> ſaith, that the ſtone was vaniſhed, to the end that our Lord might paſſe in his reſurrection: and God did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reforme it. It followeth in the text of <hi>Caluin:</hi> As alſo to enter into a chamber the doores ſhut, is not to ſay that hee pierced the wood, but onely that he made an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by his diuine power: ſo that by a myraculous faſhion, he was found in the middeſt of his Diſciples, although the doores were were ſhut. Moreouer he ſaith: That which they bring of S. <hi>Luke:</hi> to wit, that hee vaniſhed ſuddenly from his Diſciples which went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> ſerueth nought for them, and maketh for our aduantage. For he was not made inuiſible by taking away the ſight of his body: but he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſhed. As alſo witneſſeth the ſame Euangeliſt: In wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he was not tranſfigured nor diſguiſed, to be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, but their eyes were holden. Such ridiculous and friuolous expoſitions are brought by <hi>Caluin</hi> and his like, to auoyd confeſſing, that God can make one body to be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:19757:48"/>
And neuertheleſſe, the proper text of the ſcripture doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that two bodies may be by the power of God, in one ſelfeſame place. As alſo it witneſſeth that a body hauing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and before viſible, by the power of God, was made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, without any let to their ſight that could ſee. As S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth confirme, ſaying: <hi>Aphantos Egeneto Ap'auton, Inuiſibilis factus eſt ab ipſis.</hi> Although there was no defect on the behalfe of the Diſciples. For it is ſaid before, that their eyes were opened, that they might know him: and herevpon agreeth all antiquitie. An other act do the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors adde, for confirmation of the penitration of dimenſions. Which is, that our Lord aſcended into the heauens, which he neither diuided, nor claue aſunder. Therefore of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did hee pierce them: as the ſcripture it ſelfe in proper termes importeth.</p>
            <p>The Doctors ſhewe alſo to the ſaid Miniſters, that they cannot produce one only renowned Father, hauing expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe places, from whom they might learne their ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers interpretations. And that which they bring of the Acts of the Apoſtles, where mention is made, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> came forth of priſon, nought ſerueth to colour their expoſition. In which text, there is nothing ſpoken of the opening of the priſon doores. And it is not ſaid (as in S. <hi>Iohn)</hi> that the doores of the priſon being ſhut, S. <hi>Peter</hi> came forth: but that the Angell came thither, when the keepers before the doore kept the priſon. Where if they ſay, that the doores were opened to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that agreeth not with the ſaying of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the doores were ſhut when as our Lord entered. The like reaſon brought by the Miniſters out of the fift of the Acts of the Apoſtles, and for the ſame cauſe, is as vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for this purpoſe, as the former.</p>
            <p>And to ſhewe clearely and euidently, that God (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the naturall proprietie of a body) can make a great and thicke body to paſſe in a ſpace and place vnequall to it greatneſſe, largeneſſe, and thickneſſe. The Doctors cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what our Lord ſaith in the 19. of S. <hi>Mathew:</hi> It is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a Cable to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19757:48"/>
rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>Two things haue the Miniſters anſwered vnto: the one, that in the tranſlation wee muſt not vſe Cable, but rather Camel: although neuertheles their own French Bible of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Rebulls</hi> impreſſion, which they haue brought, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the tranſlation of this word Cable. And <hi>Caluin</hi> himſelf likewiſe in his Hermony of the foure Euangeliſts, ſaith that to bee better. But here in appeareth to be truth what <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> againſt the Valentinians; and before him, <hi>Ireneus</hi> in his firſt booke and 14. Chapter againſt the Valentinians doo ſay: That they which ſeperate themſelues from vs to go to an other ſchoole, do alwaies inuent ſome new thing, that the diſciples may bee found more cunning then their Maiſters. But well, this word <hi>[Camell]</hi> beeing yeelded vnto them, (as the Doctors doubt not to haue bene expounded by Saint <hi>Hillary,</hi> S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and others) the reaſon thereof is yet more ſtrong. For it is yet more repugnant that a crooked, groſſe, and great Camell (then a Cable) ſhould enter through the eye of a needle. The other reaſon giuen by the Miniſters is, that God cannot make a Camel or Cable to enter throgh the eye of a needle: which is notwithſtanding, againſt the pure word of Ieſus Chriſt, who ſaith not, it is is impoſſible to God, but rather eaſie to do that, and by compariſon, more eaſie vnto God, then to make a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen: which neuertheleſſe is ſaid by our Lord to be poſſible: not vnto men, but vnto God: to whom there is nothing vnpoſſible. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Doctors ſay thus, If God can do that which is more difficult, he can doo that which is more eaſie. Now by the text of the ſcripture, it is ſaid that God can make a rich man enter into the kingdome of heauen, which is the more difficult; he can therfore make a Camell (or Cable) to enter through the eye of a needle, which is more eaſie.</p>
            <p>The anſweres of the Miniſters here aboue confuted, tend to ſuch abſurdities and blaſphemies, that Ieſus Chriſt by his almightineſſe, could not enter through the cloſed doores: that hee could not come forth of the belly of his mother,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19757:49"/>
through her body without fraction: that he could not make a viſible body, to be inuiſible: that a groſſe and great body might be in a place vnequall to it: that hee could not by his diuine power make penetration of dimenſions: and that he could not make by the ſame diuine power, one body to bee in two places (for it is like reaſon, of the laſt article and of the others) albeit ſuch things are declared in the ſcriptures, not onely to be poſſible, but euen the moſt part of them to haue bene done. And the Doctors do wonder how the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters dare denie ſuch things, ſeeing themſelues muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily confeſſe (if their doctrine of the Supper be true) that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is in diuers places: which they proue thus. The faithfull really receiue in their ſoules the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Ghoſt, and not the bread and the wine one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: or elſe (as ſaith <hi>Caluin</hi> in the 4 booke, 17. Chapter, and 11. ſection of his Inſtitution) the effect and vertue of the ſame Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now the Doctors conclude thus. It is impoſſible for a man to receiue into him the ſubſtance of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, but the body of Ieſus Chriſt is in him. But all the faithfull in the Supper do receiue the ſame into their ſoules, therefore muſt the body of Ieſus Chriſt be in them: and by conſequent in diuers places: to wit, in all places where their Supper is made: and likewiſe in heauen. They ſay further, that <hi>Caluin</hi> in his Inſtitution, the fourtth booke, 17. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and 24. ſect. ſaith: That in the Supper, the power of God is required: to the ende that the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt may pierce euen vnto vs: and that humane nature cannot comprehend the ſame. But it behoueth that the power of God doo worke therein. And by this meane, <hi>Caluin</hi> doth admit by the power of God, the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt in many places: to wit, in heauen, and in vs, into whom it muſt pierce by the power of God. And in the tenth number he ſaith: That the truth ſignified, and repreſented by the ſignes, muſt bee repreſented and exhibited in the ſame place where the ſignes be. Which hee proueth by reaſon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19757:49"/>
in many places: to wit, that the ſignes muſt no more bee voyd, then the Doue was voyd of the holy Ghoſt. But as the eſſence and ſubſtance of the holy Ghoſt was conioyned and preſent with the Doue: ſo the fleſh and bloud of our Lord, before there be a true Sacrament, muſt be conioyned and vnited with the ſignes. The paſſages are againſt <hi>Heſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and in his booke of the Supper: and vpon the firſt of the 11. Chapter to the Corinthians. And although the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters will anſwere: the Doctors beſeech them well to weigh and conſider the text of <hi>Caluin,</hi> and of the reaſon he giueth of the holy Ghoſt. They doo obiect further, that the Miniſters in their Supper doo attribute more to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, then to the omnipotencie of God: yea they do more then God can do: which is, that they brag to do a thing by their faith, which implyeth contradiction: ſaying in their confeſſion of faith exhibited to the Biſhops in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Poiſſy;</hi> That faith maketh things abſent, to be preſent, in one ſelfe-ſame inſtant and place. That is to ſay, in the ſoules of the faithfull, when they celebrate their Supper: which is as much to ſay, as faith maketh things not preſent, preſent at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant and place. So that to euery faithfull in the Supper, comming worthily therevnto, is the body of Ieſus Chriſt there preſent by the power of faith. And neuertheleſſe it is not there preſent; for they ſay ſo: and that it is onely in heauen. Wherein appeareth that there is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of contradiction: to wit, preſent, &amp; not really preſent. And the ſmall ſtarting hole they told vs of, that the body is aboue corporally, and ſpiritually in the Supper in the harts of the faithfull, can ſerue for nothing. For the ſpiritualtie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take away the ſubſtance of the thing: and their faith cannot make a body, not to be a body: and that a body haue not it dimenſions, as heretofore they haue ſaid.</p>
            <p>Therefore howſoeuer they confeſſe, that the faithfull in the Supper receiue into their ſoules the ſubſtance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Ieſus Chriſt, will they or nill they, muſt they neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily confeſſe, that either their faith is more mightie then the infinite vertue and power of God: or elſe that God can
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19757:50"/>
make his body to be locally in heauen; and Sacramentally (really neuertheleſſe and ſubſtantially) in the Sacrament of the Aultar. Thus would the Doctors deſire to heare the Miniſters vpon this point: and then afterwards to put their anſwere in writing. And the Miniſters ſhall neuer be able to ſhewe by the word of God, that their faith can make at one inſtant, and one ſelfe-ſame place, a thing to be preſent, and not preſent. And one thing preſent, and not preſent by faith: is as much to ſay, as that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is in, and not in a faithfull perſon. And no Coduit pipe of the power of the holy Ghoſt ſhould there alſo be needfull, to conuey the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt hither vnto vs from heauen, were not the ſaid fleſh but in heauen, and notwithſtanding came vnto vs.</p>
            <p>And as touching the points obiected by the Doctors, that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Theodoret Beza</hi> were the firſt which ſaid, that God could not make one body to bee in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and the Miniſters haue willed to confirme by antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie this new doctrine, which they cannot name otherwiſe then blaſphemie. The Doctors ſay, they haue often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſters (that time might be ſpared, things better cleared) to ſpeake nothing from the purpoſe. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they bring forthwith the teſtimonies of Fathers, to ſhewe that a body by nature is circumſcript, and cannot be naturally in many places: but thoſe Authors ſay not that God cannot do it. But S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cyted by the Doctors, touching the article of the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed doores, do rather witneſſe, that two bodies by the power of God, may occupie one ſelfe-ſame place, which is of like difficultie. And when they ſhall come to the proofe of the reall preſence of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, they will euidently ſhewe, that wholly all the auncient Fathers which haue ſpoken of that Sacrament, haue not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that hee could make his body to bee aboue in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and here belowe in the Sacrament: but all with one accord, haue declared that they beleeue according to the word of Ieſus Chriſt, that he is in heauen, and here in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19757:50"/>
the Sacrament. The Doctors demaund of the Miniſters, whether they haue any, that before <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Beza,</hi> denied ſuch power of God. And let them no more ſet foorth the authorities of the Fathers, to prooue that one body is not naturally in two places. The Doctors doo not maruell if the Miniſters do magnifie <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> from whom they haue taken all the places they haue brought.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Article which beginneth <hi>(Touching that which the Doctors pretend, that the forme</hi> &amp;c.) The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſay, that this forme is common, as often as men will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the power of God. And they cannot be better gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to proue it, then to follow the words of the Angel: <hi>That there is nothing impoſſible to God.</hi> From the which, when a man will except ſomething, hee will alwaies bring, what the Miniſters do bring: that there is ſome repugnancy of things, whereof enſueth ſome implication of contradiction. As did the olde heretiques againſt the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt; who brought alwayes ſome impoſſibilitie according to nature. And as much did they againſt the Article of the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and incarnation: as though there had bene contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God ſhould be man, and man ſhould be God. And it ſhall be alwayes eaſie for an euil ſpirit, to forge ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in his conceit, according to the proprieties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And concerning the Article beginning <hi>(As touching that which the Doctors do adde, that God can change,</hi> &amp;c.) The Doctors ſay, that the Miniſters haue not wel conceiued their meaning: for they take for an abſurd thing, that a ſubſtance remaining affected of his qualities, can by the power of God haue effects, contrary to his qualities. As if God by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie could not make the fire, hauing his naturall heate, to coole, in ſtead of burning, which none of ſound and Chriſtian iudgement will deny.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Article beginning <hi>(Touching the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the power,</hi> &amp;c.) The Doctors ſay; that it ſeemeth by the Miniſters anſwere, that the power of God is limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will: as much to ſay, as God cannot doo but what he will: which is notoriouſly falſe. For the Hebrew
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19757:51"/>
alledged, the Miniſters (it ſeemeth) are willing to ſhew they are skilfull therin. For ſuch ſummoning is not to the purpoſe, when as they ſtay chiefly vpon the word <hi>Dauar:</hi> which is as much to ſay, as one thing. But it ought not to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a thing done: they ſaid, to be done. And ſuch is the ſence of the place <hi>ad verbum.</hi> Shall there be any thing hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from me? And becauſe hard things are hidden, &amp; things impoſſible alſo are yet more hidden; Behold why they haue tranſlated, Is there any thing hard (or impoſſible) to mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which holy <hi>Pagninus,</hi> and other Interpreters of the Hebrew tongue, do wel declare, that the verbe <hi>[Pala]</hi> ſignifieth to hide. The Doctors had no deſire to anſwer herevnto, but to make it bee vnderſtood that an Hebrew word doth not appaule them. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the article beginning, <hi>Touching the danger,</hi> &amp;c. The Doctors ſay, that they are words ſuperfluous; and whatſoeuer the Miniſters can bring, the ſame may other vſe, and retort againſt the ſaid Miniſters. And where they ſay it is a ſlaunder, in that they obiect vnto them, that they corrupt the ſcripture, the Doctors ſay, that the Miniſters cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie but they change the ſence &amp; gloſe the words of the Supper. <hi>This is my body. This is my bloud.</hi> And with like authoritie, as they (vnder pretence of I know not what reaſons) may each one pretend to corrupt the other ſcriptures, &amp; alledge ſome impoſſibilities, &amp; contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of nature. As touching the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle beginning, <hi>To that which they adde, that the ſcripture ſaith, that the body</hi> &amp;c. The Doctors do ſay, that in time and place they will ſhewe what they haue obiected, when as they ſhall treate more amply of the Sacrament of the Aultar.</p>
            <p>Where the Doctors haue obiected that the Miniſters do not ground their affirmation; to wit, that God cannot make one body to be in two places, vpon the expreſſe teſtimonie of the ſcripture: or can thereof deduct the ſame. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for all places haue onely brought but theſe: that God cannot lye: God cannot denie himſelfe. But the Doctors ſay that this conſequence is nought worth. God cannot lye: God cannot therefore make one body to be in two places: which neuertheleſſe the Miniſters ſhould haue made ſuch had the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19757:51"/>
places produced ſerued to that purpoſe. Ioyned, that when it is ſaid God cannot lye, as the Miniſters themſelues haue cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to be able to lye: is not power, but infirmitie. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ſenſe, it was meet ſo to ſay; God is not weake that he can lye. Therfore God cannot make one bodie to be in two places: which conſequence ſhould be ridiculous.</p>
            <p>And where the Miniſters haue brought certaine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the auncient Fathers, to proue there is diuerſitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the creatures, and Creator: and that the Creator by nature is euery where, and naturally the creatures be not in diuers places: the Doctors reuerently imbrace the authoritie of the holy Fathers: But to produce the ſaid places for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a thing ſo well knowne, and not doubted of, their trauell was now needleſſe. But the Doctors yet attend one ſole place of the ſcripture; or one ſole teſtimony of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, which ſaith: That God cannot make one body to be in diuers places. The Doctors pray the Miniſters, that with like reuerence, they receiue the auncient Fathers: chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching the interpretation of holy ſcriptures: whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (as are the places aboue cyted) ſhalbe agreed vpon betweene them and the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Vpon requeſt made to the Lord <hi>Neuers</hi> on the behalfe of the Miniſters, that hee would pleaſe to aſſigne a day for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, particularly to all and euery article and ſlaunders here aboue propoſed by the Doctors in their obiection: The ſaid Lord ordained, that the Miniſters ſhould carry with them that euening, one of the Copies of the Doctors obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; to be ready the next morrow by noone, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thervnto: which the Doctors agreed vnto. And made likewiſe requeſt to the ſaid Lord of <hi>Neuers,</hi> to haue leaue (if it ſo ſeemed them good) to reply to the anſwers that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould make. And therwith to deliuer their reſolution, touching this article of the omnipotency of God. To th' end to proceed, and examine the reall truth of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Aultar. Whervnto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters added: that they alſo for their parts, would deliuer a briefe reſolution of all that which ſhall be deduced by them.</p>

The company aſſembled on the morrow beeing Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, the 17. of Iuly, My Lord of <hi>Neuers,</hi> conſidering that the Doctors the day before had imployed all the time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any left for the Miniſters to make preſent anſwere to them: ſuppoſed no leſſe time would be needfull for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to anſwerefully, which had bene a thing tedious and irkſome. For this cauſe, and others by him declared: he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, they ſhould thenceforth ſpeake by writing. And that the Miniſters ſhould carry with them the Copie which was giuen them, to make anſwere therevnto: and to ſend it vnto him, ſigned by them, and two Notaries. Of which he would cauſe a Copie to be written by his Secretary, to giue it to the Doctors, reſeruing the Originall to himſelfe. And in like ſort would he keepe for the Miniſters the Copie of that which the Doctors ſhould ſend him. Wherevnto both parts ſubmitting themſelues, they diſputed afterwards by writing as followeth.</p>

               <p>THe Miniſters deny, that the conſequence propoſed by the Doctors, (to wit: God cannot make one body to be in two places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant. Therfore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Vnto which, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugneth, which the Doctors ſet forth: that one ſelfe ſame body, at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant, may be in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For it would follow, that a body ſhould be a body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being limitted: And by conſequence, that it ſhould be, and not be, altogither. For the meaſures (as to be long, large, thicke, and to be bounded &amp; limitted with certaine bounds) are ſo eſſentiall to a body, that without that, it is no more a body. And ſo farre of is it, that the Miniſters in ſo ſaying, do
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19757:52"/>
diminiſh the omnipotency of God: that contrariwiſe they eſtabliſh the ſame; and will not attribute to him any muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and chaunge in his counſaile: nor any contradiction in his will, for feare to make him lye: which by the ſcripture is impoſſible to him.</p>
               <p>And where the Doctors alledge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Fathers, that they haue not denied the omnipotency of God, The Miniſters haue heretofore ſhewed, that they haue: and in what caſe it may happen. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his booke written againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> ſpeaking of this matter, ſaith as followeth: Surely nothing is hard vnto God. But if without iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we wil vſe this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and interpret it according to our fooliſh fantaſie, we may faine all things to be of God: and ſay, that he hath done them: becauſe he can do them. Now muſt it not be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe he can do all things, that therfore he hath done, what he hath not done: but enquired whether he hath done it? And finally concludeth, that the power of God is his wil: and his inhabilitie, likewiſe his vnwillingneſſe. The Doctors then, to ſhew that he can do it, ſhould declare that God hath willed to make a body, which at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant hath bin in diuers places. And a maruellous thing it is, that they impute to the Miniſters, that they derogate from the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God, when as they do except fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, what is contrary to his wil: ſeeing they themſelues do confeſſe it, and except the ſame things. And that there is no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the Miniſters, but that they ſay, that God maketh one body to be in diuers places, at one ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: becauſe he can do it. And the Miniſters ſay, that he doth it not, and cannot do it: becauſe he wil not do it. For as much (as is ſaid according to <hi>Tertullian)</hi> the power of god is his wil.</p>
               <p>Touching the reaſon that the Doctors do alledge in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſophie, to proue, that a bodie, for being a bodie, doth not therfore leaue to be in diuers places: The Miniſters ſay, they ſuppoſe a falſhood. To wit, that quantitie is accidentall, and not eſſentiall to a body. For that (to wit, that a body is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, bounded and circumſcript) is in ſuch ſort of it eſſence, that without that, it is no more a bodie. As S. <hi>Augustine</hi> him
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19757:53"/>
ſelfe, ſpeaking of the glorified body of Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith: That if ſpace be taken away from a body, there is no more place where it might be: and by conſequence, being no part, is no more at all. The reaſo of Philoſophie they propoſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt heauen; as, that it is not in any place: The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do denie it: for to ſpeake according to the language of the ſcripture, it muſt be confeſſed that there is place e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 26.</note>Where I am (taking the preſent time for the future) there ſhal my ſeruants be In the which ſentence muſt be obſerued, that there be aduerbes of place. And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writing to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> expreſly ſaith: That it behoueth that the body of Ieſus Chriſt be in ſome place in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe it is a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Moreouer, in numbring of the errors ſometimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the facultie of <hi>Paris,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid: That the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by them called <hi>Empyreum,</hi> is the place of Angels, of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits, and glorified humane bodies. Where the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors pretend, that of the doctrine (which the Miniſters main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that a body cannot be without place, nor in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at one inſtant) may be inferred, that they blaſpheme the omnipotencie of God. The Miniſters contrariwiſe ſay, that the Doctors blaſpheme his Maieſtie, and diminiſh the ſame, in attributing to the creature that which appertaineth to him alone: to wit, to be vncircumſcript. As it appeareth by that which <hi>Didimus</hi> ſaith in his booke of the holy Ghoſt: where he proueth, that the holy Ghoſt is God, &amp; not a creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is incircumſcript: and that al creatures neceſſarily be circumſcript, and limited. As much thereof alſo ſay S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilius,</hi> and the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of the ſentences in his firſt booke. Where they confeſſe, that the Angels and bleſſed ſpirits be circumſcript, although they be not corporall. This reaſon is againſt themſelues, and proper to proue what the Miniſters haue here aboue maintained of bodies: to wit, that it cannot be but that they be circumſcript in ſome place. For by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leſſe to the more: If the Angels which want dimenſion and meaſure, (by their own confeſſion) in as much
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19757:53"/>
as they be creatures, be neceſſarily circumſcript: by a more ſtrong reaſon, the bodies of men, which be creatures, and meaſured, ſhall be ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p>And where they adde, that the auncient Fathers haue not ſaid, that one body by the power of God could not be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places: That is contrary to the ſaying of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his 30. tract vpon S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which is recited <hi>De conſec: diſtinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2. <hi>C. Prima quide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Where, ſpeaking of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, he ſaith: namely; It behooueth, that the body of our Lord, wherin he roſe again, be in one place: teaching therby, that at one ſelfe-ſame time, it cannot be in diuers places. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reaſon they adde, taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sacrament, to proue their aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the Miniſters ſay, that the fathers neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, nor ſaid, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt was in heauen, and in the Sacrament, in one ſelfe ſame ſort &amp; maner: nor do they teach, that he was otherwiſe then Sacramentally in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And wheras in their reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they pretend to proue, that the Angels may at one ſelf inſtant be in diuers places, when the Miniſters ſhall haue vnderſtood their reaſons, then they wil anſwere therevnto. That which they ſay of a body, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoiled of it dimenſions, ceaſeth not to be a body not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: is a very abſurd thing. For did it happen, that a corporal ſubſtance were wholly diſpoiled of it dimenſions, it ſhould no more be a body, but an incorporeall ſubſtance: &amp; of like nature as the Angels &amp; ſpirits. And although God by his power can ſeperate the dimenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of a ſubſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corrupting it: yet can it not be, that they be ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a body, without the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame. Becauſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie &amp; dimenſions are accidents of the ſubſtance, but not of the body: which cannot ſubſiſt without them, in as much as they be of it proper eſſence.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Doctors ſay afterwards in their obiection, that the waight in a body, is a thing eſſentiall. The Miniſters do deny it. And the reaſon is, that were it of the eſſence of a bodie, and the ſame wanting, the bodie ſhould ceaſe to bee: Neuertheleſſe we ſee, that the glorified bodie
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19757:54"/>
of Ieſus Chriſt, (wherevnto the bodies of all the elect ſhall be like after the reſurrection) doth not leaue to be &amp; ſubſiſt, although it be now exempted from all waight.</p>
               <p>And as touching their alledged very ſtrong and mightie argument: That if two bodies may be in one ſelfe place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, one body, at one inſtant, may be alſo in diuers places. The Miniſters not graunting the antecedent (vnder correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſay, that the conſequence is not good: and that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is very weake. Adding therto, that the Doctors haue nor prooued, and neuer can prooue by the ſcriptures, nor by any authoritie of the auncient Fathers, nor by any ſufficient reaſon, that which they propoſe in their antecedent, or the conſequent which they inferre thereof to be true.</p>
               <p>Wheras the Doctors to proue that two bodies may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one ſelfe place, alledge out of the ſcripture, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt entred into the houſe where his Diſciples were, the doores being ſhut: The Miniſters do anſwere: that it is not written, that he entred through the cloſed doores, but only the doores being ſhut: which the auncient Interpreter hath well giuen to vnderſtand, expounding in one of the places of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> (where mention is made of that aboue ſaid) <hi>Cuum fores eſſent clauſae.</hi> Then when the doores were ſhut, Ieſus came, &amp;c. Neuertheles the Miniſters ſay, they verily belieue, and are aſſured, of that which the ſcripture doth clearly ſay, to wit, that the doores being ſhut, he came and ſtood in the midſt of his Diſciples. But they cannot certainly define, nor determine, which way he entered: whether it were through the walles, or doores of wood; which <hi>Hillary</hi> himſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth doubt of in that place of his writings, alledged by the Doctors. Howſoeuer it be, the Miniſters do ſay: that in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, he miraculouſly made way. And that a body (be it the wood or wall) did yeeld and giue place to the body of Ieſus Chriſt entering: or that an opening was made vnto him by the Angell, which opened and afterward ſhut againe the doores in a moment; as before hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne ſaid. And that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it was done, two bodies were neuer found in one ſelfe ſame place together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:19757:54"/>
Touching that they alledge out of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his booke <hi>de agone Christiano,</hi> that Ieſus Chriſt entered through the doores: The Miniſters deny not, that he entred through the doores: but that two bodies onely were neuer in one ſelfe ſame place together. But if Ieſus Chriſt entered through the doores, that the doores at his entire gaue him place, as is ſaid.</p>
               <p>For that which the Doctors alledge touching the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſuſpition, that it was a vaine viſion, it nought appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the preſent matter; nor that alſo that they maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the maner of his entry, which was miraculous: as they euer confeſſed.</p>
               <p>And touching that which they adde afterwards, in the opinion held by the olde heretiques, of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, that it was not a true bodie: becauſe it did things aboue nature. The Miniſters doo ſhewe them, that they litle think what occaſion and foundation of their errour, the auncient Fathers had preſented vnto them, had they confeſſed what the Doctors haue ſet foorth, and doo obſtinately defend of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: that it doth things, not only aboue nature, but alſo contrary to nature: yea euen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will and ordinance of God. And there is no doubt, but ſuch an opinion ſhould be a great proofe for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> and other heretiques, which haue denied the true huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Ieſus Chriſt: if they ſhould confeſſe by the Doctors example, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the truth, nature, and eſſence of a body) may be, at one ſelf-ſame time in diuers places: or in one ſelfe ſame place with an other body.</p>
               <p>To that they alledge of <hi>Iuſtin Martir:</hi> The Miniſters do anſwer, that the booke by them alledged, is falſly attributed to him. For it there maketh mention of <hi>Origen</hi> (to wit in the the 82. queſtion) althogh that <hi>Origen</hi> was more then 100. yeares after him. And touching the opening of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, whereof there is mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made in the place by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, They anſwer, that the Euangeliſt reciteth clearly, that there was a great Earthquake, when Ieſus Chriſt roſe again; and that the Angel did rowle away the ſtone, which cloſed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19757:55"/>
the Sepulchre. Whervnto agreeth the ſaying of <hi>Leo,</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writing to the Biſhops of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> where he ſaith: That Ieſus Chriſt roſe againe, the ſtone which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Sepulchre being rowled away.</p>
               <p>Touching the place alledged by the Doctors, out of the writings of S. <hi>Hillary;</hi> one word there is, ſhall ſerue them for an anſwer. To wit, that this holy Doctor expreſly ſaith: that Ieſus Chriſt (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all things are open (as the Doctors haue expounded the ſaid ſentence) or (as the Miniſters expound it, that he maketh way euery where, by his diuine power) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the doores being ſhut. For thereby alſo he giueth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that to enter into the houſe where his Diſciples were, he made himſelfe way &amp; opening. And by his writing can nought elſe be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, but that his entry was myracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Concerning that which the Doctors alledge of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke:</hi> No more can they inferre thereof, then S. <hi>Hillary</hi> hath ſaid. And they cannot conclude, neither of the one nor the other, but that Ieſus Chriſt entered within the houſe, by a diuine and miraculous power.</p>
               <p>For that which they alledge of S. <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the virgin, that Ieſus Chriſt came forth of her wombe, her virginitie &amp; integritie no way thereby corrupted nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: yea &amp; that ſhe did remain a virgin before &amp; after her child birth: The Miniſters do beleeue, confeſſe, and teach the ſame. And yeeld a reaſon thereof by the ſcripture: for as much as ſhe neuer had knowne man. But if thence they will infer, that in the birth of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Nula interceſſerit aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio vteri:</hi> The wombe was not opened. The Miniſters do ſay: that ſuch a concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be againſt the expreſſe text of the ſcripture; and of that ſaid in S. <hi>Luke</hi> to that purpoſe: <hi>Omne maſculinum ad aperiens vuluam,</hi> &amp;c. Euery male that firſt openeth the wombe, &amp;c. Ioyned therevnto, that many auncient authors haue written &amp; approued it. as <hi>Origen</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. <hi>Luke: Tertullian de carne Chriſti:</hi> S. <hi>Ierom</hi> in his firſt <hi>Tome, Ad Euſtochiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Where in expreſſe termes he ſaith: that Ieſus Chriſt came bloody forth of the virgins belly. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Luke.</hi> Wherby it may appeare, that the virgin was truly a virgin, and truly a mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:19757:55"/>
To the authoritie which they bring of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters alledge no other thing for anſwere, then that which himſelfe hath ſaid. To wit: That when Ieſus Chriſt came where his Diſciples were, the creature obeyed his Creator.</p>
               <p>What the Doctors alledge of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> ſerueth nothing to the confirmation of their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the hereſie in <hi>Iouinian,</hi> iuſtly reproued by Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> who to auoyd the error of the Manichees, fel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an other: namely, that the virgin in her child-birth remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not a virgin. The Miniſters ſay: that it was not neceſſary that <hi>Iouinian</hi> (to auoid the error of the Manichees) ſhould cal in doubt the virginitie of <hi>Mary:</hi> foraſmuch as the foundio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame virginitie, is vpon this, that ſhe was neuer knowne of man.</p>
               <p>Touching the concluſion, that the Doctors would draw from the authorities aboue ſaid, and apply them to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (which was) that one body may be in two places at one ſelf-ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or that two bodies may be in one ſelf-ſame place togither: The Miniſters ſay, that it is altogither impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And that neither by the places they alledged, nor any others that they can gather, can they any way inferre the ſame. Adding further, that it ſhall neuer be found in any good Author. By meanes wherof, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude againſt the Doctors, that their foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing. And that they wil falſly authoriſe their error by the name &amp; title of the auncient Fathers, for fault of good vnderſtanding, and taking the terme [piercing] which ſome of the auncient Fathers haue vſed; and ſignifieth not a a confuſion, and mingling togither of diuers bodies, occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſelfe ſame place: but only the yeelding, that the one made, to giue the other paſſage. As we ſee, and haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the aire giueth place to a man that walketh, and birds that flye. And the Miniſters for concluſion ſay: that, that which they maintaine, and propoſe by their anſwere, doth not derogate, nor any way diminiſh the greatnes, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and power of God: but doth eſtabliſh the ſame; and much more aduance it, then ſuch prodigious abſurdities, (as thoſe are, which the Doctors ſet foorth, and will perſwade: without any reaſon or probable meanes) woulde doo. For they confeſſe, that all whatſoeuer happened, both
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19757:56"/>
in the entry of Ieſus Chriſt into the houſe where his diſciples were, and in his going out as wel of the virgins wombe, as of the Sepulchre, there was the myraculous &amp; diuine power of God. But they denie, that thereby nothing happened, which was impoſſible, and contained any contradiction.</p>
               <p>What they alledge of <hi>Caluin &amp; Beza</hi> are friuolous things: and propoſed more to ſlaunder and contradict, then to ſearch out and make manifeſt the truth.</p>
               <p>Where as they ſay that all antiquitie, with one conſent do vnderſtand by the terme <hi>Aphantos ap'aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n;</hi> That Ieſus Chriſt made himſelfe inviſible to his Diſciples, abiding in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Miniſters for their anſwer, are content to alledge vnto them, one onely authoritie of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke:</hi> who expounding theſe words, ſaith: That hee retired from them. And an other of <hi>Nicholas de Lyra,</hi> which ſaith vpon this place, that it was done by the agilitie of his glorious body, which can ſuddenly vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>To that they alledge of the piercing the heauens, when Ieſus Chriſt aſcended thither, the Miniſters do anſwer, that it is very like they claue a ſunder, and were opened; a when at the Baptiſme of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Doue deſcended vpon him: And when as alſo S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned.</p>
               <p>Touching that which they reproue in the firſt anſwere of the Miniſters, ſaying: that in the 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there is made no mention of the opening of the priſon. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do admoniſh them to read diligently the text of the ſaid place. And there they ſhal find, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had paſſed the firſt &amp; 2. watch, the vtter gate of the priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which was of Iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it own accord, to make the Angel &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> paſſage.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Doctors reply vpon the anſwer of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to the argument of the Camell formerly propoſed by them in their firſt anſwer: the Miniſters ſay, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their ſaid anſwer, againſt the word of God. But that they deceiue themſelues: referring to the Camell, whereof hee had formerly made mention: that which ought to bee vnderſtood, but of the ſauing and conuerſion of the rich man only. For our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaying, that that which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19757:56"/>
is impoſſible to men, is poſſible with God: nought elſe pretendeth, but to anſwere the queſtion which the Diſciples had propounded. To wit, who could be ſaued. Anſwering wherevnto, hee ſaid: that it was indeed impoſſible to men: who of themſelues are inclined to truſt in their riches. But to God it was poſſible, which could pull backe or withdraw their hearts from that vaine confidence.</p>
               <p>As touching the argument which they will build vpon the preſence of Ieſus Chriſt in the Supper, (whereof they wil inferre, that it is in diuers places) the Miniſters confeſſe the antecedent, &amp; denie the conſequence. For there is no doubt, but by faith our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is ſpiritually preſent to all the faithfull in the Supper. Whence neuertheleſſe muſt not be inferred, that he is there locally, definitiuely, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. And wheras they ſay, that it is not imaginable, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do avow the ſame, in regard of theſe which are not taught and enlightned by the ſpirit of God, and haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imagination, then that which their natural facultie doth furniſh them withall. But they that beeing illuminate by the grace of God, haue a true and liuely faith in their hearts: it is no more impoſſible to repreſent vnto them Ieſus Chriſt crucified in the Supper, then it was to the Galathians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and propoſe him vnto them, as preſent and viſible, at the preaching of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and to thoſe likewiſe of whom Saint <hi>Ciprian</hi> maketh mention in his Sermon of the Supper: That in celebrating the ſame, they embrace the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, ſucke his bloud, and faſten their tongues within his wounds. All which things are done by a liuely contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and apprehenſion of faith: which is no other thing, then the ground of things hoped for, and an euidence of thoſe things which are not ſeene: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth define it.</p>
               <p>Touching the truth of the thing conioyned with the ſignes and Sacraments: the Miniſters confeſſe, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes are neuer without their effect toward the faithfull, who cannot be partakers of the bread and wine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed in the Supper, but that they participate therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt crucified for their ſinnes, and
<pb facs="tcp:19757:57"/>
of his bloud ſhead to ratifie the new couenant which God made with his people. But if the Doctors will inferre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a corporall preſence in the Supper, the Miniſters will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it. And their reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a preſence was not required among the auncient Fathers: who left not for all that, to eate one ſelfe-ſame ſpirituall foode, with all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at this day: as it ſhalbe by the grace of God, more amply declared when the Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> ſhall pleaſe to command conference of this matter.</p>
               <p>To that which the Doctors (ſlaundering the Miniſters) do ſay, that they attribute more to themſelues, and to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, then they do attribute to the power of God: when they ſay, that by faith they make preſent, the things which be abſent; ſeeing that God (according to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Miniſters) cannot make one ſelfe-ſame body to bee in diuers places at one inſtant. The Miniſters doo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that ſuch antitheſes be fooliſh, and vnfit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and that there is much more great apparance that the Doctors do preſume more of their power, and that of the other Prieſts of the Romane Church, then of the power of God: for God created not by his word, but the heauens, the earth, and the other creatures therein contained. And they in their conſecration, doo attribute vnto themſelues, the power to create their Creator: as is contained in their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiarie, where the Prieſt ſaith: <hi>Qui creauit me, creatur medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante me.</hi> He that created me, is created my meanes of mee. And the Miniſters much maruell, that the Doctors call the vertue of faith, a humane power, ſeeing the great and admirable effects thereof propoſed vnto vs, in ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſcripture; chiefly in the eleuenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes: where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: That the Saints, by faith, haue ſubdued kingdomes, &amp;c. All which things ſurmount not onely the vertue, but alſo the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of humane vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>In that immediately following this article, there is but repetitions in the reply of the Doctors: and many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and ſuperfluous wordes: and little or nothing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19757:57"/>
of that, ſhould be neceſſary to the purpoſe. And as they haue anſwered them particularly to euery point which they repeate, they ſend them now backe to the former anſweres: and pray them henceforth not to ſerue them twiſe with one meſſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Sacrament of the Aultar, as they call it: The Miniſters neither receiue, nor any way approue, that their Maſſe (which they pretend to bee a Sacrament) is a Sacrament: and much leſſe a ſacrifice, by which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of finnes may bee any way obtained. Yea they ſay, that both their Prieſt and pretended ſacrifice, with all the things thereof depending, are blaſphemies, and impieties: by which GOD is diſhonoured, all the benefite of Ieſus Chriſt buried, and nought eſteemed: and the Church of Ieſus Chriſt ſeduced and abuſed; as by the purſuite of the Conference ſhall plainely appeare. And alſo, that the Miniſters do no way corrupt either the ſence, or the words which Ieſus Chriſt vſed in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holy Supper.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctors ſay, that this coſequence, God cannot by his omnipotencie, make one body to be in two places at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, he is not therefore omnipotent: is ſo good and ſtrong, that the Miniſters (without wrapping, and more and more drowning themſelues in execrable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, to the great griefe and horror of the Doctors) can no way denie the ſame: And beſides
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19757:58"/>
the two blaſphemies maintained by the Miniſters in their former anſwers, (that is to ſay, that it was impoſſible for God to make one body to bee in two places: and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to will the ſame) in the firſt article of theyr laſt anſwere, they adde foure or fiue other blaſphemies, out of which doo flow yet many others: beſides the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, falſhoods, and impoſtures they vſe to the ſaid Doctors. And firſt they ſet forth, that God cannot do a thing which derogateth the order which he hath eſtabliſhed in the world. Secondly, that it ſhould bee to eſtabliſh mutabilitie, and change in the Councell of God, did they confeſſe, that hee can do any thing againſt the ſaid order which he hath put in the world. And thirdly, that were it ſo, there ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in his will: whereby it would followe, that hee ſhould be a lyar. And for the fourth blaſphemie, that the power of God is his will: and that his weakneſſe, is his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe. And for the fift, the Miniſters pretend, that God hath willed to make a body, which at one ſelfe inſtant hath beene in many places, before they beleeue that God could doo it: otherwiſe they intend to inferre that hee had not power, and could not do it. So that the Miniſters will nought acknowledge of the power of God, but ſo much thereof, as hee hath ſhewed by effect. And to that purpoſe they alledge <hi>Tertullian.</hi> All which blaſphemies be drawne out of the proper words of the Miniſters firſt article.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, which is, that God cannot make a thing which derogateth the order he hath eſtabliſhed in the world: it is very apparant that it is blaſphemie by the holy ſcripture: which in infinite places maketh mention of the workes of God aboue nature, which the Miniſters call the order eſtabliſhed in the world. And in proper termes tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that God can do infinite things, aboue the order by him eſtabliſhed in the world. Namely, that <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned into a pillar of ſalte: that a barren woman in her old age, hauing an old husband, brought forth a childe: that a withered Rodde budded: that an Aſſe ſpake: that the ſonne ſtayed and went backe: and other more then innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19757:58"/>
examples, contained in the old Teſtament. And as touching the new, that a virgin brought forth a child. That a body walked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water, &amp; mounted into heauen. And generally all the myracles that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did aboue nature, which is contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world. And of this blaſphemie enſueth an other: that God ſince hee eſtabliſhed his order in the world, hath not done, nor could, nor can do any myracle.</p>
               <p>Now to proue that the ſcripture teacheth clearely, that God can do contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world, it is written in the 50. of <hi>Eſay:</hi> Is my hand (that is to ſay my power) ſo ſhortned, that it cannot helpe? or haue I no power to deliuer? Behold at my rebuke I drie the ſea: I make the flouds deſart: Their fiſh rotteth for want of water, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thirſt. I cloathe the heauens with darkneſſe, &amp; make a ſacke their couering. And more expreſly in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, where it is ſaid by S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> That God can of ſtones raiſe vp children to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Which place, although it may be expounded allegorically: yet hath S. <hi>Iohn</hi> willed in the litterall ſence to ſhewe, that it was poſſible to God. And the diue did know and confeſſe, that if Ieſus Chriſt were the true ſonne of God, he could chaunge the ſtones into bread. Which is neuertheleſſe contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world. And it muſt be noted, that there is no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie that the bread ſhould bee chaunged into fleſh by the omnipotencie of God, then a ſtone into bread. And therefore they which denie this laſt, done by the power of God, do ſhewe to beleeue leſſe the almightineſſe of God, then the diuels.</p>
               <p>The confutation of the ſecond blaſphemie, dependeth on the confutation of the firſt. For although God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world, hath done many myracles (as hath beene before recyted) yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there is no mutabilitie, nor chaunge in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile.</p>
               <p>Touching the third blaſphemie, which is, that if God did any thing contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19757:59"/>
there ſhould be contradiction in his will, and he ſhould ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a lyar. The Doctors obiect, that it would follow, that the will of God ſhould be ſuch, neuer to will any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world. And that God ſhould haue purpoſed and declared by his word, his will to be ſuch. For otherwiſe can they not know what the will of God ſhuld be. And the Miniſters do not, nor can they make it appeare by the word of God, the will of God to be ſuch, that he will not do any thing againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world. And it behoueth the ſaid Miniſters to teach of ſuch a wil of God, before they conclude that God made one body to be in two places (or other thing) againſt the order of nature eſtabliſhed in the world, he ſhould be a lyar.</p>
               <p>Touching the fourth blaſphemie, which is, that the power of God is his will, and that his weakneſſe is his vnwillingnes, according to the ſence which the Miniſters giue it (to wit, if God cannot, but that which he will) it is an hereſie of the heretikes called <hi>Monarchians,</hi> in the Primitiue Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom, <hi>Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> wrote, in his booke <hi>Aduerſus Praxea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and afterwards renewed by <hi>Peter Abaillardus.</hi> And ſince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by one called <hi>Wickliffe:</hi> who meaſured the power of God according to his will. Which is againſt the expreſſe word of God, which often declareth many things poſſible to God, that notwithſtanding he wil not do, as by that which is written in the 2. of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> appeareth: where mention is made, that God could ſend vpon the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> many kinds of affliction, to chaſten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he would not do it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſpoſed all things, by number, waight &amp; meaſure. And that he could deſtroy thoſe which had offended, but that he would not, vſing mercie towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in the Goſpel, our Lord ſaid to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Thinkeſt thou that I could not now pray my Father, and he would ſend me more then 12. Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels? And notwithſtanding he would not pray for that purpoſe. And his Father would not ſend them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had power to do it to the perſon of his ſonne. And Ieſus Chriſt himſelf could haue letted his enemies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking away his life, but he would not. And the Father (ſaith S. <hi>Paul)</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:19757:59"/>
by his power could haue ſaued him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corporall death. But neuertheleſſe hee would not do the one, nor the other. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Miniſters might ſay, that it was preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yet the ſcripture ſaith expreſly, that he could do it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it had bin preordained. And as touching the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Doctors are glad that the Miniſters do produce it, becauſe it maketh wholy for the truth, againſt the blaſphemy of the Miniſters, who haue omitted many words and ſentences of the ſaid <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which ſerued to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of their error: as by the text here inſerted, may be eaſily iudged. <hi>Nihil Deo difficile.

Etenim poſſe, velle eſt, &amp; non poſſe, nolle.</hi> Nothing is vnpoſſible to God: who knoweth not this? And things vnpoſſible to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are poſſible to God: who is ignorant hereof? And God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe. Therefore ſay the heretikes (namely the Monarchians) it was not hard for God himſelf to make both the Father and the ſonne, againſt the preſcribed forme in humane things. For the barren to bring foorth againſt nature: as alſo a Virgin, was nothing hard vnto God. Truly for God there is nothing too hard.</p>
               <p>But if in our preſumption we ſo abruptly vſe this ſentence,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19757:60"/>
wee may faigne euerie thing to be of God: as though hee will do, becauſe he can doo. We muſt not beleeue, becauſe hee can doo all things, that therefore hee hath done what he hath not done: but wee muſt ſeeke if hee haue done it. God could (I am ſure) haue formed man to flye with wings, (as he hath appointed the kytes) he hath not forthwith done it becauſe he could. He could preſently cut off both <hi>Praxea,</hi> and likewiſe all heretikes together: yet hath he not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe he could. For it behoued there ſhould be both kytes and heretikes: It behoued alſo the Father to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. By this reaſon ſhall ſomething be too hard for God, namely that which he will not do: not becauſe hee cannot, but becauſe he will not. For to be able, is to will: and not to be able, is not to will. By which text it is eaſily ſeene, that according to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> God can do many things which he will not do: as he can make a man to flye, and doth it not: deſtroy heretikes; neuertheleſſe he deſtroyeth them not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not, all that he may doo.</p>
               <p>And touching the concluſion which the Miniſters draw from the ſaid place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (to wit) that the power of God is his will: and his weakeneſſe is likewiſe his vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe: The Miniſters ſhewe, that they haue not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the vnderſtanding of that place. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> of his owne iudgement ſaith it not; (ſo ſhould he haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt what hee had ſaid before) but hee inferreth the ſame againſt the Monarchian heretikes, which ſaid: That what God could, he would do, and it was done. And for this reaſon <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludeth againſt them: that it behoued whatſoeuer God had not done, was to him hard and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So that (after theſe heretikes) it was all one to be done, and to haue power to do it. And not to be done, as much as to be impoſſible to God. And hereof inferreth <hi>Tertullian,</hi> would follow, that the power, and the will, and the act of God, ſhould be all one. And contrariwiſe, that a thing not to be done, and to be impoſſible for God to do it, ſhould be all one: and ſo the power of God, and his wil, all one. And his weakneſſe, &amp; his vnwillingneſſe be likewiſe all one. Which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19757:60"/>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludeth for an abſurd thing, proceeding from the opinion of the ſaid Monarchians heretikes, and not of his owne iudgement, which was altogether contrarie. Wherein it appeareth, that the opinion of the Miniſters, is like to that of the Monarchian heretikes, refuted by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi> And that the Miniſters maintaine ſuch an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is euident by that which is contained in the fift blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
               <p>The Doctors for concluſion againſt the ſaid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, do ſhewe that God can do much more then he will do, and then he hath eſtabliſhed in the order of the world. For otherwiſe, other blaſphemies would yet enſue: namely, that the power of God ſhould not be infinite, but limited. Alſo that all things of neceſſitie ſhould bee done in this world, becauſe God could not but maintaine the eſtabliſhed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the world. Which <hi>Caluin</hi> himſelfe deteſteth, ſaying: That God of his omnipotencie, changeth and altereth the order eſtabliſhed (as ſeemeth beſt vnto him) and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to thinke, were to limit his power and prouidence. Where the Miniſters ſay in their ſaid former article, that the auncient Doctors of the Church haue denied the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of God: it is a manifeſt falſhood, and they wrong them greatly. For denie it they doo not, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the ſcripture, which ſeemeth to denie it: and giue to vnderſtand, how it ought to be taken. So that, ſo farre off is it, that by this ſcripture well vnderſtood, exception may bee giuen againſt the omnipotencie of God; that contrariwiſe the ſame is confirmed: as ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the fift booke, and tenth Chapter of the Citie of God. The power of God (ſaith hee) is nothing diminiſhed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee ſaid, that hee cannot die, nor bee deceiued: for ſuch things he cannot do: becauſe, that could he do them, his power ſhould thereby be leſſened. And concludeth, that ſuch things which be of infirmitie he cannot do, beccauſe he is almightie.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters in the end of the firſt article, vſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit towards the Doctors, in that they affirme theyr diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19757:61"/>
to be, becauſe the Doctors maintaine, that a body is in many places, for as much as God can ſo cauſe it to bee: and that the Miniſters on the other part hold, that it is not in the power of God to do it, becauſe hee will not doo it. The Doctors doo ſhewe, that they (for their part) neuer ſo concluded for truth, that one true body was in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe God could ſo cauſe it: but that the queſtion was onely to knowe, whether God could doo it, to come afterwards by order, to proue by ſcripture that hee would doo it. And they haue alreadie heretofore cyted the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Supper and Aſcention. And further added the doctrine of <hi>Caluin</hi> touching the ſaid Supper: to ſhewe, that the will of God is, to make one body to be in two places, (as indeed it is) according to the expreſſe word of God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, to this ſelfe-ſame end, the Doctors haue produced the ſcriptures of the cloſed doores: of the birth of our Lord: and of the reſurrection through the ſtone: which are made like: and by the ſame reaſon, to that of a body in many places. The Miniſters on the contrary part, to denie the wil of God, and depraue the holy ſcriptures (which declareth the will of God to be ſuch, that one body be in two places) alledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more inſtantly, then the impoſſibilitie for God to doo this.</p>
               <p>Now, to the end that all the world may vnderſtand the preſent difference, betweene the Doctors and Miniſters, the Doctors declare, that no other difference there hath beene hitherto touching this article, then to know whether it be in the power of God, to make one body to be in two places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant or no.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond article, the Doctors ſay, that the Miniſters anſwere not to the purpoſe: for the obiection was not, whether quantitie were an accident of a Mathematicall body, <hi>Aut de praedicamento quantitatis,</hi> as ſpeaketh the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers) but to know whether it were of the eſſence and of neceſſitie to the quantitie of a body, to be circumſcript, and in one piace incloſed. And as touching S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> by the Miniſters alledged, he ſpeaketh expreſly according to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19757:61"/>
proprieties of the diuine and humane natures. And wel ſaith, that the diuine, is in all places, but not the humane: becauſe of it naturall proprietie, it requireth a place certaine. And of this make the Doctors no doubt, according to the ſaid natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proprietie. But the queſtion is, to wit, whether aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the omnipotencie of God, he cannot cauſe one body to be without place, proportionable to it greatneſſe, Which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>de Ianuis clauſis:</hi> not hauing regard to the nature of things, but to the power of God, plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. And the Doctors would deſire the Miniſters to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Epiſtle of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> againſt the doctrine of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> and his Miniſters, for the deſcent of the ſoule of Ieſus Chriſt into hell, as often as they alledge the paſſage of the place of bodies, againſt the power of God, touching the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>In the 3. article the Miniſters are deceiued. For after the ſayings of the Philoſophers, and according to the naturall reaſon of a body (which the Miniſters do follow) <hi>Locus est ſuperficies Corporis continentis.</hi> Place is the ouermoſt part of a containing body. Wherfore it ſhould behoue, that were the high and laſt heauen circumſcript of place, there ſhould be a body aboue the high and firſt heauen, <hi>A quo primum Caelum contineretur. Et ſic in infinitum.</hi> Of which the firſt heauen ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained. And ſo infinit. And moreouer the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters anſwer not to the other obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this article.</p>
               <p>And as touching the paſſages of ſcripture, which they alledge to proue that there are toomthes &amp; places aboue all the heauens, they captiouſly conclude, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

now are: but incomprehenſible and vnimaginable places, where bodies and ſpirits indifferently are, without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their greatneſſe, of certaine ſpaces and places corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. And in ſuch places, the Miniſters rule is falſe, by which they maintaine, that a body cannot be in one place, if it bee not as ſpacious, as the greatneſſe of the body. Moreouer the Doctors ſay, that it is the manner of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, to interpret the ſcriptures ſpiritually, when they are litterally to bee taken: and contrariwiſe, to expound according to the letter, that which ſpiritually and by figure ought to bee vnderſtood. As the Miniſters doo expound the houſe of Cod in the other world, litterally and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, wherein there are ſpaces, and corporall habitations, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſeperate one from an other: albeit it ought to bee ſpiritually vnderſtood, for the diuerſitie of degrees of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Doctors cannot omit, a manifeſt contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Miniſters in this ſelfe-ſame article: wherein they pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end, that the bodies and ſoules of the bleſſed, are lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged aboue all the heauens. And yet they place the body of Ieſus Chriſt within the heauen.</p>
               <p>And touching the alledged article, condemned by the facultie of diuinitie at <hi>Paris:</hi> the Doctors anſwere, that the Miniſters do ordinarily alledge authorities, pared, or euilly applied: For the Article ſaith, that the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> hauing called the Facultie, condemned all thoſe, which would place two diſtinct heauens: one for the Angels, the other for the ſoules of men. Which nothing pertaineth to the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters in the fourth article do charge the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who neuer attribute the proprietie of God to any creature: but haue often heretofore ſaid, that to bee euerie where, and incircumſcript, was not naturall to any creatures, but to God alone. And the Authors by the Miniſters alledged (as Saint <hi>Baſil, Didimus,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilius,</hi> ſpeake no otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the proprietie of nature, to be euery where, or not. And yet they neuer denie, but it is in Gods power
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19757:62"/>
to cauſe one creature or body, aboue it nature, to be in two, or many places: but (as aforeſaid) when they come to the power of God, many of the olde authors confeſſe, that it is poſſible with God, and that hee hath done the ſame in the Sacrament: the anſwere of the Miniſters is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to no purpoſe. For the whole contention is of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, and not of naturall proprieties.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters in the fift article haue not well concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the reaſon of the Doctors: who alledge, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are naturally circumſcript, as well as bodies: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by would inferre, that the circumſcription of place ſimply depended not as of the ſole and eſſentiall cauſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of a body: as by all their ſaid reaſons, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters pretend. Albeit the Doctors are not ignorant that to put difference betweene the corporall and ſpirituall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they haue accuſtomed to diſtinguiſh in ſchooles, that the Angels <hi>Sunt diffinitiue in loco,</hi> and the bodies <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriptiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſixt article to ſatisfie the Doctors, who made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they ſhould produce one onely place of the auncient Fathers: where it was ſaid, that it is not in Gods power, to make one body to be in two places. The Miniſters for all the teſtimonies they could haue, do falſly alledge a place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> where it is ſaid (as it is cyted in <hi>Gratian De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecra: diſtinct.</hi> 2. <hi>C. prima quidem)</hi> that the ſaid Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> hath written, that it behoued the body of Ieſus to be in one place: wherevnto ſay the Doctors, that it is not ſo couched in the proper text of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> which is in the 30. tract vpon Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> For ſuch is the tenour in all the auncient copies of S. <hi>Augustine: Corpus domini, in quo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrexit, vno loco eſſe potest, veritas eius vbi<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> diffuſa est.</hi> The body of the Lord, in which he roſe againe, may be in one place, his truth is ſhead into euerie place. Where is not this word <hi>[Oportet]</hi> as the Miniſters cyte it, hauing taken the ſame out of <hi>Gratian.</hi> And that men may knowe there is no great truſt to be giuen to the fragments of <hi>Gratian,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recourſe to the copies of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in the tytle
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19757:63"/>
of <hi>Canon,</hi> theſe words are there extracted out of the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> vpon the 54 Pſalme. From whence hee draweth the onely beginning of his Canon: and yet doth he not truly cyte it. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt of the ſaid Canon, is taken from diuers paſſages of S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> And although there ſhould bee <hi>Oportat.</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaketh after his wonted manner, according to the proprietie of a body, oppoſing the diuinitie to the humanitie: without touching the operation of Gods omnipotencie. Whereof when he maketh mention, and that he ſpeaketh of the Sacrament, he plainly affirmeth, the body of Ieſus Chriſt to be in diuers places; by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of God. As the Doctors hope in their reſolution to deduce as well out of him, as other auncients alſo.</p>
               <p>The 8. artide containeth many errors, againſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie and truth. Firſt, becauſe the Miniſters make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betweene the body they cab Mathematicall (to wit, hauing dimenſion of breadth, length, and height) and the Phiſicall or naturall body: to wit, which is compoſed of a ſubſtantiall forme and matter: by the vnion whereof, it is made a naturall &amp; ſubſtantiall body. Secondly, although the body ſhould bee without quantitie, yet ſhould it differ from our ſoules ſeperated, which bee not materiall ſubſtances: and conſequently ſhould it alſo differ from the Angells and ſpirits. Thirdly, the Miniſters by the concluſion of this article, doo manifeſtly declare, that they acknowledge not any ſubſtantiall body. And where they ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God might ſeperate the dimenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from a ſubſtance, without corrupting the ſame, that ſuch ſubſtance ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſpiritually, as the Angels, they are deceiued. For ſuch ſubſtance ſhould not remaine immateriall, as are our ſoules, and the Angels which be not capable of dimenſions: and therefore ſhould it yet bee different from Angels and our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ninth article, the Miniſters anſwere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. For the Doctors ſay not, that the maſſineſſe and waight bee eſſentiall in a body, but to preſſe downeward, is eſſentiall to the ſadneſſe and waight of a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19757:63"/>
body. And by their obiection they demaunded to knowe, whether an earthly and maſſy body, abiding in it ſubſtance and natural waight, might not by the omnipotencie of God, be hanged in the ayre, without falling downward, albeit it were againſt it nature and inclination,</p>
               <p>Moreouer, for anſwere to many articles which concerne the act of two bodies in one place, and the paſſages of holy ſcripture, and auncient Authors produced by the Doctors, (to proue that it was in Gods power to cauſe two bodies to bee in one onely place: and contrariwiſe, that by the ſame reaſon it was in the ſame power, to cauſe one body to bee in two places). Firſt the Doctors ſay, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doo wrong, to denie this conſequence. Two bodies by the power of God, may be in one ſelfe-ſame place. Then on the contrarie part, one body may be in two places, by the ſelfe-ſame power. For as great repugnancie there is to Gods eſtabliſhed order, in the one, as in the other: and as great contradiction in nature, founded vppon one ſelfe-ſame cauſe and reaſon: to wit, in the limitation, and circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a body. Which as it is naturall to be in place, ſo is it naturall for it, to bee in place proportioned and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it meaſures. And if for the number of diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where a body ſhould bee, one may inferre, that it ſhould no more bee a body (as implying contradiction) by the ſame reaſon, according to one onely place, where many bodies ſhould bee, may alſo bee inferred, that they ſhould no more be many bodies: or that many bodies ſhould be one. Which would imply the contradiction as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>And where the Miniſters denie the antecedent, which is, that two bodies may bee in one place, the Doctors to proue it, haue produced the paſſages of ſcripture, of the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed doores: the birth of the body of our Lord of the Virgin: the going out of the Sepulchre: the paſſage of a Camell through the eye of a needle: and the piercing of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens made by Chriſt in his aſcention.</p>
               <p>And for as much as the Miniſters denie theſe actes,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19757:64"/>
contained expreſly in holy ſcripture, and expounded by the auncient Chriſtians, and depraue the ſame at their pleaſure. The Doctors eſtſoones vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the texts of ſcripture do ſay as followeth. Firſt as touching the cloſed doores, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: That Ieſus came, meaning into the place where his Diſciples were. But hee came not there without entering thereinto. For to bee found in the middeſt of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring, there ſhould bee a much greater myracle, then that hee entred there ſimply. Secondly it is ſaid, <hi>Cum fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res eſſent clauſa,</hi> or <hi>Ianuis clauſis.</hi> To wit, that hee there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the doores beeing ſhut. And there is no apparance that the ſcripture maketh mention of doores, rather then an other place, were it not to ſhewe the place by which hee entred. Thirdly, it is added not in vaine, that the doores were ſhut, without ſaying that any opening was myracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly made. For it is alwaies ſaid, <hi>Quod venit Ianuis clauſis.</hi> That hee came the doores beeing ſhut. And were it true, that the doores had bin opened by diuine power, this ſhould be falſe, that our Lord entred, <hi>Ianuis clauſis,</hi> for hee ſhould haue entered <hi>Ianuis apertis,</hi> howſoeuer they had bene ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>And to ſhewe, that the common conſent of all the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes haue bene, that Ieſus entered therein by the cloſed doores, the Doctors ſet forth foure foundations, drawne from the auncient Fathers. The firſt is, that all expreſly confeſſe the myracle of ſuch an entrie to haue bene wrought in the body of Ieſus Chriſt. The ſecond is, that ſuch my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was there wrought by the power of God, aboue the nature of a body. The third is, that the Fathers eſpecially iudge, that herein conſiſteth the myracle, that the body paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed through the cloſed doores: and that ſo it was with an other body. And for the fourth ground, they adde, that the Apoſtles by reaſon of ſuch entring, ſuppoſed that the body of Ieſus Chriſt was not a true body, but a ſpirit, or vaine viſion: which the Miniſters lightly paſſe ouer, without any anſwere. Now ſo it is, that if by the power of God (as the Miniſters will haue it) an opening was made of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19757:64"/>
the doores, or any other part of the houſe, to giue entrie to the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: then the myracle did not conſiſt in the ſaid body, but in the doores, or other part of the houſe, which was open: and nothing had beene there againſt the nature of the bodie of our Lorde: for it is not repugnant to any bodie whatſoeuer, to enter by an opening made by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Bee it, that <hi>Iustine</hi> was not Author of the queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gentiles; yet can they not deny, but they are of ſome auncient Chriſtian, of the Primitiue Church. And the Doctors haue attributed them to him, in whoſe name they are intituled. And ſo much there is, that the ſaid <hi>Iustine</hi> in the place alledged, layeth the myracle to haue bene done in the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: which (being groſſe and thick) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through the cloſed doores by the power of God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of a bodie. And therefore the Apoſtles ſuppoſed it a viſion: by reaſon of the entrie made without opening, as ſpirites doo wontedly enter. Let the text be ſeene.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hillary</hi> ſaith not only, that he there entered in what ſort ſoeuer it were, by the omnipotencie of God, (as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters will wreſt his authoritie) but as if he had now to deale with the ſaid Miniſters, hee repulſeth &amp; mocketh at all their euaſions and ſubtilties, which vpon this act they imagined. Nothing (ſaith he) gaue place, to open to ſuch a bodie, and that it loſt nothing of it ſubſtance: nor by it entry was ought diminiſhed. He addeth: That the doores and clefts were ſhut, and faſt barred. And in this neuertheleſſe lyeth the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that the true naturall bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, contrary to nature, by the omnipotencie of God entered into a houſe, cloſe and couert, without any opening: wherein hee plainly ſheweth, that the myracle conſiſteth in the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt. And for this let the text be viewed, which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors wiſh to be well examined by the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in the place cyted ſaith: That S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was abaſhed, ſeeing the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt to enter, <hi>Per in via ſepta corporibus. Et quod natura corporea per impenitrabile cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19757:65"/>
ſeſe infuderit inuiſibili aditu.</hi> Through cloſures impaſſable for bodies: And that the corporeall nature powred it ſelfe by an inuiſible meane through an impenitrable bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Chriſoſtome <hi>in the Homely of S.</hi> Iohn Baptist, <hi>and in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon the Goſpell of S.</hi> Iohn, <hi>expreſly ſaith:</hi> Qui intrauit per ostia clauſa, non erat phantaſma, non erat ſpiritus, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re corpus erat. Quid enim dicit? Respicite &amp; videte: quia ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus carnem &amp; oſſa non habet, quae me habere videtis. Habebat carnes, habebat &amp; oſſa, &amp; clauſa erant omnia. Quomodo clauſis octijs intrauerunt oſſa &amp; caro? Clauſa ſunt omnia &amp; intrat, que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intrantem non vidimus. Neſcis quomodo factum ſit, &amp; das hoc po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae Dei.</p>
               <p>He that entred through the cloſed doores, was not a vain viſion, was not a ſpirit, it was truly a bodie. For what ſaith he? Behold and ſee: For a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as you ſee me haue. Hee had fleſh, hee had alſo bones, and all thinges were ſhut. How entered bones and fleſh, the doores being ſhut? All thinges are ſhut, and hee ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth whome wee ſee not entering. How it is done thou knoweſt not, and attributeth this to the power of God.</p>
               <p>Where S. <hi>Chriſostome</hi> without difficultie, as doth alſo S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> acknowledgeth the myracle to haue bin wrought in the body of Ieſus Chriſt; in that hee paſſed through the ſhut doores, by the omnipotencie of God.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in the places quoted by the Doctors manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writeth: that the body pierced the cloſed doores, euen as the Poets recount that the fight of <hi>Linceus</hi> pierced the walls, to ſee through without opening. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> then reaſoned of the nature of a bodie, which the Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the hereſie of <hi>Origen)</hi> held not to bee truly in Ieſus Chriſt after his reſurrection: becauſe contrary to the nature of a bodie, he had paſſed through the cloſed doores: wherein Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> (as the other Auncients) declareth: that it nothing derogateth from the nature of the bodie: becauſe it proceeded from a ſupernaturall power.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt Booke againſt <hi>Iouinian</hi> hee ſaieth as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19757:65"/>
much: where he vſeth theſe words: Ieſus entered through the cloſed doores. <hi>Quod humanorum corporum natura non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur.</hi> Which thing, the nature of humane bodies admitteth not. So that with others, he placeth the myracle in the body of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in three places (at the leaſt) maketh expreſſe mention, that this body paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the ſhut doores: and that this was done by the power of God, aboue the nature of bodies: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heretikes ought not to denie the true bodie of Ieſus Chriſt: beſides the paſſages <hi>De agone Chriſtiano,</hi> and of the Epiſtle <hi>Ad voluſianum,</hi> alreadie alledged in the booke <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitate Dei,</hi> he ſaith ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the firſt booke, vpon the 20. Hereſie, and in the 2. booke, vpon the 64. Hereſie, againſt the <hi>Origeniſts,</hi> declareth that it is but a ſpirituall body: to wit, which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth nothing of it corporall ſubſtance: but changeth &amp; get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth new qualities and ſpirituall perfections, and meete for ſpirites: as to paſſe through the walles without opening. And giueth example of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, which pierced and paſſed through the cloſed doores after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And euen ſo iudgeth (as others do) the myracle to haue bene wrought in the body of Ieſus Chriſt: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he pierced the ſhut doores, as a ſpirit, albeit hee were a true body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cirillus Alexandrinus</hi> determineth alſo (as the others) this myracle to haue hapned in the body of our Lord; which by the like myracle, walked vpon the waters, againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a body, by the power of God; and reproueth all them, which ought ſuſpected by this deed, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt was not naturall.</p>
               <p>By all theſe authorities, the foure grounds propoſed, are true. And therefore to corrupt the intention and faith of ſo many Auncientes and learned Chriſtians, to bring in a confuſion of new Interpretations, is ouer-great impudencie. For beſides the diuerſitie of <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> the Miniſters to that ende produce two others:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19757:66"/>
to wit, that the Angell opened the doore: as though Ieſus had not power himſelfe to open it, or elſe had need of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And the other is, that the opening was made which way he pleaſed. And by ſuch diuerſities, the Miniſters ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that they know not where to reſt. And (which is worſe) they could not alledge one only auncient Father, for author of their fictions, or that is contrary to all the others, from the Primitiue Church. And to alledge, that the Iron gate (in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles opened to S. <hi>Peter</hi> of it own accord, ſerueth nothing to the purpoſe: For the Doctors ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer denied the ſame: but haue well ſaide, that the ſcripture ſpake not of the gates of the priſon: and if at the entry of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the doores had beene ſo opened, the Euangeliſt had as eaſily ſaid it, as he ſaid they were ſhut; and as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that the Iron gate was opened of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but peruerſe ſpirits, which doubted of the truth of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt in this world, were not of opinion touching the paſſage of the doores, with other Chriſtians. And although they thought to helpe and aide themſelues herewith, to ſupport their hereſies (as of all the other myracles hapned to the body of our Lorde aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) the Fathers neuertheleſſe haue not denied this, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſemblable acts: for feare to giue heretikes occaſion of error. But haue declared and diſtinguiſhed what was of the nature of the ſaid bodie, and what came vnto it by the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of God. And the Chriſtians (for hereſies) neuer abandoned the truth: albeit heretikes thereby haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abuſed the ſame. Sith then the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt paſſed through the doores without opening; ſure it is, that two bodies haue bene, and may be in one ſelfe ſame place. And hereby haue the Doctors well proued their propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which without ſcripture, or teſtimony of any Father, the Miniſters deny.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Birth of Ieſus Chriſt without fraction of the virgin, the Doctors ſay, that many of the Auncients pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the paſſage of the doores, haue alſo held, that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to haue bene wrought in the bodie of our Lord, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19757:66"/>
not in the bodie of the virgin, but in as much as ſhe remained in her pureneſſe, without fracture or opening. And for their reaſon, the Fathers haue alledged the ſcripture: <hi>Exce virgo concipiet &amp; pariet.</hi> Behold a virgin ſhall conceaue and bring forth. And out of Ezechiel: <hi>Porta haec clauſa erit.</hi> This gate ſhall be ſhut. As reciceth S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in the 80. Epiſtle, where a Councell is conteined, wherein S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was preſent: which determined againſt <hi>Iouinian</hi> and other heretikes, that the virginitie and puritie remained in her child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>birth, to the mother of God. Which thing S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Doctors in the firſt booke, and 2. Chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iulian,</hi> repeateth. And where the Miniſters ſay, that the virgin had not loſt her virginitie, when our Lorde was borne as other men: in that they are condemned of hereſie by the Fathers: which declare <hi>Iouinian</hi> to derogate her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, for the like opinion as the Miniſters do hold. Of whom the Doctors would willingly demaund, what myracle they acknowledge in the birth of our Lord, touching his bodie, and the virginitie of his mother, if he departed from her, as other childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their mothers, as the Miniſters do write. And as touching that which they alledge of <hi>Tertullian, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and S. <hi>Ierome;</hi> the Doctors ſay: that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian &amp; Origen</hi> held ſuch an hereſie, and many others, which were reproued before <hi>Iouinian.</hi> And for this, were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him and his conſorts. And for S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it is euident, that he beleeued the contrary; as well by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell where he was preſent: as by that which he wrote in the booke <hi>De Institutione <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginis.</hi> And therefore, where hee ſaith: that <hi>Christus vuluam aperuerit,</hi> it muſt be interpreted, not that it was by rupture or fraction, but by effect of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and production of his true bodie, out of the wombe of the virgin, by myracle and ſupernaturall power. So that, as the conception was myraculous, ſo was his birth: <hi>Et ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire vuluam,</hi> is a phraſe and maner of ſpeaking in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to call and nominate the firſt borne: howſoeuer he had power to be borne. And as touching S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> he ſpeaketh nothing of the fracture, but only that the bodie iſlued out
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19757:67"/>
bloodie, as it was in the wombe of his mother: and to bee bloodie, there is no neceſſitie of fracture of the mother.</p>
               <p>The Doctors for concluſion of this article, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly demaund of the Miniſters, whether they hold for an article of faith, the virginitie of the mother after the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth: &amp; whether they could proue the ſame by the expreſſe and vnreproueable word of God written. For as much as <hi>Beza</hi> when hee pleaſeth, maketh doubt of theſe two points: and that the pretended reformed religion among the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, of his diuers imprinted confeſſions, recyteth ſometimes the virginitie of the mother of God after her child-birth, and ſometimes omitteth the ſame. And in ſome confeſſions inſerteth not that Ieſus was borne of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> but onely that hee iſſued of the ſeede of <hi>Danid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctors employ for the reſurrection, and iſſuing out of the body of Ieſus Chriſt through the ſtone of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, the moſt part of the authorities alledged by them vpon the cloſed doores: as the whole lecture of the foreſaid authorities, with <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene,</hi> in his tragedie of the paſſion of our Lord, will witneſſe: which conioyneth (as do many other Auncients) theſe three myracles happened into the body of our Sauiour aboue nature: namely the birth without fracture of the Virgin: the reſurrection through the ſtone: and the entrance by the cloſed doores.</p>
               <p>The Doctors adde, that <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſay as doo the Miniſters, that our Lord aroſe not, the Sepulchre beeing ſhut and cloſed: and rather had the ſaid <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> fall into friuolous abfurdities, and ridicclous expoſitions here afore alledged, then yeeld to the opinion of the Miniſters. Becauſe there is more appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the text of the Goſpell, that Ieſus Chriſt was riſen before the ſtone was rowled away by the Angell: as therein agree the moſt part of auncient Chriſtians. And by this meane alſo is there occaſion giuen, more eaſily to beleeue the reſurrection of our Sauiour, then if the ſtone had beene taken away before the reſurrection. For one might more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19757:67"/>
eaſily ſay, that the body had bene tranſported and not riſen againe. And the text ſaith not, that the Angell rowled away the ſtone before the reſurrection, or when Ieſus aroſe, but rather afterwards: as there is great apparance in the ſcripture, in reaſon, and all antiquitie.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> is euilly alledged by the Miniſters, which well knowe to conceale what is written in the Epiſtle by them cyted, touching the cloſed doores. And they euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledge that of the reſurrection. For it is not ſaid, that our Lord aroſe after the ſtone was rowled from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. But well is it ſaid againſt the Fantaſmatiques, that the ſubſtance put vpon the Croſſe, and that which reſted in the Sepulchre, and that which aroſe the third day (the ſtone of the graue beeing rowled away) is the true fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By which words, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> meaneth not to ſay, that our Lord was not riſen, before the ſtone was remoued: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt riſen againe; was a true, and not a phantaſtike body: of whoſe reſurrection it appeared by the opening of the graue. And ſuch is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interpretation of old Authors touching the remouing of the ſtone.</p>
               <p>For concluſion of all theſe auncient teſtimonies, the Doctors are abaſhed that the Miniſters (ſeeing them ſo manifeſt, and themſelues conuinced, that God cannot only cauſe two bodies to bee in one ſelfe-ſame place, but that hee hath alſo done the ſame) dare ſlaunderouſlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue the vnderſtanding of them, which euerie man of good and ſound iudgement, can by the onely reading finde out.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Miniſters ſay, that the reaſons taken from ſuch and ſo euident teſtimonies, be impertinent. So that wiah like libertie (common to heretikes) they feare not, without any text of ſcripture, or any place of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, to interpret, that two bodies to pierce one an other, is no other thing, then one body to giue place to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:19757:68"/>
Of which falſe and licencious interpretation, the common phraſe of ſpeech among Philoſophers themſelues doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them. And the feat example brought of them which walke through the aire beating vpon them, and of Birdes when they flye, is ouer ſubtill. And whereas they boaſt in the ſaid article, that in denying that two bodies may be in one place by the omnipotencie of God, or one bodie in two places, they aduance and magnifie the power of God. As true is that, as when in all their other errors, by which they reſiſt the truth of God, and blaſpheme him, they euer boaſt to aduance the glorie of God. And the Miniſters muſt paint and couer their filthineſſe and deformitie, with ſome colour of ſpeech, to blinde the ſimple and ignorant.</p>
               <p>Good reaſon alſo haue the Miniſters not to excuſe the interpretations of <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as too too friuolous and ridiculous: and preferre in the meane time their owne inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, though more ridiculous then thoſe of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: wherein appeareth the concorde betweene the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Diſciples; all vſing one foundation of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is, to truſt alwayes to their owne particular and priuate interpretation, and inſpiration: and to preferre the ſame to all others. Where the Miniſters ſay, that the bodie of our Lord was not inuiſible to the Diſciples, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made in the 24. of <hi>Luke:</hi> but that his bodie only being nimble, he ſuddainly withdrew himſelfe: the Doctors ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that the ſuddaine departing (whereof ſpeaketh S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and <hi>Lyra,)</hi> maketh not, but that the bodie was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: as ſignifieth the Greeke word <hi>Aphantos:</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, not a ſuddaine departure, but an incapacitie to be ſeene and knowne. And ſo the text of the ſcripture is plainly for the Doctors. Ioyned neuertheleſſe, that when the olde and late Diuines wil giue examples that Ieſus was made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, they ordinarily alledge this paſſage.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters alſo who boaſt, that they reſt vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the pure word of God, (for expoſition of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) bring their dreames, aboue their owne perſwaſion; as touching the cloſed doores appeareth. And with like libertie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19757:68"/>
vſe they to expound the text of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which expreſly maintaineth, that our Lord pierced the heauens. And it is likely (ſay they) that the heauens claue a ſunder, and were opened. And if one demaund, whence they learned ſuch an interpretation, they anſwere, from the word of God, founded vpon their inward inſpiration: by which, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate that which is written in Saint <hi>Mathew;</hi> that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were opened when the Doue deſcended vpon our Lord. As though all the heauens were cleſt aſunder, and the holy Ghoſt had not power to deſcend without the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them: not nothing that the ſcripture in many places taketh heauen for the ayre.</p>
               <p>Concerning that they alledge of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who when he was ſtoned, ſawe the heauens open, more meete it were for the Miniſters, to interpret ſuch viſions, to bee made in ſpirit, as there is great likelyhood: elſe ſhould it behoue to confeſſe two myracles: the one in the diuiſion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: the other in this, that the ſight of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pierced vnto, but alſo aboue the heauens: where the Miniſters confeſſe, the body of Ieſus Chriſt to bee at the right hand of the Father, whom Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> ſawe, which is againſt the order of God eſtabliſhed in the wold: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is neceſſarie that there be a certaine diſtance betweene the eye ſeeing, and the thing which is ſeene. And no leſſe hard is it, that ſuch thing bee done, then that two bodies ſhould pierce one an other. Nor muſt they forget that the ſcriptures oftentimes in ſpirituall apparitions and viſions, vſeth this phraſe of ſpeech, that the heauens were opened: and yet in ſuch caſe was there but a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall viſion, and likewiſe but a ſpirituall opening. And euen as the Miniſters will take the rigour of the word [the opening of the heauens]: ſo ſhould they not thinke it ſtraunge if the Doctors with like rigour, take [the piercing of the heauens] eſpecially in the article of the Aſcention: where the queſtion is of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, which had alreadie pierced more impenitrable bodies then the heauens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:19757:69"/>
And the Doctors to auoyd tediouſneſſe, referre themſelues to more ample debating this point [of the piercing of the heauen] hereafter.</p>
               <p>As touching the 28. article, where the Miniſters againſt expreſſe ſcripture, do obſtinately defend, that God cannot by his power, make a Camell (or Cable) to paſſe through the eye of a needle: the Doctors cannot ſufficiently ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uel, either at the blindneſſe of the Miniſters, which ſeeme to ſee nothing at noone-day: or at their obſtinacie and boldneſſe. And that the Miniſters vnderſtand not their fault, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors cannot thinke, but that impugning the truth, well knowne to themſelues, they ſinne againſt their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And God ſuffereth that (it ſeemeth) to happen vnto them, in this ſo manifeſt a place and text of the ſcripture: to the end, that by this article, one may perceiue how much more bold they are, to giue falſe ſences, to ſcriptures more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure then this, and to the ſayings of the auncient Chriſtians which make againſt them.</p>
               <p>Now that the great wrong may be vnderſtood, which the Miniſters doo, in denying that our Lord can cauſe a Camell (or Cable) to paſſe through the eye of a needle: the Doctors do obiect, that it ſhould be impoſſible with God to ſaue a rich man: vſing ſuch argument, taken from the text of the Goſpell. More impoſſible or hard is it for God to ſaue a rich man, then to make a Camell (or Cable) to paſſe through the eye of a needle. But God by his omnipotencie cannot make (after the Miniſters) a Camell or Cable to paſſe through the eye of a needle. Therefore God by his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie cannot cauſe a rich man to be ſaued, and enter into the kingdome of heauen. The Maior is of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The Minor is confeſſed by the Miniſters: and the conſequence is neceſſarie. And according to all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, hee that cannot doo a more eaſie thing, cannot doo a thing more hard. So alſo without contradiction haue the Auncients expounded the preſent ſcripture: as doth <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> in the Homily vpon this place, ſaying: that it is poſſible for a Camell to enter through the eye of a needle: yet not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19757:69"/>
poſſible with men, but with God. And the manner how ſuch thing may bee done, is knowne of God, and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and of him to whom hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it.</p>
               <p>Semblably Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in the firſt and fift Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his booke of the ſpirite and letter, thus ſpeaketh to <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> whom hee wrote vnto: It ſeemeth to thee abſurd, when I ſay vnto thee, that a man may bee without ſinne: albeit that (Chriſt excepted) ſuch a one is not founde. Should it ſeeme abſurd vnto thee, that a thing may bee done, whereof no example can bee ſhewed? Seeing thou doubteſt not (as I thinke) but it neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that a Camell paſſed through the eye of a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. And yet is it ſaide, that with God ſuch thing is poſſible.</p>
               <p>By the Miniſters anſwere vnto the 29. article, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bee ſeene, that they deceiue and abuſe their Diſciples, making them beleeue by faire words and writings, that they really receiue in the Supper, the true body of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſame which iſſued from the belly of the Virgin, and was faſtned vpon the Croſſe, for the reſtauration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And wil make them to vnderſtand, that they who place not with the bread and wine in the Sacrament, (as they call it) of the Supper, but ſome ſpirituall effect onely (as are the redemption, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, life eternall, and other gifts, and benefites, which Ieſus Chriſt bringeth to his elect) diminiſh the excellencie and dignitie of the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that they be <hi>Zuinglians.</hi> But that beſides ſuch ſpirituall effects, one muſt beleeue that hee receiueth truly the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Supper.</p>
               <p>They hold neuertheleſſe an other opinion. For when they are preſſed with arguments, and cannot defend ſuch an imaginarie and phantaſtike preſence, they confeſſe by their writings, they are become <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and returne to the ſpirituall preſence of Ieſus Chriſt in the Supper: which is as much to ſay, as beſides the bread and wine, they receiue a certaine ſpirituall effect, and not really
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19757:70"/>
the body, as the Miniſters do in the preſent anſwere: which thing they make manifeſt, by that they cyte of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle S. <hi>Paul:</hi> by which citation may bee gathered, what is their opinion concerning the Supper: to wit, that the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is not really, but by ſpirituall effect onely in the hearts of the faithfull. For the Galathians by the hearing of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, receiued not really the body of Chriſt crucified, but had onely an imagination of the Croſſe and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, and receiued onely the fruite of their faith: that is to ſay, by this meanes they were iuſtified and ſanctified before God: alſo the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Miniſters make of S. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> tendeth to this ende, to ſhewe that in the Supper are receiued ſome ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all effects onely: which neuertheleſſe by theſe words, to embrace the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, to ſucke his bloud, &amp;c. be allegorically ſignified. Wherein they denie (againſt the intent of S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> in the Sermon of the Supper) the reall prefence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. The Doctors confeſſe that the argument they haue made, is addreſſed to <hi>Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and not to <hi>Zuinglians.</hi> And they ſuppoſed that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters would not otherwiſe haue thought of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> and the other Miniſters, renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be Miniſters of the <hi>Caluiniſt</hi> Church, which they call reformed.</p>
               <p>An other maner of ſpeech vſed they, which exhibited the confeſſion touching that Sacrament, to the Biſhops at <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> who freely confeſſed the body of Ieſus Chriſt to bee really preſent in that Sacrament: which the Miniſters in conference with the Doctors, do now denie. And hereby the Miniſters in the iudgement of the Doctors, of <hi>Calueniſts,</hi> become <hi>Almanists.</hi> Wherewithall, they that maintaine the doctrine of the Church, which they call reformed, will not be greatly pleaſed: ſeeing their principall pillars (for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to anſwere an argument obiected by the Doctors) do leaue them in the buſineſſe: conſidering that in the anſwer they ſay themſelues to be ſo much enlightned with the holy ſpirit, which maketh them vnderſtand &amp; know all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:19757:70"/>
Concerninig the article following, they doo openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what their preſent opinion is, touching the preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, by ſaying that the faithfull receiue no more in this time of the Goſpell, then did the Fathers before, and vnder the lawe: But certaine it is, that the Fathers receiued not really the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Ieſus Chriſt, which as then was not made. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion muſt follow, that vnder the Goſpell the body of Ieſus Chriſt is not really receiued in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which the Miniſters call the Sacrament of the Supper.</p>
               <p>To the 31. article they anſwere not: as alſo they neuer could anſwere the ſame: and they muſt neceſſarily confeſſe, that in the power of their faith, they do that which implyeth contradiction. For they maintaine one thing to be preſent, and not preſent, at one ſelfe-ſame time and place. And their ſpirituall (or rather phantaſticke) preſence, maketh nothing to the purpoſe. For (according to their doctrine) the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cannot be preſent but with it meaſures, locally, difinitiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and corporally: otherwiſe the body ſhould be wholly abrogate and corrupted. And the maner of it beeing there ſpiritually, would not make, that the body is not there: or otherwiſe they falſly ſay it is preſent in the Supper, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the world. Wherefore it is neceſſarie, if the body be there (yea ſpiritually) and their doctrine of the nature of a body be true, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt be corporally, difinitiuely, and locally in the Supper. Moreouer, for as much as it is abſent according to their confeſſion: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that it is not there preſent. And to conclude, the Miniſters ſay, that it is there, and not there. And for the full ſolution, (without entering into the principall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) they ſuppoſe to eſcape, by obiecting to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſome words of the breuiarie, which the Doctors haue not yet ſeene. The Miniſters (they thinke) haue found them in ſome breuiarie of Monkes, and remember when they were in the Couent, that they were ſo accuſtomed to ſing and ſay. But although ſuch things were found in the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiaries,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19757:71"/>
vſed in the Romane Church, ſuch maner of ſpeech might be defended, in the ſence which the Fathers haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaid, that the Apoſtles <hi>Conficiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t corpus Chriſti:</hi> do make the body of Chriſt, as the ſcripture it ſelfe ſaith: that they baptiſe, forgiue ſinnes, and ſaue thoſe whom they conuerted: which is meant, as the Miniſters of God. Who of his owne authoritie, and as Maiſter, baptiſeth, forgiueth ſinnes, and iuſtifieth the faithfull perſons.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters do maruell, that the Doctors call faith a humane vertue, (the great and maruellous effects it worketh conſidered): the Doctors ſay, that the Miniſters haue no great cauſe to maruell thereat: ſeeing that euerie worke, in as much as it is in man, and that he therein worketh together with God, is iudged and reputed humane. Alſo the ſcripture calleth the faith of man, the worke of man. The Doctors ſhewe vnto the Miniſters, that after their wonted maner, they dwell alwaies on ſmall things, and leaue that which is principall in the matter: being ignorant (or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ignorance) where lyeth the difficultie of that is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. As they do in their anſwere vpon the argument propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Doctors: whereby they obiect, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by their faith (call they it diuine or humane) may doo more then God can do: wherevnto the Miniſters (without touching the point) do anſwere with ſongs.</p>
               <p>In the 32. article, the Miniſters lightly paſſe ouer many obiectious made them by the Doctors. Whether there bee ſuperfluitie, or repetition in them, or whether they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, let the reader iudge. But for this cauſe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will not ceaſe, to require eftſoones the Miniſters, that they bring ſome paſſage of the ſcripture, to ground that God cannot make one body to be in two places: ſeeing that this conſequence is ouerfooliſh and ridiculous: <hi>God cannot lye.</hi> Therefore can he not make one bodie to be in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For ſo ſhould they make their aſſumption. Now God hath ſaid and ordained, that one body cannot be in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: therefore can he not make it ſo to be. But neuer will they inſtruct by the truth of the Aſſumption or Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19757:71"/>
the contrarie whereof hath bene ſufficiently veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by many teſtimonies of the ſcripture. The Doctors alſo require the Miniſters to produce ſome Father, yea ſome man, euer reputed Catholique, which hath dared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that God could not make one body to be in two places. For full anſwere, the ſaid Miniſters can bring forth none which euer hath vſed ſuch a ſpeech, except S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but by them falſly alledged, both touching the letter, &amp; the ſence of the letter. The Doctors will not ceaſe to beate both into the Miniſters, and alſo all perſons; that there is no place of ſcripture found, nor booke of any auncient Father, that God cannot make one body to be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>Concerning the laſt article, the Doctors haue reſolued to ſhewe by the pure and expreſſe word of God, expounded by common conſent of all antiquitie, that our Lord did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Sacrament and ſacrifice of the Aultar, and will teach the effect and vertue of the Maſſe, according to the inſtitution and ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt. And will make it alſo to be vnderſtood, that the Miniſters haue polluted and defiled the Sacrament by Ieſus Chriſt inſtiruted. And that the Supper which the Miniſters maintaine, is no way the Sacrament, but a prophanation of holy things, containing execrable blaſphemie: whereof the whole world ought to haue horror.</p>

Wherefore, to make their ſlaunders more like to truth: by adding and diminiſhing, they change and alter almoſt the whole meaning of the Miniſters: well knowing, that otherwiſe they could neuer haue meane to ground their ſlaunders, nor to giue any colour or likelihood therevnto: which thing ſhall now appeare by the deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and particular confutation of the pretended blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, obiected to the Miniſters, by the ſaid Doctors.</p>
               <p>Firſt the Doctors accuſe the Miniſters, in that they haue ſaid, that the omnipotencie of God ought not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but by the things onely which bee agreeable to his will, and are not derogate either to his wiſedome, his truth, his nature: nor to the order which hee hath eſtabliſhed in the world. And to verifie their accuſation and ſlaunder, they breake in two this whole ſentence, and take thereof but the laſt part onely, the which they haue ſeperated from thoſe going before, wherewith it was conioyned expreſly by the Miniſters; the more clearely to expound and ſhewe, how the omnipotencie of God ought to be knowne, beleeued, and adored of all the world. Moreouer, they haue not taken, nor vnderſtood the word <hi>[Order]</hi> as doo the Miniſters. Whereby the Miniſters haue willed to ſignifie the eſtate and diſpoſition, which God by his prouidence, and eternall, and vnchangeable will, hath eſtabliſhed, conſerueth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth in all things: rightly to gouerne, and let that no confuſion happen in his workes, euen as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath defined it in his bookes <hi>De Ordine:</hi> and hee himſelfe hath vſed the ſame in the fift booke of his confeſſions. Which the Doctors not vnderſtanding, haue reduced that which the Miniſters thereof ſaid, to the ordinarie and wonted courſe of nature, and to the mouing of creatures which bee in the world.</p>
               <p>And to giue exception to the doctrine aforeſaid, they obiect the myracles which God doth aboue nature: and thereof inferre, that God doth, and can doo many things
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19757:73"/>
againſt the order by him eſtabliſhed and decreed.</p>
               <p>Whervnto the Miniſters anſwer; that myracles, albeit they be done beyond &amp; aboue the ordinary courſe of nature, yet are they not done againſt the order aforeſaid. For as much as all things reduced to the prouidence, and ordinance of God, are well done and ordained, although that the reaſon and order therein, be oftentimes vnknowne to men: which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſi.</hi> 3.</note>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> wrote ſaying: God maketh all things good in their ſeaſon. Wherevnto may be alſo applied, that which is read in the booke of Sentences of S. Auguſtine. <hi>Sent.</hi> 283. and 284. God who is the Creator and conſeruer of nature, doth nothing in his myracles which are againſt nature. And it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that that which is new to cuſtome, is contrary and repugnant to reaſon, &amp;c. If the Doctors will know more thereof, let them reade the two bookes of <hi>Order;</hi> which this holy man compoſed: and that which he wrote concerning myracles, in the fift and ſixt Chapter of his third booke of the <hi>Trinitie.</hi> This anſwere ſhall ſerue for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of two other pretended blaſphemies, which follow in the obiection of the Doctors.</p>
               <p>Concerning the fourth, the Miniſters for anſwer ſay, that the will of God (after the doctrine of Diuines) may in two ſorts be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered: to wit, according to that which by words, ſignes, and effects, is declared to men: and according to that which is reteined &amp; hidden in himſelfe. The one is called the will knowne by ſignes: and the other the will of the good pleaſure of God. For the firſt conſideration the Miniſters do confeſſe (as heeretofore they haue to the Doctors) that God can do many things, which he will not do. But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the other, they ſay: that it is equall to his power: as is alſo his power (in this reſpect) equall to his will. According to which conſideration, the ſentence of <hi>Tertullian</hi> alledged by the Miniſters, and to the Monarchians ill applied by the Doctors, ought to be vnderſtood and expounded: As all thoſe may iudge, which attentiuely ſhall read the paſſage by the Miniſters produced. Who to anſwer one ſlaunder of the ſaid Doctors, which accuſe them to haue wronged the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19757:73"/>
Fathers, in ſaying that they excepted ſome cauſes of the omnipotencie of Cod: are yet conſtrained here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate, that which <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith thereof in the 3. <hi>Dialogues</hi> who writeth as followeth. It muſt not be ſaid without any determination, that all things are poſſible to God. For who ſo abſolutely ſaith this, comprehendeth all things, as well good as bad, which no way ought to be attributed to God: whereby it appeareth, that this good author, and the other, before alledged by the Miniſters, haue not indifferently ſubmitted all things to the power of God: but excepted from the ſame, whatſoeuer is contrary to his will and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, but one meane there is to appeaſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Miniſters, who ſay that it is impoſſible for one body to be in diuers places at one inſtant: and the Doctors, which affirme the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, to wit, that the Doctors (without taking ſo long circuit) looſing ſo many words, and alledging ſo many ſuperfluous things, do proue briefly by one only paſſage of ſcripture, that God willeth the ſame.</p>
               <p>Whether the Miniſters haue well or euilly alledged Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> to proue that a body cannot be without place and meaſures: and alſo whether they haue well or euilly ſaid and defended, that quantitie is eſſentiall to a body, and not accidentall (as hold the Doctors) they leaue the iudgement to the Readers of the Actes of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>Touching that which followeth in the writing of the Doctors: to wit, that there is no place aboue the heauens, that Ieſus Chriſt is not therein compriſed nor conteined, that bodies and ſpirites bee indifferently there, without any diſtinction or diſtance of place: the Miniſters ſay, that touching all theſe points, they rather beleeue the ſcripture, and expreſſe word of God (by them alledged) then all the ſubtilties &amp; ſophiſtries of vaine Philoſophie, which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or others can propoſe. Ioyned herevnto, that it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined &amp; taught in one of the articles of our faith: where it is ſaid; <hi>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he ſhall come to iudge the quick &amp; the dead.</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:19757:74"/>
Wherevpon muſt bee noted, that there is <hi>[Vnde]</hi> an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſignifying place.</p>
               <p>As touching the 4. and 5. articles, to know whether the Miniſters haue ought impoſed vpon the Doctors which is not true, they ſend backe the readers to the precedent confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And alſo to know in what ſence, and to what end, the auncient Fathers haue bene alledged by the ſaid Miniſters; which they may eaſily perceiue by the reading, and diligent obſeruation of the paſſages and ſentences of the ſaid Fathers there inſerted.</p>
               <p>For the 6. article, wherein the Doctors had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their Canons to be falſe, then (accuſing their authoritie) to auouch that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is a true dody, and that to be ſuch, it ought neceſſarily to bee in one certaine place: the Miniſters anſwere, that by the obſeruation of the place of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> (whence the ſaid Canon is taken) it is eaſie to iudge, that the word <hi>[Oportet]</hi> is there much more conuenient, then that of <hi>[Potest].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the 8. article, the Miniſters anſwere, that a ſubſtance is not without quantitie, and whiles it is ſuch, and ſo remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, it cannot any waies be a body. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that of the ſubſtance, and that of the quantitie, are two diuers predicaments: vnder which, one ſelfe-ſame thing, for one ſelfeſame reſpect, cannot be any way compriſed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, Ieſus Chriſt alledged no other reaſon to ſhewe that his body was not a ſpirit, but that hee had members and parts, which in reſpect of their meaſures, might bee handled and touched. Whence it followeth, that without this, a ſubſtance cannot be a body. And as touching the difference which by the Doctors opinion ſhould remaine betweene our ſoules and our bodies exempted from quantitie, (if that were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the Miniſters ſay, that although they were ſubſtances both in number and different, they ſhould neuertheleſſe be like, as touching the kinde: and that the one and the other ſhould be contained vnder the kinde of an incorporeall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters paſſe ouer the 9. article, becauſe it is but a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19757:74"/>
repetition, and that they haue largely anſwered what the Doctors there repeate.</p>
               <p>To the 10. article, the Miniſters anſwere, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof is the queſtion, cannot bee otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Doctors, but by the rule which ſaith: that of one abſurditie may all things be inferred. Moreouer, they complaine of time, which the Doctors make them looſe, by reading ſo many things wherevnto they haue alreadie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and which it ſeemeth they repeate not for any other ende, then to fill vp paper, and to make men thinke they ſay ſomething.</p>
               <p>For firſt the Euangeliſt ſaith not (as the Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) that Ieſus Chriſt entered by the ſhut doores: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he came, the gates beeing ſhut. So that he ſpeaketh nothing there of the maner of his entry, nor how the doores were opened, or other place about the houſe by the which he entered. And all that which the Doctors ſay, cannot be grounded neither vpon the ſcripture, nor vpon any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all the auncient Fathers by them alledged: which bee more againſt them, then with them. And for concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue no other foundation of their ſaying, then their owne coniectures and imaginations, and the falſe interpretations which they giue to the writings of the Fathers. To the faith wherof they would gladly conſtraine &amp; ſubiect the Church: to the end, that hauing laid that foundation, they might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards build therevpon, all the abſurdities and errors they ſhall delight in touching the ſame. And where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe when Chriſt entered the ſhut doores, walked vpon the waters, and went out of the Sepulchre: that ſuch my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were done rather in the perſon, then in the other things. <hi>Iustine</hi> writeth the contrarie, ſaying: that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny change happened, either in his body, or in that of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he made by his diuine power the Sea againſt nature, to ſerue him to walke. As alſo S. <hi>Hillary</hi> to the ſame purpoſe ſaith: That by his power hee made all things paſſeable. Wherevnto likewiſe agreeth S. <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome,</hi> attributing all that to diuine power, and freely confeſſing that hee
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19757:75"/>
knew not the maner and the faſhion thereof. By meanes whereof, the Miniſters are much abaſhed, that the Doctors are ſo preſumptuous to determine a thing which by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fathers hath bene left vndecided: and wherein (as S. <hi>Hillary</hi> ſaith wiſely) ſence and words do faile, &amp; the truth of the deed, exceedeth the capacitie of humane reaſon. How dare then the Doctors ſo boldly ſay, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt paſſed through the doores; that there was penitration of dimenſions; that two bodies were in one ſelfe-ſame place? Seeing that of all that, neither in the ſcripture, nor in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, there is not one onely ſillable: and that (as is ſaid) the Fathers do confeſſe, that their vnderſtanding and ſence were too feeble to comprehend or declare the reaſon of ſuch a my ſterie.</p>
               <p>As touching the birth of Ieſus Chriſt, the Miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues vpon the ſcripture, which ſaith clearly, that the Virgin was with childe, that ſhe brought forth, that ſhee gaue ſucke, and that <hi>Apertaest vulua,</hi> the wombe is opened in the child-birth. They adde, that the ſame doth nought derogate nor preiudice her virginitie and pureneſſe, which conſiſteth in this point onely, that ſhee knew not, not was knowne of any man, Moreouer, they ſay that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the ſame, they follow the ſcripture: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they cannot erre, nor bee heretikes: nor they likewiſe which ſubiect and ſubdue their ſence to the word of God: as in this haue done the Fathers which are by them alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>In the following article propoſed by the Doctors, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner of the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, there is nothing but coniectures, ſlaunders, &amp; repetitions, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſuperfluous, which the Miniſters by their former anſweres haue largely ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>All that which afterwards followeth in the writings of the Doctors, are but iniuries and ſcoffes, in ſtead of reaſons and arguments: which is the laſt recourſe of contentious ſpirits: who ſeeing themſelues deſtitute of reaſon, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to giue place to the truth, defend themſelues by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19757:75"/>
and ſlaunders.</p>
               <p>Some reaſon ſhould the Doctors haue for that which they ſay concerning the word <hi>Aphantos,</hi> if there followed <hi>Autois:</hi> but that which the Euangeliſt ſaith <hi>Ap'auton,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth clearely, that the interpretation of the ſaid place, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> (where vnto the Miniſters agree) is better then that of the Doctors.</p>
               <p>As touching the opening of the heauens, the Miniſters anſwere, that (vſing the language of the ſcripture, which ſaith clearely, that in the baptiſme of Ieſus Chriſt, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were clouen aſunder, and then opned, when S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned) they cannot faile. And to apply to the ayre the ſignification of heauen, is a humane imagination. This alſo ſeemeth, ſhould diminiſh the Maieſtie of God, and of Ieſus Chriſt, who is lifted vp aboue all the heauens, to eſtabliſh ſo lowe as the ayre, the Throne of his Maieſtie. And there is no likelyhood in that which the Doctors ſay, touching the being of two bodies in one ſelfe-ſame place; and that which the Miniſters ſay of the ſight of <hi>Stephen,</hi> which extended euen to the heauens: for as much as the one is a myracle of the power of God in nature, and the other a wonder againſt nature, and the will of God.</p>
               <p>The Doctors in the article following, do falſly impute to the Miniſters, that they affirmed, it was a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God to make a Camell to paſſe through the eye of a needle: for they neuer touched this point in theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer anſweres, but that part of the ſentence onely, where it is ſpoken of rich men. Now to anſwere too, and reſolue their obiections, the Miniſters ſay, that euen as God can ſaue a rich man, by chaunging him, and emptying his heart of ſo much vaine truſt and preſumption, as is therein, and whereof beeing groſſe and filled, hee is vncapeable to enter into the Kingdome of heauen: ſo to him it is alſo eaſie, to make a Camell paſſe through the eye of a needle, hauing circumciſed and pared off the groſſeneſſe thereof, and other things which might hinder the ſame to paſſe. * * * * * *</p>
               <p>

Firſt, that the Supper which is celebrated in the reformed Church, is the true inſtitution and ordinance of the ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, that the end for which it was inſtituted, is to aſſure the faithfull of the true participation which they haue in the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt, crucified for their ſaluation, and in his bloud ſhead for the remiſſion of their ſinnes; and for the confirmation of the new couenant, which God hath made with his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they ſay, that it is neceſſarie that the bread and wine abide in their proper ſubſtance, and that after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: otherwiſe they cannot be Sacraments of the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the Miniſters ſay, that the vnbeleeuers preſenting themſelues at the Supper, by meanes of their vnbeliefe, can there no other thing receiue, then the outward ſignes of bread and wine, and that to their iudgement and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Miniſters on the other ſide propoſe vnto them touching the Maſſe, that ſuch as it is, and now celebrated in the Romance Church, it is nothing but a humane inuention and tradition.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Alſo, that it is a corruption and prophanation, as well of the holy Supper of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as of the true and lawfull vſe thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Alſo, that it is an abuſe of the Prieſthood of Popiſh Prieſts, and that there is no other Prieſthood in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ordained, to get and obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes; nor alſo to make interceſſion, and by prayers and merits to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the fauour of God, then the onely Prieſthood of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> They ſay moreouer, that it is a blaſphemie and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but of the ſacrifice of the Romiſh Prieſts, and that there is no other oblation, then that which Ieſus Chriſt once made with his body vpon the Croſſe; by which the wrath of God could be appeaſed, his iuſtice ſatisfied, ſinners recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, ſinnes pardoned, and the hand-writing of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19757:76"/>
eternall death cancelled and aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Alſo they ſay, that the ſeperation of the Prieſt in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Maſſe, from the reſt of the people, is an aboliſhment of the Communion of the Supper: and conſequently damnable before God.</p>
               <p>And to be briefe, the adoration of bread and wine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> (be it in the Maſſe, or out of the Maſſe) is an intollerable Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Two points yet remaine in the writing of the Doctors, whereof the Miniſters will admoniſh them. The one is, that the ſaid Miniſters haue neuer found in the ſcriptures, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn,</hi> 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.</note>that faith is a humane worke, but that it is the worke of God, and a gift which hee beſtoweth vpon his elect. The other point is, that they confeſſe they cannot bring forth one auncient Author, which hath ſaid in expreſſe termes, that one body could not be in diuers places at one inſtant: for ſo much as the contrarie thereof ſeemed ſo abſurd and ſtraunge vnto them, and ſo much againſt the reaſon and faith which all faithfull people ought to haue, that they neuer thought ſuch an opinion had found place in the heart of any man that was called a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters to ende this anſwere, ſay that it will much more pleaſe them, to handle the queſtions aforeſaid, then to diſpute of the opening of doores, of the Sepulchre, or of the heauens; as to their great griefe, they haue done theſe dayes paſſed: and that for two reaſons. The one, becauſe that the decyding and reſolution of ſuch queſtions, cannot bee drawne nor gathered out of the ſcripture. And the ſecond, becauſe it cannot much ſerue either to the aduancement of the honour and glorie of God, or the edification and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Church.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here the Miniſters ſay, that they doo great wrong to call them blaſphemers, ſeeing thereof they are innocent, as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Naboth,</hi> to whome men falſly imputed ſuch like crime. The Doctors ſay, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therein doo imitate the good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, the Donatiſts: who ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the great iniuries and ſlaunders which they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (ſaid they) of the Catholikes; and yet men know by the hiſtories how it was, and how much they were like to Chriſt, S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Naboth:</hi> as may alſo be knowne the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the ſaid Miniſters, to ſuch holy examples. As much might the Anabaptiſts ſay to them of the Church cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reformed, when they call them heretikes. And as much might and did <hi>Seruetus</hi> ſay, who for his blaſphemies was burned at <hi>Geneua:</hi> reputing himſelfe happie to be iudged by <hi>Caluin</hi> a blaſphemer, and to ſuffer for his doctrine, the paines of death. We muſt not therfore beleeue that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not blaſphemers, becauſe more boldly then all other heretikes, they reiect the name of blaſphemer: but meet it is to examine whether their doctrine importeth blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie or not. Now the Doctors ſay, that there is no blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie worthy of more great execration, then to denie the omnipotencie of God: and no leſſe it is then ſimply to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that there is a God. So that ſuch deniall importes an Atheiſme. For to take from God, that which is proper to his nature, is as much to ſay, as there is no God. As it well pleaſeth S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> writing in one of his Homilies, intituled, <hi>That God is not the Author of euill.</hi> That it is no leſſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie to ſay, that God is author of euill, then to ſay that God is not God. In ſo much as to take away from God
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19757:77"/>
his goodneſſe, which to him is naturall, is wholy to take away his diuinitie. The like alſo may be ſaid of the omnipotencie, that whoſoeuer denieth or diminiſheth the ſame, he denieth alſo his diuinitie.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then is, to knowe whether the Miniſters will aboliſh the omnipotencie of God, not in proper termes (for they ſeeme to confeſſe it) but in affirming that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God is meaſured according to his will, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but that which he will: and other like propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the precedent anſwere of the Miniſters. Whether the Doctors haue proued ſuch propoſitions to containe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies or no, they refer them therin to euery man of ſound iudgement, who ſhalbe any thing conuerſant in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the bookes of auncient Chriſtians: which ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be knowne by the Miniſters friuolous anſweres in their laſt writing to the Doctors obiections. Who nothing maruel that the Miniſters are deceiued in the nature of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, ſeeing they erre in the foundation, and know not wherein it lyeth, and why God is called almightie. For they haue learned of the ſcripture (ſay they) that God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, becauſe hee can doo whatſoeuer he will doo: and that nothing can reſiſt him, which is rather as a ſigne of the power of God. But it is not that (vnder correction) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſteth; for knowledge whereof, it muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to it obiect: that is to ſay, according to the things poſſible to be done: ſo that there is nothing poſſible which God cannot do. Now all without any exception, is eſteemed poſſible, wherein is found no contradiction to be, and not to be: and that commeth not by default of the power of God (which can do all things) but of the repugnancie of the thing which cannot be. Which the Miniſters from the beginning had well ſaid in euery anſwere: but for that they had anſwered vpon ſome Interrogatories that the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of God muſt bee meaſured by his will, ſuppoſing to ſalue that error, they are plunged in many other errors, out of which (for not conſeſſing to haue erred) they cannot rid themſelues, without falling into an infinite number of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19757:78"/>
Moreouer, the Miniſters deceiue themſelues when they will limit the power of God, and not extend it to all things gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that humane ſpirit can conceiue or imagine. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, it is doubtleſſe that the power of God is great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all conceit, and imagination of the humane ſpirit, that it is infinite and incomprehenſible, as ſaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> God can do more then we demaund or vnderſtand. And where the Miniſters ſay, that God onely can doo all things which are not contrarie to his iuſtice, wiſedome, goodneſſe, and truth, and therefore cannot doo generally all things. It hath alreadie beene ſhewed them, that to bee able to doo things contrarie to the iuſtice, wiſedome, goodneſſe, and truth of God, was not power, but weakeneſſe. And by the ſelfe-ſame reaſon (as ſaith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in the place by the Doctors in theyr former obiection alledged) that he cannot do ſuch things, it is an argument of his omnipotencie, and not of reſtraint thereof.</p>
               <p>And where the Miniſters inferre, that becauſe God cannot do ſuch things, he can (by conſequence) do nothing; which is contrarie to his wiſedome, and eternall will, which is, and euer ſhall be, to doo all things well and wiſely, with number, waight, and meaſure, and without that there is any iniuſtice or contradiction in all that which he doth. Men may ſee how the Miniſters diſguiſe the matter in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, concealing haue couched in their former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, touching the order eſtabliſhed in the world, againſt which (ſaid they) God could doo nothing: and the other words of blaſphemie, whereof the Doctors rebuked them, and which they durſt not inſert in their laſt anſwere, becauſe their conſcience accuſed them, and made them know, that ſuch affirmations could not be maintained; and from which, they cannot eſcape, but in denying to haue written them, and in accuſing the Doctors of ſlaunder: as if by adding or diminiſhing, they had altered and chaunged the words of the Miniſters. To be purged of which crime, the Doctors pray, that recourſe be had to their laſt obiection, where theſe words are inſerted in the firſt article.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:19757:78"/>
The which blaſphemies are drawne out of the proper words of the Miniſters firſt article. And the Doctors referre them to the conference may bee made of their laſt writing, with that of the Miniſters. So that if it bee found (as certainly it ſhall be found) that the Doctors haue faithfully cyted the proper words of the Miniſters writing, which the Miniſters themſelues will not auouch; it ſhall be knowne at the leaſt, that the Miniſters haue hitherto maintained blaſphemous propoſitions, and that the Doctors therein haue no way wronged them: hauing pardoned their perſons, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (of the doctrine) to ſay their ſimple opinion.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters to ſhewe that they haue iuſt cauſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Doctors of ſlaunder, ſay firſt that the Doctors haue broken in two their propoſition: which was ſuch, that the omnipotencie of God ought not to be meaſured, but by the things onely which be agreeable to his will, and be not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate either to his wiſedome, truth, nature, or to the order which he hath willed to eſtabliſh in the world: and that the Doctors haue not taken but the laſt part onely. Who for their purgation, ſay that they haue alwaies conſidered what was put in difference: to wit, whether God could make one body to be in two places. And to examine the truth of this queſtion, before they put it in writing, they haue reduced the whole to euery part of the Miniſters propoſition, and haue thus reaſoned. God can do all things which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his will: the which is knowne (as the Miniſters doo hold) when there is nothing that derogateth, either to his wiſedome, his truth, his nature, or the order by him eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the world. Now one body to bee in two places, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogateth not from the wiſedome of God. For God ſhould therefore not leaue to be wiſe. Alſo it derogateth not from his truth: for he hath neuer ſaid, that he could not do it: nor from his nature. For although he ſhould do it, hee ſhould not ceaſe to be God. If then there be any repugnancie, it ſhould be, becauſe it ſhould derogate from the order by God eſtabliſhed in the world. Which was the cauſe that they ſtayed not but on the laſt article. The Miniſters alſo would
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19757:79"/>
not ſay as the Doctors ſuppoſe) that to be able to make one body to be in two places, was a thing repugnant, either to the wiſedome, truth, or nature of God: if not, in that they thinke it to repugne the order by God eſtabliſhed in the world. Ioyned heerevnto, that the Miniſters hauing put this propoſition aboue ſaid, for a rule to knowe what God can doo; when they would apply this rule to the matter in controuerſie, then ſhould they thus ſay: To which things, that which the Doctors put foorth (namely that one body, at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant, may be in diuers places) repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. But the Miniſters haue only ſayd &amp; written, to which, (that is to ſay) order &amp;c. For ſuch relatiue cannot agree, but to the next antecedent. Wherein is clearly ſeene, that the Miniſters runne into the cryme of ſlaunder, which they falſly obiect to the Doctors.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Miniſters ſay, that the Doctors take not the terme of the order eſtabliſhed in the world, in the lyke ſence, as they vnderſtand it: The Doctors ſay, that they haue taken the terme according to the vnderſtanding which the Miniſters haue therof giuen: euen as they haue knowne by their words, which they haue heretofore vſed. For when the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was to ſet forth ſome myracle done by Ieſus Chriſt, againſt, or aboue the nature of things created the Miniſters haue had alwayes recourſe to the common order of nature. As when ſpeech hath bene of the cloſed doores, of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Sepulchre, of the wombe of the virgin, and of one body in diuers places; No other reaſon to contradict it haue the Miniſters alledged, but that it was all againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world, touching the nature of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which cannot be vnderſtood, but of the common order which is ſeene in nature. Therefore the Doctors (ſo taking the ſame, as the Miniſters haue ſufficiently declared in their former anſweres, againſt the order of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) haue well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt the Miniſters, that God could not then do a myracle, againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world. The Doctors know, that the auncient Fathers obſerued not this difference, aboue or againſt nature: as by the teſtimony of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19757:79"/>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> here before alledged, appeareth: Where it is ſaid, that God againſt nature, can make a man flye as well as a byrd. But they will not ſtay vppon the rygor of wordes, but apply themſelues to the Miniſters with whome they conferre. Who call it a worke againſt the order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the world, one body to be in diuers places, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as it withſtanſteth the common diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of bodies. And by ſuch reaſon (ſay the Doctors) that all other myracles ought alſo to be eſteemed againſt the order in the world eſtabliſhed: becauſe they be againſt the common diſpoſition and proprietie of nature.</p>
               <p>And yet following the vnderſtanding which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now giue of the order eſtabliſhed in the world, for the eſtate and diſpoſition which God hath eſtabliſhed, conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and maintaineth all things, by his prouidence and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immutable will, to gouerne all things rightly, and hinder any confuſion to happen to his workes. Here againe do the Miniſters commit a new blaſphemy againſt the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of GOD: for hee can wholly chaunge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge, and deſtroy ſuch order as hee hath eſtabliſhed in the world (albeit hee will neuer do the ſame) and make a new world more perfect then this. And were it ſo, that hee could do nothing againſt this order, his power ſhould be ſtinted and limitted. For hee could not do but certaine effects, according to the order which hee had eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the worlde. Which ſhould not happen by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie of the nature of Creatures: but in as much as God himſelfe ſhould bee tyed. And ſo (againſt the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) ſhould his hand be ſhortened, and his power forced and limitted: From which blaſphemy, infinite others iſſue, as the Doctors when occaſion ſhall ſerue, haue purpoſed to ſhewe.</p>
               <p>To the 2. &amp; third blaſphemies which the Doctors haue noted, the Miniſters ſay, by the new interpretation of the order of the world, in one word they haue fully anſwered. Which (to diſſolue the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts produced by the Doctors) commeth nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:19757:80"/>
And the Miniſters paſſe ouer the alledged places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which declare the blaſphemie, and diſſemble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of their doctrine, and of that of <hi>Caluin,</hi> touching the prouidence of God, in reſpect of the order eſtabliſhed in the world. And the Miniſters anſwere not to the Doctors obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that from the third blaſphemie flow many others; leaſt in confeſſing the ſame, they might heape blaſphemie vpon blaſphemie, and make their doctrine by this meane, odious toall the world.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the fourth blaſphemie, vſe the Miniſters a diſtinction of the will of God, which may two wayes bee conſidered. The firſt is called the will knowne by ſignes: and the other, the will of good pleaſure. The Miniſters confeſſe, that according to the firſt, God can doo more then he will; and not according to the ſecond, which is (as they ſay) equall to the power of God, &amp; is hidden and vnknowne to men. The which diſtinction if it ought to haue place, the Doctors obiect, that the foundation of the Miniſters, wherevpon they ſtay the pretended truth of this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God cannot make one body to bee in diuers places, is wholly deſtroyed. For the Miniſters will haue the power of God to be meaſured according to his will, not according to the ſecond, which is hidden vnto men. It behoueth then, that this be taken according to the firſt, by the which they confeſſe that God can do more then he will do. Whereof it followeth, that the rule by them giuen to meaſure Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, is falſe. For it cannot be meaſured by his will, ſeeing he can do more then he will.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the Doctors ſay, that the Miniſters ſhould not require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to proue that God hath willed that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be in two places, to declare that he could do it. For the Doctors might obiect, that to teach that God may doo ſomething, it needeth not to proue, that he hath formerly willed it. For (according to the Miniſters confeſſion) God can do more then he will.</p>
               <p>The Doctors adde, for as much as the will of God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to vs, but by ſignes, words, and effects: and that the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19757:80"/>
order eſtabliſhed in the world, according to his prouidence (as the Miniſters agree) is hidden vnto men: that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters cannot affirme, and ſhewe, that God hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſuch order in the world, that one body may not bee in diuers places. For meete it were they ſhould teach ſuch an ordinance of God, and declaration of his will. Oft times haue the Miniſters bene required, to bring one onely place of ſcripture, where ſuch a will of God is manifeſt: and where it is ſaid, that hee cannot make one body to bee in diuers places.</p>
               <p>As touching the place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Doctors for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof, refer themſelues to euery man of ſound iudgement: and ſay, that the Miniſters haue ill to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alledged <hi>Theodoret:</hi> and it maketh more againſt them, then with them. For when he writeth that it muſt not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinately ſaid, that God can do all things, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein good and euill; in that he maketh no reſtraint of the omnipotencie of God: but contrariwiſe, doth ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame: in ſo much, that not to be able to do euil things, is both a vertue and power, as before hath beene largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters do inſtant the Doctors to ſhewe, that God hath willed one body to bee in two places: the Doctors anſwere, that theſe are two different queſtions, whether God can do it: or whether he hath willed it. And when it ſhall be confeſſed (as it ought to bee of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) that the power is in God, very eaſie ſhall it be to ſhewe the will, by the word, of the Supper, and of the Aſcention: which they of the pretended reformed religion haue accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to depraue, and diſſwade men from, by the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie which they faigne to bee in God, to put one body in two places.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Doctors leaue it to the readers iudgement, whether S. <hi>Augustine</hi> haue bene cyted by the Miniſters to the purpoſe or no. And to that which concerneth whether ihe quantitie be eſſentiall to a body, or not: the Doctors (ſpeaking of a body as doth Philoſophers, namely, <hi>In predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camento
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19757:81"/>
quantitatis)</hi> haue neuer doubted but it is eſſentiall. But the difficultie is to know, whether to be circumſcript in a place certaine, be eſſentiall to a body? And the Doctors ſuppoſe they haue ſufficiently proued that it is not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but that it is an accident naturall to a body. And they verifie their ſaying, by the definition of a body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all eſſentiall reaſon is compriſed: and ſuch it is, that a body is a kinde of firme quantitie of three dimenſions, length, breadth, and deepeneſſe: where no mention is made of the circumſcription of place in the ſaide defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>What pertaineth to the queſtion concerning places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the heauen, the Miniſters (as they are wont) do light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſe ouer. And for want of good anſwere, they wrong the Doctors, calling them Sophiſters. And that which they bring to confirme that our Lord is in one place aboue the heauen, is ouer friuolous. For by the ſame reaſon might one conclude, that the diuinitie is circumſcript. And Aduerbes ſignifying place, ſhall be found in the ſcripture, when it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the diuinitie, as well as when it ſpeaketh of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters impute to the Doctors that they confeſſe their Canons to be falſe, it is a manifeſt ſlaunder. For the Doctors acknoweldge not any Canons, but in as much as they are taken out of the Councels, &amp; other bookes authenticke: and not according as they are extracted of any particular perſon: as is the polinge of <hi>Gratian:</hi> wherevnto they giue no credit, but as much as that which hee cyteth deſerueth.</p>
               <p>For reſolution of the 8. article, the Doctors ſend the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the ſchoole of Philoſophers, to vnderſtand, that in a predicament of ſubſtance, there is a body, which is a kind of ſubſtance: and in a predicament of quantitie, an other body, which is a kinde of quantitie. And to learne them alſo, that the body which is of quantitie, is accidentall (and not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall) to a body of predicament of ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Miniſters do erre againſt all Philoſophie,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19757:81"/>
calling a materiall ſubſtance, incorporall. But the Doctors will not reſt vppon ſuch things, and are much grieued that they haue not to do with people better grounded in Ppilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie. For that, being ſuch, they could better touch the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then the Miniſters do.</p>
               <p>The Doctors doo maintaine the conſequence of two bodies in one placle, to infer it for neceſſarie, that one body may be in two places: for there is like reaſon, and like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience in the one, as in the other. And therefore if the one be to be done, the other is poſſible: and ſo they referre it to the readers iudgements.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters complaine of the time they haue loſt in reading the reaſons, arguments, and allegations, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cloſed doores, and other articles. The Doctors ſay, that in the matter in queſtion, the Miniſters haue no cauſe to complaine of ouer-great prolixitie, for feare of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time. And that there is matter ſufficient to ſpend the time withall, would they with patience (bringing with them good will, and all paſſion excluded) examine the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Auncients, and reaſons drawne from the ſame. But the Doctors do wel proue, that when there is any thing which preſſeth the Miniſters, then ſet they a good face on the matter, and make ſemblance to haue right on their ſide. Moreouer, the Doctors are much amazed, how the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſo bold to ſay, that <hi>Iustin</hi> and all the Auncients haue not placed the myracle of the paſſage of the doores, in the body of Ieſus Chriſt: ſeeing that <hi>Iustin</hi> expreſly propoſeth the queſtion, how it is poſſible that a thicke bodie is not hindered to paſſe through the cloſed doores. In the anſwere of which queſtion, they conclude the ſame: that for as much as ſuch myracle was done in the nature of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, the Apoſtles eſteemed it was not a true bodie, but a ſpirite: as if the bodie had beene transformed into a ſpirite: which <hi>Iustin</hi> ſaith did not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: but that without any chaunge of nature, ſuch an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to paſſe through the cloſed doore, was giuen to the body of Ieſus Chriſt by the omnipotencie of God:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19757:82"/>
and <hi>Iustin</hi> ſaith not, that any myracle was wrought in the ſea, when Ieſus walked therevpon: but that by the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe which was in him, he made it walkeable, without any chaunge of the nature, either of his body, or of the ſea: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the myracle were in his body, which againſt it nature ſo walked. It is not ſufficient to alledge out of S. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi> that the power of God made paſſage to the body of our Lord. For he ſaith not that onely; but addeth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, that the body paſſed without change or diminiſhing of it nature, and without hauing any ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But that by the operation of the almightineſſe, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed notwithſtanding, which wrought in his body, piercing the ſhut and cloſed places: <hi>Nihil (inquit) ceſſit ex ſolido parie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> nothing ceaſed (ſaith he) of the firmneſſe of the walles: and other like words which he bringeth: of which can no other thing be vnderſtood, but a piercing of many bodies. S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> expreſly diſputeth of the body, which againſt it nature paſſed through the cloſed doores, as through the wombe of the virgin, without fraction. And he ſaith not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that hee knoweth not wherein the worke conſiſted (for he deſcribeth it) but he amplifieth the power of the worke: and ſaith, that he cannot comprehend the reaſon and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, for as much as it proceeded from the power of the incomprehenſible Cod. Concerning this whole point, the Doctors refer them to the reading of the bookes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more debating thereof againſt the Miniſters: who think alwayes to abuſe the ignorance of thoſe which beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, denying or affirming what they thinke good. And it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and grieueth the Doctors, that they are conſtrained to repeate the former reaſons ſo familiarly, and clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted: But the Miniſters euaſions ſo often repeated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eftſoones to inculeate that, which of theſe articles ought to be beleeued by the common conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Doctors are abaſhed at the maner of the Miniſters anſwere: who without regard of that hath bene obiected to them, ſay what they pleaſe, without anſwering to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19757:82"/>
of the matter propoſed: As they do in the article of the byrth of Ieſus Chriſt: In the deductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue brought many teſtimonies of the Ancients, which hold, that our Lord (as he was alſo there conceaued) myracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly iſſued from the wombe of his mother: And that the ſaid Fathers did witneſſe, ſuch byrth to haue bin made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fraction in the body of the virgin, and condemned of hereſie all thoſe which held the contrary. Which thing the Miniſters will yet maintain, and for full anſwere, affirme the ſame: relying (as they ſay) vpon the ſcripture, and not daring to ſay openly, that to cleaue to their proper ſence, they reiect the determination of the ancient &amp; primitiue Church. Which is very cleare notwithſtanding by their anſwere to this article: wherein they falſly cyte the ſcripture, as though it contained, that in the byrth of our Lord, <hi>Aperta fuerit vulua virginis:</hi> The wombe of the virgin was opened. And where they ſay, that ſuch an opening repugneth not the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall virginitie, (whereof is the queſtion) they belye the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the auncient Fathers, which haue determined of that deed.</p>
               <p>Whether in the Article of the Reſurrection there be but coniectures, the reading of the Doctors obiection will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The which they may ſee, that deſire to know the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters do complaine in the end of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Reſurrection, that the Doctors do wrong and ſcoffe them; the Doctors doubt not, but the Miniſters are ſore troubled, that their ſubtilties and maner of dealing are diſcouered: the which, did men well vnderſtand, they would not ſuffer themſelues ſo eaſily (as heeretofore) to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>The ſolution which the Miniſters pretend to giue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not <hi>Aphantos autois,</hi> but <hi>Ap'auton</hi> is impertinent. For howſoeuer it was, our Lord was inuiſible to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, were it by ſuddaine vaniſhing, or otherwiſe; the which vaniſhing, in a body preſent to perfect ſight, cannot be done, except the body be made to them inuiſible. And howſoeuer
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19757:83"/>
it be, the Greeke Text beareth inuiſible and vnappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>As touching the article of the opening of the heauens, the Miniſters as they are wont, anſwere not to the purpoſe: For it is not ſaid, that the heauens were clouen aſunder, or opened, when he aſcended thither: as at the baptiſme of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and when it is ſpoken of the viſion of S. <hi>Stephen.</hi> But the ſcripture ſaith expreſly, that Ieſus Chriſt pierced the Heauens, and not that the Heauens were opened vnto him. And the Miniſters cannot forbeare to ſlaunder the Doctors, in deprauing the vnderſtanding of their writings: as is ſeene in this preſent anſwere, where the Miniſters faineto haue vnderſtood, in that place of the ſcripture, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioning Ieſus Chriſt to haue pierced the Heauens, that the Doctors by the name of Heauen, will haue the ayre to be ſignified: which the Doctors neuer thought: but haue oft times ſayd, that when it mencioneth the opening of the Heauens, by the Heauens it vnderſtandeth the aire: which ſo ought not to be applyed, when our Lorde is ſayd to haue pierced the Heauens.</p>
               <p>By ſuch manner of anſwere do the Miniſters thinke, to cauſe the force of the Doctors reaſon to be forgotten. Who ſaid thus: If when it is ſaid in the ſcripture that the Heauens were opened, the words ought ſtrictly to be taken, and truly to be vnderſtood, that the heauens were opened: It likewiſe behoueth, when the ſcripture ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt pierced the Heauens, that the word [pierced] be taken in it proper ſignification and ſtrictly: which thing directly repugneth the diuiſion or opening, as things oppoſed one to another. To which reaſon, there is no anſwere giuen, more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is to the other arguments of the ſaid Doctors.</p>
               <p>Touching the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which the Miniſters put, between the ſight of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> which ſtretched euen to the height of Heauen, and the being of two bodies in one ſelfe-ſame place: and that the one is a myracle in nature: and the other a wonder againſt nature, and the will of GOD. The Miniſters (good Secretaries of Gods Counſaile
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19757:83"/>
and will) ſhould do much, if they could teach the Doctors, that God hath willed the one, and that hee cannot will the other: and then ſhall there bee reaſon for their ſaying, to ſhewe the difference they haue aſſigned betweene theſe two.</p>
               <p>The inconſtancie of the Miniſters is knowne in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle where the Camell is mentioned: to wit, whether God can cauſe him to paſſe through the eye of a needle. For in the Miniſters firſt anſwere, made without any diſtinction, haue they anſwered, that to make a Camell (or Cable) to paſſe through the eye of a needle, was a thing impoſſible with God. And in the ſecond anſwere do they alledge, that Ieſus Chriſt, (in ſaying, that what was impoſſible with men, was poſſible with God) no other thing pretended, but to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the queſtion which his Diſciples had propoſed: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who could be ſaued: anſwering wherevnto, he ſaid: that it was impoſſible with men: and that ſuch ſentence of Ieſus Chriſt, ought not to be vnderſtood, but of the ſaluation and conuerſion of rich men onely: which excluſiue ſpeech (when the Miniſters affirme, that our Lord ſaying, that what is impoſſible to man, is poſſible with God; muſt not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but of the ſaluation of the rich) clearely ſheweth, that the Miniſters intent was to ſay by their anſwere, that our Lord ment not to comprehend vnder this propoſition; [That which is impoſſible with men, is poſſible with God]: the poſſibilitie to make a Camell paſſe through the eye of a needle. As if this propoſition were not to be generally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, whereof our Lord inferreth this particular. It is poſſible with God to ſaue a rich man. And hee himſelfe by expreſſe words ſpeaketh generally: <hi>Omnia apud De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um poſſibilia ſnnt.</hi> With God are all things poſſible. The Doctors deſire, that they which can read this preſent writing, would note the ſtarting holes of the Miniſters, who wontedly auouch, and denie the errors they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, when they are thereof by the trueth conuinced.</p>
               <p>Now the Miniſters (not daring to perſiſt in defence, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19757:84"/>
God cannot cauſe a Camell to paſſe through the eye of a needle) haue inuented a very fooliſh interpretation, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that God can do it, but that the meanes ſhould be in this, that God might pare off and diminiſh the groſſeneſſe of a Camell, and all other things which might hinder it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage there. But that gloſe the Text cannot brooke: For our Lord ſpeaketh of a thing wholy impoſſible to men: which ſhould not be. For although to make and bring forth a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell of ſo little ſtature and bigneſſe, that he might paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the eye of a needle, were a thing impoſſible with man, yet if God brought forth ſuch a one, or if he did ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the greatneſſe and groſſeneſſe of a Camell, and that man might hold the ſame, he might well cauſe it to paſſe. But the queſtion is not of the production of a Camell, or of making him great or ſmall; but of cauſing him to paſſe. The which (were hee ſo little) ſhould not be a myracle as touching the paſſage, but onely touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch a liuing Creature, or the chaunging of his quantitie. Alſo in taking this name <hi>Camelus,</hi> for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as <hi>Caluin</hi> thought beſt) the abſurditie of this new expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhall better appeare. For well may man ſo much leſſen a Cable, by the detraction of it matter, that in the ende he may make it paſſe through the eye of a needle. Moreouer it ſhould be eaſie for a man to make a needle, whoſe eye ſhould be ſo large, that a Cable, (yea a Camell) might paſſe there through. But the ſcripture ſpeaketh of things impoſſible with man, and as they are in their owne nature. Therefore as the eye of a needle muſt be taken in it little and ſtraight quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo alſo muſt a Camell or Cable, be taken in it naturall groſſeneſſe. And neuer were the Auncients ſo ſubtill, to int uent ſuch ingenious interpretations, as one could not reade without laughter. But the Miniſters cannot eſcape with this goodly expoſition, that one ſeeth not clearly, they deny the power of God can ſtretch ſo farre, that it can make a Camel in his crookedneſſe and thickneſſe, to paſſe through the eye of a needle: but only when hee ſhall by the power of God, be brought into quantitie proportionable to the eye of a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19757:84"/>
needle, which is againſt the expreſſe Text of the ſcripture, and againſt the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of auncient interpreters: although that beſides the litterall ſence, the Camel be ſometimes alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically expounded by them. But the allegorical expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that place, taketh not away the truth of the litteral ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, no more then the acts of Ieſus Chriſt ceaſe to be true acts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the interpreters expound them allegorically. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Miniſters are deceiued, ſuppoſing, becauſe they haue read in S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſome interpretation beſides the litteral, that <note place="margin">Li. de vera Circonci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione ad finem.</note>the compariſon which our Lord in this behalf hath vſed, was a parable, which is falſe. For a true argument it is which our Lord deduceth, to ſhewe his power to ſaue a rich man: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a thing more hard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cauſe a Camel to paſſe through the eye of a needle.</p>
               <p>The Doctors to conclude vpon this article, do eftſoones ſhew vnto the Miniſters, that of the deniall of the ſtretching forth of Gods almightineſſe, many other abſurdities, which cannot otherwiſe be termed then blaſphemies, do follow. Namely, that two bodies cannot be in one place by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe of God: that GOD cannot make a bodie without circumſcription of place: that Ieſus Chriſt ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, nor could enter through the cloſed doores: aroſe not, nor could a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e, without the ſtone were rowled from the graue: that hee went not, nor could goe out of the Virgines wombe, without fraction in the bodie of his mother: that hee pearced not, nor could pearce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, without opening of them: that he made not, nor could make a bodie (no not his owne) inuiſible: that he could not cauſe a Camell (or Cable) retaining it groſſeneſſe, to paſſe through the eye of a needle. Which things do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the deniall of his almightineſſe, and is an execrable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, and very Atheiſme. Behold the enormious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities which they are conſtrained to confeſſe, that denie the real preſence of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; which the Doctors pray to be well conſidered by the readers of this preſent writing.</p>
               <p>Concerning that which the Miniſters make queſtion of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19757:85"/>
in the laſt article of their anſwere, that the Doctors doo call faith a humane worke, ſeeing that it is of God: they ought no more to wonder thereat, then infinit other truthes, which ſeemeth ſtraunge to them becauſe their doctrine is founded on the grounds of error: among which, one of the principall is; That man hath not free will: that man to thinke well, will well, and doo well, worketh not together with God: againſt many places of ſcripture which ſetteth downe man co-working with God: and for his faith and workes, hath of him reward and recompence. The which, without wandring from the purpoſe, ſhall more aptly be handled in an other place. The Doctors like well, that the Miniſters do confeſſe that the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers haue neuer ſaid, God could not cauſe one bodie to be in diuers places: which thing is true. But the reaſon which they yeeld, why they haue not ſo ſayd, is of the Miniſters owne forge and inuention. It remaineth, that they ſhewe vs ſo much by the teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning the ſame: For no more is it therein found, then in the writings of the Fathers. Whereof the ſaid Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue bene oft admoniſhed, who ſay they build all their doctrine vpon the word of God.</p>
               <p>Had the Miniſters in the beginning confeſſed the truth of the Omnipotencie, or elſe had they ſaid, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that Ieſus Chriſt could cauſe his body to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and here belowe in the Sacrament, really and truly, if he ſo would: than had it bene needleſſe to handle theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queſtions, which neuertheleſſe, are not of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as the Miniſters do eſteeme them. Which thing appeareth by the writings of the Fathers, who haue diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled theſe places, and ſtrengthened themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with againſt heretiques: But becauſe the Miniſters would not agree, that God can make one body to be at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant, in diuers places; And that if the Doctors had begunne to declare his will to haue bene ſuch, that he had ordained the body of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be in Heauen, and in the Sacrament. The Miniſters might haue ſayd (as they of theyr ſect doo ſay) that God hath not willed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19757:85"/>
it, becauſe he could not. The Doctors had rather firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of the Almightineſſe, then of the will. And ſeeing the matter of the Omnipotencie hath bene ſufficitntly toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they are determined to prooue, that Ieſus Chriſt hath willed and ordained, that his bodie ſhould bee in diuers places. In the probation of which thing, when they haue vnderſtood the Miniſters opinion, of that they holde in theyr Churches touching that matter, they will enter into the former Conference, to the ende that theyr trauell be not in vaine.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19757:86"/>
all hereſies: On the contrary ſide, ſhall one perceiue the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe of God, to be propoſed by the ſcriptures, as a ſharpe ſword, cutting in peeces all arguments which might come of naturall reaſons: for a certaine and finall reſolution to beleeue whatſoeuer is couched &amp; borne by the ſaid word of God, albeit impoſſible &amp; incomprehenſible to euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and faith to be ſtaied on that ſame power in all doubts, which might be offered or propoſed.</p>
               <p>All the difficultie which <hi>Abraham</hi> made vppon the promiſes of God to him, did proceed of certaine impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of nature, which he ſawe in himſelfe and in his wife. And it ſeemeth hee had alwayes regard therevnto, vntill God vſed his authoritie, and ſaid vnto him: I am God all ſufficient. Is any thing hard to the Lord? After this rebuke and remonſtrance of God, <hi>Abraham</hi> did then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all conſideration of the proprieties of his nature, and laid hold on this ſhield of faith: which is to knowe, and to bee fully perſwaded, that God is almightie, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hard or impoſſible. And after that, when queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was of killing his onely ſonne; albeit hee had great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of contradiction in nature, and in the word of God, which had beene giuen him: to wit, that of the ſeed of that ſonne ſhould hee proceed, which ſhould giue bleſſing to all Nations, and notwithſtanding hee muſt kill him before hee had any lynage of his bodie iſſued. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee made not proteſtation, oppoſing that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of nature, and of the word of GOD, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that that which had beene ſaid and promiſed vnto him was impoſſible: but hee had recourſe to the ſtay of faith, and of the faithfull (ſaieth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes) that is to ſay, to the omnipotencie, eſteeming that God had the meane to make true both the one and the other: namely, to cauſe his ſonne to die, and riſe againe, to drawe from him afterwards lynage and poſteritie: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as yet there had beene no example of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the conſideration of creatures, and the order
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19757:86"/>
of nature which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſawe before him, made him fall into Infidelitie. And God ſhewed him his fault, in that he would deny him the power, long time with fleſh to nouriſh his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: becauſe the nature of the wildernes did not afford it: and did admoniſh him to lift vp his ſpirit to the omnipotency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, and there to aſſure his faith. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid: <hi>Sixe hundred thouſand people there are, among whom I am: and thou ſaiſt, I will giue them fleſh, that they may eate therof a month long: Shall the ſheepe and beeues be ſlaine to find them? Either ſhall all the fiſh of the ſea be gathered together for them to ſuffice them?</hi> God anſwered <hi>Moſes, Is the hand of the Lord ſhortnea? thou ſhalt now ſee whether my word ſhall come to paſſe, or no.</hi> In like maner, as often as one ſhall reade in the ſcriptures, that the people, or other particular perſons, fell into vnbeliefe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of Gods helpe and ſuccor, he ſhall know, that the cauſe hath ordinarily bene, for ſtaying vpon the nature and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of humane things: without ſufficient apprehenſion of the power of God.

               </p>
               <p>In the new Teſtament, the Virgin hauing regard to the naturall maner of conceauing, ſeemed to doubt of the mean of her conception. And ſhe ſaid: <hi>How ſhall this thing be, ſeeing I know not man?</hi> And the Angell anſwering, ſayd vnto her: <hi>Nothing ſhall bee impoſſible with God.</hi> Drawing her backe from the cogitations of naturall proprieties, which is the roote of Infidelitie, and exhorting her to thinke vpon the Almightineſſe of God, which is the chiefe ſtone and rocke, wherevpon true Religion is builded.</p>
               <p>Which thing conſidered: The Doctors for their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this conference with the Miniſters, do ſay: that with good right hath the omnipotency of God very expreſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the firſt place, among the articles of the Apoſtles Creed: as being that, by which all the other articles of faith, and the workes of God aboue nature, are belieued and maintained, againſt all contradiction and repugnancy of nature, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which may be pretended or alledged: And without the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19757:87"/>
which, any article of faith, or any the workes of God ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nature, and contained in the ſcriptures, could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and maintained, againſt the aſſaults of malice, and depriuation of humane ſpirit: which alwayes tendeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie, and diſobedience towards his God: and from his byrth is prompt and ſubtil to depraue and ſlaunder his word and commandement. By meanes whereof (ſay the Doctors) that ſo much the more ought euery Chriſtian to inforce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to hold and keep that article entire, without ſuffring any to make any exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, or to reſtrain it at his pleaſure, vnder any pretexts of (I know not what) repugnancies of creatures; which humane ſpirit propoſeth, for want of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and comprehending the greatneſſe of God. For the ſcriptures do euer preſent vnto vs this omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy generally without any reſtraint, in regard of creatures, or of the workes of God. And teacheth vs, that the creatures is in his hands, as the clayin the hand of the Potter, to receiue ſuch change and forme, as ſhall ſeeme good vnto him: without that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. <hi>Iere.</hi> 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</note>they can ſay, Why haſt thou made or chaunged mee thus! Such ſimilitude and words the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Ieremy,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> do vſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Doctors ſay: that men muſt yet leſſe be lycenſed to limit and bound the foreſayd power, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the contradictions which in theyr writings they imagine of the nature, wiſedome, or eternall will of God: Seeing that the ſcripture ſaith plainly, that God can doo more then wee vnderſtand, and mocketh at them which will entermeddle with the nature, wiſedome, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall will of God: as though they had bene of counſell with him to know thereby the deciſions and ordinances, more then his owne word pronounceth thereof. And S. <hi>Paule</hi> in the end conſtraineth with himſelfe euery ſpirit created, to cry out, confeſſing his ignorance of the power, wiſedome, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note>and workes of God: <hi>Oh the deepneſſe of the riches, wiſedome, and knowledge of God, how incomprehenſible are his iudgements, and his wayes past finding out. For who is he that hath knowne the minde of the Lord? Or who hath bene his Counſailor?</hi> And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19757:87"/>
an excellent ſaying of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this point is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who in an Epiſtle <hi>Advoluſianum</hi> ſaith: We confeſſe, that God can doo ſomething, the which in ſearching, wee cannot finde. As if hee would ſay: to wit, if God can doo ſomething, albeit in our naturall iudgement wee thinke it impoſſible: wee eſteeme it neuertheleſſe that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but that the capacitie of our ſpirit cannot comprehend the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſay aſſo, that by ſuch libertie and meanes that any will exempt what hee liketh from the power of God, vnder colour of ſome impoſſibilities of nature, or of repugnancie, after his owne iudgement, to the nature, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and will of God: each one will ſtudie to faine the like, in all matters of faith: wherein ſuch cauſes may bee eaſily inuented, and well diſguiſed. And that it is ſo, from the firſt article of the Creed vnto the laſt, let all the hereſies which haue bene there contradicted, be from time to time obſerued, and it will appeare, that all haue held this way and method, to fight againſt euery article of faith, as impoſſible to God: reſpecting the impoſsibilitie of the worke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, and ſome pretended inconueniences, againſt the nature, wiſedome, will, and glorie of God.</p>
               <p>The Doctors employ to this effect, the two firſt bookes of <hi>Tertullian:</hi> one whereof is, of the incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt: and the other, againſt the Marcioniſts of the reſurrection of the fleſh: In which the Chriſtian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall perceiue the like arguments of thoſe Marcioniſts, endeuouring to exempt from the omnipotencie of God, the incarnation of our Lord, and the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Then to conclude this point, the Doctors do forewarne euery Chriſtian, that they adde not ought to the ſcriptures, which ſpeake alwaies without any limitation of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of GOD towards the creatures: and to the ende, to praiſe the infinite power, wiſedome, and eternall will of our Creator and Redeemer: and to the end to preſerue the cloſet of Gods ſecrets from euery ſhameleſſe and impudent perſon, which of his own folly wil make a law, not only to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

of heretikes. <hi>Credendo non credunt.</hi> To wit, that in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Gods omnipotencie, they beleeue it not. For after they haue ſaid that no exception is to be put vnto it, on the other ſide they returne to declare, that it ought not bee extended to euery thing, which humane ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> t can conceiue. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they will not apply vnto it, but what ſeemeth good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and ſhrowd themſelues with the nature, wiſdome, and eternall will of God: which to them are vnknowne, and incomprehenſible, as that of the Omnipotencie. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therefore do admoniſh all men to beware of beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed with the words of <hi>Caluin</hi> and his Miniſters: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the works which they denie to be in the power of God. The Doctors haue propoſed to them theſe foure queſtions: to wit, whether God can make one body to be in two places: and (contrariwiſe) two bodies in one place: whether hee can lodge one body in a leſſe ſpace then the greatneſſe thereof: and whether he can make it inviſible. And ſuch queſtions haue beene ſpecially choſen: becauſe the principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the pretended reformed Religion againſt the true preſence of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament, are founded vpon the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Doctors beleeue ſimply (as all other things) that the foure queſtions are poſſible to God, and haue proued the ſame by the infiniteneſſe of his power, by the ſcriptures, which attribute vnto him all power without exception, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the creatures: and by written examples and ſtraunge my racles wrought vpon their bodies, againſt the nature of them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his booke of the Reſurrection, ſaith: <hi>To the end wee may beleeue, that our God is more mightie then all lawe and nature of all bodies:</hi> And addeth: <hi>that they knowe God amiſſe who thinke that is not in his power, which they in their braine cannot comprehend.</hi> From whence it commeth (as ſaith S. <hi>Cyrill)</hi> that ſuch wicked ſpirits doo reiect and condemne all things as impoſſible, becauſe they themſelues do not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the Doctors ſuppoſe they haue ſufficiently ſhewed, as well by expreſſe ſcripture, as by the expoſitions
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19757:88"/>
thereof, taken from auncient Chriſtians, that it was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the power of God to make two bodies in one place, and one body without place equall to it greatneſſe, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie it was truly done in the birth of the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: in his reſurrection: in the entrie through the cloſed doores: and in the aſcention aboue all the heauens. And the Doctors haue ſhewed, that there was like and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable repugnancie in theſe deeds, as in the other: that is, of one body in two places: which is not exempted by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the power nor will of God, more then the others, to iudge it impoſſible to bee done: and that there was neuer Chriſtian before our time, which dared to affirme that thing to be impoſsible, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd out of the power of God, although oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was often offered to ſay it, had they any way thought it impoſsible: as the Miniſters of the pretended reformed Religion do pretend. Contrariwife, the moſt part of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authors of the Primitiue Church, haue held it expreſly to be in Gods power to place one creature in many places: as held Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> againſt the heretike <hi>Vigillantius,</hi> that the ſoules of the Saints might be preſent in many places, with the immaculate Lambe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was, whether the ſaid ſoules, and ſpirits of the Saints, were ſometimes preſent in the Churches where their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres and monuments were. And ſo much thereof holdeth S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. of the booke which he wrote of the due care of the dead: where he writeth, that ſoules by the power of their owne nature, cannot be here belowe, and in heauen, or in many places: but that it may be done by the power of God: and will not reſolue whether they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our affaires by ſuch a preſence in many places, or by the reuelation of Angels, or other meanes by the power and grace of God.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is certain, that in the matter of the holy Sacrament, the auncient Fathers of the Church haue acknowledged and maintained, that the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt was in many places by the almightie power of God. As doth S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon the tenth of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes: and Saint
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19757:89"/>
                  <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in his 17. Homily vpon the ſame Epiſtle. Where both two as it were in like words do write, that although in many places there are many actions and oblations of the body of Ieſus Chriſt: neuertheleſſe (hauing regard to the thing which is offered, to wit, the true lambe and body of Chriſt Ieſus) that this ſacrifice in many places offered is but one, for ſo much as it is but one ſelfe-ſame thing: to wit, the true lambe, and the true body of Ieſus Chriſt, which is but one, and abideth whole in all places where it is offered. They adde alſo, that the oblations of him in diuers places, is not an iteration of the ſacrifice of the Croſſe: but in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him. So that in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and diſtinguiſh two points. The one which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the realtie of the thing offered: and they ſay, that this is the true lambe, and true body of Ieſus Chriſt: which then remaining intierly one, is neuertheleſſe in many places. And the other concerneth the action and oblation of ſuch thing by the Prieſt, which is no iteration, nor like action or oblation as that of the Croſſe: but diuerſe, in remembrance notwithſtanding of that was made vpon the Croſſe. S. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> in the third booke of Prieſthood, cryeth out ſaying: Oh myracle and power of God! He which ſitteth on high at the right hand of his Father, is held betweene the hands of each one in the Sacrament. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon the 33. Pſalme ſheweth, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Supper was in two places: that is to ſay, in it viſible place among his Apoſtles; and neuertheleſſe betweene his owne hands. So that he himſelfe did beare himſelfe. And before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the ſame, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> debateth how it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that one perſon ſhould beare his body betweene his hands. And after he had ſhewed that it was impoſſible for <hi>Dauid,</hi> and cuerie creature, he deſcended at laſt, to the diuine power which was in Ieſus Chriſt: by the which, to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone among all men, ſuch myracle was poſſible. And to the ende that men ſhould not depraue, nor wreſt the meaning of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> (becauſe there is ſomething which after a ſort is carried as though it diminiſhed the truth) let them
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19757:89"/>
note that the purpoſe of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is, to ſhewe that Ieſus by his almightineſſe did carrie himſelfe, which to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was impoſsible. Now had he onely in the Supper borne betweene his hands the figure of the Sacrament, and ſigne of his body, and not his true and reall body, hee ſhould haue done nothing, but what the leaſt man might do. For each man can carrie betwixt his hands, the figure, Image, ſigne or Sacrament of his body, or ſticke it in his hat, without my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle or ſupernaturall power. It be houeth then, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine maner which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vſeth, doth nothing diminiſh the truth: and this it is, that betweene his hands he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, and in a ſupernaturall maner of being; reall neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe and true. S. <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Liturgie with the others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth the body of Ieſus Chriſt to be in heauen, and by his almightineſſe notwithſtanding to bee preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: although the Miniſters to proue it impoſsible for one body, or one other creature, to be in many places, do chiefly build vpon S. <hi>Baſil:</hi> but the ſaid S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> in the place by the Miniſters alledged, doth expreſly proteſt, not to ſpeake but according to the naturall proprietie. And in his Liturgie he declareth, that it is not onely in the power of God to cauſe the body of Ieſus Chriſt to be in heauen, and vpon the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; but that it is ſo truly done.</p>
               <p>The Doctors to end this queſtion of one body in many places, ſay: that ſuch matter is not onely in the power of God, but that it muſt ſo be beleeued to bee done in the holy Sacrament, that God be not found a lyar and deceiuer in his word: whereby Ieſus affirmed to his Apoſtles, that that which he gaue with his hands, was his true body, deliuered for vs. This is an argument which <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his booke of the Reſurrection maketh, after hee had diſputed againſt them which denied the ſame to be poſſible with God. And it ſeemeth they then ſaid (as the Miniſters haue formerly ſaid) that there was ſomething by the ſcriture impoſſible with God: to wit, that he could not lye, nor deceiue: and that thereof they tooke occaſion to goe further, and to diſpute that the reſurrection was to him alſo impoſſible. So
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19757:90"/>
that the Miniſters, becauſe God cannot lye, haue endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o inferre, that to put one body in two places, was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him, as well as to lye and deceiue. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the end accordeth with the Marcioniſts, and ſaith: Rather had I confeſſe that God cannot deceiue, and that hee is onely weake and impotent in deceit: to the end, that thereby hee ſeeme not to haue taught and ſpoken one way, and to haue otherwiſe diſpoſed of the deed contained in his word. Then if hee cannot (concludeth <hi>Tertullian)</hi> deceiue and abuſe, the reſurrection muſt be beleeued, as it is carried in his word, and not otherwiſe, leaſt deceit be found in the word of God.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſay alſo, they willingly confeſſe, that God cannot lye, nor deceiue: and that it muſt therefore be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that ſo he hath willed and ordained the truth of the Supper, in ſuch ſort, and not otherwiſe, as his word ſoundeth and beareth. Now ſo it is, that his word plainly and expreſly beareth, that he affirmeth that what hee gaue with his hands to his Apoſtles to eat, was his body, deliuered for vs: we muſt therefore beleeue that his word ſaith not otherwiſe then his will is, leaſt he be eſteemed a lyar. And that as he ſaith, <hi>This is my body: This is my bloud:</hi> that it is ſo indeed. The which the Doctors (by Gods aſſiſtance) will declare in the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to ſhewe that he hath not onely power to eſtabliſh his body in the holy Sacrament: but alſo that he hath willed it, and ſo hath done it.</p>

               <p>An other point there is yet, which inuiteth the Miniſters to demaund tractation of the Supper: which is, that they haue the whole matter alreadie ſquared, by many of their Sect, who haue written of the ſame: And chiefly the great booke of <hi>Peter Martir</hi> will not faile them. Wherby they ſhalbe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with I know not what infamous obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; of ſome paſſages of the Fathers, broken &amp; depraued, or euilly applied, to impugne in ſhew, the truth of the body in the Sacrament.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19757:91"/>
But for defence of all other their errors, the Miniſters are meanely armed: and their conſcience doth ſufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that by the ſcripture, deciſion of generall Councells, and common accord of the writings of all the auncient Fathers, (no apparance to the contrary) they are conuinced and condemned of their errors againſt the ſaid Creed.</p>
               <p>Now, to enter into the examination of the Supper of the Miniſters, the Doctors do maintaine, that it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane eating and drinking, not differing from common ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, but in that it is worſe: that they abuſe the holy inſtitution of the Supper of Ieſus, and pollute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file ſuch their banket with all impietie, &amp; blaſphemie. They alſo maintaine, that the Miniſters do great iniurie to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Ieſus Chriſt, falſly to attribute to ſuch, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and polluted banket, the name of Sacrament. And to the end that the proofe thereof be more cleare, the Doctors demaund of the Miniſters, whether they receiue one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine, receiued not only in the Church Catholique, but alſo almoſt in all Sects which are ſeperated from it: That is, that in the confection of the Sacraments, there be two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and neceſſarie things: the matter (or element) and the word?</p>
               <p>Secondly, what word, with the Element, is neceſſary to make a Sacrament: and namely, that which the Miniſters do call the Sacrament of the Supper: and whether it behoueth to vſe certaine words or no?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether the word haue ſome power or effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall working in the Sacrament? &amp; what, &amp; whether it worke vpon ſomething in the matter of the bread and wine?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whether by the ſame word, conſecration bee made of the matter of the Sacrament or no?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whether by the word conſecration, be not made of the matter? to wit, how the ſame conſecration is made? and by what vertue the ſame is made?</p>
               <p>Sixtly, whether beſides the bread and wine, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces and benefites of Ieſus Chriſt, the true body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in their proper ſubſtance, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19757:91"/>
not in ſpirituall effect onely, be really receiued in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? And the Doctors do demand vpon this article, a plaine confeſſion of the faith of the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>They demaund further, whether in receiuing the bread, before taking of the wine, they receiue not by the eating of the bread, the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: or the body onely. Briefly, whether they admit that which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines call a <hi>Concomitance</hi> of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They demaund alſo, whether the Supper (ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the aſſurance which it giueth them of the participation they haue in the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt, for their redemption) doth worke in them remiſſion of ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Laſtly they demaund, whether one receiueth any thing by the Supper, which he could not receiue without the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? or whether without paine taking to go the Supper, or beeing preſent thereat, one may as well receiue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and graces of Ieſus Chriſt, as if hee were preſent at the Supper?</p>
               <p>The Doctors will afterwards debate the other articles, contained in the Miniſters laſt writing: for as much as the precedent demaunds ought to be firſt examined, as grounds of other articles propoſed by the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, after the confutation of the Supper of the Miniſters, and the confirmation of the reall preſence of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament, the Doctors by order, and without confuſion, will clearly teach by the pure and expreſſe word of God, that the Maſſe was inſtituted and ſaid by Ieſus Chriſt, and that he commaunded his Apoſtles to ſay it: which thing, then following the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Maiſter, they afterwards performed.</p>
               <p>That the Maſſe is a true ſacrifice of the lawe Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelique.</p>
               <p>That they which reiect the Maſſe, and admit in the Church no externall ſacrifice, nor Prieſthood, are without the true lawe, without true Religion, and therein worſe then Idolaters themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:19757:92"/>
That the Maſſe auaileth to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, fauour, and grace of God: and that it auaileth both for the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p>That it is not an abuſe in the Church, if the Prieſt in the Maſſe do communicate alone, when they that are preſent will not communicate.</p>
               <p>That they commit an horrible blaſphemie, which call the adoration of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, adoration of bread and wine, and falſly call ſuch worſhip of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, that there is nothing in the Maſſe, at this day ordained and celebrated, which in it ſelfe is not good, and holy, and agreeable to the word of God.</p>
               <p>The Doctors do admoniſh the Miniſters to anſwere to the demaunds here aboue written, to purpoſe, plainely, and by order.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19757:92"/>
attribute the ſame to the ſole company of them which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their cuſtomes and errors: as the Doctors at this day approue not others for the Catholike and vniuerſall Church, then they which follow the traditions and abuſes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church. Moreouer, the Donatiſts did perſecute them which were contrarie to their doctrine, and vſed violence and all crueltie againſt them, that they could deuiſe: as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in many places doth recyte. Now what in time paſt hath bene the rage and furie, as well of the Doctors, as of their complices, Prieſts, and hypocriticall Monkes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poore Chriſtians, each one knoweth. And there is not he, which knoweth not now, both by their Sermons, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and conferences, what is their hate and ſpight againſt the children and ſeruants of God: and what pleaſure ſhould they haue to roote them out, were theyr power anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their will: whereby one may iudge, whether they or the Miniſters come nearer to the likeneſſe and example of the Donatiſts.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Doctors adde, that the Miniſters ceaſe not to bee blaſphemers, becauſe they reiect and deteſt the name thereof. The Miniſters anſwere, that the Doctors alſo leaue not to be falſe accuſers, becauſe they diſauow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the name. And that the effects do ſhewe of the one ſide and the other, to whom ſuch crimes and names may apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and be attributed.</p>
               <p>And touching that which the Doctors in the ſame article ſay, that it is blaſphemy againſt the goodneſſe of God, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto him, that hee is the author of vice, and of ſinne. The Miniſters confeſſe it: and do adde, that it is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my alſo againſt his truth, to ſay, that with him there is yea, and nay: as doo they, which vnder a colour and falſe pretext to eſtabliſh the omnipotencie of GGD, doo propoſe, that hee can cauſe one bodie at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant to bee in diuers places: to wit, that it is, and is not.</p>
               <p>Touching that which the Doctors afterwards ſay, that the Miniſters erre in the grounds of Gods omnipotencie:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19757:93"/>
for as much as they haue ſaid, that he was almightie, becauſe he doth whatſoeuer hee will: and that nothing can hinder, or with-hold the execution of his counſailes. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters anſwere, that therein they haue followed Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> definition of the omnipotencie of God, in the 96. Chapter of his <hi>Enchiridion:</hi> where word for word hee thus ſaith: For other cauſe is hee not truly called omnipotent: but for as much as hee can do all whatſoeuer hee will: and that the effect of the will of the Almightie, is not hindered by the will and effect of any creature.</p>
               <p>In that they conſequently impute to the Miniſters, that they haue ſaid the omnipotencie of God ought not to bee generally extended to all things which men may conceiue and imagine in their mindes. The Miniſters ſay (vnder the Doctors correction) that they ſaid not ſo: but that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe of God, ought not to be extended without any diſcretion or diſtinction, to all things generally, which men in their fooliſh phantaſies might forge or imagine. Wherein to each one it may eftſoones appeare, how they curtall and falſifie the Miniſters words and ſentences, to haue meanes and colour for their ſlaunder.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, where they affirme that it is blaſphemy to ſay that God can doo nothing againſt order: the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters on the contrary part maintaine, that to thinke and ſay that hee can doo ought which is not well ordered, is to blaſpheme the wiſedome, and eternall prouidence of God.</p>
               <p>The Doctors pretend in the article following, that one body to be in diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant, is not a thing derogatorie to the truth of God. The Miniſters doo maintaine the contrarie, that it ſhould be derogate both to his truth; for as much as there ſhould be in him, (as is ſaid) yea and nay: and to his wiſedome, for as much as in his words there ſhould be diſorder and confuſion: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to his almightineſſe, becauſe in his deeds there ſhould be imperfection.</p>
               <p>And they further ſay, that it ſhould not be onely againſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19757:93"/>
the diſpoſition and ordinary courſe of nature, (as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors faigne to haue thought and vnderſtood) but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the eternall and vnchangeable will of our God.</p>
               <p>And as touching that which the Doctors, to proue that God can do ſomething againſt order, do propoſe that he can chaunge and alter the order eſtabliſhed in the world. The Miniſters confeſſe the ſame: but they denie that in ſo doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould do any thing which were diſordered. As (for example) all faithfull and Chriſtian men doo beleeue, beleeue, that God will renew at the laſt the eſtate of the whole world: wherein there is nothing in the meane time which is not well ordained, perfect, and in all points accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>The Doctors in the following article, confound the diſtinction propoſed by the Miniſters, in their anſwere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the will of God manifeſted, and that he hath hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in himſelfe, and is equall to his power: as the Miniſters before haue at large declared. And the Doctors do falſly preſuppoſe touching the reuealed will of God; taking that generally, which the Miniſters haue graunted in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars onely: to wit, that God can doo more in ceraine things, then he hath declared to will: which none doubteth. As ſaith S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the booke of perfect Iuſtice, that he cannot make a man to be perfect in this world, and ſanctifie him in ſuch ſort, that there remaine no more in him any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie or imperfection; although hee hath neuer decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs by his word, that hee would do it: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the fleſh in all the regenerate will alwaies refiſt the ſpirit: ſo that all the time of their liues, they ſhall be in many points imperfect. But albeit in that, and ſome other like caſes, God can do more then his will declareth, which he hath manifeſted to vs in his word: yet neuertheleſſe can it not be ſaid but that there be other caſes, wherein God hath reuealed his will vnto vs, againſt which he can do or ordaine nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with God. yet in theſe</note> As (for example) hee hath declared vnto vs, that hee is one, that he is immutable, incomprehenſible, wholly good, wholly iuſt, wholly perfect, and wholly true: Againſt all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19757:94"/>
                  <note place="margin">impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</note> which things, (which to vs are manifeſted and clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his word) impoſſible it is for him, euer to thinke, ſay, do, or ordaine.</p>
               <p>Now the thing propoſed and debated by the Doctors, touching the being of one body, at one inſtant in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is compriſed in that ranke, beeing (as is ſaid) contrarie to the truth of God. Which ſhall ſerue for anſwere to the Doctors ſlaunders, and to all that they haue propoſed in this article. Likewiſe in an other following article, where they ſay that God not onely can, but will alſo cauſe, that one body occupie diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame time. That ſhall be yet more impoſſible for them to proue, then the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer aforeſaid, for which they haue hitherto ſo much trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in vaine.</p>
               <p>In their definition of one bodye in the Article fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, they contradict themſelues, when they ſay that the meaſures are eſſentiall vnto it: and that it may neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe bee incircumſcript: for if it bee needfull that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions whereof it is compoſed, bee finite; of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it followeth therevpon, that then it is finite, limited, and circumſcript.</p>
               <p>To that which they afterwards ſay, that the reaſon which the Miniſters haue taken of the Creed, and alledged to proue that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is in heauen in a place certaine, is friuolous. The Miniſters ſay; that the Doctors ſhewe therein what reuerence they beare to the word of GOD, and his ſpirite, who hath reuealed the ſame vnto vs, and to the Apoſtles, which declare them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
               <p>To iuſtifie <hi>Gracian</hi> and the Canon, which the Miniſters alledge of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> by which they proue that the bodie of Chriſt muſt neceſſarily be in a place certaine, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters bring yet for more ample confirmation, the 4. booke and 10. diſtinction of the Maiſter of the Sentences: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyting the ſelfe-ſame paſſage of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> vſeth the verbe <hi>[Oportet]</hi> and not <hi>[Poteſt].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching that of <hi>Iuſtine</hi> which the Doctors alledge,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19757:94"/>
to proue the myracles which were then done; that Ieſus Chriſt appeared in the middeſt of his Diſciples, the gates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut: and that hee walked vpon the waters, were done in his perſon. The Miniſters are amazed how the Doctors doo yet repeate the ſame. For as much as the ſaid <hi>Iuſtine</hi> (as they haue before beene anſwered) expreſly ſaith: that when the ſaid myracles were done, there was no chaunge of the body of Ieſus Chriſt: which thing, had the myracles bene done in his perſon, had bene neceſſarie. In the meane time, the Miniſters confeſſe (as they haue done often) that the cauſe of the ſaid myracles, and the diuine power whence they proceeded, abode in Ieſus Chriſt. As when hee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the diſeaſed which touched him: and did the other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles recyted in the Euangelicall Hiſtories: the which were done by him, but not in him, but in the perſon of them that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> healed. And there is great difference betweene ſuch myracles, and thoſe of his transfiguration, and reſurrection, which were wrought by his onely power, and in his proper perſon.</p>
               <p>Vpon the importunate repetition which the Doctors make, as well of the meanes of the birth of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as of the word <hi>Aphantos:</hi> The Miniſters for ſparing of time, and not troubling the readers, ſend them back to their former anſweres.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters much maruel that the Doctors to proue their pretended penetration of two bodies, and of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, wil ground their proofe and principal argument vpon the proper ſignification of the terme <hi>[Penetrer].</hi> For be it ſo, that they will by this French word interpret the Greeke word <hi>Diercheſtas,</hi> or the Latine word <hi>Penetrare.</hi> It ſhall bee euer impoſſible to proue their pretence. And as it is alſo in the Acts of the Apoſtles, Chap. 12. 10. It is ſaid of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and S. <hi>Peter</hi> that they paſſed the firſt and ſecond watch. And in S. <hi>Luke.</hi> 4. 30. But they paſſed through the middeſt of them, and departed. And in S. <hi>Io.</hi> 4. 4. Now it behoued him to paſſe by <hi>Samaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all which paſſages the Doctors ſhall not find, that the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19757:95"/>
word <hi>Dierchestai</hi> (in the ſaid paſſages alledged) can bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way applied to the penetration of dimenſions. And no more ſhall they proue that the word <hi>[Penetrare]</hi> which the old Tranſlator hath vſed in the 2. <hi>Tymo.</hi> 3. can be reduced to their ſaid penetration.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters do adde, that the Doctors ought not to hold it more ſtraunge, that Ieſus Chriſt aſcending into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his finite and limited body, an opening were made for his entrance therin: then when he deſcendeth betweene the hands of the Prieſts ſinging their Maſſes: For then (as ſaith S. <hi>Gregorie)</hi> the heauens do open to giue him paſſage. Although after their imagination, his body is then ſeperated from it meaſures and dimenſions.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſhould haue contented themſelues with the Miniſters anſwer vpon the ſimilitude &amp; word [Camell]. For firſt, they can no wayes proue, that that ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt vpon the end of that ſpeech, ought elſe-where to be applied, then to the neareſt member of the ſame: where ſpeech is made of the conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſion and ſauing of a rich man. For the Pronowne demonſtratiue <hi>[Hoc]</hi> doth clearly ſhewe it: Afterwards, although that the generall propoſition in the end and concluſion of the ſaid ſentence (where it is ſaid that all things are poſſible to God) extendeth (as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will haue it) to the Camell, as well as the rich man: yet rightly to apply the two patts of the compariſon, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth they confeſſe, that as the change is neceſſary for the rich man to be ſaued: ſo is it alſo for the body of the Camel, to cauſe it paſſe through the eye of a needle. Howſoeuer that might in ſome ſort be done, the Doctors ſhal not proue, nor euer thence conclude, that two bodies can the one pierce the other. For as much as the Doctors by their thriſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong &amp; powerfull arguments haue not bene able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any of all their abſurdities, nor by force of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to conſtraine the Miniſters to confeſſe the ſame: they do nought elſe but exclaime, Blaſphemy, Blaſphemy; which is the laſt recourſe of all perſons, who deſpite and gnaſh the teeth againſt the truth, and them that maintain it, when they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19757:95"/>
cannot ouercome them. Would the Miniſters ſubſcribe to the errors end abuſes of the ſaid Doctors, they ſhould bee good and Catholike people: but becauſe they gainſay and reproue them, they be (in their opinion) heretikes, ſeducers, blaſphemers, and Atheiſts: and in ſo great horror doo the Doctors hold them, that it is maruel they pull not (like <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas)</hi> their horned caps and hoods in peeces, in deteſtation of the word of God, propoſed and defended by the ſaid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and condemned as blaſphemy by the Doctors.</p>
               <p>The Doctors haue diſſembled the paſſage of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alledged by the Miniſters, to proue that faith is a worke of God, which he bringeth forth in the heart of the faithfull, when he will worke his regeneration: and incidently ſpeake of free will, and the merit of workes.

As we all ſee, that vnder pretence to honour God, he hath eſtabliſhed all the Idolatrie which hath euer beene in the worlde: referring the adoration of Images, the Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interceſſion of Saintes, the worſhipping of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and other lyke impieties to the honour of God, and perſwading the ignorant that all that was done to aduance the ſame. Lykewiſe vnder pretext of his ſeruice, hath he brought in all the traditions and inuentions of men, and chaunged with the time, the true and lawfull ſeruice of God (which conſiſteth in the obedience of his holy will, declared vnto vs in his lawe and word) into the obſeruation of theyr commaundements, and theyr inuented ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Vnder ſhadowe and colour of the Sacraments ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, for the confirmation, exerciſe and nouriſhing of the faith of the Church, there hath crept in the Maſſe: which is not only the ruine and totall ſubuerſion of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but alſo an aboliſhment of all the benefite of Ieſus Chriſt: and conſequently of the faith and all true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Vnder colour and ſhadowe of holineſſe, and of chaſte, ſhamefaſte, and honeſt conuerſation, which is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Miniſters and Paſtors of the Church, he hath eſtabliſhed ſingle life, and taken away from them the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of marriage: which hath bene the occaſion of all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of infamous, ſtinking, and execrable whoredomes and luxuritie, which is ſeene in the Papacie. Vnder the ſhadowe of prayers, which men are commaunded to make one for an other: and of Charitie, whereby we are bound to ſuccour all the needie poore: hath hee brought in all the ſuffrages which men ſing for the dead, the merites and workes of ſupererogation, and other lyke abhominations. Vnder colour of the Saboth, which God had choſen and deputed to the ſanctification of his holy name, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his workes, in the remembrance and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his benefites and fauours. He hath ſet forth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of prophane Feaſtes, in which the name of God is blaſphemed, his ordinance deſpiſed, his couenant violated. But who can recount the wickedneſſe and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19757:96"/>
which are committed in theſe dayes? Vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the keyes and diſcipline of the Church, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and vſe whereof was giuen to the Miniſters law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, for a meane to conſerue the doctrine in it puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and keepe and entertaine good order in the Church, and to hinder the ſlaunders which by the inſolencie of ſome might happen: hath hee eſtabliſhed a tyrannie, whence is proceeded the whole diſſipation of the Church of God, the corruption of all eſtates: and the diminiſhing of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authoritie which God hath giuen to Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates. Some whereof, haue bene wholly ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as well of theyr goods, as dignities, by the Pope, and the Biſhops: and others ſo weakened, that they are in many places conſtrained to bowe the necke, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to theyr yoake and puiſſance. To be ſhort, this may be noted and obſerued in all the purpoſes and actions of the diuell: that as he is a Serpent, ſo hath hee alwayes ramped, and ſecretly crept (as it were) vnder the leaues and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome pietie, into the houſe of God, to place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, his pretended diſorder, confuſion and ruine. And we ſee, that now continuing and following his wonted prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, hee ſetteth foorth the omnipotencie of God (which to all the world is a plauſible and fauourable tytle) to the ende, that vnder the luſtre and brightneſſe of ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, hee might dazell the eyes of the ignorant, and hold them ſtill in the opinion and perſwaſion of theyr errorus; which haue no foundation in the word of God. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters beſeech the Readers, and all thoſe that haue the feare of God, or any zeale of his honour, to be wiſe, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to weigh and diſcouer the ſayd ſubtilties and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Diuell: and not to beleeue all ſpirites before they haue well ſounded and tryed them: and that they alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue not all the things, which vnder the name of God, may be propoſed vnto them; and which at the firſt, may ſeeme to tende and appertaine to his honour and glorie: but that they remember the Apoſtles admonition, to try the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1.</note>and that they verie carefully regarde the ende,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19757:97"/>
and ſcope of thoſe, which propoſe vnto them ſuch doctrine. And if there be any thing wherin heed muſt be taken of ſuch coſonages and fraudes, which are layd to ſurpriſe the ſimple; it is needfull, chiefly in this matter of the Omnipotency of God: whereof is the preſent queſtion. For the Miniſters do confeſſe, that it ought to be knowne, beleeued, and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally adored of all creatures, in heauen and in earth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they confeſſe, that the faithfull cannot haue a better foundation, nor better rampert to leane vnto, and ſuſtaine themſelues againſt all the endeuours, as well of the diuel, the world, and their other enemies: as alſo (to be ſhort) of all the temptations wherewith they might bee aſſayled and befie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>This Omnipotency (they confeſſe) is the hinge of the axeltree (as it were) wherevpon the world, with all it parts is turned and ſuſtained. They confeſſe moreouer, that the ſame Omnipotency is not only venerable to the Angels, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits in heauen, and to the elect and Saints vpon earth: but alſo terrible to the reprobates and diuels in hell. So that the one doth willingly embrace and ſubmit themſelues vnto it: and the others are conſtrained to bow vnder it, and yeeld vnto and obey the ſame.</p>
               <p>Laſtly they confeſſe, that it is infinite, and of incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible greatneſſe, to all creatures, as the wiſedome, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Iuſtice, truth, and the other vertues and proprieties of our God.</p>
               <p>This is that which the Miniſters beleeue and confeſſe of the Omnipotency of God: and that which they thinke, all Chriſtians ought thereof to beleeue and hold. Now to make good vſe of this Almightineſſe, and to apply it as is meete: we muſt iudge thereof, according to his will: and of his will, according to his word: So that we ought not to attribute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to the power of God, all things good and euill, ordered and diſordered, agreeable and contrary to his nature, falſe and true: But to well rule and order the thoughts and cogitations of Gods Omnipotencie, preſenting themſelues in our hearts: we muſt (for our part) meaſure the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19757:97"/>
to his holy will: and beleeue that it cannot be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, letted nor hindred by any other will or power, which wil or may be oppoſite vnto it. Which thing S. <hi>Augustine</hi> well teacheth in many places; as in the fift booke and 10. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Cittie of God: where ſpeaking of God, hee ſaith: That he is called almightie: becauſe he doth all whatſoeuer he will, and ſuffereth nothing if he will it not. Alſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Chapter of the 21. booke. For no other reaſon but this onely, is he called <hi>Almightie:</hi> that he can do all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he will doo. Alſo in the firſt Chapter of the booke <hi>De Symbolo ad Catec:</hi> Our God (ſaith he) doth all that which he will do: and that is his Almightineſſe. Alſo in the 119. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>De tempore;</hi> He is Almightie, to do all things that he will do, and ordaineth to be done. Theſe ſentences, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other lyke, found in the writings of that good Father, and other Auncients, do clearly teach vs, the maner how we may well make profit of the faith we haue of the omnipotency of God: That is in bringing vs backe to his will, and iudging of his will, by his word, and not by the falſe imaginations which therof we may conceiue in our minds: or that others would propoſe vnto vs: As did Sathan to Ieſus Chriſt, whom he would haue induced to caſt downe himſelfe headlong, vnder a vaine truſt of helpe from the omnipotencie of God. Euen ſo alſo, the <hi>Monarchians,</hi> who vnder colour and pretext of Gods omnipotencie, which of ſome myracles they gathered, would proue and eſtabliſh their hereſies, and take away the perſonall diſtinction which is betweene the Father and the ſonne, ſaying: That God being Almightie, could therefore make himſelfe Father and ſonne together. Of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> in theſe laſt times, is it alſo found, that for a vaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, which they put in the omnipotency of God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping he could nouriſh them, as he did the byrds, would not labour.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch lyke more great inconueniences may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all thoſe, that hauing ſuch wandering and ſtragling thoughts of the Omnipotency of God, wil not reſtraine nor reduce them to his will. And this we ſee is beſalue the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19757:98"/>
who willing to apprehend and meaſure the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of God by their owne imaginations, rather then by his will and word, are (as ſaith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> become vaine in their imagination, and their fooliſh heart is filled with darkneſſe. And willing to behold the Maieſtie of God out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and bounds which hee had ſhewed them in his word, haue bene intrapped and ouerwhelmed of his glorie. And that is befalne them, which in their reſolution, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues haue touched: to wit, that for not hauing taken the word of God for their guide, nor followed the ſteppes and pathes of his holy ſpirit, they do erre from the faith: which (contrarie to that which the Doctors doo thinke) is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed nor ouerthrowne by the conſideration of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and workes of God (which are as a myrror of his glorie and diuinitie): but in as much as by them wee were turned away from the promiſes of God: by the which we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his will, and almightineſſe; which doth warrant and aſſure vs of the effects, and accompliſhment of this holy will. Which may bee ſeene and clearly obſerued in them that were ſent by <hi>Moyſes</hi> to eſpie out and know the Land of the Cananites. Two of which, (namely <hi>Ioſua</hi> and <hi>Caleb)</hi> could neuer be withdrawne from the truſt they had in theyr God. For as much as turning their mindes from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all things which could make them doubt thereof, (as of the Fortreſſe and munition of Cities, the number, force, weapons, and experience of the countrie Inhabitants) they ſtayed their minds in the ſole conſideration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which God had made vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, the others forgetting the ſame promiſes, &amp; nought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering, but that which they ſaw before their eyes, they fell, and cauſed all the people to fall with them, into that curſed and damnable infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which they were ſo grieueuouſly puniſhed in the wilderneſſe, and excluded from enterance therevnto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of that thing, which God had promiſed to theyr Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And in the example of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whoſe faith abode firme and ſtable, by the conſideration chiefly of the promiſe and will of God, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> declareth. So that the conſideration
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19757:98"/>
of Gods Almightineſſe, came after, to maintaine &amp; ſecond that which he had of the promiſe. One may ſee by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, what daunger there is, to depart and draw backe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neuer ſo litle, from the word of God: by which we are guided to the knowledge of his will. And by the knowledge of his will, conducted to the conſideration and iudgement, which we ought to make and haue of his Almightineſſe.</p>
               <p>For want whereof, the Doctors are fallen into errors and raylings, which they propoſe to the Miniſters by their writing and concluſion of their reſolution. That is to ſay: that the body of Ieſus Chriſt may be in diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant: which is againſt the faith we ought to haue, and conſtantly retaine of the wiſedome, prouidence, and euerlaſting truth of our God: and againſt that likewiſe, which wee ought to haue and keepe of our Lords true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie.</p>
               <p>And that which they firſt alledge of S. <hi>Ierome</hi> againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilantius,</hi> nought ſerueth for the proofe and confirmation of their error. Where no other thing he ſaith: but that the ſoules of the Saints are not incloſed in a certaine priſon (as dreamed <hi>Vigilantius)</hi> but do follow the Lambe whitherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he goeth. Nor that which they alledge of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in the booke which he made of the pure care of the dead. For in that booke hee himſelfe confeſſeth, that he is incertaine of that which the Doctors doo propoſe, and are aſſured. And nomore doo the three authorities they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of Saint <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> whoſe ſentences ought to be taken, and vnder ſtood of the Sacrament, and not of the thing ſignified by the Sacrament: As in the next conference the Miniſters well hope to ſhew.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters do much maruel, that the Doctors ſo draw backe, and will not (but vnwillingly) enter into conference for defence of their Maſſe: and to gainſay the Supper ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the reformed Churches. For ſeeing they hold it for the principall foundation of theyr Religion: and propoſe the ſame for a meane of ſaluation to the whole
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19757:99"/>
world: (That they be not ſeene ſeducers, nor ouer credulous to beleeue or teach an incertaine and vnaſſured thing): they ſhould alwayes be prouided and furniſhed with reaſons, to the end they might approue, and readily defend that which they beleeue and ſay: and might conuince them alſo, that would deny the ſame: But in this, it appeareth to proceed of of an euill conſcience, which being timerous and fearefull, flyeth alwaies the combat, and the light. It is long time ſince the Miniſters haue importuned them to enter into the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conference of theſe two points, and to bring them thervnto, they haue propoſed vnto them, that it was the end for which the conference was appointed: which Madame <hi>de Buillon,</hi> (in whoſe fauour it was made) once or twiſe hath publikely required: and that they alſo had often proteſted, that they were not for other ende aſſembled with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then to ſatisfie therein the ſaid Lady of <hi>Buillon:</hi> and not to be examined by them, as they do falſly pretend. For the Miniſters haue no deſire to be examined of ſuch Doctors, being Prieſts: Ioyned, that to be taught in the points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to know the truth, they would not chooſe ſuch Maiſters, nor repaire vnto them, and frequent theyr ſchooles for that purpoſe. And yet notwithſtanding all the foreſayd remonſtrances often made and repeated by the Miniſters, the Doctors haue alwayes vntill now, deferred to conferre of the foreſaid points: awayting (as it is likely) that ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould be offered, to breake off, and determine the ſayd conference, before they had begunne to ſpeak thereof. Albeit, had they any zeale to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it is not much need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereafter to diſpute of the Saints, of Purgatory, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, and other like points: In regard of which, the moſt part of the world is at this day cleared. By meanes whereof, as well the Doctors, as the Miniſters, ought chiefly to inſiſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19757:99"/>
vpon theſe two points, and to endeuour (with them) to make them cleare and to be vnderſtood of each one, and not to vſe Sophiſtries and cauils to make them obſcure, and retaine thereby the ſimple in their ignorance: as the Doctors ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to do. Who (hauing left of ſet purpoſe the <hi>Theſes</hi> &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles propoſed to them by the Miniſters, with order &amp; good methode in their laſt anſweres) do confuſedly propoſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine queſtions culled out of their ſchoole diuinitie: euer more and more to fold vp this matter: And in ſo doing they withſtand (as euer hitherto they haue done) what ſo, and ſo often they haue proteſted: to wit, that they would examine the confeſſion of the reformed Churches: whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they haue not handled one only point in all the conference. Wherein they haue ſhewed, and yet plainly do ſhewe, the diſtruſt they haue to be able to withſtand ſo cleare and apparant trueth; as that which is propoſed in the ſaide confeſſion.</p>

               <p>THe Doctors, before they propoſe their Queſtions, in their Preface do call the Supper celebrated in the refor-Churches, a prophane and polluted banquet. And in ſo ſaying, they neither ſhame, nor feare, firſt to blaſpheme Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who inſtituted the ſame, and is the authour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and then to condemne the Apoſtles of Impietie, which ſo haue celebrated and taught it: together with all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches which followed and obſerued (whiles it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remained in it puritie) the forme and maner which the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and Apoſtles had taught, and left by their writings. But the Miniſters would willingly demaund of the Lordes our Maiſters, that they particularly note vnto them, wherein they can violate the inſtitution &amp; ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, and leaue his example, and that of his Apoſtles in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Supper?

Ieſus Chriſt did his Apoſtles and Diſciples: where after their publike confeſſion of ſinnes, and vnderſtandingly made in the name of all, they make a Sermon to the people: wherein according to the grace and power which God hath giuen them, they declare the cauſes, and occaſions, the end, the vſe, the points and effects of the holy Supper: to lift vp the hearts of the people to the conſideration of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible loue which the Father hath ſhewed towards his Church, when in fauour thereof, and for the ſaluation of the ſame, he hath not ſpared his owne ſonne, but expoſed him to a cruell and curſed death: to the end, that each one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde ſo great a grace and mercie, be kindled and inflamed in the loue of God: and tremble at the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and rebellious offences and ſinnes which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt his Maieſtie: and that with the ſorrow and diſpleaſure he hath for the ſame, he caſt himſelfe betweene the armes of his ſonne, ſtretched out vpon the Croſſe, to haue thereof a generall and full abolition. And that euen ſo, with ſuch a faith and repentance hee be prepared to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe worthily at the table of the Lord, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the good things which are there adminiſtred.

               <p>That done, he denounceth to all thoſe, not fully inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Catechiſed, that they depart: and to all them which are excommunicated, or attainted with ſome ſinnes or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous crimes (whereof they haue made no ſatisfaction to the Church) that they abſtaine therefrom, and pollute not the table of the Lord.

               <p>For anſwere to the ſeuenth queſtion, the Miniſters ſay, that they reiect and reproue the word <hi>Concomitance,</hi> and more alſo the thing thereby ſignified: for as much as that hath beene the cauſe, for which the common people hath bene depriued and excluded from one of the eſſentiall parts of the Sacrament: namely, from the participation of the Cuppe. And they ſay, that it is an attempt againſt the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19757:101"/>
diuine Maieſtie, to ſeperate what the ſonne of God hath ioyned together: and to deny to ſome of his members, that which he hath willed and commaunded to be common to all. Ioyned, that the reaſon of the Sacrament requireth it: which was inſtituted for our ſpirituall nouriſhment. The which (as doth the corporall) conſiſteth in drinke &amp; meate. To the ende then, that there be ſome correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them two, it behoueth, that as we are fed with the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt crucified: So be we alſo watered with his blood ſhead, for the remiſſion of ſinnes. To be ſhort, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Supper was chiefly inſtituted to ſhewe foorth the Lords death: and that in his death, his blood was ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his bodie: Meete it is, that the bread and wine be there adminiſtred, to repreſent the one and the other, and more clearly to propoſe vnto vs, all the miſtery of the death of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the eight queſtion, the Miniſters do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no other cauſe, nor meane of remiſſion of ſinnes, then the grace of God, the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and faith; whereby the effect of Gods grace, and the fruit of the death of Ieſus Chriſt are applied vnto vs.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the ninth queſtion, the Miniſters do ſay: that the faithfull comming to the Supper, do not come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receiue there a new Ieſus Chriſt, with whom they had not bene formerly conioyned: nor a new righteouſnes, which had not bene communicated vnto them. And they adde, that if ſome one did preſent himſelfe there without faith, (for want whereof he ſhould not be vnited, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and engraffed into Ieſus Chriſt, to bee partaker of his righteouſnes, life, and all other his gifts and bleſſings): that the holy Supper in that caſe, ſhould be as vnprofitable to him, as is meate vnptofitable to a dead man. But, if liuing by the meanes aforeſayd (namely the grace of God, the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and faith) he preſent himſelfe there in ſuch an eſtate: that then the graces of God be multiplied, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and more and more confirmed in him.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> brought not vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> a new
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19757:102"/>
righteouſneſſe: but ſealed and ratified that, which by the promiſe was communicated before vnto him. Which the faithfull, knowing in what degree of vertue they bee, yet ought they not to contemne the holy Supper, nor any way to abſtaine from it, when occaſion and meanes ſerue them to be there: Conſidering, that they cannot be ſo promoted nor aduaunced in the knowledge and feare of God, and in the faith of his promiſes, that they may not yet growe and profit (in what eſtate ſoeuer they be) by the meanes which God hath therefore left and ordained in his Church. And impoſſible it is, for a man hauing true faith in his heart, to do otherwiſe; ſeeing hee hath the commoditie thereof: For as much as the nature of faith is not to apprehend the promiſes of God onely: but alſo to engender, and bring forth in the heart of the faithfull, a will to obey him, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements and ordinances.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the firſt Article which the Doctors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe touching their Maſſe, the Miniſters ſay: that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do openly blaſpheme Ieſus Chriſt, to authoriſe with his name, and by his example, ſuch an abhomination. And that they alſo mocke the Church &amp; the world, in preaching and writing ſuch Impieties.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the ſecond Article of the Maſſe, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſay: that there is in the Church no other ſacrifice, by which men are reconciled to God, and which maketh him mercifull and fauourable towards them (by appeaſing his wrath) then that onely and alone, which Ieſus Chriſt hath once offered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe to his Father. The vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being eternall, to ſanctifie all beleeuers, and to obtain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for euer, remiſſion and aboliſhment of ſinnes: there is no need of any other, nor that which he hath once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, be euer reiterate.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the third Article, the Miniſters ſay: that they which approue the Maſſe, and other Prieſthood, then that of Ieſus Chriſt; and wil eſtabliſh for remiſſion of ſinnes an other ſacrifice, then that he himſelfe, with his body vpon the Croſſe offered, are Antichriſts: and aboliſh (as much
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19757:102"/>
as in them lyeth) all the vertue and fruite of the death &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the fourth Article, the Miniſters do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, to wit: <hi>That where remiſſion is,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.</note>
                  <hi>there is no more offering for ſinne.</hi> Now ſo it is, that by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, remiſſion hath bene obtained for vs: as by infinit paſſages of ſcripture appeareth. It followeth then, that there is no more oblation for ſin, neither in the Maſſe, nor out of the Maſſe. And if there be none for the liuing, leſſe is there for the dead.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the fift, the Miniſters maintaine, that the Communion is of the eſſence of the Supper, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth in the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 10. and 11. Chapters. And as it is carried by the Cannon it ſelfe, and other things about the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the ſixt, the Miniſters ſay three things: Firſt, that the Popiſh Maſſe is no Sacrament: then that the body of Ieſus Chriſt is not there. And therof conclude, that then the bread and wine there remaining, ought not to be adored: which being creatures cannot be adored, but that they which adore them be Idolators.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the ſeuenth and laſt Article, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay contrary to the Doctors, that there is not any thing in the Maſſe, which is not either directly, or indirectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters for concluſion admoniſh the Doctors, &amp; entreat them, not to depart (as they haue formerly done) out of the bounds of the matter, now propoſed for diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To the end, that theſe two points which are now in debate betweene them, may be wholly and perfectly decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the content and edification of them that ſhall reade the Acts of this conference.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctors, after their reſolution giuen vpon the Artice of Gods Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, were not determined to returne any more therevnto: as hauing ſufficiently handled that matter. But the horrour they haue of the new blaſphemies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the laſt writing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, hath incyted them (contrary to their purpoſe) although not to reply, at the leaſt to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Miniſters and the reader of this preſent Conference, of the ſaid execrable blaſphemies: which they are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confeſſe, that will not acknowledge the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Aultar: but dare therby deny the power of God himſelf. The conſideration wherof (as the Doctors hope) wil not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Catholikes in the faith of the ſaid article: but alſo (by Gods aſſiſtance) wil bring back many which are ſtrayed, ſeparating themſelues from the Church Catholike: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall vnderſtand the deteſtable errors &amp; blaſphemies which do follow the contradiction of the reall preſence of the body and bloud of our Lord in the Sacrament. Which alſo ſhould ſerue for the conuerſion of the Miniſters themſelues: would they without paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examine the reaſons &amp; acts which haue bene propoſed vnto them, touching the power of God: and ſincerely iudge therof: as reſiſting the holy ſpirit, in ſtead of acknowledging their errors, they are turned to all maner of reproach and iniury againſt them, which of good will would admoniſh them; and haue taxed them, that they tended not but to roote them out. Which thing the Doctors neuer min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and deſire not but the ſaluation of the Miniſters, &amp; of all thoſe that are ſeperated from the true Catholike Church.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19757:103"/>
Of which, their preachings ſhall beare witneſſe: wherein they ordinarily exhort the people to pray vnto God for them. True it is, that they require the extirpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sathan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rooting out of all hereſies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe doctrine, rather by the preaching of Gods word, then by all other meanes. And they wonder why the Miniſters are ſo pricked againſt them in their two laſt anſweres: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they haue giuen them no occaſion thereof, but haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it lightly, for no other reaſon, but becauſe the Doctors haue written, that many propoſitions ſet forth by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, contained blaſphemies, which they ſhould content themſelues to denie, or to proue that there are none, and leaue the iudgement thereof to the readers: without ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into ſuch hotte coller, ſeeing they profeſſe to bee ſo much mortified, patient, and modeſt, that albeit one ſhould reproach them, they would not reproach againe. They ſhould alſo well remember the faire tytles with which they honour the Catholique doctrine: as with the name of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Idolatrie, impietie, abhomination, and many other like: yea not ſparing the perſons: calling the Popes, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp; Prieſts, Antichriſts, &amp; Miniſters of Sathan: againſt which reproaches, the Doctors content themſelues to ſhewe by the word of God, when occaſion ſerueth, that ſuch tytles agree neither with the perſons, nor yet the doctrine by them preached. Now although that the Miniſters and their furie deſerue a ſharpe reply, yet to mittigate their ſo inflamed hearts, the Doctors will not anſwere to the iniuries which touch their perſons and eſtates: referring the whole to the iudgement of the vnpaſſionate readers: and will only touch the points which concerne the doctrine.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Miniſters do great wrong to the Doctors and their like, in comparing them to Donatiſts, and falſly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto them, that they tie the Church in a certaine place, (as did the Donatiſts) which placed it onely in <hi>Affrike.</hi> For it is manifeſt to all, that the Doctors know not, nor confeſſe any other Church, then the Catholique: which (as it name importeth) hath bene viſible ſince the Apoſtles time, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19757:104"/>
hath her ſpreading through the world, in what region, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or place ſoeuer, the faithfull beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt are. Although they reuerence the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as chiefe and principall among others: as <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and other the auncient Fathers, haue giuen it this honour, to confeſſe it to be principall and mother (as it were) of other Churches; with more iuſt reaſon, may ſuch obiection be retorted againſt the Miniſters: who cannot ſay their Church to be Catholike: hauing taken it beginning in our time, ſeene &amp; known at <hi>Geneua,</hi> founded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the priuate opinion of one man: without that in former time one could ſhewe ſuch opinion to haue beene holden in any Nation whatſoeuer. Which thing ſhall be handled in it order, when they ſhall examine the errors by the Miniſters maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt this Article; <hi>I beleeue the holy Catholique Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Miniſters ſhould not haue alledged the violence, crueltie, and furie of the Donatiſts, againſt the Catholiques: for ſuch example doth condemne them, and their like. But becauſe it doth not but bring freſh to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the paſſed euils, which <hi>Fraunce</hi> hath endured by the inſtigation of the Miniſters, for feare to incyte them further to ſay new iniuries: the Doctors will not dwell long vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter. Neuertheleſſe, they ſhewe vnto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that the Donatiſts reproached the Catholiques, that they endured perſecution by them, and that to roote them out, they ſollicited the Emperours and Magiſtrates euen as the Miniſters doo blame the Doctors. Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: firſt to deſire the conuerſion of all Sects, and in caſe they will not come to repentance, that the Magiſtrates by good and holy lawes may execute ſuch puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as God bee not ſo outragiouſly blaſphemed, and the people grieued. And therein they follow the doctrine of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> expreſſed in an Epiſtle, ſent <hi>Advincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin contra Donatistas.</hi> Where he confeſſeth, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques did perſecute the Donatiſts: and that contrariwiſe the Donatiſts alſo afflicted the Catholiques: but that the perſecutions were different. That thoſe of the Catholiques
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19757:104"/>
were not executed but by the Magiſtrate, and came of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to roote out the euill, which hindred the peace and tranquilitie publike. And contrariwiſe, the perſecution by the Donatiſts, was made without authoritie of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and proceeded of malice: which pretended but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and ruine: and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> declareth that the firſt was good, and of God: and the ſecond wicked, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of Sathan. And to this purpoſe he bringeth many excellent examples of holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>This hath bene ſomewhat largely handled, to purge the Doctors of the ſlaunder impoſed on them by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: where they reproach them, that in their preachings, writings, and conferences, they ſearch but onely to roote out the Miniſters: whom they haue alwayes perſecuted. And they interpret the ſame as therefore proceeding from a particular hate of the Doctors againſt them: and not of charitie, and zeale of truth, and of the conuerſion, as well of the Miniſters, as of thoſe which are ſeduced and abuſed by them. The Doctors therein call God to witneſſe, and doo proteſt the contrarie, and pray the Miniſters to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, attending therevpon the iudgement of God, who is the onely ſearcher of the hearts and affections of men.</p>
               <p>As touching the Article where the Miniſters ſay that God is almightie, becauſe he can do whatſoeuer he will, had they liſted to read the writings of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> (whoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine they diſdaine) well had they knowne, that this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is no reaſon. Becauſe the Angels, and they which are bleſſed, conforming themſelues alwayes to the will of God, can doo all things that they will doo: and there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which can hinder the effect of theyr will, and yet are they not almightie. And as touching the ſaying of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> in taking it ſo as the Miniſters do take it; The reaſon of Gods omnipotencie is ouer-weake and falſe. But to haue the true vnderſtanding of this ſentence, it behoueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there is a difference betweene the actuall will of God, and the power of will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:19757:105"/>
For God can wil many things which he willeth not, nor euer will. And euen ſo can he will more then he actually willeth: whereby they ought rather to meaſure his omnipotencie, then to meaſure it according to his actuall will. And thus muſt be interpreted the text of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe extendeth to all things which he can will, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he actually willeth. And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Miniſters, being deſtitute of teſtimonie of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, albeit they vaunted in their former anſwere, to haue learned this reaſon by the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>In the article following, the Miniſters by ſlaunder doo falſly taxe the Doctors, to haue cut off ſome words of theyr laſt writing: which will not be found to bee true. For the text of the Doctors beareth theſe words. It is not to bee doubted, but that aboue all conceit and imagination of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit, the power of God is great, infinite, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. Where it clearly appeareth, that the Doctors ſpeake generally of all conceit and imagination, without any exception thereof, be it of wiſedome or folly. Therfore was it not needfull to expreſſe the words of the Miniſters, ſeeing that the Doctors ſpake generally. And that which goeth before doth ſhewe the ſame: as the Miniſters haue cyted it: where it is ſaid, that the Doctors reproued the ſaid Miniſters, becauſe they gaue ſome reſtraint and limitation of the omnipotencie of God. For as much as they would not ſtretch it generally to all the things which men can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and in their mindes imagine. Where the words gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and all things do ſufficiently declare, that the Doctors haue willed to comprehend end the fooliſh phantaſies and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations themſelues, which men may apprehend accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to humane iudgement, and haue willed to cut off no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the writing of the Miniſters: who peraduenture haue thought, the Doctors would not ſay, that God can doo all that which a fooliſh braine can imagine: as fearing they would inferre againſt them, that God then ſhould commit ſome folly. Which would not follow: For albeit that ſome things be eſteemed follyes in the iudgement of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19757:105"/>
men, neuertheleſſe ſeeing they be in themſelues poſſible, they may bee done of God; but wiſely, although humane ſence do iudge the contrary: euen as in many iudgements man is deceiued: eſteeming that folly, which (as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> is wiſedome to wards God. The Doctors then ſay, that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note>all things imaginable to man, are without exception to bee done as touching God: the things excepted, which imply contradiction to be, and not to be. Which cannot be done in regard of the repugnancie comming on their part, and not by default of the power of God. The Doctors pray them that ſhall bee able to reade theſe Conferences, to note, that the Miniſters are alwaies found falſe accuſers, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they taxe the Doctors with ſlaunder: as in the former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they remaine thereof conuinced.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters ſhall finde themſelues alſo falſe accuſers in the article following: there where they cut off the ſaying of the Doctors, and falſly impute vnto them, that they haue written, God can do ſomething againſt order. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue well ſaid, that it is blaſphemy to ſay, that God could do nothing againſt the order by him eſtabliſhed in the world. Where appeareth the ſlaunder of the Miniſters, who haue clipped the ſentence, and taken away theſe words <hi>[Establiſhed in the world].</hi> In that they inferre, it is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſay, that God can doo a thing which is not well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. It is doubleſſe, but to doo ſome matter againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world, importeth not ſome thing diſordered: but onely a mutation and chaunge of order, without any diſorder, which the Miniſters confeſſe in their article following.</p>
               <p>The Doctors haue in great execration the blaſphemies contained in the next article. Of which the firſt is, that one body to bee in diuers places, is a thing derogatorie to the truth of God: for as much as in God there ſhould bee yea and nay. So that the Miniſters doo ſay, that God ſhould not be true, if hee cauſed one body to bee in diuers places. And yet teach they not, nor can teach, that God hath euer ſaid, that one body could not bee in diuers places. It impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19757:106"/>
the wiſedome of God: becauſe that in his workes ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould be diſorder and confuſion. Wherin they likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God ſhould not be wiſe, if he cauſed one body at one inſtant, to be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>The third is, that ſuch a thing repugneth the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of God. For in ſuch a worke there ſhould be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So that, ſo farre off is it (after the Miniſters opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that God in ſo dooing ſhould bee almightie; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe he ſhould be imperfect and weake.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that were ſuch a thing done, it ſhould bee againſt the eternall and vnchangeable will of God: and therefore God ſhould bee mutable: which blaſphemies doo neceſſarily diſgorge a manifeſt Atheiſme: to wit, that God ſhould not bee God, if hee made one bodie to bee in diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant: For God cannot be but true, wiſe, almightie, and vnchangeable: which blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies the Doctors doo content themſelues to quote and marke onely: and to admoniſh what ſimple ſtuffe iſſueth from the doctrine of them, which denie the reall preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament, without dwelling vpon further confutation of them: as beeing too manifeſt, and hauing regard to that which <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaith: that ſome hereſies there be: which to diſcouer, is to refute them.</p>
               <p>In the article following, do they gaineſay that which ſo often they haue ſaid, that God could not cauſe one bodie to be in diuers places at one inſtant: becauſe it repugneth the order which he hath eſtabliſhed in the world. As if God could not do otherwiſe, then according to the order alreadie by him eſtabliſhed. In the preſent article they confeſſe, that God can change and vnchange the ſaid order. From which confeſſion the Doctors drawe ſuch an argument: God can chaunge and alter the order which hee hath eſtabliſhed in the world: and that without preiudice to his truth, wiſdome, power, and vnchangeable will. Therefore can he chaunge the order, by which he hath eſtabliſhed (as the Miniſters wil ſay) that one body ſhuld be but in one place; &amp; cauſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19757:106"/>
(the order being chaunged) that one body ſhall bee in diuers places: without that the ſame is any way deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to his truth, wiſedome, power, and will. And that by conſequence, God of his omnipotencie can cauſe one body to be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>As touching the article of the diſtinction of the will of God, the Miniſters do confound the whole: vnderſtanding nothing in the ſaid diſtinction, no more then in that which they ſay, that one body to be in two places, is in the ranke of things which God hath declared by his word, againſt the which he can do nothing. The queſtion is firſt of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of God, which is reduced to his power, and not to his eſſence, and to that which he is in himſelfe: as to be one, wiſe, good: which things belong not to the matter of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, but of the eſſence in himſelfe. Secondly, what reaſon is there to confer the being of one body in one place: or to know whether God can cauſe it to be in two or many places: with the eſſence of God, which is one, incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, &amp;c. ſeeing that ſuch things of number, pertaine to the eſſence of God, and power to make one body in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth nothing properly belong vnto it, and is not refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the ſame. Thirdly, the Miniſters ſay, that God by his word haih declared his will, becauſe he was one: which nothing ſerueth to the preſent matter. But (pardoning the Miniſters ſuch follies) how dare they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare with the matter of Gods eſſence, that which is in queſtion of the being of one body in one, or in diuers places? ſeeing God hath neuer ſaid that he could not do it: as he hath manifeſtly ſhewed all the other perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which pertaine to the diuine eſſence. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that it ſufficeth the Miniſters to fill vp paper, without founding their ſaying vpon ſolid reaſon.</p>
               <p>For as much as they repute it ſlaunder, when one cutteth off ſome of their words, albeit the full ſence abide: the Doctors do wonder, that the Miniſters haue not feared the like obiections to them. But they are ſo accuſtomed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that they cannot beware thereof. As in the article where mention is made of the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a body, they paſſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19757:107"/>
that ouer in ſilence, which giueth ſolution to theyr difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The Doctors haue defined a bodie to be a kind of firme quantitie, of three dimenſions, length, breadth, and deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: which definition comprehendeth the whole eſſence of one body, which is of the predicament of quantitie: and no mention is any way made of the circumſcription of place. The Miniſters ſay, that the Doctors by their definition, doo limit the body, and therefore it is circumſcript. But they haue maliciouſly omitted (as it is to bee ſuppoſed) this little word <hi>[place].</hi> For the queſtion is not, whether a body be lymited, or no, ſeeing that no man doth call it infinite. But the queſtion is, whether it bee eſſentially circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of place, ſo that it cannot bee a body, if it bee not in place: for as much as the Miniſters could not anſwere to the argument of the Doctors, they haue cut off that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed them.</p>
               <p>The foure next articles deſerue no new reply: and therefore the Doctors ſend backe the readers to that which heretofore hath bene ſaid. They onely admoniſh, that it is a great matter which the Miniſters do hold, that a myracle could not bee done in the body of Ieſus Chriſt, without chaunge of his nature: and ſuch an opinion do they impoſe vpon <hi>Instine,</hi> who hath ſaid and maintained (with the other Auncients) that the body of Ieſus Chriſt paſſed through the doores without chaunge of nature, albeit that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the myracle, was wrought in the nature of the body, without changing the ſame: but in giuing it a ſpirituall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and perfection, to wit, ſubtiltie, aboue the natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a body.</p>
               <p>With like boldneſſe, call the Miniſters the ſcripture of the Camells paſſage through the eye of a needle, a parable and ſimilitude: as they doo that of the Supper, and all others which withſtand their errors. And the better to eſcape, they ſay that God ſaueth not, but changeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth the rich man: and ſo cannot make a Camell to paſſe through the eye of a needle, without diminiſhing and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his groſſeneſſe. But the Miniſters will not conſider,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19757:107"/>
that when our Lord ſpake of the rich man his entrie into the kingdome of heauen, he put not the difficultie in the entring of the kingdome properly, but in the conuerſion of the rich man: by which, hee ſhould obtaine the entrie and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of heauen. Therefore when our Lord ſaith, that it is more eaſie for God, to cauſe a Camell (or Cable) to enter through the eye of a needle, then a rich man the kingdome of heauen: hee intendeth to compare the conuerſion of a rich man (which is vnpoſſible with men) to the paſſage of a Camell abiding in his groſſeneſſe: otherwiſe, there ſhould bee no apparance of difficultie: and our Lord would not haue ſaide, that ſuch a thing had beene impoſſible to men.</p>
               <p>The Doctors ſay moreouer, that they haue not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this place, to proue and inferre properly the penitration of dimenſions: but to ſhewe, that God can make a body to occupie place, not proportionable to it greatneſſe: which is as well contrarie to the nature of a groſſe and thicke body, as that one body be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters do boaſt, that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to confeſſe any thing of Gods workes, alledged by the Doctors out of the ſcripture: it followeth not that the Doctors out of the ſcripture: it followeth not that the Doctors haue brought forth vaine reaſons to conſtraine and conuince them. And for the ſame referre them to the Acts of the Conference. And as touching the knowledge, whether God could do ſuch myracles alledged, aboue the nature of a body, the Miniſters cannot eſcape whatſoeuer euaſion they pretend, vnconuinced (if not openly, yet ſilently at leaſt) to haue denied, as well the power as the deed: For, affirming that God canot cauſe one body to be in diuers places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repugneth the order by him eſtabliſhed in the world, and his wiſdome and wil, which diſpoſeth all by good order; and that it was againſt the nature of a body: albeit as much may bee ſaid thereof, as may truly bee ſaid of all the other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mentioned touching one body: and that there are like reaſons: in confeſſing the one, they muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all the others, that there is the like reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:19757:108"/>
The Miniſters vnable to giue any difference, and ſhewe why God cannot do the one, and that he can doo the others, haue ſilently conſented thervnto. And although they would neuer confeſſe the debt, and yeeled themſelues vanquiſhed, as they do boaſt, it is no maruell: for it is the nature of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, to be obſtinate, and reſiſt the truth, what reaſons ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are propoſed vnto them. The Scribes and Phariſies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer confeſſed to be ouercome of our Lord, albeit his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were vnreproueable. And albeit they that withſtood S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> had nothing to anſwere, yet left they not to reſiſt the holy Ghoſt, which ſpake by him: as the Miniſters doo reſiſt the ſame ſpirit, which ſpeaketh in the ſcripture, and by the mouth of the auncient Fathers, concerning myracles done in the body of Ieſus Chriſt aboue nature. Which the Miniſters do repugne, by I know not what vaine and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtarting holes. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſpeaketh well to this purpoſe, <hi>Haeretici conuinci poſſunt, non perſuaderi.</hi> Heretikes may bee conuinced, not perſwaded. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> writeth: <hi>Duritia baeretica vincenda eſt, non ſuadenda.</hi> Hereticall obduration is to be vanquiſhed, not perſwaded.</p>
               <p>And as touching the iniuries which the Miniſters in this behalfe do multiply againſt the Doctors, in that doo they imitate all the aduerſaries of truth, and giue teſtimony of the diſquiet which ſuch manner of people endure in theyr mindes, when their errors are ſhewed them. Of whom the Doctors haue pittie and compaſſion, &amp; pray God to reſtore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their right ſences. For as much as they know, that the conuerſion of an heretike, is one of the matters reſerued to the omnipotencie of God.</p>
               <p>In vaine doo the Miniſters labour to produce ſtore of Greeke, to ſhewe that <hi>Penetrare Caelos,</hi> dooth not ſignifie to paſſe the heauens without opening: becauſe the Verbe <hi>[Dierchestai]</hi> is found, for paſſing where there is an opening. But the Doctors neuer ſaid, that <hi>[Penetrare]</hi> or <hi>[Diercheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thai]</hi> may not be applied to open places: or that one pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in opening of them: for well do they know, that it is met with in all Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:19757:108"/>
They haue well ſaid, that the Miniſters would inferre a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all opening of the heauen, by the rigor and proprietie of the verbe <hi>Aperire:</hi> So might they alſo inferre, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were ſhut in the aſcention of Ieſus Chriſt, by the verbes <hi>Dierchesthai,</hi> and <hi>Penetrare,</hi> which ſtrictly do ſignifie, to pearce or paſſe through, without that of it ſelfe it importeth an opening: albeit a man may vſe the ſame where there is an open paſſage. But by the rigour of theyr ſignification can they not neceſſarily inferre an opening, if the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bee not ſhewed from ſome other place, by ſome word, or euident condition of the thing pierced: as it is in the texts by the Miniſters alledged. Now in the aſcention theſe words <hi>[Diercheſthas],</hi> and <hi>[Penetrare],</hi> are put for to pierce: and no word is there added, which importeth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the heauens. The condition of which, nor the ſtate of the glorified body of Ieſus Chriſt, doo not conſtraine that one neceſſarily vnderſtand an opening to haue beene made, to ſuffer the body of Ieſus Chriſt to enter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Doctors wel reaſon of the rigor of <hi>[Penetrare:]</hi> as the Miniſters did of the rigour of <hi>[Aperire:]</hi> which more often is found in the ſcripture without ſignification of the reall opening of the heauens, then <hi>[Penetrare]</hi> is found in the ſcripture to ſignifie a diuiſion and actuall cutting of the heauens. For <hi>Aperire Caelos,</hi> is often found for imaginary and ſpirituall opening; and hardly is <hi>Penetrare Caelos</hi> euer found for actuall diuiſion of the heauens. And therefore had the Doctors better reaſon to conclude, by the rigour of the verbe <hi>Dierchesthai,</hi> or <hi>Penetrare,</hi> (to pierce without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diuiſion of the heauens) then the Miniſters had to inferre the opening of them by the verbe <hi>Aperire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Miniſters in the laſt article obiect to the Doctors, that they haue paſſed ouer ſome places of ſcripture, by which it appeareth, that faith is the worke of God, whervnto (ſay the Doctors) that in ſome one of their writings they haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly confeſſed, that faith, in as much as it is a gift of God, it is a worke of God: but in as much as he that beleeueth worketh together with God, in beleeuing (for <hi>Nemo credit, niſivole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:19757:109"/>
no man beleeueth vnleſſe he be willing) it is a humane work. And it is not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one ſelf-ſame work, for diuers cauſes to be a worke of God, and a worke of man. And where they ſay, that the auncient Fathers haue ſaid (if not in proper, yet in equiualent termes) that God could not cauſe one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be in diuers places: that is falſe. And the Miniſters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue, nor can ſhewe the ſame: and contradict their laſt writing. For bringing the reaſon, why the Fathers haue not expreſly ſaid it: It was (ſaid they) becauſe they neuer thought that ſuch an abſurditie would euer fall into the braine of man. Which reaſon ought to haue place, for the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in termes equiualent, as in expreſſe termes, ſith one ſelfe-ſame thing is ſignified as well by the one, as by the other.</p>
               <p>As touching the reſt, the Miniſters neuer anſwer to the principall point, whereof they haue bene ſo often admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: and they efſoones admoniſh them, ſhould they a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times call this ſaying a repetition: to wit, that they are required to bring ſcripture, to proue that it repugneth the order eſtabliſhed in the world, the truth, the wiſedome, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, and vnchangeable will of God, that one body may be in two places: which thing they cannot do: but they will anſwere, as they are accuſtomed: that is to ſay, nothing. Wherein appeareth, that their doctrine is not founded vpon Gods word, but vpon their owne opinion, or particular inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which cannot be but of Sathan. For it cannot be of the holy Ghoſt which is againſt the common conſent of the Church vniuerſall. And vpon the ſame are alſo founded, the other articles of their religion: albeit they diſguiſe them, and promiſe Gods word to euery purpoſe.</p>

               <head>A ſhort Aduertiſement of the Doctors, vpon the Miniſters Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, touching the omnipotencie of God.</head>
               <p>THe Doctors are aſtonied at the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Miniſters, in their words and writings. For they themſelues from the beginning of the Conference, haue neuer had patience
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19757:109"/>
to proſecute &amp; conclude one onely point, without mingling other things therewithall, impertinent to the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: as ſhal appeare by the reading of the acts. And before their reſolution made of the omnipotencie of God, they haue heaped vp all the articles which they could remember, and throwne one vpon an other without cauſe or reaſon. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Doctors at their requeſt, had propoſed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Supper: And after diſpute of the omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God (to make preſent the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament) to come orderly to ſhewe and proue, that the will of God hath bene ſuch, and that there it is. But the Doctors well vnderſtand the good cuſtome of all them of the pretended reformed religion: which is, to ſpet in the eyes of Chriſtians, all the articles of the Religion, and theyr inuented filthineſſe, all on one threed: to the end, that nought bee determined, that all abide in confuſion, and that the Serpent glide awaye, hauing caſt his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, by obſeruation of the Miniſters anſweres, it ſhall bee ſeene and knowne, that they neuer ſtay vpon any certaine and the ſame anſwere, but rather of an act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of the ſcripture: where of euery queſtion, they haue giuen therevnto diuers impertinent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnſufferable anſweres. Of which the Doctors do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them that can read theſe Conferences, and pray them to haue regard to the ſame, and thereof referre them to their iudgement.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Doctors admoniſh the Miniſters, that they may, or ought to knowe, that all Sects of our times doo caſt before the eyes of thoſe whom they will abuſe, the ſame beadroll of Articles, which the Miniſters in theyr Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution haue gathered together, to get audience againſt the Church Catholique, and to bring in theyr hereſies and errors, vnder the name of the glorie of GOD. Whereof they boaſte to bee defenders as well as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. And therefore are they not ſo acceptable in theyr opinions and concluſions, that the Miniſters can
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19757:110"/>
pretend any right, to exalt the power and glorie of God, by ſuch mingling and confounding of all matters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the Doctors ſhewe, that they may with better reaſon retort againſt the Miniſters, the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they pretend to inferre, of the ſubtiltie and craft of Sathan: which is (as they write) that Sathan vnder faire ſhewe of pietie, glideth like a Serpent into the Church of GOD, to put therein diſorder and confuſion: and in the end to aſſaile God himſelfe. The Doctors do pray each one to conſider in himſelfe, whether the Miniſters purpoſe be not ſuch by their deductions, and generally by the principall points of theyr doctrine. For vnder faire pretext to roote out ſome abuſes and errors againſt the word of the Lord, which they falſly ſtudie to perſwade the world to bee in the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: And vnder the ſhadow to preach, that they ſeeke the aduancement of the name of the ſame Lord, they goe about to ſpoile God of all his proprieties and perfection, albeit they no more declare it, then Sathan told his meaning to the firſt man.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Miniſters abaſe the merit and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and open a doore by their doctrine to all vices and ſinnes. Be it ſo, the Doctors will not repeate what the Miniſters haue held, concerning the omnipotencie of God: becauſe they ſhall fill their writings therewithall. But ſo it is, that in their goodly reſolution (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſuite it with ſeemely words) that God cannot (after them) but ſo much as they pleaſe to receiue of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and will: which they diſguiſe after their owne ſence, when it is found declared in the ſcripture. Againſt the goodneſſe of God they hold that he is the author and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of euill, and of ſinne. Againſt his mercie they teach, that he neuer pardoneth, nor will pardon a man which ſhall maliciouſly oppoſe himſelfe to the knowledge of the truth: or which ſhall reſiſt the ſame. Againſt the merit of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and paſſion of the Croſſe, in proper termes haue they written, that had Ieſus Chriſt onely dyed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19757:110"/>
by the ſorrowes of corporall death, and by the ſheading of his whole bloud, he had nought done, nor profited for our redemption: if beeing on the Croſſe hee had not endured in his ſoule, the paines of the damned before his death: and other horrible blaſphemies contained in the atticle of the diſcent into hell. The Miniſters do alſo inſtruct their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that murther, adultery, robbery, theft, and euery crime whatſoeuer, is but a veniall ſinne to one predeſtinate, who is neuer (ſay they) out of the fauour of God, what thing ſoeuer he commit: and do aſſure their faithfull, and thoſe of theyr Church to beleeue firmly, that they are in grace, and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, which is in plaine termes (albeit the Miniſters will otherwiſe excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to giue leaue and licenſe to commit all wickedneſſe, and other articles which the Doctors will veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, where the matter ſhall require the ſame.</p>
               <p>If the Miniſters denie theſe points to be in their writings, and publiſhed in their Sect, the places of <hi>Caluins</hi> bookes which the Doctors noted in the Margin, wil teſtifie the ſame. To be briefe, behold the glory of God, and of his ſonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, wherevnto tend the Miniſters, by the rooting out of the pretended impieties, mentioned in many articles of their laſt reſolution. For briefe anſwere wherevnto, the Doctors doo ſay, that ſome things by ſlaunder of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are falſly imputed to the Catholique Church: that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are expreſſed in the holy ſcripture: and others drawne from the ſame, and confirmed by the traditions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the vniuerſall conſent of the firſt Chriſtian church: the deceits excepted which the Miniſters adde in euery ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. And ſo ſhall it bee ſhewed and proued at the leaſt in time and place, if the Miniſters haue patience to handle in it ranke euery difficultiie: but if to make their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, they perſiſt to mingle all together, the Doctors do proteſt to mocke therat without anſwere. Moreouer, the Miniſters in generall, doo rightly attribute to the power of God: and ſay well, that the certaine knowledge thereof, is to be taken by the ſcriptures, which hath bene alwaies auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them by the Doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:19757:111"/>
Very well ſay they alſo, that it is infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. But when they come to particularities, and to ſhew wherein the omnipotencie lieth and conſiſteth, then forget they holy ſcriptures, and without them do meaſure the ſame, according to the wiſdome and eternall wil of God: &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order eſtabliſhed in the world: and as though they remembred no more that ſuch power were infinit, they tie it to the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, proprietie, &amp; natural order of creatures: As though to make ſomething againſt, or aboue the order, condition, &amp; natural proprietie of the creatures, were a thing repugnant to the wiſedome, nature, and wil of God. Behold the ſhort reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Doctors can gather of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters opinion, touching the omnipotencie of God: which ſhall appeare by their writings and anſweres giuen to the ſaid Doctors. And as touching S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which they produce for them, he hath bene anſwered heretofore.</p>
               <p>The Doctors refer them to their writings, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that which the Miniſters do falſly tax the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold, as a ſufficient argument (to infer ſome matter to be done of God) to ſhewe that he hath power to do it. The reſolutions and obiections of the Doctors do plainly containe the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The Doctors are alſo falſly accuſed by the Miniſters, as if they had affirmed the faith wholly contrary to nature. Who haue onely ſaid, that the contradiction ordinarily made to faith, founded vpon the word, commeth from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of naturall things, againſt the power of God.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the ſcripture in <hi>Geneſis</hi> alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that he &amp; his wife made ſome difficultie touching the promiſe of God.

And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſufficiently declareth the ſpeech of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from his firſt vocation, vntil after ſuch aſſurance, without putting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in the Hiſtorie, of that which was before, or after ſuch aſſurance: as is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:19757:111"/>
The Doctors ſay: they haue better concluded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the faith, we ought to haue of the power of God (to make one bodie in diuers places) then the Miniſters haue done: which haue not any word of God to ſettle theyr faith vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to beleeue that God could not do it, or that it repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the wiſedome, prouidence, and eternall vertue, or the humanitie of Ieſus Chriſt, yea the nature of a ſimple bodie only. But concerning all that, the Miniſters do truſt in their owne preſumption, and particular reuelation, without one onely paſſage of ſcripture, wherevpon they might ſtay theyr opinion. Contrariwiſe, haue the Doctors founded their faith (not on the power of God onely, to make one body in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, but to beleeue the deed, and that God hath ſo willed) on the holy ſcripture: as in theyr Reſolution is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: with the paſſages of auncient Fathers, which they to this end haue alledged. Which are ſo plaine, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters cannot iuſtly but affirme the ſame. And their ſtarting holes ſhall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced by the ſimple reading of the bookes.</p>
               <p>For all the reſt of the Miniſters reſolution (where are mightie iniuries, Impoſtures, and ſlanders againſt the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) they anſwere nothing: hauing regard to the Miniſters manner of dealing. And the Doctors alſo do well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it ſhould be loſt labour to teach the Miniſters: who more eſteem their owne particular reuelation, for their whole inſtruction, then all the doctrine and remonſtrance of the Church vniuerſall, and all Chriſtians together. And freely do the Doctors pardon all the iniuries they haue done them, as people voyd of ſound ſence, and without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which thing they declare, by theyr maner of dealing.</p>

               <head>An obiection of the Supper by the Doctors, againſt the anſwere of the Ministers.</head>
               <p>WHy the Doctors in the beginning of the conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue not touched the Article of the Supper, it ſufficiently appeareth by the firſt dayes Acts. And a deceit it is, which the Miniſters haue done, in taxing them
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19757:112"/>
to haue recoyled from entering into that matter. For it ſhall be proued, as well by the offers which the Doctors haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made, to confer by word for quicker diſpatch of the ſaid matter: and then at more leiſure to put it in writing (which the Miniſters haue refuſed): as alſo by the firſt obiections, which the Doctors propoſed touching the article of Gods omnipotencie: wherby they touched the foundations, vpon which are builded the errors of the pretended reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion againſt the reall preſence of the body and bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament. And ſhall moreouer be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, in that the Doctors haue obiected to the Miniſters ſome arguments againſt their Supper, to make them enter into the ſame. Vnto which they haue nothing anſwered: or ſo impertinently (at the leaſt) as one may iudge by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their anſwere, that they fled the Liſts: as yet alſo they do, by their laſt writing: hiding as much as they poſſibly can, what they thinke of the Supper: albeit they haue bene admoniſhed to anſwere therevnto plainely and to purpoſe. Whether the Doctors or the Miniſters retyre, ſhall bee ſeene by effect: For albeit the Miniſters will not anſwer, the Doctors will not leaue to aduiſe them thereof, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all the world, the intollerable errors which bee in the Supper, and in all the doctrine of the Miniſters: Who beeing demaunded, dare not confeſſe and auouch by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, what hath beene written by the inuenters of theyr Supper.</p>
               <p>Now to begin to ſpeake thereof, the Miniſtrrs do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it to be celebrated according to the ordinances of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and after the faſhion which the Apoſtles vſed, and all the Primitiue Church whiles it flouriſhed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in it puritie. Wherevpon the Doctors demaund, how long the Miniſters eſteeme the doctrine of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to abide in it puritie? And whether the Church were not then as pure in the doctrine of all the other articles, as of this? Furthermore, whether ſince that time, there is not ſome place in the world, where the true doctrine of the Supper, and of other Articles, haue beene retained
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19757:112"/>
and conſerued: and whether ſuch doctrine hath euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without interruption? and in what place? and by whom hath it bene preached and ſet forth, and from age to age? The Doctors deſire the Miniſters to make declaration thereof, for that it much importeth. For as much as before <hi>Caluin</hi> put forth his Catechiſme, there was no memorie, that ſuch doctrine as he taught, had bene held in any Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Supper was not celebrated after the faſhion and maner as it is celebrated in the Church, called Reformed.</p>
               <p>The Doctors would willingly cheare vp the Miniſters, who are much diſquieted in their writing, becauſe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue ſaid, that their Supper differeth not from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon banquet, except in that it is worſe: as being prophane and polluted.</p>
               <p>To meete wherwithall, the Miniſters haue made a great narration of the whole action of their Supper: and by faire ſhewes, which haue a forme of all godlineſſe, they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to make it very commendable, and to couer a new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing betweene two platters. And contrariwiſe, that they may tread vnder foote and abaſe the thriſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>precious ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the Maſſe, by renting in peeces ſome ſhewe of him: as if they were vſed without reaſon or ſignification, which the Miniſters vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, or make ſemblance not to vnderſtand. But things ought not to be priſed and eſteemed by their ſhewes, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their value, nature, and truth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Miniſters ſhould foreſee, that all the Sects which bee now in the world againſt the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, for the act of the holy Sacrament, doo vſe at the leaſt, as faire ſhewe as they. And were they thereof asked, there is not any which would not enforce himſelfe, to proue, that it approacheth nearer to Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Primitiue Church, then the pretended reformed Religion dooth. Concerning all which, the Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them to the writings of the Lutherans, Zuinglianiſts, Anabaptiſts, Trinitaries, Maiſter <hi>Alaſco,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:19757:113"/>
For vnreaſonable it is by ſuch faire deceits, to preferre the Supper of the Miniſters, to other Sects: &amp; to iudge it good, holy, vnpolluted, and according to the word of God: but to repute it rather polluted, and defiled with impietie: for as much as it cloaketh a lye in ſtead of truth, and giueth the ſhewe of pietie, to impietie and falſhood.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Doctors haue not diſpraiſed the Supper of the Miniſters, for the praiſes therein giuen to God, or for the confeſſion they there make of their ſinnes: or the preaching (if it contained the truth), or for other preparation. But therefore did they ſay it was deteſtable, becauſe, againſt the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, it contained not, but common bread and wine: and yet that they attributed vnto it ſome ſpirituall effect, and other faire pretext of godlineſſe. The which is an abhominable thing, and inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sathan, who endeuoureth by ſuch maner of Supper, to aboliſh and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the true Supper, according to the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, and to depriue the faithfull of the fruite, and veritie of the ſame Supper: in cauſing them to giue common bread onely, inſtead of the body and blood of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt. The Doctors could as well recyte the euill ſhewes, as the Miniſters do recyte the good, which be in their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: as the ſecrets, the new enterpriſes practiſed vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſhadow of aſſemblies made in their ſaid Supper. But to the ende the Miniſters reproach not the Doctors, that Prieſts ſpake of armes, of contributions, &amp;c. they paſſe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with ſilence, and referre them to the thing it ſelf: and wil content themſelues to declare ſome cauſes, whereby they maintaine, that there is no truth in the ſame Supper, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt: which are ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>That in the Supper of the Miniſters, and theyr like, no conſecration can be made of the matter of bread &amp; wine which are there propoſed. And that for this cauſe, there is not in the ſame matter any change made, be it before, or in, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vſe. And by conſequence that the bread and wine in ſuch a Supper, cannot be but common. That no conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:19757:113"/>
is made in their Supper: hereby appeareth, firſt, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to all perſons, to conſecrate bread and wine in the Supper: but onely to thoſe that by impoſition of the Paſtors and Biſhops hands, are lawfully ordained according to the ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles time, euen vnto vs. Now certaine it is, that the moſt part of the Miniſters of the Church, called Reformed, be not ordained by the laying on of the Paſtors hands, who haue the power by ſucceſſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to an other ſince the Apoſtles. Whereof we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch Miniſters vſurping the office which pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to them, cannot make any conſecration, and giue not by conſequence but common bread and wine. Which article ſhall be ſpoken of, when we ſhall entreat of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Prieſthood. Secondly, to make conſecration of the bread and wine, it ſufficeth not that the perſon be fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the matter: but alſo it is neceſſary, that the lawfull Miniſter by a certaine meane, do make the conſecration: to wit, by bleſſing, and pronouncing of certaine words ouer the matter propoſed; euen as Ieſus Chriſt hath firſt obſerued it. And becauſe the Miniſters (albeit they were lawfully ordained, and that they had authoritie and power to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate) vſe not the bleſſing and pronuntiation of certaine words ouer the bread and wine, (withſtanding that which Ieſus Chriſt firſt did, and then ordained to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors ſo to doo) they cannot take any conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread and wine, and that in them any chaunge happeneth. Whereof it followeth, that they differ not from common bread and wine, and that ſuch a feaſt and banquet is but common. And that it is blaſphemy to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto it, the name of Chriſts Supper. Behold, why partly the Doctors haue ſaid, that the Supper of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is a prophane and polluted banquet.</p>
               <p>The Doctors admoniſh the Miniſters to anſwere to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and plainely, to the demaunds by them propoſed, which they haue not done: which is the cauſe that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, leaſt they ſhould trauell in vaine, haue not yet willed to impugne their anſwere: ſummoning them eftſoones to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19757:114"/>
anſwere what is propoſed to them, without drawing backe from the Conference, which (they ſay) they affect ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The firſt demaunde was generall for all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: to wit, whether the Miniſters did beleeue, that two things were eſſentiall and neceſſary, to the confec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament: namely, the matter, or element, and the word.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters anſwere, that the Sacrament in it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection conſidered, conſiſteth in three things, &amp;c. They ſpeake indeterminately: ſo that one cannot iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they vnderſtand theyr ſaying of the Sacrament, which they call the Supper onely: or generally of all, as they were demaunded. Although becauſe they alledge <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> one may coniecture, that they meant but of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it behoueth to note, that which they adde (in it perfection conſidered): to haue alwaies a ſtarting hole, when ſpeech ſhall be made of the eſſence of the Sacrament. The Doctors require that the Miniſters anſwere to the queſtion propoſed generally of all the Sacraments. For there is lyke reaſon as touching the eſſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in generall. And that they openly declare what things be eſſentiall, and neceſſary to a Sacrament, to be made a Sacrament: without ſpeaking for the preſent of the perfection of a Sacrament, containing the eſſence and ſpirituall fruites, which be not of the eſſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond demaund, the Miniſters anſwere no more pertinently then to the firſt. And namely where the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue demaunded, whether it behooued to vſe certaine words for the confection of a Sacrament: and what word was neceſſary for the Sacrament of the Supper. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters haue ſayd, that the lowe and ſecret ſpeaking of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, addreſſed to the elements, was not the word neceſſary to the confection of a Sacrament. But they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded not, whether it behooued to pronounce that word, with a lowe, or high voyce: but the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19757:114"/>
was, whether there be any words neceſſary to make the Sacrament, that one ought to pronounce ouer the matter, or in adminiſtring the matter: and that they might be ſuch words for the Supper. And it is not ſufficient to ſay, that the word, by which the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, is the word of the Sacrament: but it behoueth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, in what words conſiſteth that word, and when it muſt be pronounced.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſixt and principall demaund, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters anſwere not clearly, and to purpoſe: but make a capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwere: by which one may conceiue what is their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preſence &amp; participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Supper. And ſo temper they their ſaying, that there is no <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> nor <hi>Almaniſts,</hi> which confeſſeth not thereof as much, or more then they: To wit, that they are conioyned to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that they poſſeſſe him in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of their faith, and by the operation of his holy ſpirite, to be made fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones, &amp;c. But this is farre off from the demaund: to wit, whether the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Supper receiue into theyr ſoules, beſides all the graces ſpirituall (among which is the communication with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt) his true bodie and blood, really, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſubſtantially? And whether the Miniſters in the Supper make not diſtinction of the ſubſtance contained and perceiued in the Sacrament, with the fruites thereof proceeding? And for more breuitie, the Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, whether the Miniſters do receiue, and approoue, that which <hi>Caluin</hi> hath written of the Supper, and of that they receiue thereof in his <hi>Catechiſme, Institution,</hi> and other bookes.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſeauenth demaund, the Miniſters haue not vnderſtood what hath beene propoſed to them, touching the <hi>Concomitance:</hi> For they haue taken it, as if one demaunded, whether it were lawfull to receiue the Sacrament vnder one onely kinde or no. Whiche was not as then put in queſtion. But ſuche a difficultie was propoſed to them: namely, whether in theyr Supper,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19757:115"/>
when one hath receiued the bread, before hee receiue the wine, he do participate of the true body of Ieſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hee be partaker of his bloud, vntill hee haue taken the wine: or hauing eaten the bread, whether he hath receiued the body and bloud, before he take the Cup? To which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, to auoyd vaine blotting of paper, the Doctors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Miniſters to anſwere, without wandering, and to render open confeſſion of their faith. And that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may knowe, what doctrine they ought to impugne or approue.</p>
               <p>As touching the articles of the Maſſe, the Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them to their proper place: which is of the ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt. After it ſhalbe knowne and proued that they be preſent in the Supper and holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

               <p>The Miniſters firſt ſay, that they taxed not the Doctors to haue reſtrained the Church in a certaine place, but to a certaine company, and to the traditions giuen, followed, and by the ſame approued. And they magnifie God, that the Doctors doo now acknowledge the Catholique Church to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19757:115"/>
ſtretch through the world: and that it is not incloſed in the boundes and limits of the authoritie, and traditions of the Romane Church: which the Miniſters confeſſe to haue beene then much eſteemed of the auncient Fathers, when errours, abuſes, and vices, did not as yet there abounde, as ſince they doo. But now that all things almoſt are there corrupted, as well in manners, as in doctrine: and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is there more odious, then the word, the light, the trueth, and the power of God. The Miniſters do ſay: that as the ſtate of the ſame Church hath beene chaunged, ſo ought to bee alſo the eſteeme and reputation in which it hath beene: adding therevnto, that in whatſoeuer degree of honor ſhe hath bene formerly lifted, ſhe hath not neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe beene eſteemed by the Fathers for the vniuerſall Church, nor her Biſhop for vniuerſall Biſhop: As by that which Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> wrote thereof to <hi>Euagrius:</hi> and by that which concerning the ſame, was determined in one of the <note place="margin">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19757:116"/>
to containe and repreſſe the fury of the people, and to hinder theyr open violence vpon them. Whereas they contrariwiſe, doo ſtirre vp againſt the Miniſters, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Magiſtrates, by ſlaunder and falſe imputations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by all other faſhions &amp; meanes they can inuent for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the Omnipotencie of God, and the definition thereof, which the Miniſters haue propoſed, drawne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the bookes of Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> the Doctors in theyr laſt writing, produce no new thing, to cauſe them leaue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For that they alledge of the Angels, which can do whatſoeuer they will, and by that meanes ſhould be almightie as well as God (if the aboueſayd definition of his Omnipotencie had place) is an example from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and which cannot prooue that there is in the Angels any ſuch power, as in God. For certaine it is, that theyr will and power dependeth elſewhere, and that God ruleth ouer them, to chaunge, ſuſpend and hinder them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and as he can do in all other creatures. Which none can ſay of God, without blaſphemy. Howſoeuer it be, If the Doctors will reproue the definition of Gods Omnipotency propoſed by the Miniſters, they deale not with them, but with S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> For as much as the ſaid definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was word for word copied out of his writings.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters do maruell, that after they had ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply declared to the Doctors, what they thought of Gods Omnipotencie, and ſhewed, that it ſtretched not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to all things which men in theyr fooliſh phantaſies, may conceiue or imagine: the Doctors will eftſoones harpe on that ſtring, alledging that God can do wiſely, what fooles do fooliſhly imagine.

The Doctors ſay: That all things ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to man, are poſſible to be done with God, without any exception: but of thoſe things which imply contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be, and not to be. What reaſon then is there, that for the things (whereof the Miniſters and Doctors agree, that they ought to be excepted out of Gods omnipotency) the Miniſters in excepting them, be held for blaſphemers, &amp; not the Doctors, which ſay &amp; confeſſe the ſelfe-ſame thing? Now this propoſition that a naturall body (yea that of Ieſus Chriſt) is in diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame inſtant, is in the ranke of things which imply contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as it hath bin already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proued. Therfore the Miniſters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of God cannot be referred &amp; extended thervnto.</p>
               <p>The Doctors doo afterwards charge the Miniſters with foure horrible blaſphemies (as they ſay) grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon that which the Miniſters in defending that one body could not be diuers places at one inſtant) haue ſaid, that it repugned the truth, wiſdome, and omnipotency of God. Which thing, the ſaid Doctors finde ſo ſtraunge, and farre from reaſon, that they would not vouchſafe to ſtaie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it: thinking it was vnworthie of anſwere, and that it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to haue recyted the ſame. Wherevnto the Miniſters anſwere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is a very eaſie and readie meane, to rid them ſpeedily of all the difficulties wherein they finde themſelues wrapped, to ſay, that it is a blaſphemy, and vnworthie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
               <p>The Doctors yet make inſtance to the Miniſters, and ſay: that it behooueth them to ſhewe by the word of God, that one bodie cannot be in diuers places at one inſtant.

               <p>And touching the argument which they thus make, God can change the order which he hath eſtabliſhed in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therfore can he alſo cauſe that one body at one inſtant be in many places. The Miniſters denie the conſequence, and yeeld reaſon therof: for as much as ſuch a matter ſhould not onely change the order, but ſhould wrap vp alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: the which, by the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, is excepted out the omnipotencie of God. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the article following, do but reproach the Miniſters, for they confound and obſcure what had bene clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Miniſters, in their laſt writing. By means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let them make (if they will) more large an anſwer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound themſelues better. Where the Doctors accuſe the Miniſters to haue maliciouſly concealed the word <hi>[place]</hi> in the matter of circumſcription of a meaſured body: the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay, that it was not needfull to adde that word expreſly there. For as much as there is no man ſo ignorant, who (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnderſtood that a body is circumſcript) but doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inferre, that then it is compriſed in a place certaine.</p>
               <p>As touching the Camell, if they be not contented with that alreadie ſaid thereof, then let them reade what Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> hath thereof written, in his firſt booke againſt the Pelagians: who expounding the words of Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith as followeth. In this hath the Lord not ſaid, that it may be done: but hath compared one impoſſibilitie with an other. For as a Camell cannot enter through the eye of a needle: ſo the rich ſhall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Now if thou canſt ſhewe that the rich
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19757:117"/>
man there entereth, it will alſo follow, that the Camell may paſſe through the eye of a needle. And alledge not vnto me <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the others, which we read in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to haue bene rich, and which being ſuch, were entered into the kingdome of heauen, becauſe they (well vſing their riches, and imploying them to good workes) haue by that meane ceaſed to be rich. Behold what S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is neceſſary (after the ſaying of S. <hi>Ierome)</hi> that for the ſaluation of the rich man, there be a mutation and changing in his heart; yea and that hee ceaſe to be rich, to the end hee may enter into the kingdome of heauen: ſo alſo it behoueth, that there be a chaunge in the Camell, and that hee ceaſe to be ſuch: that he may be made to paſſe through the eye of a needle.</p>
               <p>As touching the article following, the Miniſters ſay, that by the grace of God, they may diſcerne the light from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and falſhood from truth. Which is the cauſe, that they cannot approue, neither the arguments, nor concluſions of the Doctors, touching the being of one body in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at one inſtant: being well aſſured by good and certaine teſtimonies of the ſcripture, that all whatſoeuer the Doctors will proue, not elſe-where proceedeth, then from the ſpirit of error and falſhood. Which wil retaine by that meane, the impietie and Idolatrie, which hee hath formerly eſtabliſhed in the world, to the ruine almoſt of all Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>As touching the verbe <hi>[Dierchesthai]</hi> the Doctors finde themſelues much hindred to ſaue their penetration: which they can no way found vpon the proper ſignification of that word: as hath bene ſhewed them by the paſſages produced vnto them, not vpon any authoritie of the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>To that which the Doctors alledge (to proue that faith commeth in part of our ſelues, &amp; not wholy of God) that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo credit niſivole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> (to wit, that none beleeueth but willingly) the Miniſters anſwer: that (vnder our Maiſters correction) it is nought to the purpoſe: for as much as this will and conſent is of God: who worketh in the faithfull, both the will and the deed. Which thing S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, verie
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19757:118"/>
well teacheth, where he ſaith: That when God calleth men to ſaluation, he findeth not in them any good will at all: but that he worketh and createth it in their hearts, if he wil finde it there. And that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> which the Doctors alledge, that we are coworkers with God, ſerueth nothing for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not there but of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. And meant no other thing, then what hee writeth therof more clearly in the 2. to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> in theſe words: <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note>We are Embaſſadors for Chriſt: as if God exhorted by vs. And touching that which they adde, that none of all the auncient Doctors euer taught, that one body could not be in diuers places at one ſelfe-ſame time: The Miniſters ſay yea. As they haue ſhewed in their former writings, where the paſſages of S. Auguſtine, <hi>Ad Dardanum:</hi> and in the 30. tract vpon S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and others haue bene alledged.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters anſwere not but to two points onely, of all that the Doctors haue touched in theyr aduertiſement. The firſt is, that theyr Sermons, theyr writings, theyr diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline obſerued in theyr Churches, the cenſures which they paſſe for ſcandalous offences therein committed, the care which they, and the Superintendents haue, to diſcouer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue and correct them: the paine which they take to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatſoeuer is diſordered, and the publique prayers, which in all places they make to theſe endes: defend them with all good people: and iuſtifie them againſt the ſlanders of the Doctors. The ſecond is, that the Doctors in theyr ſayd aduertiſement are deceiued, in that they haue ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> doubted of the promiſe. Which is wholy contrary to that which the Apoſtle in the 4. of the <hi>Romanes</hi> thereof writeth. Where, in theſe proper termes he ſaith: And he nothign doubted of the promiſe of God through vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but was ſtrengthened in the faith, and gaue glorie vnto God.</p>
               <p>For anſwere to the Doctors laſt Obiection, made (as they ſay) agaynſt the anſwere giuen by the Miniſters to theyr former Queſtion, vppon the matter of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Although the ſayd Doctors, do faigne not any way
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19757:118"/>
to affect delaie in the Conference and Diſpute of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and of the Maſſe: yet can they not perſwade any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any iudgement, that they haue not hetherto rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and doo yet drawe backe from entering thereinto. For notwithſtanding ſome requeſts preſented by Madame <hi>de Buillon</hi> and the Miniſters, ſome declaration which my Lorde the Duke of <hi>Niuernois</hi> hath made therevppon, of his will and deſire to bring them therevnto: yet by all the meanes aboue-ſayd, hath it not beene poſſible to obtaine of them, that (all other thinges ſet apart) they would in good earneſt, conferre with the Miniſters of the two points aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Which thing the Miniſters perceiuing, and not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to depart from them, without conference firſt had ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: haue often proteſted to diſpute no more with them, till theſe two Articles were firſt decyded and reſolued. And to this ende propoſed certaine <hi>Theſes</hi> by order and good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, as well of the one as of the other: to the ende they ſhould well aduiſe what in the ſayd <hi>Theſes,</hi> they would gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay and withſtand.</p>
               <p>The Doctors hauing diſſembled the ſame, in ſtead of purſuing of them, doo propoſe other friuolous and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable queſtions, taken and drawne from theyr Schoole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie.</p>
               <p>And although the Miniſters had iuſt occaſion to grieue, that theyr <hi>Theſes</hi> were omitted by the Doctors: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to the ende they ſhould haue no more ſhadowe nor colour of delaie, the Miniſters haue alſo anſwered to their laſt queſtions. But now in ſtead of following theyr An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, and impugning of them, if any way they could: they propoſe againe newe queſtions, no leſſe abſurd and friuolous then the former. Whereby each one may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently knowe theyr hypocriſie and diſſimulation. And that pretending a willingneſſe to conferre of the two foreſaide pointes, they doo in the meane time, what in them poſſiblie lyeth, to drawe them from the Conference thereof: to the ende, it may breake off, before that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19757:119"/>
this matter be cleared. By meanes whereof, the Miniſters for concluſion, and reſolution of all the Conference, determine by Gods grace, to couch briefly by writing, and in the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt manner they can, all what God hath taught them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame; and what they haue learned thereof by his word: as well to ſatisfie the debt and bond which they haue to God, and his honour, to obey my Lord of <hi>Neuers,</hi> and Madame <hi>de Buillon:</hi> as laſtly, for the contentment and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the whole Church.</p>

                  </note>them. Which was the cauſe, why S. <hi>Paul</hi> placeth perfect beatitude, and entire repoſe of the bleſſed in this: that God <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note>is all in all in them. But for as much as men be naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and wicked, and contrariwiſe God in all perfection, is pure and holy: the difficultie is to knowe and chooſe the meane, by which they may approach vnto him. Seeing that there is no ſocietie betweene light and darkneſſe, nor any communion betweene righteouſneſſe and vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. In them cannot this meane bee found: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that of themſelues they are wholly vnable, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caple to relieue themſelues from the miſerie and curſe, into which they be caſt headlong.</p>
               <p>So that, beeing blinde of vnderſtanding, they cannot
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19757:119"/>
know their owne good: nor ſeeke it, being rebels and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardened: and therefore of neceſſitie muſt they goe out of themſelues, and ſeeke the aboue ſaid meane in Ieſus Chriſt: who was giuen them of the Father, to bee their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.</note>wiſedome, ſanctification, redemption, way, life, and truth. Then reſteth it now to knowe, how they may bee vnited and conioyned with him. The Apoſtle dooth teach vs, that the ſame is done by faith, by which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts, and abideth in vs: ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</note>that hee and wee are made one, and hee and his Father are one.</p>
               <p>Now, there are two principall cauſes of this faith, the one outward, and the other inward. The inward is the holy Ghoſt, who is called the ſpirit of faith: for as much as he is <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13.</note>the Author thereof, and createth and bringeth it forth in the harts of men: mollifying and diſpoſing them to receiue with all obedience, the word and promiſe of God, which is preached vnto them by the faithfull ſtewards, and Miniſters of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> Which word, is the outward cauſe of faith. And as the ſame faith groweth, and riſeth by degrees, euen ſo doth the vnion which we haue with Ieſus Chriſt, and by his meanes with God: vntill (as ſaith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> wee all meete together in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note>the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the ſonne of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The increaſe of faith is wrought by the working and power of the holy ſpirite, who was the firſt beginning and author thereof: and afterwards, by the continuance of the word purely preached and denounced: and finally by the lawfull vſe of the Sacraments, ordained as ſeales for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie and confirmation of faith, and aſſurance wee haue of the foreſaid coniunction with God through Ieſus Chriſt, and of the participation of all the good things, grauntes, gifts, graces, and bleſſings, which by his fauour are purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and gotten for vs. As of the remiſſion of ſinne, of our regeneration, of the mortification of the fleſh, and the luſts
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19757:120"/>
thereof. To ſignifie which things, and more amply aſſure vs of the exhibition and enioying of the ſame, Baptiſme was ordained of God: to the end, that in the water which is powred vpon our bodies, and in the promiſe of God which is therevnto added, we may behold (as it were with our eies) the inuiſible grace which God vouchſafeth vs, to waſh and cleanſe vs from our ſpirituall filthineſſe, and to fanctifie vs, and make vs new creatures: As alſo to further aſſure vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of life eternall, and make vs growe in the hope wee haue thereof, by the participation of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt, crucified for our redemption, and of his bloud, ſhead for remiſſion of our ſinnes: the bread and the wine are diſtributed vnto vs in the Supper, by the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But as the Miniſters acknowledge, that there is a vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſacramentall coniunction betweene the outward ſigne, and thing thereby ſignified: ſo (ſay they) on the other ſide, that betweene them two, there is ſuch a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the one ought neuer to be confounded with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: nor the ſpirituall thing in ſuch ſort faſtened to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, (which repreſenteth the ſame) that the one without the other, cannot be receiued: or that the two by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee alwayes inſeperably conioyned together. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth, that they erre, which will haue the bread in the Supper to bee chaunged into the ſubſtance of the bodie of Chriſt Ieſus: And they likewiſe which will haue him to be conioyned, and corporally vnited therevnto. So that whoſoeuer receiueth and taketh the ſignes, (bee hee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or vnfaithfull) taketh and receiueth forthwith the thing by them ſignified. Which error, with the moſt part of others happening in this matter, proceedeth of not well comprehending nor conceiuing what it is to eate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and drinke the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt. Which thing ought not to bee vnderſtood, in ſort as corporall meates are taken and eaten, but after a ſpirituall manner onely: as is declared in the ſixt of Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi> which in this conſiſteth; that Ieſus Chriſt dwelleth in vs, and we in him:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19757:120"/>
and is done by the faith we haue in him: as teacheth S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in the 25. tract vpon S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Why preparest thou the belly, and the tooth? beleeue, and thou haſt eaten.</hi> And in the third booke and 16. Chapter <hi>de Doctrina Christiana:</hi> where he ſaith as followeth: <hi>When Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: except yee eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> It ſeemeth that hee commaundeth to commit ſome great offence. It is therefore a figure, wherby we ought to vnderſtand no other thing, but that it behoueth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the paſſion of the Lord: and to retaine in our memorie, that his fleſh was crucified and wounded for vs.</p>
               <p>The eating then of the fleſh and body of Ieſus Chriſt, is no other thing, then a ſtraight coniunction and vnion wee haue with him: which is made by the faith wee adde to his promiſes. Euen as by the mutuall promiſes made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued betweene man and woman, the marriage is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſetled betweene them. And although being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, they be ſometimes by ſome occaſion ſeperated, and remoued the one from the other, as touching their bodies, yet for all that, do they not leaue to be one fleſh, and one body, by meanes of the ſocietie and matrimoniall familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which is betweene them. In like caſe, albeit that Ieſus Chriſt (with whom wee are conioyned and vnited by the faith and truſt which wee haue in him, and his promiſes) bee as touching his bodie, reſident in heauen, wee yet abiding vppon the earth; and that by meanes thereof, there is great diſtance and ſpace betweene him and vs, as touching his bodie: that neuertheleſſe hindereth vs not, to bee fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones: that hee is not our head, and wee his members: that hee is not our husband, and wee his ſpowſe: that wee bee not of one ſelfe ſame body: that wee bee not engrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that wee be not cloathed with him: that wee abide not in him, as the boughes and buddes in the Vine. And there is neither diſtance of times, nor places whatſoeuer it be: there is no difference of times, which can hinder ſuch a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19757:121"/>
coniunction, and that the faithfull eate truly his fleſh, and his bloud. For as the auncient Fathers, albeit they were two or three thouſand yeares before Ieſus Chriſt dyed, yet left they not to communicate in his fleſh crucified, and to eate the ſame ſpirituall meate which we eate, and to drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke which wee drinke. The faithfull alſo which are come twelue or fifteene hundred yeares after, leaue not, what place ſoeuer they be in, to participate (as did the Fathers) in the ſame meate, and in the ſame drinke, which they haue done. And no other difference there is betweene the eating of the Fathers which were before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, and of them that haue followed him, but the reaſon of more or leſſe: that is to ſay, that there is in the one, more ample and expreſſe declaration of the good will of God towards vs, then in the other. Whence muſt be concluded, that from the beginning of the world vnto the end, there neuer was, nor ſhall be other coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his Church, then ſpirituall: that is to fay, wrought by the ſpirit of God. For euen as there is but one faith in the Fathers and in vs, which reſpecteth alwayes on the one part and the other, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: ſo are we not alſo otherwiſe conioyned with him, then they haue bene. As then it is ſo, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue had no other ſocietie nor communion then ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: It followeth thereof, that we alſo are not, nor can be otherwiſe, then ſpiritually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned with him. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is not ſaid, that wee and the Fathers are not fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones: and that all together, doo not partake as well in his humanitie, as in his diuinitie. But that which wee ſay is: that all this participation which wee haue in him, is by the operation &amp; vertue of the holy Ghoſt: which thing, Chriſt Ieſus in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſpeaking of the meane of this coniunction, teacheth clearly, when he ſaith: <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note>
                  <hi>things which I ſpeake vnto you, are ſpirit and life.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, when hee ſaith: <hi>Our fathers did eate the ſame ſpirituall meate, and dranke the ſame ſpirituall drinke.</hi> Now when wee ſpeake of this ſpirituall eating, common to vs, and to the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19757:121"/>
Fathers: it muſt not therfore be thought, that we reiect the holy Supper of the Lord, or any way thinke that the ſame vſe of bread and wine is ſuperfluous: no more then the vſe of the water in Baptiſme. For our Lord knowing the bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhneſſe of our vnderſtandings, and the infirmitie and weakeneſſe of our hearts, and through the pittie he hath of vs, willing to helpe and remedie the ſame: hath not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue left vs the miniſterie of his word, to aſſure vs of the participation which we haue in his fleſh, &amp; in his bloud, and in all the good things thereon depending: but hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo willed to adde therevnto, the ſignes of bread and wine, which he hath as ſeales to his word, to ſeale in our hearts, by the vſe of the ſame, the faith we haue of the foreſaid coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his word. So that it ſufficed him not to haue contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a couenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the word and promiſe which he made vnto him: but added moreouer therevnto the ſigne of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> as a ſeale, for more ample confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and aſſurance of the ſaid couenant.</p>
               <p>To the end then, that each one may vnderſtand what is the Supper of the Lord, and what the Miniſters do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beleeue and teach: it is meete to conſider and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the ſame, three things. Firſt the ordinance of the Lord contained in his word, and declared by his Miniſterie, according to his commaundement: by which this holy ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimony hath bene ordained and eſtabliſhed in the Church, for the edification and entertaining of the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: which thing muſt bee diligently obſerued, to haue it in that honour and reuerence as appertaineth; and not to place it in the ranke of other cerimonies, which haue no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor reaſon to authoriſe them, but the onely will and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men. Neuertheleſſe heed muſt be taken, that by the inſtitution, and ordinance, whereof we make mention, we vnderſtand not, a certaine pronuntiation of words, or any vertue which is hidden in the ſame: as do the Prieſts of the Romane Church: who by ignorance and ſuperſtitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they haue, thinke to haue conſecrated, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated the bread and wine in the Maſſe, by the vertue
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19757:122"/>
of fiue words: <hi>Hoc est enim Corpus meum.</hi> For this is my body, breathed and pronounced ouer the Elements. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are greatly deceiued and abuſed: for as much as the word which is the formall cauſe of the Sacrament, is not a word ſimply ſaid and vttered, but a declaration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and ordinance of God, made by the Miniſter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his commaundement: and a preaching of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the fruite thereof: by which, the hearts of the hearers are lifted vp vnto the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and meditation of his benefite, and their faith ſtirred vp and inflamed in his loue: and where the ſame ſhall not thus be done, it muſt not be thought, that the Elements be Sacraments. As S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the 80. Tract vpon Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in theſe termes teacheth: Whence commeth this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to the water, that in touching the body, it waſheth the heart, ſauing that it is done by the word: not becauſe it is pronounced, but becauſe it is beleeued?</p>
               <p>This word is the word of the faith which wee preach. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9.</note>This (ſaith the Apoſtle) to wit: <hi>If we confeſſe with our mouth, that Ieſus is the Lord, and beleeue in our heart, that God raiſed him from the dead, wee ſhall be ſaued.</hi> And continuing his ſpeech, hee addeth in the end theſe proper words: to wit, <hi>This word of faith which wee preach,</hi> is that (doubtleſſe) by which baptiſme is conſecrated, to the ende it might waſh vs.</p>
               <p>Of this, as before, do the Miniſters inferre two things. The one is, that the word of conſecration is not (as is ſaid) a ſimple pronuntiation, but a publike and manifeſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the inſtitution and ordinance, and of the whole myſterie of the death of Ieſus Chriſt. The other, that the ſignes and Elements conſecrated, are not chaunged as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their nature and ſubſtance: but onely as touching the vſe and ſignification: and that onely, during the action wherein they doo ſerue. For to conſecrate the ſignes (as the water in Baptiſme, and the bread and wine in the Supper) is no other thing, then to depute and make them ſerue to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19757:122"/>
an holy and ſacred vſe, by the publike declaration of the ordinance of God, made to this ende: and not to chaunge them as touching theyr nature and ſubſtance. The which (vaniſhing away, and beeing aboliſhed) there ſhould remaine no more of the ſigne, nor (conſequently) of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Euen ſo then, as the water in baptiſme, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, abideth water, without that the nature or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof in ought chaungeth or altereth: So alſo the bread and wine in the Supper, remaine as touching theyr ſubſtance, ſuch after conſecration, as they were before: elſe ſhould there not bee <hi>Analogie,</hi> nor mutuall agreement betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified. For what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon or conformitie is there betweene the accidents of bread, and the truth of the body of Ieſus Chriſt? Seeing that the accidents of bread, as the whiteneſſe and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deſtitute of theyr ſubſtance, (as the Sophiſters doo falſly imagine) could not nouriſh, nor ſuſtaine the bodie: and by that meane, ſhould not be proper to ſignifie, that the fleſh and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt doo nouriſh and ſuſtaine our ſoules.</p>
               <p>This then muſt bee holden for a thing reſolued, that the bread and the wine abide in their ſubſtance: which thing is clearely prooued by that which Ieſus Chriſt (ſpeaking of that hee giuen his Diſciples to drinke in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) calleth it, namely: fruite of the Vine. Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 26.</note>bee applyed to accidents, but ought neceſſarily to bee vnderſtood of wine in it proper ſubſtance. Alſo <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 21.</note>by that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: calling the Elements of the Supper three ſeuerall times bread and wine: yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue beene conſecrated. Alſo by that which hee ſayeth elſe-where: <hi>Wee which are many, are one bread</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note>
                  <hi>and one body: for as much as wee are all partakers of one ſelfe-ſame bread.</hi> For there hee will teach vs by the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of bread and wine, hee propoſeth vnto vs, that as it is compoſed of many graines, ſo paſted and mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that one cannot diſtinguiſh nor ſeperate one from an other: So alſo ought all the faithfull in the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19757:123"/>
Church to be ſo conioyned and vnited together in one ſelfe-ſame body, that it ſeemeth and appeareth, they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of an other. Now very fooliſh and from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould this compariſon be, if the bread which we eate in the Supper, and vpon which this compariſon is founded, were not true bread. Alſo by that which <hi>Gelacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writing againſt <hi>Eutiches</hi> ſaith: The Sacraments (ſaith he) which we take, is a thing diuine: and neuertheleſſe doth it not ceaſe to bee ſubſtance and nature of bread and wine. Alſo by that which writeth <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his firſt Dialogue, and in theſe proper termes: <hi>The Lord hath honoured with the name of his body and of his bloud, the viſible ſignes which doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them: neuertheleſſe without changing the nature of them, but onely adding grace to nature.</hi> The ſame Author in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Dialogue, ſpeaking likewiſe of the bread and wine, which are diſtributed in the Supper, ſaith as followeth: <hi>After ſanctification theſe miſticall ſignes depart not from their nature: for they abide in their proper ſubſtance, forme, and figure. By meanes whereof, one ſeeth and handleth them after conſecration, nor more nor leſſe then he did before.</hi> Alſo by that which ſaith S. <hi>Iohn Chriſostome,</hi> writing to the Monke <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> whoſe words are ſuch. <hi>In the Supper we call that which is preſented bread, before it be ſanctified: and after ſanctification thereof, by the diuine grace, and meane of the Miniſter, it hath no more the name bread, but of the body of the Lord: neuertheleſſe, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bread is there ſtill remaining.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the paſſages aforeſaid, as well of the holy ſcripture, as of the auntient Doctors, and others, which might be yet alledged for this purpoſe, it appeareth, that the bread and wine in the Supper abide alwayes (as hath bene ſaid) in their proper nature and ſubſtance, as well after conſecration, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And it muſt not be doubted, that the faith of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church hath not euer bene ſuch: and that tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation was not ſetled nor holden in the Romane Church for an Article of faith, vntill the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third.</p>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19757:123"/>
the nature and ſubſtance of ſignes, which remaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſecration, the aduerſaries of this doctrine do ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledge, that which Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, ſpeaking of the bread in the inſtitution of the Supper: <hi>Take eate, this is my body:</hi> And reſting vpon the naturall, and proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words, they obſtinately defend, that the ſubſtance of bread vaniſheth in the conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no other ſubſtance, but that of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. The reaſon thereof is, becauſe they obſerue not the figures and maner of ſpeaking; which be ordinarie and vſuall in the holy ſcripture, alwayes, and as often as the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is queſtionable. For then the name of the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, is ordinarily attributed to the ſignes, which do ſignifie and repreſent them: as the name of a couenant is attributed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</note>to <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> becauſe it was deputed to ſignifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.</note> The Lambe, for like reaſon, is called the Paſſeouer: and Baptiſme, the waſhing of regeneration: not becauſe they bee like and ſemblable things, as the ſignes and myſteries ſignified by them: but for the conformitie that is betweene them, the ſignes (as ſaith Saint <hi>Augustine)</hi> take oftentimes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 23.</note>the name of the things which they repreſent. The error then commeth, becauſe they take and vnderſtand the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and maners of figuratiue ſpeeches, as if they were proper and naturall.</p>
               <p>Now that this kinde of ſpeaking: <hi>Take yee, and eate yee, This is my body,</hi> is figuratiue, it appeareth by that which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt addeth after the Cup, ſaying: <hi>This Cup is the new Testament in my bloud, which is ſhead for you.</hi> Where he calleth the <hi>Cup, Testament, and new Couenant in his bloud.</hi> Wherein it behoueth neceſſarily to confeſſe, that there is a figure, and that without the ſame, they cannot well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor fitly interpret the ſaid paſſages: For it is a thing manifeſt, that a couenant (which is a contract and bargaine betweene parties, made and conceiued vnder a certaine promiſe and word) is not wine. And neuertheleſſe it is ſo called by figure: for as much as the wine which is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19757:124"/>
in the Supper, and as the ſeale, by which the ſaid coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſealed, and the faith thereof confirmed. By ſuch, and like manner, this ſentence <hi>[This is my body]</hi> which is as much to ſay, as this is the new Teſtament in my body, which is giuen for you, muſt bevnderſtood and expounded. For as by the effuſion of his bloud, the new Teſtament was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: ſo was it alſo by the death of his body. And a better Interpreter of the words of Ieſus Chriſt, then Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, muſt not bee ſought for. For certaine it is, that what he hath ſaid of the Cup, is as it were a glaſſe, &amp; cleare and familiar expoſition of that he had more briefly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely ſaid of the bread. This alſo is proued by that which S. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> which is a manner of figuratiue ſpeech. For as much as (to ſpeake and vnderſtand properly) the bread, which is a corporeall and materiall thing, is not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which we haue in the body of Ieſus Chriſt, which is a ſpirituall and inuiſible thing. And neuertheleſſe it is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe it is the ſigne thereof, to repreſent it vnto vs, and to aſſure vs of the ſame. As commonly we cal the ſigned and ſealed Letter, which containeth the declaration of the laſt will of a man, his Teſtament: although it be not his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is properly the declaration, which he hath verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of his ſaid will. But it is ſo called, becauſe it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and teſtimonie thereof.</p>
               <p>Now, as the ſcripture and auncient Fathers, as well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and aduance the dignitie of the ſignes, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therby the contempt of them: as for the agreement and likeneſſe which is betweene the ſignes, &amp; the thing ſignified, haue ſometimes attributed the name of the ſame things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, to the ſignes which repreſent them: and ſpeaking of ſignes, haue vſed figuratiue ſpeeches. At ſome other times alſo haue they ſpoken of them properly, to take away all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of abuſe thereof, and to hinder that in taking the ſignes without any diſtinction, for the things by them ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, men ſhould attribute to them the effects, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine not but to the things onely which they ſignifie.

Of theſe two diuers reaſons, &amp; maners of ſpeaking, examples there are, as well in the ſcriptures, as in the auncient Fathers.

And ſometimes it happeneth, that one Doctor in this matter expoundeth an other. As one may perceiue it in the conference of two paſſages: the one of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alreadie alledged: and the other of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the booke <hi>De Corona militis:</hi> where hee ſaith: Wee very hardly ſuffer any thing of our bread and wine to fall vpon the ground. And in ſtead of that which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith to the ſame purpoſe, he ſaith: (as hath before bene recyted) we carefully regard, that nothing of the body of our Lord, fall vpon the ground.</p>
               <p>Now as in diuers paſſages the auncient Fathers (as hath bin declared) haue vſed the two foreſaid maners, ſpeaking of the Supper, now by figure, now ſimply and properly: ſo it is ſometimes found, that in one ſelfe-ſame place theſe two manners of ſpeaking haue beene vſurped in their writings. As in a Canon of the Councell of <hi>Niece,</hi> where it is ſaid: <hi>It was thus concluded of the table of the Lord, and of the mysterie which is therevpon: that is to ſay, of the worthy body and bloud of Ieſus Christ.</hi> At the table of the Lord, we ought not to abide <hi>tyed here below to the bread and wine, which bee there propoſed: but to lift vp our hearts on high by faith, and meditate, that on this holy table, is propoſed vnto vs, the Lambe of God, which taketh vpon him the ſinnes of the world; which is ſacrificed of the Prieſts, and not ſlaine. And in communicating truly with his precious body and bloud, we ought to beleeue that theſe things be ſignes of our reſurrection.</hi> Whence we may ſee, how the Fathers in one ſelfe-ſame place, haue ſpoken properly, calling bread and wine, the ſignes and Elements, which be preſented in the Supper: and alſo by figure, naming the ſame ſignes, the Lambe of God, which taketh vppon him the ſinnes of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:19757:126"/>
By that which is ſaid, touching the ſaid two manners of ſpeaking, they which read the ſcripture, and auncient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ought to be admoniſhed, carefully to regard, that for default of well diſtinguiſhing the places, where the ſaid ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are vſurped, they do not confound them: taking that which ought to be vnderſtood by figure, as if it were ſpoken properly: and that which is ſaid properly, as if it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by figure. And it behoueth them alwayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in the reading, as well of the ſcripture, as of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, what S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath written in his booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana.</hi> We muſt beware (ſaith hee) that we take not a figuratiue ſpeech, according to the letter: For herevnto muſt that bee referred which the Apoſtle ſaieth: <hi>The letter killeth: and the ſpirit giueth life.</hi> So that to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which is ſpoken by figure, as if it were ſpoken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, is fleſhly wiſedome. And in the end of the Chapter he hath one memorable ſentence: namely, that it is a miſerable bondage of the ſoule, to take the ſignes, for the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and not to be able to lift vp the eye of the ſpirit aboue the corporall creature, to draw eternall life.</p>
               <p>To come to the third part of the Supper, which is the ſpirituall and heauenly thing, repreſented &amp; propoſed there vnto vs, as well in the Elements, as in the whole action: the Miniſters ſay, that it is Ieſus Chriſt crucified, and offered on the Croſſe to God his Father, for the whole and perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, and ſatisfaction of all the ſinnes of the world. And that to make vs enioy the fruite of this ſacrifice, and to apply vnto our ſelues the righteouſneſſe, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, life, the grace of God, and all other fauours and bleſſings, which by the ſame ſacrifice, haue bene purchaſed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for vs: the word and Sacraments haue bene left and ordained for vs, chiefly that of the Supper: wherein, as in a picture, we behold Ieſus Chriſt ſuffering for vs, the paines and ſorrowes of death, paying our debts, cancelling and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the hand-writing which was contrarie to vs: bearing vpon him our malediction, to free vs from the ſame: and by his obedience reconciling vs to God his Father, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19757:126"/>
his wrath towards vs. All which things are repreſented and aſſured vnto vs in the Supper: when with a true faith we preſent our ſelues there, to celebrate the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Supper then was not ordained to be a propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſacrifice (as the Doctors do teach, and as they falſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the Romane Church) but to be a Sacrament, to the ende to renue and alwayes conſerue the memorie which wee ought conſtantly to retaine of the death and ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſte. Now, betweene a ſacrifice, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, there is great difference. For as much as in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, we preſent our oblations vnto God: and in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God contrariwiſe offereth and communicateth vnto vs, his graces and gifts. Alſo in a ſacrifice for ſinne, there is the death and effuſion of the bloud of the Hoſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and not in a Sacrament: but the onely percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and applycation of the fruite and effects of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. In the Supper then, Ieſus Chriſte is not againe ſacrificed: but the fruites of his obedience, and merite of his ſacrifice are there diſtributed and receiued by the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Of the reaſons aforeſaid, do the Miniſters conclude, that it is blaſphemy and ſacriledge, to call the bread of the Maſſe, of a Romiſh Prieſt, a wholſome hoſt. And if for proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they wold alledge the Fathers, in whoſe writings is found, that they call ſometimes the Supper an oblation and ſacrifice: The Miniſters anſwere, that firſt it nought appertaineth to the Maſſe of the Prieſts: between which &amp; the Supper, there is no agreement. And afterwards, that what the Fathers haue ſaid, they neuer vnderſtood it of the propitiatory ſacrifice: by which remiſſion of ſinnes is gotten and obtained. And they haue neuer beleeued nor thought, that there was any other ſacrifice to appeaſe the wrath of God, and obtaine reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and agreement betweene him and men, then the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, made by him alone, one onely time vpon the Croſſe. Three things then in briefe, doo the Miniſters ſay: firſt, that there neither is, nor can be other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer of the new Teſtament, then Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:19757:127"/>
The reaſons are, becauſe there is none but he, of whom it hath bene ſaid: <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for euer, after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> Alſo there is none but he, to whom may agree, and be fitly applyed the conditions and eſſentiall qualities of a ſacrificer, and the ſacrifice: Which are, that the Prieſt be holy, innocent, without ſpot, ſeperated from ſinners, and made higher then the heauens: which needed not to offer daily ſacrifices, firſt for his owne ſinnes, and then for the ſinnes of the people. Alſo there is none but he, which is, nor could bee Mediator betweene God and men: which could ſatisfie the diuine iuſtice: which is capable to beare and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the wrath of God: which could tame and conquer death: which by his death, and proper bloud, could worke the confirmation of the new Teſtament: and which (to bee briefe) could in fauour and contemplation of his merits and dignitie, obtaine of God remiſſion of ſinnes, and the other graces needfull for them which truſt in him, and inſtantly deſire him.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Miniſters ſay, that there is no other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne, but that of Ieſus Chriſt: That he is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lambe which beareth the ſinnes of the world: that there is nothing but his bloud, whereby our filthineſſe is waſhed: To bee ſhort, that God taketh pleaſure in no other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice nor oblation: and that hee requireth no other burnt ſacrifice nor offering for ſinne. And that therefore Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte (as it is written of him in the rolle of the lawe) is come, to doo and accompliſh the will of God his Father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they ſay of the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, that it was one onely, and once offered by himſelfe: without that it was euer needfull afterwardes to repeate and reiterate the ſame, conſidering the perfection and vertue thereof, by which ſinne is aboliſhed, and abſolute and eternall ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation obtained to all the elect: as it appeareth in the 9. and 10. of the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> By meanes whereof, no leſſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy it is, nor a thing leſſe contrarie to the doctrine and meaning of the Apoſtle, to approue the repetition and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19757:127"/>
of the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, then the pluralitie of ſacrifices for ſinne. And if the Doctors would (as they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly haue) to diſguiſe and colour ſuch an abuſe, ſhewe forth their diſtinction betweene the propitiatory and applicatory ſacrifice, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Prieſts pretend not in their Maſſes to ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſt for other end, then to apply the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of his death to thoſe, for whom they celebrate the ſame. The Miniſters anſwere, that in ſo dooing, they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto Ieſus Chriſt, more then they do: becauſe all the fruite of his ſacrifice commeth vnto vs, by the application thereof. As healing commeth not ſo much by the confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and preparation of the medicine, as by the application of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Miniſters would willingly demaund of our Maiſters, by what meane the benefite of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, was applied to the Fathers before his comming, ſeeing that as then they did ſing no Maſſes? Well ſeeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man of any ſpirite or iudgement, that ſuch diſtinctions are friuolous, and onely inuented to obſcure the truth, and dazell the eyes of the ſimple and ignorant. For Ieſus Chriſt who hath offered the ſacrifice, is hee himſelfe, which apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame vnto vs, by his ſpirite, his word, and his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>To returne then to their former ſpeech, and declare why the Fathers haue called the Supper, and all the action thereof a ſacrifice. It behoueth to note, that there are many ſorts of ſacrifices in the Supper: As the ſacrifice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.</note>heart, offered by publike confeſſion of ſinnes which there is made. After the ſacrifice of our body, there offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note>by publike prayer, which followeth the ſaid confeſſion. Thirdly, the ſacrifice of praiſe there offered, when they ſing Pſalmes after the confeſſion and prayer. After com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the preaching of the Goſpell, (which is called a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.): then the confeſſion and prayers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Miniſter preſenteth himſelfe to the people, to preach vnto them the word of God. The Almes (which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note>is an other kinde of ſacrifice) was heretofore brought
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19757:128"/>
forth in the Supper by the faithfull: which would therby te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, not only their remembrance of the graces &amp; benefites of God: but alſo their loue &amp; deſire they had to relieue the neceſſities of their poore neighbors. Beſides all theſe Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there are yet in the Supper two particular ſacrifices, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made in the writings of the Fathers. The bread and the wine which were choſen and taken of the Almes, brought thither for the poore, and were conſecrated: that is to ſay, deputed and appointed to the holy and ſacred vſe of the Supper. The other is the memorie of the death and ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, celebrated and repeated in all the action of the Supper. The which, for this reaſon is called a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</note>Sacrifice by <hi>S. Iohn Chriſostome,</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>We make not euery day other Sacrifice, then that of Ieſus Christ.</hi> But rather (ſaith he correcting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) we make the memorie of that Sacrifice. <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> calleth it the memorie of our redemption: To the end, that we remembring our Redeemer, may obtaine of him increaſe of his graces in vs. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> yet propoſeth it more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnder a compariſon which he bringeth of the dayes of the paſſion, and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt: which he thus <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt</hi> 23.</note>applieth: when the Feaſt of Eaſter approacheth, we vſe oft times this maner of ſpeech: To morrow, or within two daies, we haue the paſſion or reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt. That cannot properly be vnderſtood of the day wherein Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered death (which is long ſince paſſed): but onely of the memorie of his death, which is ſolempnized and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, as this day, euery yeare. A little after, to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate his compariſon, he addeth: Ieſus Chriſt, hath not he bene one only time offered in himſelfe? And neuertheleſſe in the Sacrament of the Supper, not only on Eaſter day, but euery day alſo, is hee offered to the people. Alſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: <note place="margin">Contra Fauſt lib. <hi>20.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note>The fleſh and blood of this Sacrifice, were before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, promiſed by the figures of Sacrifices. In the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, they were giuen and offered in trueth: And after the Aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt into Heauen, they are celebrated by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19757:128"/>
the Sacrament of remembrance. Of theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like paſſages, one may deduct, that the Fathers haue often called the Supper a Sacrifice: by reaſon that in the ſame, the memory of the Sacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt is renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and celebrated.</p>
               <p>The name of Sacrifice, is by the Auncients often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo applied to the Almes, which the faithfull brought forth in the Supper. As by <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in the ſecond <hi>Apologie:</hi> by S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in the 20. chap. of the 20. book <hi>Cotra Fauſt:</hi> by S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> in the booke <hi>de Elimoſina:</hi> by S. <hi>Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, Hom.</hi> 46. vpon S. <hi>Mathew.</hi> Which thing may alſo be verified by the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Maſſe it ſelfe, where it is ſaid: We offer to thy maieſtie part of thy gifts &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: which ought to be referred to the Almes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which the Miniſter in the name of the whole Church offered to God. They haue ſometimes alſo called the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there made, Sacrifices. As S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> vpon the Lords Prayer. And <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the 7. of the Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the 3. booke againſt <hi>Marcion:</hi> where, alledging that written in <hi>Malachy,</hi> [of the cleane offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring], which ought to be made vnto God, from the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sunne, to the going downe of the ſame, ſaith: that ought to be vnderſtood of the <hi>Hymnes</hi> and praiſes of God. Which <hi>S. Ierome</hi> (expounding the paſſage aforeſaid) doth alſo confirme.</p>
               <p>For concluſion of this matter, the Miniſters ſay: that all the paſſages of the bookes of the Fathers: wherin mention is made of Sacrifice, in the ſpeech of the Supper, ought to be referred to one of theſe kinds aforeſaid. And that it ſhal neuer be found, that they haue ſaid or written, or yet euer haue thought, that there was any other ſacrifice <note n="*" place="margin">

And that by means therof, it is certain, that in the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, he ought to be acknowledged, the prieſt of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as touching the other ſacrifices, namely: of a Contrite heart: of the Mortification of the fleſhe: of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19757:129"/>
Praiſes and Almes: and of the ſhewing forth, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the death of Ieſus Chriſt: they ſay, that it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongeth to all the Church to offer them: And that there is no faithfull, nor any member in the whole bodie of the Church, which in this reſpect, is not a Prieſt. As ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 2. Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Apocalips.</hi> And that we ought for this cauſe, to offer in the Supper ſuch Sacrifices vnto God: As appeareth by the ſame Cannon of theyr Maſſe, by them euilly vnderſtood, and applied to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which they pretend to make of the body &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt; where it is ſaid: For the which, we offer vnto thee: or who offer vnto thee, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our ſaying of the Sacrifice, that it is common to all the Church, to offer vnto God, Sacrifice of praiſe: ought not to be ſlaunderouſly interpreted: as if we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery, with the ſayd Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and by that meanes, ouerthrow and diſturbe the order of the Church: attributing to each one, authoritie and power to gouerne the ſame. For we know well, that the callings be different among the people of God: And that it is needfull, there be in the Church, Paſtors, and Doctors, and other Miniſters (as Deacons and Elders) to well guide and edifie the ſame: as well by the daily prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, as by the carefull and diligent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other things which concerne their charges. But it behooueth notwithſtanding, to diſtinguiſh ſuch callings which be particular, from the Prieſthood aforeſaid: which ought to be generall, and common (as is ſaid) to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>It ſhall now be eaſie for all them, which will diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerue the things here before diſcouered, and ſhewed <note place="margin">The Maſſe is a corruption and ruine of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in his Supper.</note>forth by the word of God, to vnderſtand and iudge, that the Maſſe, ſuch as is now celebrated in the Romane Church, is a whole corruption and ouerthrowing of the inſtitution of the Supper, which Ieſus Chriſt made, and left in his Church. So that it ſhould be now impoſſible to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19757:129"/>
acknowledge therein, one onely trace or marke of it firſt ordinance. For of a Sacrament which Ieſus Chriſt left in his <note place="margin">The ende of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the Sacrament, aboliſhed by the Maſſe.</note>Church, to edifie and entertaine the ſame in a preſent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his death, haue they made a ſacrifice; whereby the remembrance of that of Ieſus Chriſt, hath bin wholly buried and interred. And herein is there a maruellous thing, and worthy to be well marked. That is to ſay, that that which appertaineth not but to the ſonne of God <note place="margin">The Prieſt in the Maſſe moſt impiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſurpeth the proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Chriſt himſelfe.</note>onely, and was impoſſible for any other but him to do: as to ſacrifice for ſin, to reconcile men vnto God, to appeaſe his wrath towards them, and to make interceſſion, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for them his fauour and aide; the Prieſts do attribute to themſelues. And that which to them was lawfull, and commaunded, and alſo poſſible and eaſie to do: that is to ſay, to ſolemnize the memorie of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; in taking and breaking, diſtributing and eating of the bread, and drinking the wine, to ſhewe forth his death: they haue wholly caſt aſide. So that one may ſay, that the Prieſts do <note place="margin">What Chriſt in celebration of his Supper hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Popiſh Prieſts in their Maſſe neglect: and what Chriſt hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and is impoſſible for any but himſelf to do, dare they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do.</note>nothing of all that which Ieſus Chriſt did, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done in the Supper. And that which he did vpon the Croſſe, and that he neuer commaunded man to do, the Prieſts dare enterpriſe, and will do the ſame.</p>
               <p>The errors and abuſe, as well of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as of the Prieſthood, and expiatorie ſacrifice, and of the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, of the ſame, which be the principall parts, and as it were the foundations of the Maſſe, haue bene heretofore confuted, and ſufficiently conuinced by the word of God: and by the reaſons which haue bene alledged in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the parts of the Supper. And nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to caſt downe this Idoll, but to ſhewe, that that which is in the Maſſe, (beſides the abuſes aforeſaid) is not better, nor better founded vpon the word of God. For the adoration which there is made of the bread and wine, is an Idolatrie, condemned and accurſed of God. And it is not like, that Ieſus Chriſt (inſtituting the Supper) would not haue ordained it, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> (recyting this inſtitution, as he had receiued it of the Lord) would not haue taught it:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19757:130"/>
and that the auncient Church would haue omitted the ſame, had it bene a thing wherein God had bene any way honoured.</p>
               <p>Afterward, the ſeperation of the Prieſt from the people, is directly contrary to the Article of the faith, of the Communion of the Church: and to the ende, for which the Supper was ordained, which is to confirme and entertaine due ſocietie among the faithfull, and to binde them alwayes more ſtraightly one to an other. And none can ſay, but that it is an intollerable preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a manifeſt contempt and diſdaine of the reſidue of Gods people. And a plaine mockery is that which the Doctos alledge to excuſe and couer ſuch a ſacriledge: to wit, that the Maſſe of the Prieſts ceaſeth not to bee good, when thoſe that are there preſent will not comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For firſt it is forbidden them to eate alone in the Supper. And a Supper it is not, where there is not a Communion: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, reproouing the Corinthians, becauſe they departed one from an other in <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. 21.</note>the celebration of their Supper. <hi>When</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>yee come together therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Supper of the Lord: For euery man, when they ſhould eate, taketh his owne ſupper afore.</hi> And teaching in the ende of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the forme which they ought to hold, hee ſayth vnto them: <hi>Wherefore my bretheren, when yee come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eate, tarry one for another.</hi> Furthermore, oft times it happeneth, that there are not in their Maſſe, but the Prieſt and the little Clarke, which anſwereth him: whom they will not receiue to communicate with them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, how can they excuſe the Maſſes which are ſung in Monaſteries: where the people are forbidden to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Monkes, which celebrate the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreouer, it is ordinarily ſeene in great Pariſhes of this Cittie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and elſe-where, euen vppon the dayes that the people Communicate; that they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from the Prieſts, who do their buſineſſe apart, and wil not vouchſafe to feed &amp; communicate with them
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19757:130"/>
vpon one table. Alſo, what communion is there betweene the Prieſts and the people, ſeeing that in ſtead of breaking in the aſſembly, one ſelfe-ſame bread, (to the end that all the partakers thereof, ſhould bee by that meane conioyned and more ſtraightly cloſed in one body) each one hath his owne particular: the Prieſt, one more great, and the people, one leſſe? Seeing alſo that the Cup is not any way diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them? Furthermore, what dutie do the Prieſts, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite and exhort the people, to communicate with them? yea the Biſhops themſelues? who would at this day repute it great ſhame to communicate with crafts-men, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude, had the Doctors well noted the cuſtome of the Fathers, which cauſed the</hi> Cathecumenians, &amp; <hi>others there (not prepared to communicate) to depart the place where the Communion was celebrated: and that likewiſe which S.</hi> Iohn Chriſostome <hi>ſaith thereof: they would ſhame to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſuch an abuſe &amp; impietie, as is that of their Maſſe. And that the people may not bee ignorant of that, which theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In Epiſt. ad Epheſ. Serm. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>holy Doctors therof ſaith, we will tranſlate the ſame, word for word.</hi> It is in vaine that the daily ſacrifice is made: It is in vaine that we abide at the Aultar; there is no perſon which there communicateth. I ſay not this to the end that yee communicate in any ſort ſoeuer; but that ye yeeld your ſelues worthy thereof: Art thou not worthy to communicate? ſo art thou not worthy to pray. <hi>Alſo a litle after:</hi> If ſome one were called to a banquet, ſhould waſh his hands, and ſitting at the table, ſhould not eate, nor taste ought of the meates which ſhould there be ſerued: ſhould he not diſhonour and wrong him that inuited him? had it not bin bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had not come there? Euen ſo it is with thee. Thou art come, thou haſt ſung the Pſalme with the reſt of the people: thou hast confeſſed that thou wast of the number of the worthy, in not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting with them which are vnworthy. How then abidest thou, and dooſt not perticipate of the table of the Lord? Thou ſayeſt I am vnworthy. I anſwere thee, that thou art ſo: whereby alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Communion of prayers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the gobbets and offalls of Goſpels and Epiſtles,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19757:131"/>
the Symbole, praier, &amp; other peeces of the ſcripture, brought all confuſed, and not hanging together, ſaid and propoſed to the people in an vnknowne language (againſt the expreſſe commaundement of God, and without any edification of the congregation) is no other thing, then a vaine vſurpation of the name of God, againſt the expreſſe prohibition which he hath made thereof. And ſuch robes are too ſtraight and ſhort, to couer the ſhame and filthineſſe of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what an execrable abuſe is it to ſay, that the Maſſe ſerueth to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes; not onely for the quicke, but alſo for the dead? And that the Prieſts (paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing yet further, not to forget, or leaue any blaſphemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind) do diuide their hoſte into three parts: faigning one part to be for them in heauen: an other for them which are on earth: and the third for them in Purgatorie. For the Sacrament which is not ordained but for confirmation of the faith of the word: extendeth not further then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, nor the Miniſterie further then this life. As then it is ſo, that they which are in heauen, and they likewiſe whom they faine to be in Purgatorie, are dead and departed from <note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent note to proue the Maſſe a ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forgery</note>this world: we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that as the word cannot be preached to them, ſo alſo the Sacraments cannot be adminiſtred to them. And if they be not adminiſtred to them, that they can profit them nothing.</p>

And to that which the Doctors demaund, how long after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles, continued the puritie of the doctrine and Religion in the Church of God, as well in the Article of the Supper, as in others: the Miniſters anſwere, that ſo long time it there continued, as the word of God was followed and preached.</p>
               <p>To that which the Doctors ſay afterwards, (traducing the Supper celebrated in the reformed Church) that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters abuſe thoſe that are there preſent, nought elſe giuing them, but nothing betweene two diſhes: the Miniſters an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: that this blaſon much better fitteth the Doctors, then them, becauſe they preſent not to them whom they haue ſummoned to their Maſſes, but accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of indiuiſible waues, and the ſight onely of the formes of bread and wine to feed them withall.</p>
               <p>A litle after do they call their ſacrifice of the Maſſe moſt precious: whervpon the Miniſters grant that they haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to exault it: &amp; to attribute thervnto, ſo precious and magnificall a tytle, for the great reuenewes and riches, which this precious ſacrifice hath brought vnto them: wherof may well be ſaid, that it hath bene vnto them a fleece, and golden Myne, more abundant then euer was that of <hi>Iaſon;</hi> or all the Mynes of the Eaſt. In as much as they haue made the world beleeue (and chiefly the founders of Abbayes, Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and other benifices) that their ſacrifices, were vaileable to them for the redemption, remedie, and health of theyr ſoules. Afterwards, without all ſhame do the Doctors call the Supper of the Lord deteſtable, becauſe there is nought
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19757:132"/>
therein offred (ſay they) but common bread &amp; wine. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the Miniſters anſwere, that in their Supper is truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented bread and wine to the people; which after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abide in their ſubſtance, as before: but they denie that therfore the ſaid bread and wine be common: by reaſon (as heretofore hath bene amply declared to the Doctors) that by the preaching of the Goſpell, and recytall of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, both the one and the other is changed (as is ſaid) touching the vſe, but not touching the nature.</p>
               <p>To that wherein the Doctors do charge the Miniſters, to make inſurrections, conuenticles, coniurations, conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſecret practiſes againſt the ſtate of their Prince, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour &amp; pretext of their Supper; the Miniſters anſwer, that the ſame was not to impugne their doctrine, but rather ſhameleſly to deſpight and ſlaunder them. And that the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie of thoſe of the reformed religion, hath bene knowne and proued, to the expenſe of their bloud, and loſſe of their liues. So that the King and his Councell, by his Edict, hath declared them to haue bene very faithfull and well affected ſubiects to his Maieſtie. And wee muſt not maruell if the Doctors thus ſlaunder the reformed Churches; for as much as the Chriſtians in all times haue bin accuſed of like crimes, by the enemies of the truth. As it appeareth by the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> &amp; the booke of S. <hi>Auguſtine, de Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the Miniſters much maruell, how the Doctors are ſo ill aduiſed, to alledge the ſuppers celebrated in the reformed Churches, to verifie their accuſations; ſeeing that the ſame at this day, being throughout publikely done, in the eyes and preſence of them that will behold them: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein hidden, and whereof each one (if he will) may not eaſily be informed. But this is the zeale and great chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my Lords our maiſters (whereof they haue heretofore proteſted, &amp; that by inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods name) which ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth them to ſlaunder, without ſhame or ſhewe, thoſe whoſe iuſtice in that matter, ſhall anſwere for them before God and men.</p>

               <p>The Doctors for proofe and confirmation of that afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, do adde, that it belongeth not to all perſons indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſecrate the matter of the Sacraments; but to them onely, which are ordained by the laying on of hands of the Romane Biſhops: wherevnto the Miniſters for anſwer, ſay, that the firſt point, they confeſſe: and alſo (as elſe-where they haue ſaid) that calling is neceſſarie to ſuch a purpoſe. But they denie vnto the Doctors notwithſtanding, that this calling is the impoſition which they pretend: and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters aſſure themſelues, that their calling is more lawful, and better founded, then is that of the Doctors.</p>

That his lyking might be to make the Doctors vnderſtand, that without turning this or that way, they ſhould come to end the difference: refuting that which the Miniſters had maintained of the Supper, and ſupporting that which they had condemned in theyr Maſſe.
