            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. Let us consider the great necessity of teaching and instructing Children. These words, as I have told you already, import a solemn, serious and passionate invitation of exhortation made by King <hi>David,</hi> and we should be very injurious both to the Prudence and Piety of that Holy man, if we did not conclude from hence the great necessity of teaching and instructing Children; a larger prospect of which necessity I shall give you in these following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great necessity of teaching and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Children may easily he concluded from those very significant and emphatical metaphors by which this duty is set forth in Scripture, you'll find it set forth by the metaphors of <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 5. 13. 6. 1.</note> Milk, of Principles, and of a Foundation. Will any say, it is not necessary to give Milk to Children for the preservation of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44378:7"/>
Life? and will it not then be more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to feed them with the sincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow in Grace, till they come to the Perfect Man? Is it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that Children should learn the first rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principles of knowledge, before they can attain any perfection in it? And will it not be necessary they should learn their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, some form of sound words, which shall contain the principles of Religion, that so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> length they may arrive at the saying knowledge of the truth? Is a foundation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the building of an house? no less necessary is it in the judgement of the Holy Ghost, that Christians be <note n="m" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 20.</note> I built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apostles, and on Jesus Christ, who is the chief corner-stone. These are the illustrations of this duty we find in Scripture, and they sufficiently imply the necessity of it. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This necessity of teaching and instructing Children, will further appear from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of origina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sin, and mans natural avers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ss unto all that is good. Since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> we are such wild Trees, as require due manuring and good husbandry to make us fruitful. In <note n="n" place="margin">Job 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Zophar</hi>'s comparison, man by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44378:7"/>
nature is like a wild Asses Colt, an Asses Colt for rudeness, and the Colt of a Wild Ass for unruliness. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> though a Great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, spoke but like a Heathen, when he compared the Soul of man to a <hi>Rasa Tabula,</hi> a pair of clean Tables, or a perfect blank; for the Soul is sadly blotted and blurr'd by original sin, it is all stained and polluted by natural corruption.</p>
            <p>As the <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 51 5.</note> Psalmist speaks, <hi>we are shapen in iniquity, and conceived in sin,</hi> and therefore let us begin as soon as we can, to instruct and Catechize children, we shall find sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan have got the start of us; and that they stand in need of Instruction long before they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it. Great necessity therefore there is of timely and early instructions, if it be only to root out these weeds of corrupt Nature. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. These early instructions of Children will be found necessary, if we consider that delays will make the work more difficult and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Sin has its several ages, as well as man: At first it has only the weakness of an Infant, and may easily be master'd by Religious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but in a short time it will arrive at the strength of manhood: and by custome take a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44378:8"/>
firmer possession of the Soul. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is that sad observation of <note n="p" place="margin">Aug. Conf. l. 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> St. <hi>Austin, Dum servitur libidini, facta est consuetudo; &amp; dum confuetudini non resistitur, facta est necessitas, &amp;c.</hi> Whilest men indulge themselves in the ways of wickedness, they easily contract an evil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and this, if neglected, ends at last in a fatal necessity. Youth is much more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of instruction, than the inveterate sinner. <hi>Train up a Child,</hi> saith <note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 22. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon, in the way he should go, and he will not depart from it when he is old.</hi> But such as are harden'd in wickedness, will receive very small benefit from instruction: The <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> as the <note n="r" place="margin">Jer. 13. 23.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks, may as soon change his skin, and the Leopard his spots, as those that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to do evil, learn to do well.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The necessity of teaching and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children will yet further appear, if we consider how necessary it is to fit and prepare the younger sort for the other ordinances of God. Milk is useful for Babes, that they may grow up unto men, and be able to digest strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>r meat. Such as are not well grounded in the rudiments of Religion, will not be much profited or edified by Preaching. <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> does more than hint this in his Epistle to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44378:8"/>
               <hi>Hebrews, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>let us go on to perfection.</hi> Christians must first be well Catechized and instructed in the principles of Religion, and then they will more easily advance to higher degrees of saving knowledge. Nor is Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing only necessary to fit and prepare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians for the hearing of the word; but it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prepare them for the due celebration of both the Sacraments. In the Primitive Church, when any Heathens were so far converted to the Faith of Christ as to desire Baptism, they were for some time publickly Catechized: And because <note n="t" place="margin">Vide Conc. Gerund. Can. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Easter</hi> was a solemn time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Baptizing of such Proselytes, <note n="u" place="margin">Consuetudo apud nos e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi est, ut his qui baptisandi sunt, per 40 dies publice tradamus Sanctam &amp; adorandam Trinitatem. <hi>Jerom. adv.

               </note> 
               <hi>Lent</hi> was a time in which Catechizing was more solemnly performed, and this is one reason why Catechizing at this day is more particularly enjoyned in <hi>Lent.</hi> But though it be a rare thing now a days to have Adults baptized, yet such as are baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, do seldome understand their Baptismal Vow, until they are well instructed in their Catechism. Hence our Church, according to her wonted prudence, begins her Catechism with Questions relating unto Baptism, such as are fit to remind the Catechumens of that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44378:9"/>
Solemn Vow, which their God-fathers and God-mothers made at the Font in their names. And as these Catechetical instructions are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the better celebration of Baptism, so they are not less useful for the due celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper.

            <p>By Catechizing the younger sort, Children will understand their duty to their Parents, Servants to their Masters, Subjects to their Princes, and all of them that duty which they owe to God. If Children be well grounded in the principles of Religion, they will not easily be tossed about with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they will not easily be drawn into Schism and Heresie, or be so apt as many are, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the peace both of Church and State. By such early instructions, Religion will be best preserved in the purity thereof, and more safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propagated to succeeding Generations. All which do so eminently conduce to the welfare of a Kingdom, that Catechizing cannot but be acknowledged a most important duty. Hence the <note n="z" place="margin">Plut. de Audit.</note>

at their, Childrens Ears; by which was meant, instructing them in the principles of Piety and Vertue. Having now shown you at large the great necessity of Catechizing, I come in the next place</p>
            <p n="2">II. To enquire, who those persons are that must be taught and Catechized, and they are Children, <hi>come ye Children.</hi> This word <hi>Children</hi> is allowed some Latitude in Holy Writ, and does not only signifie those that are such in respect of their age, but such also as are Children, in respect of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Hence is that exhortation of <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> St. <hi>Paul, Brethren, be not Children in understanding, but in understanding be men.</hi> Here such as are ignorant are accounted Children by the Holy Ghost, though in respect of years they may be Men. It follows therefore that all Children as soon as they are capable of Instruction, and all that are ignorant, whether through the neglect of their Parents and Sponsors, or their own default, should diligently attend upon this most profitable ordinance of Catechizing. We find in the Primitive Church Adults, and such as were stricken in years among their Catechumens. Nay, we are told, that <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> wrote many pieces of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when they were Catechumens, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44378:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was but in his Catechism when he was chosen Bishop of <hi>Millaine.</hi> I the rather mention these great examples, that none, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young or old, rich or poor, married or unmarried, may deprive themselves of the great benefits of Catechizing, by reason of some unwarrantable bashfulness. But if there are any who will not come and answer the Questions of the Church Catechism: I know nothing should hinder them from being present at the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it. But if men are unwilling to go so far, I can only add, that they may be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to more private Instructions, whenever they shall desire them. King <hi>David</hi> in the Text, solemnly invites such as are ignorant, to come and receive Instructions. So that it is their duty to come, and it will be a dangerous ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their sin still to continue in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, when the means of knowledge are plentifully afforded them, and they solemnly invited to accept of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope they will be the more ready to come when</p>
            <p n="3">III. They are told in the third place, what Children, and such as are ignorant, are to be taught, and that, saith our Psalmist, is <hi>the fear of the Lord:</hi> The fear of the Lord is but, another name for Religion, For as our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44378:11"/>
Psalmist tells us <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 111. 10.</note> elsewhere, <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding have all they that do his commandments. Solomon,</hi> who may pass for a good Interpreter of his Fathers mind, tells us the same, <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdome;</hi> and as it is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wisdome, so it is the end and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it too, and therefore in his Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 12. 13.</note> he makes this the conclusion of the whole matter, <hi>Fear God, and</hi> (which is the proper effect of it) <hi>keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> Thus the fear of the Lord is but another name for Religion, which like a perfect circle, begins and ends with this one point. King <hi>David</hi> does not invite those that are ignorant, to come and learn the arts and methods of great Estates, or procuring wordly honours; but the fear of the Lord, which will enable them to live holily in this world, and happily in the next. He would not have them come and hearken to a few speculative notions, or some curious niceties; but he would have them acquainted with the practical truths of Religion, such as are able to make them wise unto Salvation. <hi>Wisdom is the principal thing,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 4. 7.</note> saith <hi>Solomon, and therefore get Wisdom,</hi> saith he, <hi>and with all thy getting get

In it you will not find any old wives fables, or endless Genealogies; in it you will not find any abstruse points concerning Election or Reprobation: <note n="f" place="margin">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44378:12"/>
form of Prayer, we are taught to pray for such things as are agreeable to the will of God. If any thing yet be wanting which a Christian ought to know in order to his Souls health, it must be what relates to the two Sacraments, and yet both these Sacraments, as was shown above, are fully explained in that supplement, which was made by Bishop <hi>Overal.</hi> So that if men will not be wanting to themselves, they may out of this excellent Catechism be fully taught the fear of the Lord. I come now in the</p>
            <p>Fourth place to enquire, who those persons are which ought to take care, Children, and such as are ignorant, be taught the fear of the Lord; and we may learn this in some measure from King <hi>David</hi>'s example, which is here proposed to our imitation: Though he was a King, one who had the troublesome affairs of a whole Kingdom to exercise his parts, and employ his time; yet he is so far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it either below him, or no part of his duty to instruct others, that he passionately invites them to come and receive instruction. His Son <hi>Solomon</hi> writes after this fair Copy which was set him by his pious Father, and assumes the title of <hi>Ecclesiastes, i. e.</hi> an Instructer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44378:12"/>
of the Ignorant: And sure if such Royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who wanted not imployment, thought it their duty thus to promote the Salvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I know none that can plead an exemption from it. Nay, <hi>Solomon</hi> will inform us further, That the mouth of the righteous will be a Well of Life. <hi>Bonum est sui communicativum,</hi> True Goodness, whereever it is, will be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative; and none but a cursed <hi>Cain</hi> will put the Question, <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> We know the law of God commands us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our pity even to our Neighbours Ox, when fallen into a pit. And can we think that God does take care of Oxen, and not of the Souls of men? Sure, for their sakes he says it, and would have us extend our Christian pity and compassion towards our Neighbours Soul, when at any time we see it in danger to fall into the bottomless pit. Our Blessed Saviour has told us, that the Soul of man is of more value than the whole World, and he gave a sufficient proof of it, when for their Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption he shed his own most precious blood, one drop of which was of more value than ten thousand worlds. He must therefore be a very great stranger to the worth of Souls, and that infinite love which Christ bears towards
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44378:13"/>
them, who does not employ his utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to promote their Salvation. We are all obliged in our respective stations <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 10. 24, 25.</note> to exhort one another daily to love and to good works; and as <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 25.</note> members of the same body, we are bound to take care one of another. But though this duty be inoumbent upon all Christians, yet some persons are more particularly obliged to promote the Salvation of others, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and instructing them in the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This duty is in a peculiar manner incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon Ministers: It is the very end and design of their office to promote the Salvation of others by teaching those that are ignorant, the fear of the Lord. <note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 31. 11, 12.</note> We find under the <hi>Jewish</hi> Oeconomy, the Priests enjoyned to teach the Law of God to children in the publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: For this end and purpose the 48 Cities of the <hi>Levites</hi> were dispersed abroad through all their Tribes, that they might have (as <note n="m" place="margin">Ioseph.

               <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us they had) in every Village one that was called <hi>the Instructer of Babes;</hi> and to this practice of theirs St. <hi>Paul</hi> fairly alludes <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 2. 18.</note> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he aggravates the sin of the <hi>Jew</hi> upon this account, because he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

properly signifies) Catechized out of the Law. And as God commanded his Priests under the Law, so Christ under the Gospel commands his Ministers to teach and instruct such as are ignorant. Hence is that solemn and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate charge which our Saviour gives St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him all Ministers in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <note n="q" place="margin">Joh. 21. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Gospel, <hi>Peter lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I love thee; He saith unto him, feed my Lambs.</hi> These words of our Saviour are very remarkable, for he does not only command his Ministers in this place to feed his Sheep, but also his Lambs; nay, he first commands them to take care of his Lambs; nay further, he charges them as they have any love for him, to take care of these. And we find the Apostles were very observant of this passionate command of Christ; for we read in Scripture of <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 2. Heb. 5. 12.</note> milk which they had for Babes; of the <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 12. 6. See Dr. <hi>Ham. ad locum.</hi>
               </note> Analogy of Faith, and <note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13.</note> a form of sound words. Nay further, we have several heads of the Apostles Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism expressly set down by <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1, 2.</note> the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection,</hi> saith he, <hi>not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of</hi>

For <note n="y" place="margin">Eusebius lib. 5. c. 10.</note> St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ordained St. <hi>Mark</hi> to be the first Catechist at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> notes that in the year 181. when <hi>Pantaenus</hi> was Catechist there, this office had flourished for a long time; to <note n="z" place="margin">Ibid. l. 6. cap. 3. 12. 22.</note>

If we shall neglect a duty so necessary, so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, a duty commanded by Christ, and recommended by the practice of the Church of God in all Ages, we shall be very unlike the Holy man in the Text, a man after Gods own heart, who though he had another employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that a very difficult and troublesome one; yet invites such as are ignorant to come
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44378:14"/>
unto him, and professes his readiness to teach them the fear of the Lord. Nay, I will add, that we must also forget that obedience which we owe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. This duty of teaching and instructing Children is a duty peculiarly incumbent on School-masters: Our Church therefore requires of all School-masters that they have a Licence before they undertake a School; and before they can get a Licence they must subscribe the Articles of our Church, and thereby solemnly engage themselves to teach their Scholars sound doctrine, as well as good literature. School-masters are, as I may speak, Ministers Ushers, and must prepare their Youth for the higher Instructions of the Temple. Hence it was a very good Inscription which was written on the Walls of <hi>Pauls</hi> School in <hi>London, Schola Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisationis in optima fide Christi.</hi> Intimating that this famous School (as all others ought to be) was designed by the Founders of it, for a nursery of Piety, and for the Catechizing

            <p n="3">3. Parents also must take care their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be taught the fear of the Lord. St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays this injunction on them, and commands them <note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 6. 4.</note> to bring up their Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. As they have been instruments in making them Children of Wrath by Natural Generation, so must they endeavour to make them the Children of Grace by Spiritual Regeneration.

               <hi>I know him,</hi> saith God, <hi>that he will command his Children, and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> Holy <hi>Joshua</hi> engages not only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note n="k" place="margin">Jos. 24. 15.</note>, but for all his Family, <hi>as for me, and my house, we will serve the Lord,</hi> saith he. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pass by a remarkable saying of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ninth, that pious King of <hi>France,</hi> who being found Catechizing a Scullion-boy that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Kitchen; and being asked the reason, he returned this most Christian answer, <hi>I know there is not the meanest person in my Family, but he has a Soul as precious as mine own, and such as was bought by the precious blood of the Son of God.</hi> Thus ye see Parents and Masters of Families must take care their Children and Servants be taught this fear of the Lord. And if they will discharge a good Conscience in this particular, they must teach their Children and Servants, by their holy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44378:16"/>
examples and wholsome instructions at home; and, as they have opportunity, they must send them to the Church to be Catechized by the Minister; and because most Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families are too apt to sleight this most useful ordinance of Christ. I shall set down the words of that <note n="l" place="margin">Can. 59.</note> Canon which our Church has provided in this particular: <hi>If Parents, and Masters of Families do not send their Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Apprentices, to be instructed in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, for the first offence they shall be punished by the Ordinary with Suspension, and after a months obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, with Excommunication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This duty is in a peculiar manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon God-fathers and God-mothers; these are ordinarily called Sureties, because they have bound themselves by a sacred obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to secure God and his Church, that their God-children shall be brought up in the fear of the Lord: And in order hereunto they solemnly promise to instruct them concerning their Baptismal Vow, to see they be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously brought up, and learn all such things as a Christian ought to know and believe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Souls health. These must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore, that as their Charity is great in undertaking so important a trust, so <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 5. 33.</note> their Sin
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44378:16"/>
will be as great, if they deal falsely with God, and prevaricate with his Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This duty is also incumbent upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and such as are in Authority, they must take care that such as are committed to their trust, be taught the fear of the Lord. This was the practice of King <hi>David</hi> in the Text; and it will be the honour, as it is the duty of all Magistrates to follow his example. <note n="n" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us to pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that under them we may live quiet and peaceable lives in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Honesty. Magistrates must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secure the publick peace and quiet of the Kingdom, but they must take care of Honesty, and promote Godliness and Religion in the World. This is so plain a truth, that <note n="o" place="margin">Pol. l. 2. c. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> learned it in the School of Nature, for when he comes to reckon up those things which most conduce to the happiness of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, he names these six, Food, Arts, Arms, Money, Justice, and (which I should have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med first) the care of Divine things. Now this they must do by the lustre of their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the influence of their Authority: They are styled <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 82. 6.</note> Gods in Scripture, to denote they should be holy, as God is holy: They
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44378:17"/>
are styled <note n="q" place="margin">Is. 44. 48.</note> Shepherds, and if they will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they must secure Christs flock from the fury of Wolves, and the subtilties of Foxes: they are further called <note n="r" place="margin">Is. 49. 23.</note> Nursing Fathers, and must take care their Children be fed with the sincere milk of the Word. Indeed they must not usurp the Pulpit, or invade the Ministerial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> no man taketh this honour upon him, but he that is called as <hi>Aaron</hi> was; but yet it is their duty to defend the Faith, to encourage Gods Ministers, by <note n="t" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17. 3. 2. 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14.</note> allowing them an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maintenance, and <note n="u" place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 22.</note> speaking comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unto them so long as they teach the good knowledge of the Lord: nay lastly, they must build Churches, and make the best provisions they can for the publick service and worship of God, and Salvation of Souls. These matters, as they well deserve, so they would require a uery large discourse; but as the time will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to do no more than name them, so I need nor in this place insist any longer on them. For we are all witnesses this day of that pious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e which has been taken by our Godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates in this particular. This handsome Fabrick they have built, and those other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions they have made to promote Piety and Godliness in this part of the Parish, will be a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44378:17"/>
much better, and more lasting monument of their Piety towards God, and their Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Souls of men, than any I am able to erect for them. I pray God reward these their labours of love into their own bosomes; and give his Grace to those for whom these charitable provisions are made, that they may make a right use, and a due improvement of them. Now if they would not have all this Charity lost upon them, but are indeed willing to improve it to the advantage of their Souls, they must be serious in the performance of those two duties King <hi>David</hi> requires of them, they must come, and they must hearken. <hi>Come ye Children, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Children and such as are ignorant, must come and learn this fear of the Lord. It is their duty to attend upon this important ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Catechizing, and repair to such places where these wholsome instructions are to be had. <note n="x" place="margin">Prov. 8. 34</note>

               <hi>R. Solomon, Beatus ille, qui primus ingreditur,

exeatque postremus: That man is Blessed,</hi> saith he, <hi>who useth to be one of the first that cometh to Church, and goeth out with the last, always tarrying to take the Ministers Blessing along with him.</hi> And if men would but seriously reflect on the great evils and mischiefs of Ignorance, a very sleight In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation would be sufficient to bring them to Church, and make them willing to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the fear of the Lord. For Ignorance is that stain and blemish of the Soul which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives it of the Image of God, which is said to consist in <note n="a" place="margin">Coloss. 3. 10.</note> Knowledge. As <note n="b" place="margin">Diog. Laert.</note> 
               <hi>Socrates</hi> of old observed it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the only evil in the world, as being the beginning and cause of all others. So far is it from being the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Devotion, as the Papists vainly fansie, that it is the mother of all Sin, and the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Parent of all misery. <hi>Mala mens, malus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> Without knowledge, saith <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 19. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> the mind cannot be good. Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and he that wants eyes will not be able to find it, or if he stumble on it, be able to walk long in it. Knowledge is that Pilot which must guide and conduct us in our course towards Heaven; and since in this world we are exposed to so many damnable Errors, and deadly Sins, we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44378:18"/>
shall undoubtedly make shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience, if we want our Pilot. And as Ignorance is thus dangerous in it self, so it will be more dangerous to continue in it, when we are solemnly invited to the means of Knowledge. <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 3. 19.</note> 
               <hi>This is the condemnation,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>that light is come into the world, but men love darkness rather than light.</hi> To be in a state of Ignorance is matter of pity, and justly accounted a calamity; but to be in love with it, and reject Knowledge is the height of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and brings the heaviest condemnation along with it; who will not tremble at those comminations which are thundered in the Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> against such who hate knowledge, and chuse not the fear of the Lord? God he tells them plainly, <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 1. 26, 29.</note> 
               <hi>He will laugh at their calamity, and even mock when their fear cometh:</hi> Nay, <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 3. 18.</note> he swears, <hi>They shall not enter into his rest.</hi> Such therefore as are ignorant have all the reason in the world to accept King <hi>David</hi>'s Invitation, and thankfully imbrace all opportunities of learning the fear of the Lord. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. They must not only come, but they must hearken to their Instructers. As the first insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of sin were conveyed by the ear into our first Parents, so the first inspirations of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44378:19"/>
Grace must have the same entrance. <hi>Auris est os Animae;</hi> The Ear is the mouth of the Soul, by which she receives Spiritual nourishment. Hence is that of the Apostle, <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 10. 17</note> 
               <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> But it is not enough to come to Church, it is not enough to hear; we must hearken too, if we would perform that duty which is here injoined in the Text. Now it is a known Maxime in Divinity, <hi>Verba sensus connotant Affectus:</hi> To hearken therefore imports no less than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth in the love of it, to entertain it with meekness and due reverence, and to <note n="g" place="margin">Tu tamen sic audias ista praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pta, quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, si tibi praeciperem qua ratione bonam vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem in Ardeatino tuereris. <hi>Sen. Ep.</hi> 105.</note> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it with all seriousness and conscientious obedience. You'll find this duty thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and a considerable motive to enforce it in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these Judgements, and keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy Fathers, and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee, &amp;c.</hi> Here ye see bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness is intailed on hearkening, and not on bare hearing. Knowledge must issue into action, otherwise it will not save us. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> of old painted a Tongue and a Hand under it: Now the Hand is the great instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44378:19"/>
of Action, and so this pretty Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick denotes thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not enough to know, it is not enough to talk of Religion, but we must practise it. <note n="i" place="margin">John 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> I shall conclude with that excellent Collect of our Church: <hi>Blessed Lord, who hast caused all holy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Collect for the Second <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Advent.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Scriptures to be written for our learning, grant that we may in such wise hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thy Holy Word, we may embrace, and ever hold fast, the blessed hope of everlasting life, which thou hast given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi>
