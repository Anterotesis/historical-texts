            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Psal. 126. 5.</bibl>
               <q>They that sow in teares, shall reape in ioy.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen any one hath sowne tares, doth hee expect to reape wheate? <hi>Do men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thistles?</hi> saith our Master, <hi>Matthew</hi> the seuenth, and the sixteenth. <hi>Ut sementem feceris, ita &amp; metes:</hi> As you sow, so you shall reape, saith the old Prouerbe: Iustified by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> instance, <hi>Galatians</hi> the sixth, and the eighth: <hi>He that soweth in the flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption.</hi> And indeed from euery seede sowne, men doe expect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:646:3"/>
to reape graine, or corne, <hi>eiusdem speciei,</hi> of the same kind. How can wee then expect from teares to reape ioy, which differeth from it in the whole species or kind? To naturall and worldly men, this is one of the paradoxes, wherewith they vse to charge Diuinitie, and indeed a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox it must needs be to all those who are not orthodox, and sound in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of spirituall teares and ioy which are here meant, who know no other ioy but iollitie, nor teares, but when they are troubled; who know not the ioy of the Spirit which Christians haue here, nor their Masters ioy which they shall haue one day hence; who know not that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous raine of teares, which God sendeth vpon his Inheritance, whereby hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth it, when it is wearied. To such <hi>heteredox,</hi> earthly-minded men, this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Prophets Sower is a plaine paradox.</p>
            <p>But here now vnto Gods people, in this Psalme, or vnto any other people who haue been in such a case, vnto whose
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:646:3"/>
owne experience God hath iustified it, that after many yeeres captiuitie in a strange Land, where they did sow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but teares, eate the bread of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and drinke the water of affliction, by the waters of Babylon, where all their ioy was suspended, their Harpes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments hanged vp; yet he now bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againe their captiuity, like the Riuers of the South: he now filleth their mouthes with laughter, and their tongues with ioy: He maketh their ioy, like the ioy of Husbandmen in Haruest, who after long expectation, come home loaded with sheaues To such of the Children of God, who, by reason of their sinnes, after they haue mourned like Turtles, &amp; chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered like Cranes, or like <hi>Dauid,</hi> washed their beds with their teares, and haue had their belly full of them as he had; <hi>My teares haue been my meate day and night; Psalme</hi> the fortie two, the third verse; do find, that God afterward doth make their broken bones to reioyce, to whom (<hi>Esay</hi> the sixtie one, and the second) <hi>God giueth</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:646:4"/>
               <hi>beautie for ashes, the oyle of ioy for mourning, the garment of gladnesse for the spirit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse.</hi> And lastly, to all the Saints of God, who as strangers here vpon earth, from home in <hi>Baca,</hi> this valley of teares, sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the adoption of the sonnes of God, and the redemption of their bodies, groaning and moaning with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> till they may be dissolued, look with him one day to be with Christ, and to enter into their Masters ioy. To all such now this is no paradox, but a proposition by experience proued vnquestionable, that <hi>those that sow in teares, shall reape in ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a figuratiue proposition, wherein<note place="margin">The sense of the words.</note> the people going into captiuitie, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto Husbandmen, committing the seed to the earth, and as it were, with sorrow burying it there, as being vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by reason of many alterations of weather, whether euer it wil fructifie and multiply; and the same people returning from their captiuitie, is compared to Husbandmen, after many large hopes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:646:4"/>
and feares, reaping with great ioy a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Haruest, of the same seed so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the earth by them. But now this proposition in generall is true, of all, or any of the people of God, not onely in the case of captiuitie, but any other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie spirituall or temporall, that <hi>they that sow in teares, shall reape in ioy.</hi> And in this generall sense will I handle the words.</p>
            <p>THey may be deuided into a Lent and<note place="margin">The Deuision.</note> Easter; first, fasting, and secondly, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: First, a time of sorrow, and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a time of ioy, or most seasonably into two knowne seasons of the yeere, a seed time, <hi>they that sow in teares;</hi> and a time of haruest, <hi>shall reape in ioy.</hi> In the first sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son two things wee must take notice of, the <hi>seed,</hi> and the sowing or manner of committing of it, <hi>the seed, Teares:</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to speake properly, it is the <hi>seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> rather then the <hi>seed, potius sal terrae;</hi> or <hi>pluma, quam semen,</hi> rather the salt or showre, then the seed: for it is in the text,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:646:5"/>
               <hi>not they that sow teares,</hi> but they <hi>that sow in teares:</hi> so that the <hi>seed</hi> here properly is, <hi>any good a Christian doth here in this life,</hi> be it an act of faith, repentance, almes, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. If these, or any of these, be sowne with, or in such teares as are here meant, you shall bee sure to reape them againe with ioy; so that as you see, when Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen haue committed their <hi>seed</hi> vnto the ground, if the earth bee not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>watered</hi> with the raine of Heauen, their labour is lost; so whatsoeuer spiri tuall seede we sowe in our hearts, it will not fructifie, vnlesse it be watred with this heauenly raine, and dew of teares: so that though <hi>Paul sowe, or plant, if that Apollos, or some other,</hi> do not <hi>water,</hi> God will giue <hi>no increase, no reaping will follow;</hi> as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture we are commanded, to <hi>cast our bread vpon the waters;</hi> so here we are commanded, <hi>to cast water vpon our bread,</hi> or any thing that is ours: and this water, <hi>Our teares, shall not be as water spilt vpon the ground, which cannot be gathered</hi>

Though strictly now it is here to be taken for the <hi>seasoning,</hi> yet fitly we may here account it for the <hi>seede,</hi> because the principall thing here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Spirit of God, is the mouing and stirring vs vp <hi>to teares,</hi> and therefore I must intreate you at this time, to let them be held not onely for the <hi>seasoning,</hi> or <hi>the salt,</hi> but for the <hi>seed it selfe,</hi> warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other places of Scripture so to do: for <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth <hi>teares</hi> not onely his <hi>Sawce,</hi> but his <hi>Meate</hi> too, in the place aboue cited; <hi>My teares were my meate day and night:</hi> and in the 80. <hi>Psalme,</hi> vers. 5.<note place="margin">Psal. 80. 5.</note> he accounteth them <hi>whole foode, meate and drinke; Thou hast fed them with the bread of teares, and hast giuen them teares to drinke:</hi> let teares then be here for, The seede.</p>
            <p>The manner of committing this seed, must be by sowing; <hi>they that sowe in teares;</hi> they must not be, as trees are planted, one farre from another; nor niggardly or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:646:6"/>
sparingly scattered vp and downe, here a corne, and there a corne, but <hi>sowne, shed and powred out plentifully,</hi> as a sower sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth corne with <hi>a full and liberal hand.</hi> You know the Apostles rule, the second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the ninth Chapter, and the<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9. 6.</note> sixth verse, <hi>Qui parce seminat, parce metet; He that soweth sparingly, shall reape sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> If wee sowe our teares thin and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, the ioy we shall reape, shall not be so much <hi>messis,</hi> as <hi>spicelegium;</hi> not a <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,</hi> or <hi>reaping,</hi> but a poore <hi>gathering,</hi> or <hi>gleaning. Teares</hi> then must be <hi>the seede,</hi> and sowing, the manner of committing: and this is the first season, the seede-time, <hi>they that sowe in teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the second season, is the <hi>haruest,</hi> or <hi>time of reaping, they shall reape in ioy:</hi> where we must take notice of these three things; first, the Corne, <hi>Ioy;</hi> secondly, the<note place="margin">1. 2.</note> manner of gathering it, <hi>reaping;</hi> thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the reapers, onely such as sowed (<hi>they</hi>) shall reape: The Corne, <hi>ioy,</hi> a strange<note place="margin">1</note> graine, you will say, to bee reaped from such a seede as <hi>teares,</hi> but you will not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:646:6"/>
thinke it so strange, after you haue heard what teares are here meant: for there are <hi>Lachrymae amoris,</hi> and <hi>Lachrymae doloris,</hi> teares of loue, and teares of griefe: for teares of loue, no wonder though they bring forth ioy, for they are teares <hi>of ioy,</hi> and shed for ioy: and for <hi>teares of griefe</hi> in godly men, they are neuer altogether without <hi>ioy,</hi> they neuer sorrow <hi>as without hope:</hi> as wicked men neuer know what a perfect and sincere ioy is, but in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of al their ioyes feel <hi>secret checks pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and griefes:</hi> so godly men in all their sorrowes haue some secret smiles, and lightnings of <hi>ioy:</hi> they, as it is in the 2. Psalme, <hi>Serue the Lord in feare, and reioyce</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 2. 11.</note> 
               <hi>in trembling.</hi> Now as the seed must bee turned after it is sowne, before it can come to be corne, and be fit to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: so here these teares shall be turned, and a little turning wil serue the turne, to make these teares ioy; the Lord of the haruest hath promised that he will turne them, Iohn 16. 20. <hi>But your sorrow shall be</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 16. 20.</note> 
               <hi>turned to ioy:</hi> and so from the seede of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:646:7"/>
teares, men come to gather ioy, that's the corne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> take notice of the <hi>manner</hi> of<note place="margin">2</note> gathering this corne; we shall <hi>reape it;</hi> if we haue not scattered but sowed, we shall not gather or gleane onely, but reape, that is, looke how farre the corne which husbandmen reape in haruest, exceedeth the seede which they did sowe in seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, which in some grounds is, <hi>thirty,</hi>

               <hi>some forty, some sixty, some one hundred fold,</hi> Matth. 13 8. so far shall the ioy which we shall reape, exceed the teares which wee did sowe.</p>

of saluation, of which the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Now the wels from whence wee may draw these precious teares, are so many, as if wee should seeke for them, as the people of Israel did in the 15. of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 27.</note> before we had gone half three daies iourney, as they did, wee should find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more then the twelue Wels or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which they found at Elim.

            <p>The first Well is, the consideration of<note place="margin">1</note> our sinnes, which (I hope) will draw teares from the driest and deaddest eyes that can be. The second Well is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration<note place="margin">2</note> of the miseries wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with in this life: and from this Wel wee cannot misse to draw (in regard of these miseries) teares; for this life of ours is not only a Well, but a Valley of teares.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:646:12"/>
As Riuers naturally seeke the Valleys; so our teares naturally run into this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.<note place="margin">3</note> The third Well is, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs passion, and teares for vs, and from this Well wee cannot misse of teares; the driest eye in the world can giue him no lesse then teares; if not for teares, yet for torments and bloud. The fourth Well, is the desire of being at home in our owne Country, which is Heauen, the consideration of our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and exile from God, and our long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be with him; and from this Well we cannot misse of teares, when with the people of Israel, sitting by the Waters of Babylon, wee remember our absence<note place="margin">Psal. 137<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The first<note place="margin">1</note> wee may call <hi>Adams</hi> Well, because it is the consideration of that source of sinne, which is deriued vnto vs from <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Fountaine and Well of all.

And the fourth Well we may call, <hi>fontem vitae,</hi> the Well of life, or Gods Well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the consideration of our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from him, with whom is the Well of life, Psal. 36. 9. <hi>With thee is the Well of life.</hi>

            <p>I can make these foure Wels, but two, and deuide these teares <hi>in lachrymas ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras ac dulces,</hi> salt teares, and fresh or sweet teares, teares of hatred, &amp; teares of loue, teares of griefe, and teares of ioy: the teares we must draw from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> Well, we may call salt teares, teares of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:646:13"/>
hatred and griefe, because we shed them out of a detestation of sinne, and being wearied of the miseries of this life. The teares wee draw from our Sauiour and Gods Well, we may call <hi>fresh sweet teares, teares of loue and ioy,</hi> because they are shed out of a desire to be at home in our owne Country with God and Christ. And these two larger Wels of griefe and ioy, wee may wel compare to the waters of <hi>Noahs</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21.</note> Floud, which were wholly caused by God; yet partly from the Springs of the Depth, which were let loose below, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the excessiue Raines which fell from Heauen aboue. For our teares of griefe, and hatred, proceed from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our sinnes and miseries which are here below: our teares of loue and ioy, from our consideration of Christ and God, who are aboue; yet all these teares, like the whole waters of the Deluge, are from God. Sure, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our sinnes and miseries, can not fetch teares from vs, yet the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Christ and God will doe it. If

But I will let this latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of teares passe, and hold my selfe to our first foure Wels. And though I know, that in this valley of teares, there needeth no great seeking after Wels; for we may haue iust occasion of teares eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; yet it is our best course to draw them from the Well-head; <hi>Dulcius ex ipso fonte bibuntur aquae;</hi> and of these foure Wels, now I will speake in order. If onely first I tell you, that by the teares, here to be drawne from these Wels, wee must not vnderstand strictly, onely the moystnesse and water of our eyes, but the griefe and sorrow of our hearts, which many a time runneth ouer, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shed a teare; <hi>leues loquuntur curae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes stupent.</hi> But as all teares are worth nothing, without the mourning of the heart; so many times the heart may bee drowned with griefe, when the eyes are drie; and we shall reape in ioy, though we sowe not in teares, but in sorrow: <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

               <hi>teares, when they see, that the wicked will not obserue Gods Law.</hi> It offendeth wicked men, whom sinners draw into sinne by their bad example; and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps yet they doe not grieue at it, yet it is the cause of many teares to them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and perhaps of weeping, and gnashing of teeth for euermore. It grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and offendeth all the rest of the creatures, because it turneth them out of the seruice of God, into the seruice of sin and Satan; for God created the Heauens, Elements, and al other creatures, to serue man, and to waite vpon him in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God; but now, when man tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe out of Gods seruice, all the creatures, while they serue sinfull man, are, as it were, turned out of Gods seruice too, and, not without grieuing, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to waite vpon a wrong Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in

               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 27, 28.</note>

Now, who would not shed teares, and grieue for sinne, which maketh all the Persons of the Trinitie, Angels, good men and bad, all the rest of the creatures, nay, the very damned in hel to grieue, and will one day, if they be not wept for here, make vs weepe and gnash our teeth for euermore?</p>
            <p>Now when I tell you, that wee must
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:646:15"/>
shed teares for sinne, I meane not onely your owne sinnes, though them princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, but the sinnes of others too, the sinnes of the time, aswell as the sinnes of your persons: for as we find <hi>Dauid</hi> wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 6.</note> his bedde with teares for his owne sinnes, so finde wee <hi>his eyes gushing with</hi>

               <hi>teares, because the wicked would not obserue Gods Law.</hi> Christ had no sinnes of his owne to mourne for, yet wept he for the<note place="margin">Luke 19 41.</note> sinnes of Ierusalem. Dearely beloued in the Lord, when you haue cried for your owne sinnes, spare some of your teares for the sinnes of the time: for vnlesse they be mourned for, Gods plague will bee powred out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place, aswell as their persons: and if you doe not mourne and crie for the sinnes of the time, no body else will, for the sinners themselues will not weepe.

Wicked men, for whose sins all the tempests, wherewith the Church is tossed, arise, neuer shed one teare in the storme, but stretch themselues along vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beds of Yuorie, and short aloud vpon<note place="margin">Amos 6. 4.</note> the pillowes of securitie: it is onely the godly in the meane time, who must pleade, and pray, and cry, and shed teares for the sinnes of the time; like <hi>Daniel,</hi> who<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 16, 17.</note> in the time of his peoples captiuitie, in fasting and teares, was confessing his owne sinnes, and the sinnes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; onely such mourners are fit to stand in the breach, with their payles of water in their hand, I meane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their teares, and strong cryings, like <hi>Moses,</hi> to quench the flames of wrath, which goe out from the Lord to consume vs for our sinnes.</p>
            <p>Now concerning these teares which we are to shed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both for our owne, and other mens sinnes, you shall doe well to take notice of these two things; first, the necessitie of them; and secondly, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:646:16"/>
vertue of them. The necessitie of them<note place="margin">1</note> appeareth, first, by precept; secondly, by<note place="margin">2</note> practice. By precept of God in the old Testament, continually calling vnto his people by his Prophets, <hi>Ioel, Ieremie,</hi> and the rest; <hi>Turne you vnto me with weeping,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel 10. 12.</note> 
               <hi>fasting, and mourning.</hi> And in the ninth of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> marking out all those for life,<note place="margin">Ezech. 9. 4.</note> who did weepe for their owne sinnes, and the sinnes of the people. In the new Testament, by the precept of Christ, who forbade the daughters of Ierusalem to<note place="margin">Luke 23. 28.</note> weepe for him, who was no sinner, but commanded them to weepe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues who were sinners: and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Corinthians to weepe for the vncleannesse of the incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 2.</note> 1. Cor 5. 2.</p>
            <p>The necessitie of them appeareth by the practice of all the Saints, who haue been chiefe mourners for their own, and other mens sinnes. In the old Testament <hi>Dauid</hi> deserueth to haue the place of the chiefe mourner, since he vsed his teares
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:646:17"/>
for sinne, not onely for Physick, and a Bath, as it is in the sixth Psalme; <hi>I washed</hi>

               <hi>my bed euery night with my teares;</hi> but for food: <hi>for my teares were my meate day and night.</hi> If he, who was a man according to Gods owne heart, did thus weepe for his sinnes, how should we, who walke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lusts of our owne hearts, mourne for our sinnes? In this traine of mourners you shall see <hi>Lot,</hi> whose righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 7.</note> soule was grieued and vexed for the filthinesse of the Sodomites. You shal see <hi>Ezra, Josiah, Jsaiah, Joel, Ieremy</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially calling for fountaines of teares, for teares day and night, for powring out their soules like water before the Lord, writing whole bookes of Lamentations for their owne sins, and the sins of their times. In the new Testament wee haue a new traine of mourners and weepers, in which traine you shall see Christ, the chiefe mourner, weeping for the sinnes of Ierusalem; so prone vnto teares, as<note place="margin">Luk. 19 41.</note> that the solemnitie of the time, the ioy of the people, the shoutings and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:646:17"/>
of <hi>Hosanna,</hi> could neither drowne his voyce, but that he lifted it vp: nor dry his eyes, but that hee wept: after him,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 62.</note> commeth <hi>Peter</hi> weeping bitterly for his deniall: <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> wiping Christs<note place="margin">Luke 9. 38.</note> feete with teares for her sinnes, and then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> crying out by reason of his sinnes: but <hi>O miserable man that I am, who</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>shall deliuer mee out of this body of death!</hi> You haue seene sufficiently the necessity of these teares for sinne: see a little the vertue and efficacy of them.</p>
            <p>First, these teares and sighes for our<note place="margin">1</note> sinnes, make vs the better to know our sinnes, both for their colour and weight. Alas, so long as we take ioy and delight in sinne, so long sinne seemeth little, light, easie and sweete vnto vs: but he that here increaseth his sorrow, increaseth his knowledge: when we once come to smart, to grieue and groane vnder sinnes, then we will confesse, that the remembrance of them is grieuous vnto vs, and that the burthen of them is intolerable. As a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the bottome of a bason of water,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:646:18"/>
sheweth as bigge as a shilling: so our sinnes, which to vs seeme but little, steept once in the water of our teares, shew themselues in their iust quantity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as our teares for sins make<note place="margin">2</note> vs know them, so they wash and doe our sins away, so as we shall neuer see them, nor need to know them any more. I dare say, the teares wherewith <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 9. 38.</note> washed Christs feete, did not more wash away the dust from Christs feet, then they did the sinne from her owne soule: for immediatly after her teares did she heare that happy sentence, <hi>Thy sins are forgiuen</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 47.</note> 
               <hi>thee:</hi> therefore are these teares called by the Fathers, Our second Baptisme, by which our sinnes are washed away; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by them to the waters of the red Sea, in which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoast, that<note place="margin">Exod. 14 27.</note> is to say, Satan and our sinnes are drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: To the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> in which,<note place="margin">2. King. 5. 10, 14.</note> if like <hi>Naman,</hi> we wash our selues seuen times, that is to say, often we shall be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the leprosie of sinne: to the waters
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:646:18"/>
of the poole of <hi>Siloam,</hi> because if wee<note place="margin">John 9. 7.</note> bathe our selues in them, we shall be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all spirituall diseases and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: so that if you vse to extoll and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie some waters, which you distill from hearbs and flowers, because they are good against sore eyes, burnings and heats, what doe you then say of these teares, which if you can but distill from your owne eyes, they will cure the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, and all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall heates and desires.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, these teares for sinne, doe<note place="margin">3</note> not only wash away sinne for the present, but wipe them out of all bookes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, so as they discharge vs of our sins for euer: for you must know, that euery sinne we do commit, we write, as it were, in the booke of our owne conscience, a bill of our hand against our selues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we acknowledge our selues debters to Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; lyable to his Iustice. Now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse this debt bee discharged, and the bond cancelled, we must be cast in prison for it, and there lye, til we pay the vtmost
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:646:19"/>
farthing, which God knoweth will bee long enough, for we our selues are not worth one farthing. This bond is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally cancelled by Christ, who, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh, <hi>nayled vnto his Crosse the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>hand-writing of ordinances which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs,</hi> who by his blood did wipe out the letters of this black bill, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs Now what Christ did with the blood of his body, that we in some sort doe with the blood of our soules, that is, our teares: for so they are called by the Fathers: and they doe indeede wipe and eate out that which we haue written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our selues by our sinnes, and stand where those letters did: as one colour laid vpon another doth away the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and remaineth it selfe: iust so, when the booke of our conscience shall come to be opened; if we haue shed teares for our sinnes, there is no score nor register of our sinnes to be found in the Booke. <hi>Whensoeuer a sinner shall repent himselfe</hi> (say some translations, <hi>Ingemuerit</hi>) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane himselfe for his sinnes, J will put away</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:646:19"/>
               <hi>his iniquities out of my remembrance, saith the Lord.</hi> Then our sighes and teares put them out of Gods remembrance, dash them out of his Register, and now our teares doe come in place of them: for saith the Psalmist, <hi>Are not all my teares in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 56. 8.</note> 
               <hi>thy register,</hi> Psalme 56. 8? Our teares then are registred as our discharge and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance for our sinnes; for when hee findeth our teares registred, hee lets vs goe as those, who were marked for<note place="margin">Ezech. 9. 4.</note> mourners, in the ninth of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who by their teares were acquitted from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, without these teares, neither<note place="margin">4</note> first, can we dye vnto sinne, secondly, nor liue vnto God: first, not dye vnto sinne:<note place="margin">1</note> Can one thinke to bee deliuered of so huge a burthen as sinne, without griefe and teares? to haue his shoulder when it is burst, set right, without paine? to haue a tooth pulled out of his head, or a thorne out of his foote, and not crie? No woman looketh to bee deliuered of the Childe which shee hath carried in her wombe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:646:20"/>
but nine moneths, without paine and crying; and can you expect to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a man, the old man, a man of sinne, without crying and teares? Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> and as no dying vnto sinne; so no liuing vnto God, without crying and teares for sinne: for as in diseased bodies, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny member, by a violent hurt is benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and dead, a token that it is dead is this: If the member feele no paine, nor smart when it is pricked, pinched, lanched and cut, but if the Physician by plying of it can bring it to that passe, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth and crieth out at the dressing of it, the Physician, himselfe, and his friends are glad, because it is a sure argument, that the member is aliue, and vpon the recouery: Iust so it is here; If that after we haue been dead in our sinnes and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, so past sense and feeling of them, that we did not sorrow nor shead teares for them, wee can bee brought to haue a sense of them, to weepe and mourne for them; sure, we are yet aliue and vpon our spirituall recouery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:646:20"/>Though I might, yet now I will say no more of the vertue of those teares for sinne, to which holy men haue attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so much as some of the Fathers thinke, that God did indue man with this deaw of teares, for no other end, but that by them he might wipe away and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish his sinne. <hi>Chrysost. hom. 7. ad pop. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrys. hom. 7. ad Populum Antioch.</note> saith, it is plaine by experience; for when we weepe, and grieue for the losse of friends, money, for sicknesse, or any other temporall calamitie, we are so far from diminishing our griefe by our teares, as we doe rather increase it; onely if wee weepe for our sinnes, we diminish our griefe and them, and many times quite wipe them away. And it is very true which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, for though by our teares we are not able to raise our Parents and Friends from death, yet by teares wee are able to raise our soules from the death of sinne. I haue staid the longer at this Well, because it is deepe, and the fire to be quenched by it is very great; a huge mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

regard whereof we must doe that indeed, which <hi>Bonauenture</hi> (how true I know not) reporteth of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> who because hee did see, that he could not follow <hi>agnum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculatum sine macula, opera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dedit vt copio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis &amp; quotidianis lachrymarum imbribus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam purgaret:</hi> The Lambe of God which was without spots, himselfe vnspotted, hee did what lay in him, by his daily showres of teares, to wash away these spots from his soule.</p>
            <p>NOw the second Wel from whence we<note place="margin">Iacobs Well.</note> draw this precious seed of reares, is the consideration of the miseries which attend vpon vs in this life for sinne: which being rightly considered, are able to draw teares from the stoniest heart.

            <p>The consideration of which miserie deserueth so many teares, as that our life (in regard of them) is truly termed, <hi>a valley of teares;</hi> into which valley, one no sooner entreth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he is borne, but (as <hi>Job</hi> hath it) hee beginneth with teares, and crieth: so that being in this World, wee are like <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke, or like Ilanders, who from no point of their Iland can see any thing but waters: so looke any where in this life, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but occasion of teares, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were not much amisse to make Logicians change their termes, and say, that <hi>flebile,</hi> or <hi>lachrymabile,</hi> the facultie of weeping, is more mans <hi>proprium,</hi> then <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile,</hi>

            <p>I haue not time to bid you shed teares, for the miseries common to all men, in regard of which, the Saints of God haue neuer thought other-wise of this life, then of a valley of teares, as of a place of exile or pilgrimage by <hi>Iacob, Dauia,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> of a place of strife and warre, by <hi>Simeon; Lord, now lettest</hi>

It is the deuils cunning, when he meaneth to stop vp this Well of teares, to present the state of this vally of teares to vs, as he did the estate of the land of Egypt to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, to make them remember the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

and cleere Springs there, but to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their seruitude and taske of making of brick, to remember their Garlick, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, and flesh-pots; but to forget their stripes and bonds, or to present it vnto vs, as he did it to Christ; take vs vp<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 8.</note> to the top of a high mountaine, and from thence shew vs all the riches, pompe, and pleasures of the world, but sheweth vs none of the miseries and calamities of it. But now if any of vs from some high Mountaine, could but looke downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this large valley of teares, and there haue at once obiected vnto vs all the speciall miseries and calamities, which men are suffering there, to heare there at once, all the sighes of the sicke, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and rackings of many mens limbs, both by the hand of Iustice and Iniustice, the lamentable cryings of the poore for want of bread, the faint chillinesse, and chattering of many one half starued with cold; heare the disconsolate weeping and teares for the losse of parents, husbands, children, friends; should see the pitifull

anguish and affliction of such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to row in Galleys, work in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, to turne in Mils, to see how they eate nothing but the bread of sorrow by weight, and drinke nothing but the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of affliction by measure; to heare their vnpitied roarings and teares, at the smart of their vnmercifull lashings: nay, if you did see from thence the miseries of a besieged Citie, to heare the roaring of the Canon, the sound of the trumpet, and the noise of the Drum; to heare the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full groanes of men, dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their blood, or swouning in the streetes for famine; to see the women many times (as the Prophet hath it) to eate their owne children of a span long; to see the vncomfortable teares of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and husbands, for the barbarous rauishing of their wiues and daughters. If these, and millions of such miseries in the world, were obiected to vs all at once, and wee did but know what men were doing abroad, perhaps it would draw teares from those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eyes, which now

But let our Master bee as the chiefe mourner in this traine, who shed teares for Ierusalems miseries, for the griefe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his friends; for the text saith<note place="margin">Iohn 11. 15.</note> there directly, Iohn 11 15. that Christ was glad for <hi>Lazarus</hi> his death, that his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might beleeue, so that he wept only for his friends sake, who were then a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; to shew vs the necessitie of our teares, and mourning with those that mourne, say the Fathers on that place.</p>
            <p>Now in shedding our teares for others,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:646:25"/>
wee shall doe well rightly to distribute them. Shed these teares, for these speciall miseries of any men, though they be both Gods enemies and ours, at least in this regard, that they should haue deserued them. Saint <hi>Aug</hi> 1. <hi>lib. de ciu. Dei, cap.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Aug de ciuit.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:646:25"/>
Shall not wee haue as compassionate a mind, as a Heathen man had, when wee heare of the like miseries, which many in the world sustaine, though they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to our State, to our Religion, though they were Papists, nay, though they were Pagans? If his example can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moue vs to be of his mind, yet (as the Apostle speaketh) Philip. 2. 5. <hi>Let that</hi>

which they were to be destroied, he shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth first teares from his eyes for them. Shed then these teares for such miseries of any men, though your enemies, and Gods enemies.</p>
            <p>But what now if the parties vnder these miseries be Gods friends, professing the same Religion and Worship with vs? then let vs with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and those that were with him, for the burning of Zik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag, <hi>Lift vp our voyces, and weepe till wee</hi>

foure yeeres did thinke their soules as farre from death, as we now thinke ours, whose eyes were as dry as ours bee now, whose feete, as they thought, were as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from falling, as ours are now; but since, their feet haue slipped, their soules haue tasted of death, their eyes haue bin drowned with teares, because of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in their streets, and carrying away into captiuitie, because the sword of their enemies hath been glutted with their flesh, and made drunke with their blood; and shall not wee sow and shed some teares for them?</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou thy selfe diddest weepe for Ierusalem, and yet that thou wouldest not suffer the daughters of Ierusalem to weepe for thee? that thou makest so small account of thy selfe, in regard of vs, that thou canst not choose but weepe, when thou considerest, that in Ierusalem, there shall not be left so much, as one stone vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; and yet thou wilt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that the daughters of that trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Citie shall weepe, to see thee keepe not so much as one drop of blood by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:646:33"/>O but secondly, grieue and weepe much more, that we were the cause of all this his suffering: you are deceiued, if you thinke it was either the hands, or tongues of Christs enemies, that did cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie and reuile Christ, so much as our sinnes did. Not all the hands of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers could haue done it; he said no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 6.</note> to them; <hi>I am he, but they fell dead to the ground,</hi> Iohn 8. 6. What was it then? heare the Prophet, <hi>Propter scelus populi mei per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussi eum;</hi> heare the Apostle, Sinners do<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>crucifie againe vnto themselues the King of glorie, and make a mocke of him,</hi> Heb. 6. 6. What our sinnes doe now, they did then; the Iewes cried out, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie</hi>

               <hi>him;</hi> their malice was so great, that if it had been possible, they would haue had him twice crucified; and they had their wish: for they did it once with their hands, and we did it with our sinnes: let vs shed teares for that.</p>
            <p>The necessitie and vertue of these teares, drawne from our Sauiours Well, see both at once in one word: because we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:646:33"/>
must be like Christ, that sheweth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of them, and they make vs like Christ, that sheweth the vertue of them; if the head weepe, the hand must not play, nor the foot dance; and if the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers condole, when the head weepeth, it maketh the members like the head. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Vriahs</hi> answer to <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee would haue had him gone home to reioyce with his wife: <hi>Doth my Lord and</hi>

Did our head weepe, and shall not our eyes shed teares? Let it be the answere wee make to all the pleasures and vanities of this world, when they would perswade vs onely to laughter, and to forget teares. And thus much of the teares which wee may draw from this third Well, which I called our Sauiours Well.</p>
            <p>THe fourth Well, I called the Well of<note place="margin">The Well of Life. Psal 36. 9.</note> life, or Gods Well; <hi>With thee is the Well of life,</hi> Psal. 36. 9. How can wee out
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:646:34"/>
of this Well draw teares? Euen because wee cannot come at this Well. Let vs weepe, because in this life we are forced<note place="margin">Psal. 137. 1.</note> to sit by the waters of Babylon, and are yet strangers, and as it were, banished and barred from being satisfied with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of that Riuer, which gladdeth the Citie of God. Alas, if wee did consider that our Country were Heauen, and did apprehend this place here below, to bee our prison, or place of banishment, the least absence from our Country would draw teares from our eyes, and sighes from our hearts, with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 120. 5.<note place="margin">Psal. 120. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Woe is me that J soiourne in Mesech, and am constrained to dwell in the Tents of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:646:34"/>
should we doe then, when wee consider our long absence from <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and our being banished like our father <hi>Adam,</hi> for a certaine time, from the heauenly Paradise? Do you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how the Iewes behaued themselues in the 137. Psalme, in the time of their exile and captiuitie, while they sat by the<note place="margin">Psal. 137.</note> Riuers and Waters of Babylon? they wept, would not be comforted, hanged vp their Harpes and Instruments. What are the waters of Babylon, but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights of the World, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of confusion, as the word signifieth? Now when the people of God sit by them, that is to say, doth not carelessely, but deliberately, with a settled conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, see them slide by and passe away; and compareth them with Sion, that is to say, with the vnconceiueable riuers of pleasure, which are permanent in the heauenly Ierusalem; How can they chuse but weepe, when they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues sitting by the one, and soiourning from the other? And it is worthy your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:646:35"/>
obseruing, that notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the Iewes had many causes of teares; the Caldeans had robbed them of their goods, honors, Countries, libertie, parents, children, friends; the chiefe thing for all this, that they mourne for, is their absence from Sion; <hi>We wept, while we remembred thee, O Sion;</hi> for their absence from Ierusalem. What should wee then doe for our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from another manner of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem? theirs was an earthly, old, robbed, spoyled, burned, sacked Ierusalem; ours a Heauenly new one, into which no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row can be shot, no noyse of the Drum heard, nor sound of the Trumpet, nor calling vnto battell: who would not then weepe, to be absent from hence?</p>
            <p>The necessity of these teares you may easily see, because God giueth none of the water of the Well of life; that is to say, eternall happinesse, but to such who by the importunitie of their teares doe begge it, and obtaine it of him. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them is seene, because the Saints who sought heauen with these teares, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

whence we may draw these teares, this precious Seede, which heere wee are commanded to sowe. Though prophane men thinke these teares, but the badge of hypocrites; yet know, that <hi>Dauid</hi> did sowe them, who was none, but a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods owne heart. That they proceede out of childishnesse and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> did sowe them, <hi>who was wiser then his Ancients and Teachers:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 119. 99, 100.</note> though they doe account them woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and signes of weakenesse; yet <hi>Dauid</hi> did sowe them, who had the heart of a Lion, and was one of the Worthies, and valiant men of Israel. Though they thinke they proceed of idlenesse and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinesse; yet did <hi>Dauid</hi> sowe them, a man as full of businesse, both in peace and warre, as euer was any.

            <p>I doubt not, but that some such sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there are; &amp; these are they that stand in the breach, and that the wrath of God doth not burne among vs, as it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many, perhaps lesse deseruing then we: no question, a good part of the cause is, the seed of these sowers, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares of these men of teares, which they throw vpon the deuouring flames of wrath, which are gone forth from the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:646:39"/>
Lord, the number of which teares, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they bee increased, and in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion of Christendome, we will shew our selues as swift in running to the foure Wells aboue mentioned, as we can be forward to run and ride, if wee heare but of any new vpstart Well in the Countrie, and from them bring pales full of teares to quench this flame; the fire may go on, and as now it is in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours house, so next it may take hold of ours.</p>
            <p>Now as all are bound to sowe these<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 3.</note> teares, so they especially, who in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Sower, Matth. 13. 3. are desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that name, I meane, Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: for if the seede in that Parable, be the Word of God, then the sowers must bee the Ministers of that Word. The Seers and Watchmen of Israel, as they ought with <hi>Ioel, Jeremy,</hi> and the rest (if from the Towers of Sion they spie any fire approching vnto it) to call to all the people of God for teares, to meete and quench the flame: so they ought first to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:646:39"/>
powre out their owne teares; <hi>si vis me flere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi.</hi> Where onely by the way, note how much these Ministers and sowers are mistaken, who vse to sowe and preach the Word of God, not in teares, but in laughter, and thinke they sowe best, when their wit makes the people laugh. But alas, it were more wisdome to make them weepe. From this kind of sowing, they shall reap but small ioy from the fruite of their Auditors, and lesse ioy in their owne consciences from the remembrance of it, when they shall lie vpon their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds. Now I haue done with the seede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; <hi>They that sow in teares.</hi> I come to the Haruest, and will dispatch it more quickly: <hi>Shall reape in ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN which, as I told you, wee must take<note place="margin">The Haruest.</note> notice of three things: First, the <hi>Corne, Joy:</hi> Secondly, the manner of gathering it, <hi>Reaping;</hi> they shall reape. Thirdly, the Reapers, <hi>they,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Sowers.</hi> For the Corne, <hi>Ioy,</hi> as I told you, that we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:646:40"/>
were to be choyce in the seed: All teares not to be sowne: so not euery Ioy here to be reaped, nor expected. As I told you of three sorts of teares, so I pray you take notice of three sorts of Ioyes.<note place="margin">Three sorts of ioyes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, sensuall ioy, not that it is a Ioy<note place="margin">1</note> indeed, but because men call it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it so: for it is a beastly sensualitie and voluptuousnesse, and though it doth arise from the externall sense, yet because it ariseth onely from sense, it is against all sense, that it should be called Ioy, and may as well be called a sencelesse, as a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall ioy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ioy is humane or worldly<note place="margin">2</note> ioy, whereby a man is delighted with vertue and honestie, by the naturall or reasonable contemplation of them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these ioyes be that Ioy you must heere looke to reape; for Christ hath promised these ioyes to the World, <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 20.</note> 
               <hi>autem gaudebit;</hi> but the World shall reioyce: A world full of these ioyes will neuer make a Haruest; for though to the sence they seeme to grow fairer and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:646:40"/>
higher then true Ioy, yet when you come to the haruest-field, they prooue but wilde Oates, which many times grow higher then the Corne; or like the gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die flowers among the Corne, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disgrace it, then grace it, and proue both the corne to bee naught, and the ground barren; these ioyes be such, as the Mower filleth not his hand with them, nor the gleaner his lap.</p>
            <p>The third Ioy then, and that which is<note place="margin">3</note> here meant, is spirituall, which ariseth from the inioying of God and spirituall things, and it is called spirituall ioy, both because it is apprehended and perceiued not by our senses, but by our spirits, but especially because the Spirit of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth this ioy in vs, and is the cause of it, who therefore is called the <hi>Comforter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 16.</note> 
               <hi>or bringer of ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOw this spiritual ioy is twofold, here<note place="margin">Diuision of spirituall ioy.</note> and hence: first, in <hi>via;</hi> secondly, in <hi>patria:</hi> first, the ioy which we feele while wee are vpon our way or iourney in this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:646:41"/>
life; and secondly, the ioy wee shal feele, when we are come to our iournies end, in the life to come, both of which we shall reape from teares; the one we may for distinctions sake call spirituall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heauenly Ioy; the one, the first fruits or earnest of the Spirit, the other, the haruest or whole summe: for whereas in other haruests, the gleaning followeth, but in Heauen there is no gleaning, but all haruest, God is there all in all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God here before bestoweth vpon vs something answerable to a gleaning; he bestoweth vpon vs here some eares of this Corne, till the Haruest be ripe; the one is, the ioy which the prodig all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 18.</note> when hee thought but of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his father; the other, the ioy of kissing, weeping, falling on his necke, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,<note place="margin">Vers. 22. &amp;c.</note> and musicke, which hee conceiued vpon his meeting with his Father: the<note place="margin">Numb. 13. 24.</note> one, the bunch of grapes, which <hi>Joshuahs</hi> Spies brought to shew the goodnesse of the Land; the other, the whole Vintage, <hi>The milke &amp; hony where with the Land ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed.</hi>

Of inheriting our Country, from our absence, from which wee wept so much; and if it were not for this hope, the heart would breake. It was this ioy, the ioy of hope of looking after the recompence of the reward, which made the Martyrs so merry; from this ioy of hope came their reioycing, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, kissing of the stake, as it is reported of <hi>Theodorus</hi> that young man, who when by <hi>Iulians</hi> command, he was drag'd to most terrible tortures, hee is said so to haue sung and reioyced, as hee made his very torturers to blush; hee perswaded some almost, others altogether to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians.

               <hi>not seene, nor eare heard, neither haue entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for those that loue him.</hi> The eye can see very farre: I will not stand to tell you, how farre the Opticks tell vs that a man may see, hauing all aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but it is certaine, that a man may see wonderfull farre in the night, because he may see the Starres of the Firmament;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:646:46"/>
which are so farre distant from vs, that <hi>Philo</hi> (laughing at the folly of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish builders) affirmeth, That a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone would be foure hundred yeeres in falling to the earth from the Spheare of the Moone: and Astronomers, That it would bee fifteene hundred yeeres a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the firmament, where the Stars are. And yet though our eye can see thus farre, yet it cannot pierce into this Ioy: he goeth on to the eare, which extendeth it selfe a great deale farther then the eye, which onely looketh vpon things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but by our eare wee know things past, the glorie of all the Monarchies and Empires that are past, the glory of all things that now are, and all the things which are foretold shall be; and yet our eares haue neuer heard of any thing like this Ioy: he goeth on; <hi>neither hath entred into the heart of man to vnderstand:</hi> That is more then both the former, the eie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth things present, the eare things past, present, and to come, they go no farther: but the vnderstanding appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth

Sure these are great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Apostle: Can we find no other way to know this Ioy? As <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> sent out som Spies to spy the Land:<note place="margin">Numb. 13 18.</note> so we haue 2. special me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Scripture, who haue spied this ioy; <hi>Iohn</hi> in a Vision, <hi>Paul</hi> in his Person: Can they tell vs nothing of this Ioy? Yes, <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs something of it, but his expressions are darke, in regard of the light that is there; for he expresseth it by flouds, Riuers, Mountains, Mettals, stones, all which are but materiall things, and whatsoeuer hee saith, is not good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be a shadow of this Ioy: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> is forbid to tell vs what he heard, and was so rauished with that he did see, as that he is confounded, and can say nothing of it: nay, not so much as now foureteene yeeres after he was there, tell

                  </gap>. Cor. 12. 3.</note> out of the body: it must be a great ioy which so dazelled him. When men see things in a dreame or vision, then they thinke they see them in the body; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe to themselues and senses, they know that they did not see them in the body: but the Apostle foureteene yeeres after, cannot tell whether hee saw that ioy in the body, or out of the body. Now after these great expressions of the impossibility of expressing it, I will neuer goe about to doe it; onely I will giue you a taste of it by this one drop: One drop of this Ioy, is able to quench al the fire that burneth, to dry and stop all the teares, weeping, and gnashing of teeth, which is in hell; the rich glutton in hell desired <hi>Abraham</hi> to send <hi>Lazarus</hi> with<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 24</note> one drop of water to coole him. From whence wee must not inferre, that the paines of hell are so little, as they may be quenched with one drop of water, but rather make this safe inference, that one drop of that water where <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:646:48"/>
               <hi>Lazarus</hi> were, is of such infinite power and sweetnesse, that if it could bee but dropped into the flames of hell, it would quench them all. The greatnesse of this Ioy may be comprehended in these two words; in the fulnesse of the obiect, and in the fulnesse of inioying this obiect. The obiects are many, but the summe of all is God, whom we shal see face to face, and in him all the ioyes and goodnesse which is in Heauen with him: for as looking in a glasse, we see the glasse, our selues, and all things about it; so in that glasse of the Trinitie, we shall by a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall Vision, see the glory of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, see our selues, and our owne glorie, and all the Angels, Saints and pleasures of Heauen, which are round about that Trinitie. And as our ioy shall be full, in regard of the fulnesse of this obiect, so it shall bee full, in regard of our fulnesse of inioying it; we shall feele this ioy with all our powers and faculties; and neuer haue done feeling it, euer beholding, though alwaies satisfied; euer drinking
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:646:48"/>
and yet still thirsting, <hi>non per sitim siccita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> saith the schoole, <hi>sed per sitim ardoris &amp; desiderii,</hi> not with any thirst of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but with the thirst of desire. This is all I will at this time say of the Ioy of Heauen.</p>
            <p>But now how come we to reape this Ioy from our teares? It is a thing that both standeth with reason, and with good iustice: with reason; for as sweete Spices, when they are burnt in the fire, or beaten in the Morter, send forth their sweete smell and sauour: so after our teares and griefe, God may well send vs this pleasure and ioy; with Gods iustice and goodnesse it standeth, that those soules which haue refrained themselues from worldly delights, which cannot bee without some sorrow and sadnesse, should one day bee filled with ioy and gladnesse, that those vessels, which for the inioying of God, did emptie themselues of all ioy here, should run ouer with ioy in Heauen, that as <hi>Ioseph</hi> (Gen. 45.) after<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 2, 3, 4.</note> he had vsed his brethren a little roughly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:646:49"/>
at first could hold himselfe no longer, but must needs ouer-ioy them, with making himselfe knowne to them: so Christ our elder Brother, after he hath vsed vs here a little hardly vnder the rod, and made vs shed many a salt teare, should shew vs himselfe in Heauen, wipe those teares from our eyes, and fill them with ioy and laughter. Though you see therefore the Children of God in teares, nay and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in blood, both broken-hearted, and broken-boned, despaire not for all this, but that one day you may see them shine in Ioy, like the bright Starres of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> When you see one in the streets from euery dunghill, gather old pieces of rags &amp; clouts, little would you thinke, that of these rotten rags beaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Mill, should bee made such pure fine Paper, as afterwards we see: and so from teares we doe not expect pure Ioy, which notwithstanding is the pure Corne wee are promised heere from this seede of Teares. I haue done with the Corne, Ioy; now I come to the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:646:49"/>
manner of gathering it, which is reaping.</p>
            <p>IF we haue not scattered, but sowed, wee<note place="margin">The Reaping.</note> shall not gather or gleane, but reape; that is to say, Looke how farre the corne which Husbandmen receiue in Haruest, doth exceede the seede which they did sowe in seede-time, so farre shall the Ioy which we shall reape, exceede the teares which wee did sowe. When God suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to sorrow, he euer keepeth in his hand, and suffereth teares perhaps, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our soules, but not to goe ouer our soules; but in bestowing his mercies and ioyes, hee euer stretcheth forth his hand, <hi>&amp; semper,</hi> say Diuines, <hi>praemiat vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracondignum;</hi> He filleth our cup full, and maketh it to runne ouer.

               <hi>the acceptable yeere of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God:</hi> but the Apostle, 2. Cor. 4. 7. hath cut the one so short, and<note place="margin">2.

And though some that haue sowne in teares, doe complaine of the latenesse or thinnesse of the Haruest, that they haue not reaped in Ioy, as is here promised, know, that some grounds are later then others, and some yeeres the Haruest falleth later then others, and that God, who is the Lord of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, in his good time will ripen thy Ioy, and thou shalt reape it: and in the meane time, if we trie it narrowly, we shall find the cause in our selues, both of the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our Ioy, because wee were too late of sowing our teares; and of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our Ioy, because we did sowe our teares too thin. And if after our sowing of teares we find no haruest of ioy at all, we may be well assured, that either our seede was not good; that is to say, our teares none of them which are heere meant, or else some of the mischances is come vpon them, which came vpon the seede that came to no good in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

Psal. 84. 6. Such onely come to appeare<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 6.</note> before God in Sion, who passe through the valley of Baca, that is to say, teares. And indeed there is no other way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heauen but by affliction, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, griefe, and teares. There are in the new Testament twelue names especially giuen to the Kingdome of Heauen, and the celestial ioy which we hope to reape; but looke to them narrowly, and you shall find, that <hi>quantum honoris</hi> is in euery one of them, <hi>tantum etiam &amp; oneris;</hi> that as there is pleasure in them, so there is toyle and teares likewise, before you can come thither. Matth. 11.

And lastly, <hi>A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise; This night shall thou bee with mee in Paradise:</hi> but you know how Paradise was guarded, with a guard of Cherubins, Fire, and the blade of a sword shaken, to passe through which guard, it must cost vs some paines and danger: and besides these twelue, herein the Text it is called <hi>a Ioy,</hi> but such a one as onely those shall reape, who first sowe in teares: So that these men, who trauelling to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of God, take not the valley of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, that is to say, the valley of teares in their way, but shun it; and had rather take the way of the flowrie and gawdy Meddowes: So as there is no Meddow in their way, in which they leaue not some tokens of their merriment and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, as it is 2. Wisd. They are out of their way, <hi>Errant &amp; errant toto coelo,</hi> they are wide, and as wide as the wide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

               <hi>Ergo errauimus, &amp;c. Therefore wee went astray from the way of truth;</hi> as therefore all they, so none but they who sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy; which is the proposition of the text, that by Gods assistance I haue now expounded vnto you. And it is in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those propositions, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertible and reciprocal, for as they that sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy: so it is as true, that those that sowe in ioy, shall reape in teares; if by Ioy you vnderstand world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioy; and by teares, vncomfortable teares here, and desperate weeping and gnashing of teeth hereafter. Christ himself hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted these two propositions, Luk. 6. 21. for <hi>Blessed are you that weepe now, for you shall laugh.</hi> So it is in the 25. verse; <hi>Woe be vnto you that laugh now, for you shal weep.</hi> And as I told you of our ioy, so I tell you of their teares: for they shal find, that their weeping shal as much exceede their ioy, as reaping doth sowing; al their ioyes are but momentarie, or for dayes, at most, for yeeres: but there shall be no end of their Haruest of teares, it shal come in so fast vpon them; neuer shall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:646:54"/>
their teares faile to fall from their eyes, nor neuer shall any teare that falleth, bee wiped from their eyes: and if they should shed but euery yeere that they must remaine in that bottomles valley of teares, one teare, they shall shed more teares then there be drops of water in all the Ocean; for though we cannot number the drops of water in the Ocean, yet God can precisely tell, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are euen to one: but these teares neither God nor man can number, because they are numberlesse and infinite teares, which they shall reape, who sowe in Ioy; as that Ioy is infinite which they shall reape, who sow in teares. And so now by Gods assistance and your patience, I haue cleared my hands of my text: <hi>They that sowe in teares, shall reape in Ioy.</hi>
