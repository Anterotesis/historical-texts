            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE OBSERVATOR IN A DELEMMA, that while he juſtifies the LORD MAYOR and his Aldermen, he reflects on Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> and while he Vindicates Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> he pleads the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors cauſe againſt the Lord Mayor and his Aldermen.</head>
            <p>WHereas the Guide to the Inferiour Clergy, in his <hi>Obſervator,</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 206, does inſinuate as if the print on the back ſide of the Citizens juſt Proteſtation, did reflect on my Lord Mayor's Aldermen as Perjured, which nothing can be more Malicious, there being not one word that does in the leaſt ſound like it, but 'tis like him; Now Mr. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,</hi> if I am not miſtaken, I have found you in ſome of your Prints, if not expreſly, yet implicitly declare, that any Subject (thô he pretends never ſo much Loyalty, and faithful performance of his Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) that ſhall refuſe when Legally qualified, to ſerve his Majeſty in any Legal Office, when Legally called thereunto, doth not only forfeit his Loyalty, but break his Oath of Allegiance too; now Mr. <hi>Ralph Box</hi> having of late been by you in Print declared to be one moſt eminent for Loyalty and Allegiance, which is ſo great a Truth, that I affirm that none but the moſt malicious dare think to the contrary; he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo been declared by my Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen (that is his Party) to be Legally and duely Elected one of the Sheriffs for the Year enſuing, according to the Ancient Laws, Cuſtoms and Uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the City; and on Tueſday laſt the aforeſaid Legality of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was Confirmed by a hundred and odd Petitioners; now that Mr. <hi>Box</hi> after the miſſing the Office of Sheriff for two years laſt paſt, is this year declared Legally Choſen, and that Confirmed too by a Cloud of Loyal Witneſſes, ſhould after all refuſe to hold, has put multitudes of Pople to inquire into the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>For to queſtion his Loyalty and faithfulneſs to his Oath of Allegiance, is to murder his Reputation, to queſtion his Willingneſs is to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Lye, to queſtion his Eſtate is to prejudice his Credit, and to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his Judgment and Underſtanding, his natural and acquired qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for ſuch an Office, is to deny the experience of all that know him; Wherefore the moſt Judicious do conclude, that the true reaſon why he refuſed to hold, is from his being ſo faithful to his Oath as a Citizen, and from his ſo much Underſtanding and Experience of the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the City, than to hold upon ſuch an Election, which if true, as moſt certain it is, for I challenge you or any other to ſhew any reaſon for his not holding beſides the Ilegallity of his Election, and then what is become of your reflection on the back ſide of the Proteſtation? for 'tis not the declaration of great men, nor a great number of men (without the greateſt number) that can make a Legal thing Illegal, nor an Illegal Act Legal.</p>
