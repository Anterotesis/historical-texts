            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

according to the words of
<pb facs="tcp:13661:11"/>
Christ; <hi>Where our treasure
is, there are our hearts,</hi> and
thereof wee continually
thinke: DAVID had his
heart set vpon his treasure
hid with Christ aboue,
which made him to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
&amp; cheerefully to sing,
<hi>O, how loue I the Law of the
Lord? It is my continuall

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13661:12"/>
All the promises of God
in Scripture doe administer
vnto the faithfull, matter of
continuall meditation and
serious consideration; and
among many of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
his promse of defence
and deliuery of his in the
time of danger, trouble,
and affliction, is to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
considered, for that it
concerneth especially the
children of God that are
most afflicted: who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>the waies of God</hi> to
be <hi>mercy and truth,</hi> and that
what he promiseth he will
assuredly performe, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:13661:12"/>
but worke patience, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
hope; and how can
he bee without continuall
holy Meditation, whose
heart is with God, from
whom he hopeth his helpe
will come, but in Gods
owne time; and therefore
though wee hope, we may
not make haste; though he
promise to defend vs from
danger, &amp; deliuer vs in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he will not so answer
our expectations, as if wee
knew the time when, or the
manner how to be releeued
or defended, better than he.
He will exercise his owne
<pb facs="tcp:13661:13"/>
children awhile to proue
their patience, faith and
obedience, to cause vs to
meditate and ponder his
word and promise, till hee
haue sufficiently tried our
constant assurance of his
timely deliuery, for it is his
property to come to helpe
his, when they thinke hee
hath most forgotten them.</p>
               <p>How suffered he <hi>Dauid,</hi>
a man chosen after his
owne heart, to bee enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with infinite dangers,
in so much as he thought
God had forsaken him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
and forgotten
<pb facs="tcp:13661:13"/>
him, and therefore cries
out, <hi>How long wilt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
me Lord, for euer?</hi> and
againe hee confessed that
God had giuen him his
hearts desire, and that hee
had not denied the request
of his lips, whereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that the sorce of liuely
faith, holy meditation, and
diuine prayer, are able to
make (God offended) God
appeased suddenly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
sorrow, and so bring
ioy.</p>
               <p>God hath promised to
be a defence to the faithfull
in whatsoeuer dangers, yet
<pb facs="tcp:13661:14"/>
if we wel weigh and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the course of Gods
dealing with his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and duly meditate of
his power, prouidence and
wisdome; wee shall finde
that hee doth not alwaies<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
come immediatly at the
call of his dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
DAVID was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and persecuted
long, <hi>Ioseph</hi> was impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
long, they both pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for deliuery, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in a hard estate, which
was an argument in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reason that God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not for them: and
<pb facs="tcp:13661:14"/>
aboue them both was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<hi>Iob</hi> long and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies afflicted, God
saw his miseries and heard
his prayers, but he left him
yet to be an example to vs
of like expectation of Gods
timely releeuing vs, and in
his good time he made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
a King, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> the
chiefe vnder <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> and restored <hi>Iob</hi> to
his former, yea, to farre
greater glory.</p>
               <p>Thus doth God try his
dearest children, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
them to know and
acknowledge, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb facs="tcp:13661:15"/>
hee seeme to absent
himselfe from them in their
deepest dangers, and to
seeme deafe (as it were) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their prayers, he yet hath
an eie both on them and
their enemies: hee was a
shelter vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<hi>Saul;</hi> he saw <hi>Ioseph</hi> in
prison, but with his liberty
prepared his aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He saw <hi>Iobs</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but kept a hooke in
Satans nosthrills, that all
that he did against <hi>Iob</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to his finall comfort.</p>
               <p>Though therefore it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

<pb facs="tcp:13661:15"/>
and enuironed with so
many and mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and troopes of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that there appeareth
no euasion, no deliuery, by
any visible meanes; yet
there remaineth holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
patient deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods wonderfull
deliuerances of his, in all
like dangers: <hi>Consider Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
and all his troubles,</hi> and
you shall finde hee fainted
not, but depended onely
vpon the promises and
prouidence of God, with
a godly resolution, to wait
<pb facs="tcp:13661:16"/>
the issue of his hope, onely
meditating on Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and considering his
waies, and how he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dealt with <hi>Abraham,
Izaak, Iaacob, Noah, Lot,
Moses,</hi> and other faithfull
fathers before him; the
meditation and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of whose wonderfull
deliueries cannot but work
assurance in any beleeuing

though by vnlike and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

<pb facs="tcp:13661:16"/>
of his, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our faith in God, <hi>Our

called vpon thee, and were
heard, they prayed vnto thee
and thou deliueredst them
out of all their troubles;</hi> as
if hee should say in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by way of Meditation,
I finde by the Word of
God, that he hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many before my time,
that trusted in him &amp; called
vpon him, in greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
than I am in, why then
should I doubt or despaire
of like deliuery? I trust in
him as these fathers trusted:
<pb facs="tcp:13661:17"/>
I call vpon, and pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him as they did, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely hee will heare
me, and helpe me in time
conuenient; thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
meditate in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>God commanded <hi>Iaacob</hi>
to returne from <hi>Laban</hi> his
Vncle, into his countrie
and Kindred (from whom
and whence he fled) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to doe him good,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9. Could <hi>Iaacob</hi>
doe lesse than meditate and
t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>inke seriously of this
command and promise of
God, considering hee was
<pb facs="tcp:13661:17"/>
to returne to his desperatly
malicious brother <hi>Esau,</hi>
who sought to murther
him? yet vpon due Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and consideration of
Gods faithfull promise of
defending him and doing
him good, hee ouercame
feare by faithfull prayer,
and the Lord appeased his
brothers malice towards
him.</p>
               <p>Examples of like nature
are plentifull in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as of <hi>Mordecay</hi> and
the <hi>Iewes, Ester</hi> 7. of the

many others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13661:18"/>
Holy meditation is most
necessary, and an especiall

and prayer can neuer be so
powerfull as vpon holy
premeditation, though

               <p>Seeing then that there is

<pb facs="tcp:13661:19"/>

at Gods hands (who is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely

out of dangers and

readinesse to helpe his, as

2 King. 18. 13. to 30.
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 3. and
others, assuming as it were the

They praid to none, but they as

abominable, blasphemous, and
deuilish; whose ends may onely
serue to terrifie such (though
neuer so mighty, preuailing in

forsake the liuing God, and trust

that are no gods: such are not
<pb facs="tcp:13661:21"/>

               <p>Great is the force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

of faithfull Prayer, euen of
such as haue beene subiect to
like passions as we are: <hi>Ioshua</hi>
prayed, and the Sunne and
Moone stood still, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 12.
<pb facs="tcp:13661:23"/>
                  <hi>Elisha</hi> prayed, and his enemies
were strucken with blindnesse,
2 <hi>Kings 6. 18. Eliah</hi> prayed,
and fire fell from Heauen and
destroyed them that came to
take him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Faithfull Prayer doth as it
were ouercome God, in somuch as
when he hath a purpose to punish
a people, or a person, he wil forbid
the faithfull to pray for them,
lest he should be ouercome with
their prayer, and so be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to spare them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10,
11. If the prayer of one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man may restraine God, as
it were, from executing his
iudgements vpon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how much more may faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prayer preuaile for the good
of a faithfull man?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13661:23"/>
What should then hinder our
Prayer to God in our owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
and dangers? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but impatience and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
for if in a true and liuely
faith, and holy intention, wee
present our humble supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vnto God through Christ,
according to his will reuealed in
his Word, and wauer not,
Christ himselfe assureth vs to
obtaine what wee pray for;
<hi>Whatsoeuer yee aske</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the Father in my name,
hee will giue it you,</hi> Iohn
16. 23.</p>
               <p>Let vs not then be cast downe
in our spirits, but let vs lift vp
our hearts to him that seeth vs,
and taketh care for vs, and
hath both will and power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
<pb facs="tcp:13661:24"/>
vs. Hee hath a time in
his wisdome to humble vs, and a
time in his mercy to helpe vs;
a time to debase vs, and a time
to relieue vs in despight of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and his most malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
he had his time to
afflict <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and
<hi>Dauid;</hi> and in his time againe
he deliuered them. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all our trialls, troubles
and afflictions call vpon God in
the Name of his Sonne, and we
shall finde that euen in our holy
Meditations he will thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs, but before we speake, he
will answer vs: and while wee
are yet praying, hee will heare
vs and helpe vs, and we shall
giue glory vnto his name.</p>
               <p>The faithfull onely haue the
<pb facs="tcp:13661:24"/>
promise to bee heard and relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
when they call faithfully,
and perseuere constantly, on the
true God. What true comfort
then or hope can they haue in
their prayers, that in stead of
calling on the liuing God in
Christ, cry vnto, and trust in,
false gods? They may cry and
knock their breasts, and cut
their flesh, and afflict their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
like <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
profit: though they may
prosper and preuaile a while to
the hardning of their hearts,
in the end they shall be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and perish at the rebuke of
the God of hosts, as were <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
that great King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyt,</hi>
that contemned God, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus
14. 27, 28. Senacherib</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13661:25"/>
that blasphemed God, 2 <hi>Kings
9. 35. Antiochus</hi> that wicked
root, <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 11. and all such
wicked Tyrants, that despising
the liuing God, trust in their
owne strength, and hunt after
the children of God to shed their
innocent bloud; let them alone,
their confusion sleepeth not.</p>
               <p>The strength of an army is
faithfull prayer to the God of
armies; an host of men, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and militarie furniture,
are necessarie meanes; but
without deuout and feruent
prayer to God, best counsell is
vaine, aad strength feeble:
But where God is present in
both, affording a blessing to
both, there is certaine and true
victorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13661:25"/>
We are not indeed to expect
miraculous deliueries, and to
neglect the meanes; but where
ordinary meanes faile (of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity)
there may wee safely pray
and expect extraordinary. Our
owne experience doth approue
this to be true in two principall
late deliueries, wherein neither
the force nor wisdome of man
can bee said to haue the first
place; but God alone by his
owne wisdome found out the
preuention, and gaue such issue
to the inferiour execution, as is
maruellous in the eies of all men,
admired euen of our enemies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom God himselfe shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe an enemy: which
may teach and encourage vs
and all posterities to bee confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="tcp:13661:26"/>
constant and conuersant in
feruent prayer to him that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs, and discouered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
those that rose vp
both openly and secretly, to haue
as it were<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> swallowed vs vp
quite.</p>
               <p>And by these our deliueries,
we may well see and vnderstand
that if we call vpon him, he can
worke for our preseruation, as
well without meanes as by
meanes; yea where ordinary
meanes faile, he is able to raise
extraordinary, as hee did in
parting the waters for his owne
people to passe, and with the
same waters drowned their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
for he is the same God he
was then, and he that saies that
God neither can nor will worke
<pb facs="tcp:13661:26"/>
extraordinarily at this day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
him to be God at this day;
but as faithfull prayers were
auaileable in our fore-fathers
daies, as when <hi>Moses</hi> prayed
feruently, the Israelites preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and when hee waxed cold,
the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had the better,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. euen so are fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
and faithfull prayers effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
at this day.</p>
               <p>We must yet beware, lest while
we pray with our tongues, that
our hearts and hope bee not set
vpon carnall meanes; for then
will God haue no respect vnto
our prayers, God will be either
the whole or no obiect of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
he will part his owne
glory with none.</p>
               <p>He may and doth afford his
<pb facs="tcp:13661:27"/>
most faithfull children visible
meanes; and if by them we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
we may not attribute our
good successe vnto the meanes,
but vnto the sword of the Lord,
not to <hi>Gideon:</hi> wee may not say
this man did, or without that
man wee had beene ouercome;
man may doe valiantly; but the
victory is onely of God who bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the meanes; neither are we
to neglect outward meanes and
so presume vpon God; it is a
tempting of him, and argues no
true confidence in him, neither
may we contemne the meanes, be
they neuer so seeming weake, for
Gods power is seene in weaknes,
and his wisdome in our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>Therefore whether our means
<pb facs="tcp:13661:27"/>
seeme likely or vnlikely of good
successe, let them neither lift
vs vp or cast vs downe, neither
make vs presume or despaire,
for God can saue as well by few
as by many, as appeareth by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi>
who with three hundred
men ouercame a huge host of
the <hi>Medianites, Iudg.</hi> 7. 13
He can supply our occasions as
well by little as by much: <hi>Elijah</hi>
with little food trauelleth forty
daies and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi>
19. 8. Many examples might
bee produced, but no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
in holy Scripture is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
and therefore our faith
should not bee the more assured
through the greatnesse, nor the
more dismaid at the weaknesse
of visible meanes, but to depend
<pb facs="tcp:13661:28"/>
onely on the prouidence of God
in prayer, wherein we are to vse
all reuerence, knowing that we
are in the presence of an <hi>infinite
Maiesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our prayers also must be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
without hypocrisie, for hee
is a God that searcheth the
heart, he is iealous, he will not
be mocked, nor can he be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by outward conformity, for
he can finde out a counterfeit;
though <hi>Izaak</hi> could not discouer
<hi>Iaacob</hi> from <hi>Esau: Ahijah</hi> the
Prophet, by the Spirit of God
could discouer disguised <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
wife, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 6.
Therefore must our prayers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a sincere, vpright, and
faithfull heart, beleeuing that
God is willing to beare and able
<pb facs="tcp:13661:28"/>
to performe what he promiseth:
otherwise we make him a God
without mercy, that can and
will not heare; a God without
truth that can and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his promise; or a God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to doe it.</p>
               <p>Pray therefore in faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
humility, and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
pray with the whole
heart without wauering or
doubting, without limiting <hi>the
holy one of Israel,</hi> either in the
time when, the thing what, or
the manner how hee should doe
the thing thou desirest; for hee
knoweth best what, when, and
how to doe all things for thee:
therefore as <hi>Moses</hi> said vnto
the Israelites, <hi>hold you your
peace, and see the saluation of
<pb facs="tcp:13661:29"/>
God.</hi> Then pray and be heard,
aske and receiue, seeke and thou
shalt finde fauour with God at
all times, in all places, and vpon
all occasions, euen thy God will
bee ready to helpe in greatest
time of need, which God for his
Christs sake grant, so be it.</p>

The ordinary meanes to
apprehend <hi>Christ</hi> the light,
is the word, which he taught
and left vnto vs, yet not of
it selfe that light, but onely
sheweth it, for euery man
that heareth the word, sÃ©eth
not the light comprehended
in the same; but they onely
whose inward eies the Lord
openeth to behold <hi>Christ</hi> the
light, and they walke in the
light. Many saw <hi>Christ,</hi> but
not as hee was the light and
their saluation; for <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in darknes more than
light,</hi> working wickednesse
euen against that light in
whom, and by whom, and
through whom, they onely
that truly sÃ©eke that light
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13661:37"/>
haue assured saluation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there safety or salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any other. Therefore
doth <hi>David</hi> ioyne <hi>light</hi> and
<hi>saluation</hi> together, because
that without that light there
is no saluation, for light go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with or before saluation;
for without the light of
knowledge there can bee no
faith, and without faith no
saluation. <hi>Dauid</hi> through
faith was bold to affirme
that the Lord was his light,
and consequently his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hee that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him from all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and therefore resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not to feare what man
could doe vnto him.</p>
               <p>Our owne naturall light,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13661:38"/>
the light of our eyes is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
blessing of God: yet
for vnruiinesse it may bee
compared to the tongue; for
as the tongue is an vnruly
euill, in setting as it were
the whole world on fire, so
are the eyes extrauagant,
and set the heart on fire; and
therefore saith <hi>Dauid, Turne
away mine eies from regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vanity:</hi> for he found by
wofull experience, that the
light of the eye doth admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
vnto the minde diuers
dangerous obiects, as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the nakednesse of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaba,</hi>
with the sight of whom
he was so enflamed with the
fire of lust, which first entred
by the eie, that he committed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13661:38"/>
grieuous sinnes in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
thereof. Yet
was <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as it were <hi>the light of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
which hee assumed not
vnto himselfe, but attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the true light that he had
vnto <hi>the light of lights;</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Surely thou art my light
O Lord, and the Lord will
lighten my darknesse:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<hi>the Lord is my light
and my saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By his owne naturall
light hee could not sÃ©e his
owne error of adultery and
marther, vntill hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
enlightned, then hee
could confesse it: neither
could he see and consider how
the Lord had defended him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13661:39"/>
but by that dim light which
gaue him courage &amp; strength
against the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eare and the
Lion, the ouercomming of
whom gaue him assurance
of the victory against <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:</hi>
his experience of Gods
fauour towards him grew
daily more and more, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
others also to depend
on the power, prouidence
and loue of God by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
saying, and assuring
them that the Lord would be
a sure refuge vnto them in
their afflictions, for hee fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
none that faithfully sÃ©eke
him; and how can we sÃ©eke
him but by Prayer? <hi>I will
call vpon the Lord, saith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
who is worthy to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13661:39"/>
so shall I bee safe from
mine enemies:</hi> though they
haue many meanes to hurt,
yet God that is our light and
our saluation, hath many
more meanes to helpe and to
defend vs: therefore saith
<hi>Dauid,</hi> whom should I feare,
<hi>the Lord is my rocke and my
fortresse, and hee that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
mee, my God and my
strength, in him will I trust,
my shield, the horne also of
my saluation and my refuge,</hi>
of whom shall I be afraid?
If I haue <hi>Iehouah</hi> on my
side, what can man doe vnto
me? If he be my light, I shall
liue in light and walke in
light, for in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at all; he offereth light
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13661:40"/>
by his liuely Word, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth
our inward parts
by the bright beames of his
heauenly Spirit. Being then
inwardly armed, howsoeuer
outwardly endangered, wÃ©e
nÃ©ed not feare, but as <hi>Dauid</hi>
did, <hi>let vs cast our burthen
vpon the Lord and hee shall
defend vs;</hi> and let vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our care vnto him, for
he careth for vs: of whom or
of what then need we to bee
afraid?</p>
               <p>Saluation commeth not
of flesh nor by fleshly meanes,
as the true light is not of the
world nor of worldly men.
Therefore sÃ©eke not thy light
nor safety through the policy
or strength of the flesh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13661:40"/>
dreame of saluation by
worldly meanes, but breake
through the walls of flesh,
and mount vp in true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of that sauing
light that shineth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue;
from thence commeth
the strength against which
no carnall force shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile:
and beware of such as
promise vnto themselues
safety and saluation without
this true light, as the wise by
their policies, the rich by
their wealth, the mighty by
their much strength and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
and as some by their
owne workes: All which are
broken rÃ©eds &amp; vaine props,
and weake meanes to saue
the outward man, much lesse
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13661:41"/>
the inward soule. How then
can they say, whom shall I
feare? of whom shall I bee
afraid? when indÃ©ed they
cannot but bee afraid euen
where no feare is.</p>

               <p>Consider well the benefit

               <p>Feare not man then, who

               <p>O feare this Lord and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence

               <p>Feare not the world nor

man, for if a thousand assaile
thee, feare not, but pray and

more then was before they

weapons were his feare and
trust, in the name and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he fought diuers bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
and slew with great
slaughter many <hi>Philistines</hi>
his enemies; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but after he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
King, none preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but they that
came vpon him stumbled and

SÃ©eing then that Faith,
and the feare of God and
praier be approued of force,
so far to preuaile with God,
as to obtaine his helpe and
defence against wicked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
&amp; foes, that when they
assaile vs, he causeth them to
stumble and fall; let vs
imitate the faith, and fight
with that assurance that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
did: for he is the same
God still, of the same power,
of the same prouidence and
loue. And we are not without
like enemies as <hi>Dauid</hi> in his
time had, though without
cause.</p>
               <p>To relate all <hi>Dauids</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
troubles, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
battels and victories,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13661:52"/>
though profitable for our
encouragement: yet might
sÃ©eme tedious, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impertinent, because by
them is the loue, the power,
and prouidence of God sÃ©ene
in defending and relÃ©euing
the faithfull; and his iust

enemies of their stumbling
and fals. Yet let his fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th
and constancy moue all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men to imitate his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
not in that he was a
King, but in that hÃ©e was a
godly King, of whom God
giues testimonie, that <hi>hee
was a man according to Gods
owne heart;</hi> not that he was
so conformable by nature,
but so framed by the grace
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13661:52"/>
and good will of God: For,
by nature he was no better
in Gods acceptation than
<hi>Saul,</hi> who was also a King:
But God so seasoned <hi>Dauids</hi>
heart (of his owne frÃ©e mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
that he obeyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his actions, according
as God had wrought in his
heart, and left <hi>Saul</hi> to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of his owne heart:
yet did not <hi>Dauid</hi> glory in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
merit of his owne, but
gaue the praise to God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Blessed is he whom thou
choosest and causest to come
vnto thee.</hi> And againe, <hi>The
wicked are strangers from the
wombe, euen from the belly
haue they erred:</hi> Yet <hi>Saul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was anointed King by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13661:53"/>
                  <hi>Samuel,</hi> was turned into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man, and <hi>was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the Prophets;</hi>
but no otherwise than <hi>Iudas</hi>
among the Apostles.</p>
               <p>God is the God of all that
faithfully and constantly fly
vnto him for succour; For,
<hi>saluation belongeth vnto him
alone;</hi> not vnto the power of
Kings, bÃ©e they neuer so
strong in multitudes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men, with shipping, or
whatsoeuer military and
warlike furniture; but
where Gods continuall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
doth accompany a few,
they preuaile against many;
though sometimes God may
suffer his owne dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to bÃ©e encountred and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13661:53"/>
beaten by his owne and their
enemies: Especially when
they presume to stand too
much vpon their owne
strength, as vpon allies,
friends, and multitudes: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing
with these, God is
not so glorified, as when he
by few ouercommeth a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
As when <hi>Dauid</hi> by a
few slew two and twentie
thousand <hi>Aramites:</hi> And
<hi>Ioshua</hi> fiue combined Kings,
wherein yet he would not
haue the whole victory to bÃ©e
ascribed to <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> forces,
but was himselfe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
in the ouerthrow, not
onely in aiding and directing
<hi>Ioshuah,</hi> but in powring
downe haile-stones from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13661:54"/>
vpon his enemies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he slew more men than
<hi>Ioshuahs</hi> Army did by the
sword. And sometimes hÃ©e
taketh to himselfe the whole
praise of the victory; as when
<hi>Senacherib</hi> came against good
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> with a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
supposed Army,
vnder the conduct of <hi>Tartan
Rabsaris,</hi> and <hi>Rabsakeh,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vpon, and threatning
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and blaspheming
God, stiling himselfe <hi>the
Great King of Ashur,</hi> whom
he thought God himselfe
was not able to withstand,
flattering himselfe as proud
Tyrants use to doe (as wÃ©e
haue seene) that hÃ©e in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> God,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13661:54"/>
would depriue him of his
Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> pretending that
he came in the name of the
Lord (as some of late haue
done) <hi>Are wee come</hi> (saith
he) <hi>or doe wee this without
the Lord?</hi> Whereat <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
in dÃ©ed, according to humane
frailtie was afraid: But as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
counsell of the Lord by
faithfull praier (the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
and defence in danger)
he became assured of Gods
assistance and banisht feare.
And that night, that God
(which that Tyrant blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as not of power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him) sent his destroying
Angell and slew <hi>Senacheribs</hi>
army, one hundred foure<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
score and fiue thousand men.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13661:55"/>
We may not forget our like
deliueries fresh in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
euen by the mÃ©ere
hand of God.</p>
               <p>It is not superfluous to
recount other famous Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
recorded in the Booke
of God, which for further
confirmation of our Faith in
God, in like danger are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.
<hi>Benadab,</hi> that mightie
King of <hi>Aram,</hi> threatned
<hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
him, not onely of his
Kingdome, but of all that
hÃ©e had, of his Siluer and
Gold, of his Women and
faire children: She wing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the insolency, pride, and
securitie of Tyrants, who
by reason of their carnall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13661:55"/>
strength, force and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
will dispose of the
lands, and share the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them, whose Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they thirst after, and
that before their arriuall, as
though the victory were
theirs before the incounter.
As we with our eares haue
heard that our enemies haue
boasted, through the false
and forged benediction of
him that is a deceiuer, and
yet taketh the falsly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
authority from heauen.
But our God laughed their
pride, insolency, and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to scorne; taking our cause
into his owne hand, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their deuices, daunted
their hearts, weakned their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13661:56"/>
armes, abandoned their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies
by his owne power;
euen as he gaue proud <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi>
into <hi>Ahabs</hi> power,
though a wicked King and an
Idolater, therefore not for
<hi>Ahabs</hi> sake, but for his owne
Names seke, and his owne
peoples safety. And to shew
his Omnipotent power in
defending his owne, and
confounding his and their
enemies. So that the truly
faithful in God being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
beset and besieged by
wicked multitudes, nÃ©ed not
to be afraid: for though war
be raised against them; that
God that defended <hi>Dauid,
Hezekias,</hi> and all that haue
truly called vpon him in like
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13661:56"/>
danger, will as hÃ©e hath
euer hitherunto, defend vs.</p>
               <p>They that haue the God
of Hosts on their side, nÃ©ed
not to feare though Kings
combine, and people rage, as
if they would eat vp their
flesh. Onely let them liue
godly, pray faithfully; and
vse ordinary meanes lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
then if an Host pitch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, their hearts nÃ©ed
not be afraid though warre
be raised against them, let
them trust in him, and they
shall sÃ©e the saluation of God.</p>
               <p>They that fight against
Gods people, fight euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God himselfe: as <hi>Paul</hi>
persecuting his children, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
<hi>Christ.</hi> If therefore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13661:57"/>
a mighty Host inuade vs,
we may boldly, though in
seeming weaknesse, encounter
them; for there are more
with the children of God,
though not sÃ©ene, than with
the wicked. God neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
nor forsaketh his, vnlesse
they forsake him: he leaueth
them not, vnlesse they leaue
him.</p>
               <p>Infinite are the examples
hereof in holy Scriptures,
which might be also produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
further to confirme our
assurance: And were it nÃ©ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
there might be inserted
not a few examples of Gods
like deliueries, recorded in
our owne Chronicles, and in
our own remembrances. But
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13661:57"/>
where Gods Spirit speaketh
by the pens of Gods owne
Secretaries, there nÃ©ed no
humane testimonies, but
onely to shew that God is
still the same. He is <hi>Alpha</hi>
and <hi>Omega,</hi> the same, yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to day, and for euer;
therefore may the man that
is godly, assure himselfe with
holy <hi>Dauid: If an Host of
enemies pitch against him, his
heart need not bee afraid,
though war be raised against
him he may trust in this; That
when the wicked, euen his
enemies and his foes come
vpon him to eat vp his flesh,
they shall stumble and fall.</hi>

<hi>Dauid</hi> desired (as all true

thing, for this only one thing

               <p>
                  <hi>Bershaba</hi> the wife of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>he might dwell in the house

of worldly men, who
might thinke <hi>Dauid</hi> not to be
so wise as some ambitious

at this day, who had rather
be in Kings Courts to take
their pleasures, than to bee

haue taken what pleasure
and delight hee would; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a Kingdome to supply
whatsoeuer might haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
any of his senses. But
these delights hÃ©e found not
answerable to his affection,
which was seasoned from

swÃ©etly of the loue of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah,</hi>
who of a Shepherd made

               <p>It is a most glorious estate

he looke to haue some discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
mixt with his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and necessary too; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
greatnesse might
cause forgetfulnes, that he is
a man, as former examples
haue discouered. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did God visit <hi>Dauid</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:13661:65"/>
(chosen after his own heart)
with many troubles, to the
end he should not be vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
what he was, &amp; whence,
and from what estate God
had raised him to that place
of eminence: and that hÃ©e
should serue the Lord, and
maintaine his lawes, and
defend his people, cherishing
the good, and chastising the
euill. And therefore was
<hi>Dauid</hi> to forward in calling
his people to serue the Lord,
and himselfe to be the leader
of them to the Temple of
God, to which he had so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
a desire, that hÃ©e reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of the Lord that hee
might dwell therein all the
daies of his life, or at least
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13661:66"/>
haue frÃ©e liberty often to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
it, to the praise of God
and exercise of prayer.</p>
               <p>This desire is commonly
the last and least in great
men, for the most part though
no doubt they desire (as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
did) to die (when neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
requireth) the death of
the righteous, and greater
glory would it be vnto them
if they would practice (while
they haue time) the life of the
righteous as they seldome
doe; yet few or none, of
whatsoeuer quality are so
irreligious in shew, but they
will looke into the house of
God, peraduenture once, it
may be twice in a Sabbath.
And peraduenture thinke it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13661:66"/>
long, as loth to spare their
pleasures, delights or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to liue a whole day in the
Temple of God with fasting
and prayer. Some would
thinke it as hard a taske as
the bondage of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or
the captiuity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
But blessed bÃ©e God, some
there are that haue <hi>Dauids</hi>
desire, though not to dwell
really in the Temple, yet to
bee comfortably conuersant
among Gods people, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God speake vnto them,
and they to speake vnto
God.</p>
               <p>This is that that great
men should principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
for their example in well
doing much moueth inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13661:67"/>
to imitation, for it is
commonly obserued, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
doth draw more to
good or euill, than documents
or dehortations. The godly
life of a great man is as a
Towre sÃ©ene a far, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
especially his followers
will imitate his steps, at
least in shew, and euen that
shew of a godly life is a good
motiue to others to liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indÃ©ed: and as a good life
giues comfort &amp; encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to others to be good, so
the president of euill makes
many euill. If greatnesse and
goodnes goe together, it is the
swÃ©etest consort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a mortall
man can make in this life, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
the contrary as harsh &amp; hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:13661:67"/>
This holy desire of <hi>Dauid</hi>
was not for a day, for hÃ©e
speakes of the time past. <hi>I
desired,</hi> which implies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
inward Petition; and
argues his constancy in desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
though he were often
in such straits and distresses
as he could not visit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
temple as he desired;
yet, wheresoeuer he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by the malice and rage of
his enemies, he euen there
found <hi>Bethel,</hi> the house of
God; in the Wildernesse of
<hi>Ziph,</hi> in the holds of <hi>Enge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
in <hi>Maan</hi> and <hi>Gath,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth
and solitary places: hee
found the Lord his God euen
in his holy Temple, for
where God is present there
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13661:68"/>
is his Temple. In the Lions
den <hi>Daniel</hi> found him; in the
Furnace the <hi>three children;</hi>
in the Dungeon <hi>Ieremy; in</hi>
the Prison <hi>Peter;</hi> vnder the
stones <hi>Stephen;</hi> in <hi>Sodom
Lot;</hi> in the floud <hi>Noah:</hi> God
is euery where, where hÃ©e is
called vpon faithfully.</p>
               <p>Euery faithfull childe of
God is alwaies in Gods
house, where <hi>Dauid</hi> desired
so earnestly to dwell: yet
though he found God euery
where where he called vpon
him, he had an earnest desire
to bÃ©e conuersant, euen in
that materiall temple where
the children of God did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
to celebrate the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of God, and to heare his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13661:68"/>
Word: and though he were
their King, thought it no
disparagement, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of his duty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
his subiects (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to conueniencie) in the
holy exercises of Religion:
whereof being preuented by
meanes of his enemies, hÃ©e
complaineth that hÃ©e was as
a <hi>Pelican in the Wildernesse,
and as an Owle in the Desert:</hi>
And dÃ©emed the Sparrow
more happy than he, because
that silly Bird could at all
times resort vnto that holy
place to which he could not
come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid) who
shall dwell in thy Tabernacle?
and who shall rest in thy holy
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13661:69"/>
Mountaine?</hi> that is, who
shall worthily enter into thy
holy Temple and behold thy
beauty? he answereth, <hi>Hee
that worketh righteousnesse,
&amp;c.</hi> for God is holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
holinesse of life,
walking vprightly in a liuely
faith. And therefore though
it be the duty of all men to
frequent the materiall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, to accompany
the congregation in prayer,
praising of God and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Word: yet all come
not with that holy desire that
<hi>Dauid</hi> did, nor qualified as
<hi>Dauid</hi> was: yet hÃ©e that is
vnprepared to day may bÃ©e
fit to morrow, for the Word
of God is as a Net, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13661:69"/>
times catcheth men ere
they bee aware: therefore
ought all men to desire as
<hi>Dauid</hi> did, to visit Gods
Temple, where this Net of
the Word is spread; for being
once taken, hee will then
with <hi>Dauid</hi> require that <hi>one
thing:</hi> namely, to dwell in
the house of the Lord all the
daies of his life, and often to
visit his Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> did not onely make
a bare request vnto God, but
did euen presse him, hÃ©e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
him as if he had bÃ©en
familiar with him, (as the
faithfull may vse a holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with God in their
prayers) praying God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him that blessing of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13661:70"/>
as to admit him into
his holy presence, wherein is
<hi>the fulnesse of ioy,</hi> and <hi>at his
right hand are pleasures for
euermore;</hi> not for a day a
moneth or a yÃ©ere, as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
haue, and then perish,
but begun here and shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue end.</p>
               <p>To dwell in the house of
<hi>Iehouah,</hi> is to dwell &amp; abide
in his fauour, to be partaker
of his sanctifying grace, to
haue the true knowledge of
his diuine will, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
it by faith, obedience,
zeale, prayer; and to beare
about vs the markes of the
Lord Jesus, in patient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
the burthen of the
Crosse, and in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13661:70"/>
of holinesse and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse:
whosoeuer is in
this case is safe in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Temple of God as in a
safe Sanctuary, and is a
true member of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
body of our conquering
Christ, the head of that
Church which is the true
Temple, neither made with
hands, and which hands can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pull downe: Out of
which are barred all such as
trust in lying miracles, and
workes that cannot profit
such as steale, commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
adultery; such as sweare
falsly, and such as fall downe
and worship false gods, or
the true God after a false
and idolatrous manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:13661:71"/>
Though these stand in the
materiall Temple, or seclude
themselues in Cloisters, in
sÃ©eming deuotion to seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
themselues from the
world to God, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
many barbarous sinnes
and grosse impieties, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselues safe, and to
be reconciled to God by a
confessory penance, God will
not onely not heare them but
reiect them &amp; their prayers,
for they seeme religious and
are not, obedient to God and
are not, faithfull and are
not: but are mÃ©ere Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
who resorting to the
Temple of God, commit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sacrilege than offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
acceptable to God.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13661:71"/>
These visit not the Temple,
but rather defile if with their
counterfeit holinesse, who
would sÃ©eme in shew Saints,
but in heart enemies to
Christ and Christians; yet
cry they, <hi>the Church, the
Church;</hi> and yet farre from
being members of it. So
many sÃ©eming-good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
cry out, <hi>Preach, Preach,</hi>
and sÃ©eme neuer satisfied
with Sermons; this desire
is good, if their hearts desire
it to profit and practise the
word: but if it be but to sÃ©eme
religious, and inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their corrupt desires,
if they amend not their
waies and their workes,
sÃ©eme they neuer so holy they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13661:72"/>
are but Hypocrites: for this
is to bÃ©e in the Temple of
God by his Word preached,
to learne &amp; <hi>to execute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to oppresse the
poore nor the stranger, the
fatherlesse nor the Widow,
not to deceiue nor to walke
after other gods, after riches
and pleasures.</hi> If this fruit of
hearing appeare in them,
they are no doubt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and house of God, and
shall <hi>dwell in his Tabernacle
and rest securely vpon his
holy Mountaine,</hi> for they are
of the generation of the iust:
but <hi>there is a generation</hi>
(saith <hi>Salomon) that are
pure in their owne conceits,
and yet are not washed from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13661:72"/>
their filthinesse: they follow
the deuices of their owne
hearts,</hi> And assume vnto
themselues a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of seruing of God, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the sincere truth:
but as God abhorreth all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of vncleane things:
so doth hee all counterfeit
showes of sincerity.</p>
               <p>God admitteth not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
namely, such as make
no conscience of sinne, to
come into his holy presence,
much lesse to dwell in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Temple, though they may
sÃ©eme to honour him with
their lips: He detesteth their
forged sacrifices, and their
very praiers are abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though they pertake of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13661:73"/>
the holy Sacraments, and
performe outwardly other
diuine duties: Hee is not
pleased with them, neither
behold they the beauty of the
Lord; but his seuere and
fierce countenance is bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>
               <p>But such as desire with
the like affection as <hi>Dauid</hi>
did, to behold the beautie of
the Lord, and to visit his
Temple, are such as the
Lord enuiteth and willeth to
come, and louingly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
them. They come not
for a spirt and away, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to make their continuall
abode, where they may still
behold his beautie and his
glory; his louing kindnesse
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13661:73"/>
and mercies towards them,
shewed in his word as in a
glasse, which appeareth more
swÃ©et and amiable to the cies
of their sanctified soules, than
the most beautifull feature of
Angels. This most heauenly
beauty <hi>Dauid</hi> desired to sÃ©e, &amp;
saw it; as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
That <hi>God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>manded the
light to shine out of darknesse,
euen in our harts, that the light
of the knowledge of the glory
of God might shine in the
face of Iesus Christ,</hi> whose
glory we sÃ©e in the preaching
of his word; wherein <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
the riches of his glory
vpon the vessels of mercy,
which he hath prepared vnto
glory.</hi> This glory the more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13661:74"/>
the spirituall man beholdeth,
the more is he moued with
desire to sÃ©e more and more,
and can neuer be sufficiently
filled with that heauenly
Contemplation. Much were
the Disciples moued at the
sight of Christs transfigured
glory; in so much as they
desired to haue enioyed the
sight of it still, so glorious it
was, that their minds were
euen rauisht with the beauty
thereof. So <hi>Dauid</hi> desired to
dwell in the Temple of the
Lord; not for a day, but all
the daies of his life, to behold
the beauty, the goodnesse, and
mercies of God, reuealed in
his Word, and to exercise
himselfe in prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:13661:74"/>
Where God is duly and
truly called vpon by a holy
Congregation, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the glory and beauty of
<hi>Iehouah.</hi> There is the <hi>Arke</hi>
of the Lord, the presence of
the mighty God of <hi>Iacob:</hi>
whose glory filleth the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which the faithfull man
sÃ©eth with a spirituall eye;
but the carnall man, though
bodily present in the same
Temple, apprehendeth it
not. As when <hi>Paul</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
he saw the glory of
God shine vpon him; but they
that iournied with him,
though nÃ©ere him, saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
So that God is onely
sÃ©ene of them, to whom hÃ©e
pleaseth to reueale himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:13661:75"/>
This beauty of the Lord
shineth in the hearts of Gods
elect children, by the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Ghost, which
none sÃ©eth but themselues.
And they take such sweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the beholding of the
face of God in Christ, as
they doe receiue in their
soules the very <hi>Impression of
the Image of the glory of the
onely begotten Sonne of the
Father, full of grace and truth:</hi>
euen as <hi>Moses</hi> receiued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the splendor of the glory
of God vpon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>
in his countenance, such an
impression of that glory,
that the children of <hi>Israel</hi>
could not endure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
with their eies the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13661:75"/>
of his countenance.</p>
               <p>What remaineth then, but
that we neglect not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
visitation of the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
of God, to accompany
the Congregation in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of that heauenly Word,
to pray vnto God for his
blessings, and to giue him
praise for his benefits. And
the Lord open our spirituall
eies, that we may euen here
behold his beautie, and bee
hereafter pertakers of his
glory.</p>

the inner man, that Christ
may dwell in my heart by
faith, and that my whole spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

kept blamelesse, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Lord Iesus. For
thou knowest, Lord, what I am
by nature, a man vnworthy
to enter vnder thy roofe, or to
presse into the place where
thine honour dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>For thou art a God that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
righteousnesse, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptest
of such as are of cleane
hearts, and whose conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are vpright before thee:
but I am a sinner and corrupt,
as all my fathers were; Cleanse
me therefore, O gracious Lord
God, in the bloud of Iesus
Christ, and make me fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13661:77"/>
thine holy Temple,
that I may see thy beautie,
and behold thy glory. Open
mine eares that I may heare;
prepare my heart that I may

in thy word: Enlighten
mine inward eies, the eies of
my soule, that I may see thee,
and take comfort in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
And open my lips, that
I may speake vnto thee in
faith, and answer mee againe
in loue. Teach mee that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall

thee to heare me.</p>
                  <p>For what booteth it me to
come into thy house with
deafe eares, not to heare thee?
without attention, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
thee? mute, and not be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13661:77"/>
able to speake vnto thee?</p>
                  <p>Yet I know, good Father,
that thou hearest them that
cannot speake, and thou
teachest them that vnderstand
not; and thou openest the eies
of them that see not: such is
thy loue towards vs, as thou
acceptest euen of the language
of heartie sighes, whither
they be for sinne, or for want
of spirituall graces: Thou
knowest the inward desires of
the heart, tending to good or

                  <p>I am sorry, good Father,
that any corruption lurketh
in my defiled heart, to keepe
out that blessed guest thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
I cannot of my selfe aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
corruption: I cannot of

my selfe so mortifie my sinne,
but that the dregges therefore
will still remaine. But cast me
not out of thine holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
because I am a sinner; but
rather, because I am a sinner,
admit to visit thy Temple, to
heare thy Word, that I may
learne to liue more and more

                  <p>Make thou my heart cleane
and I shall bee all cleane; so

pleasure &amp; ease,
and when trouble commeth,
he is cast downe, and is (as
it were) at deaths doore: but
the true childe of God being
fore-warned, that if he will
liue godly, he must looke for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13661:80"/>
and prepare himselfe to suffer
trouble and affliction in this
life: Trouble therefore doth
little or nothing moue him
when it commeth, because
when he first entred into the
schoole of christianity, he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the loue of God, &amp; the
loue of the world, could not
stand together with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and that there is a
kinde of enmity betwÃ©ene the
children of God and the loue
of the world, or at least no
agrÃ©ement; And that is the
cause that the good are most
afflicted, and the worldlings
prosper most: The first are
innocent, in whom there is
neither gall nor bitternesse;
the other, as they are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13661:80"/>
so are they commonly
proud and enuious. The first
is commonly iniured, and
beares it with patience: the
other triumphs ouer them
that resist them not, but
haue onely in all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
recourse vnto God,
whose they are, being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he in the time of
trouble will be their defence,
and <hi>hide them in his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi>
which was onely godly
<hi>Dauids</hi> refuge, being often
and many waies afflicted, as
at large before appeareth.</p>
               <p>God sendeth affliction vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne dearest children,
when oftentimes he letteth
the wicked goe frÃ©e; yet is
not God vniust in this, nor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13661:81"/>
partiall, in sparing the euill,
and punishing the good. HÃ©e
hath his ends in both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his heauenly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
who knoweth how to
deale with both. And he that
sÃ©emeth most to be spared,
and thinkes himselfe in best
case, is in greatest danger;
and he that sÃ©emeth in most
danger, is nÃ©erest greatest
happinesse: Howsoeuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrÃ©et
men measure their
felicity by this worlds ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and frÃ©edome from
troubles; and censure the
dearest children of God to be
surely out of his fauour, by
reason of their manifold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
And yet they sÃ©e
that the simple nurse, though
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13661:81"/>
she loue her Infant neuer so
dearely, she will weane it
from the breast by some bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thing, when she thinkes
her milke not good for the
childe; And that a Father, if
he loue his childe, will with
the rod of correction restraine
him from things dangerous.
And thinke they, that our
heauenly Father thinkes it
not fit to weane his owne
children from this hurtfull
world, that they perish not
with worldlings? But when
he striketh the wicked, it is
in his anger, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their perpetuall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
by whose seuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
here, his owne
children may bee terrified
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13661:82"/>
from committing like sins,
by example of their punish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee that will liue godly
must suffer affliction;</hi> yet not
aboue their strength, for God
putteth to his hand, to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and mitigate the weight
of their burden. The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and afflictions of the
faithfull sÃ©eme more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the beholders, then
to themselues that seele them,
and haue a liuely faith and
constancy to beare them:
Great and many are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
euen of the righteous;
but God deliuereth them out
of all. <hi>In the time of trouble
he hides them in his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
in the secret place of his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13661:82"/>
Pauilion shall he hide them,
and set them vpon a Rocke.</hi>
He hid <hi>Dauid</hi> from <hi>Saul,</hi> and
<hi>Moses</hi> from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers:
his Tabernacle is
alwaies open to entertaine
them, that in their troubles
fly for shelter to him: His
fauour is the Rocke that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be mooued; his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the mountaine of their
rest and refuge.</p>
               <p>Troubles are but for a
moment, and then commeth
comfort; therefore doe the
children of God with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
great alacritie and ioy
vndergoe them. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the comfort of the wicked
is here short and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
but the<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13661:83"/>
shall haue no end.</p>
               <p>SÃ©eing then that no man,
especially such as are Gods
dearest children, can liue here
in this earthly Pilgrimage,
but he must looke for and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
troubles: Who will not
then prepare himselfe with
constancy and patience to
embrace them when they
came?</p>
               <p>The holy Ghost by the pen
of godly <hi>Dauid,</hi> hath assured
the poore oppressed &amp; afflicted
children of God, neuer to be
forgotten: Their hope shall
not perish for euer, for God
is not an idle obseruer, or a
carelesse spectator of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and miseries<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of
those that are his: Though
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13661:83"/>
he suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to be oppressed
long; as some with enemies,
as <hi>Dauid;</hi> some by losse of
goods, as <hi>Iob;</hi> some by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
as <hi>Ioseph;</hi> some
with sicknesse, as <hi>Hezekiah;</hi>
and withall to permit the
wicked to mocke and deride
them, for that they trusting
in God, are suffered thus to
be afflicted; and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their praiers not to be
deliuered or relÃ©eued, which
is no small tentation. But
these men looke into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
prosperity of men, and
commend them, entertaine
them, embrace them; as if
all cause of loue were due to
them that were loaden with
lucre, As for the poore, they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13661:84"/>
are despised, contemned, and
had in continuall derision, of
such onely indeed as are
blinde, and sÃ©e not; ignorant,
and know not; dull, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
not, That there is a
God that careth for such as
worldlings cast off: that hee
embraceth his poore that the
wealthy despise, and that he
loueth them that the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
hate; And that <hi>in the
time of trouble hee hideth
them in his Tabernacle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the secret place of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion
shall hee hide them:</hi>
Nay, the very Angels of
God (whom man sÃ©eth not)
pitcheth round about them
that feare him and call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and deliuereth them;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13661:84"/>
therefore though the godly be
poore, the Lord thinketh on
them.</p>
               <p>Many a meane contenmed
childe of God, (hauing little

righteous hath, is better than
the abundance of the vngodly
rich.</hi> Let no man therefore
faint nor feare, when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

commeth; but rather reioyce,
knowing that tribulation

Hope; and Hope
maketh not ashamed; but
assureth the faithfull of the
goodnesse and loue of God,
which is shed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghost: so
that howsoeuer we be scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
we nÃ©ed not blush at our
troubles and afflictions, but
at our sinnes that procure
them: yet are they vnto the
children of God but whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
medicines to cure
them, and to preuent them:
onely vnsauory to the carnall
minde, which also doe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
to patience, which by
experience cherisheth and
confirmeth our hope, which
through faith is an assured
testimony vnto our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13661:85"/>
that we are beloued of
God, so much the more, by
how much he kÃ©epeth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and in obedience through
afflictions. For, if he leaueth
vs vnto our owne corrupt
conuersations without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
so much the stronger
grow we in sinne: therefore
necessary it is, that we should
often fÃ©ele his correcting rod,
lest at the last he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
vs with his deuouring
sword; for if we should bÃ©e
without trouble, which is
our correction, whereof all
Gods children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
we could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
our selues bastards,
and no sonnes: And if his
corrections kÃ©epe vs in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13661:86"/>
then wÃ©e may assure
our selues, <hi>he will hide vs in
his Tabernacle,</hi> that no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or policy of the wicked
shall finde vs out to hurt
vs.</p>
               <p>As men are in number
many, and their affections
diuers, &amp; none liueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some trouble or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not all in one measure or
in like degrÃ©e: so is euery
man comforted or cast down
according to the measure of
his faintnesse or faith, for
many men may bÃ©e equall
partakers of one and the
same trouble, yet not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
resolution to beare it.</p>
               <p>Some men haue great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and beare them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13661:86"/>
with great patience; some
small, and yet cry out vnder
the burthen of them; some
men haue many troubles
and yet account them few;
some few, and yet account
them many; some haue feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
afflictions, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
them fauourable; some
very fauourable crosses, yet
esteeme them very fierce and
cruell; some haue long and
tedious afflictions, yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
short; some very short,
yet conceiued long and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome.</p>
               <p>This ariseth onely of the
difference of mens faith and
frailty. The first is bold and
strong, able to beare and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
whatsoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13661:87"/>
God to lay vpon them;
saying with faithfull <hi>Dauid,
God is my hope and strength
and my portion.</hi> The second
is weake and sinketh vnder
the burthen of most easie tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
because they cannot say
in their hearts as <hi>Dauid</hi> did,
<hi>the Lord is my rocke and my
saluation,</hi> nor assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>God will hide them
in his Tabernacle, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
place of his pauilion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what is this hiding
of his Saints, but his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
watchfulnesse ouer
them, and his prouidence in
keeping and defending them?
<hi>hee sets them vpon a rocke,</hi>
namely, hÃ©e taketh them into
his owne protection, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13661:87"/>
none is able to take them out
of his hands; therefore are
they constant in all their
troubles, let them lose their
children: let them be robbed
of their goods, afflicted in
their bodies, vpbraided of
their enemies, condemned
for Hypocrites, persecuted
as Heretikes, or brought to
extreme pouerty; let them
endure all these and more
troubles with holy <hi>Iob,</hi> yet
will they retaine their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
&amp; confidence in God,
still knowing that hÃ©e in
whom they trust is faithfull
in his promises; and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is absolute, and that <hi>in
the time of their trouble hee
will hide them in his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13661:88"/>
in the secret place of his

               </p>
               <p>There is no trouble, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or affliction of what kinde
soeuer, but the dearest and
most beloued of God haue
bÃ©ene partakers of them. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
was murdered by <hi>Cain</hi>
his wicked brother for his
sincere worship of God.
Faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> was not
free from troubles, from
doubting and feare; he was
commanded to offer his dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rest
sonne Isaak in sacrifice,
in whose sÃ©ede the generall
blessing was promised: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afraid of his life, for his
wiues sake, was twice dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to faine vntruths, both
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13661:88"/>
to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and
<hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar:</hi>
HÃ©e had trouble by <hi>Lot</hi> his
brother, he had griefe for the
destruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many other troubles.
<hi>Isaak</hi> likewise for feare of his
life for <hi>Rebeccah</hi> his wife, by
his vntruth exposed her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
to the will of a heathen
King: he was afflicted by the
<hi>Philistines,</hi> he was crossed in
his desire of preferring <hi>Esau</hi>
before <hi>Iaakoh</hi> in the blessing.
<hi>Iaakob</hi> was forced to flie out
of his owne Country, and
from his friends, and to be a
seruant in a strange land, for
feare of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> that
threatned to kill him: being
enuied by <hi>Labans</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13661:89"/>
sonnes, he fled with his
wiues and children, he was
pursued by <hi>Laban:</hi> hÃ©e was
encountred by an Angel that
wrestled with him all the
night, shooke him fearefully
and lamed him: he marched
in great feare and perplexity
with his wiues children and
droues, towards his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
brother <hi>Esau,</hi> who came
against him with foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men: he was miserably
tormented for the supposed
death of his dearest sonne <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
and much perplexed for
his sonnes murthering his
neighbour <hi>Seehemites. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
was guiltlesly accused
and wrongfully imprisoned.
<hi>Moses</hi> was like to haue bÃ©ene
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13661:89"/>
slaine by the Angell in the
Inne, for not circumcising
his sonne, preuented by <hi>Zip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porah</hi>
his wife, who after
circumcised him, and cast the
fore skinne of her sonne at
<hi>Moses</hi> fÃ©et, saying, <hi>Thou art
indeed a bloudy husband vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me:</hi> many other troubles
he had for the disobedience of
the people of <hi>Israel.</hi> Not one
of Gods children haue bÃ©ene
frÃ©e from troubles, therefore
let none refuse to take vp the
Crosse of Christ, who in his
owne person suffered many
reproaches, ignominies, and
at last the death of the crosse
for vs: None of his Apostles
escaped most cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
some were stoned to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13661:90"/>
death, some slaine with the
sword, euery of them had
their troubles and torments,
and all the Fathers of the
Primitiue Church had their
seuerall miserable ends for
Christ, and yet tenderly be
loued of God. Shall wÃ©e
then that haue the like and
the same benefit by the death
of Christ, be ashamed of his
Crosse? Shall we thinke to
enioy his glory, and shall we
suffer none of his disgrace?
We are his members, and
he is our head, and shall our
head suffer and wÃ©e liue at
ease?</p>
               <p>Satan is malicious, hÃ©e
can endure none that liueth
vprightly, but hÃ©e will vse
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13661:90"/>
his instruments to molest
them; if hÃ©e cannot induce
them to sinne against God
with a high hand, hÃ©e will
procure them troubles, and
such as wherewith if it were
possible, he would so weaken
their faith in God, that they
should vse any vngodly
meanes to frÃ©e themselues;
and will perswade them that
God punisheth none but
such as he hath no loue vnto:
but the truly faithfull know
that he is a lier from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and therefore will
not giue eare vnto his false
suggestions; and therefore
when any afflictions doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
them, they will take them
as indÃ©ed they are, Gods lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13661:91"/>
corrections and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
preseruatiues, to kÃ©epe
them from all things that
may offend God, and will
in their troubles sÃ©eke no
other refuge, but (as the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Chiekens flye to the
wings of the Hen) so they
runne and hide-themselues
in Gods protecting Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
who is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them into his sauing
pauilion, and to set them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the rocke of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Experience hath found it
a dangerous thing to liue in
carnall security and without
trouble; as long as <hi>Dauid</hi>
was pursued by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as long as he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13661:91"/>
with troubles, he could
sÃ©eke the Lord, he was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in continuall prayer,
and finding God ready to
helpe him, he could say, <hi>I will
goe forward in the strength
of the Lord,</hi> then he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that God was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and that he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bÃ©e confounded: But
when he had no enemies, and
all his troubles were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
he forgat that euer hÃ©e
was in danger, hÃ©e liued at
ease, tooke his pleasure and
delights, walking without
feare on the top of his house
securely, delighting himselfe
in his pleasant prospects,
and behold a woman bathing
her selfe; then his heart
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13661:92"/>
which was before set vpon
God, was set on fire of lust,
&amp; committed grieuous sins
without remorse, vntill God
sent <hi>Nathan</hi> to put him in
minde of that which hee had
forgotten a whole yeere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
then was he stricken
with another kinde of feare,
not of humane enemies, but
of Gods iustice, and where
before hee continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
God to hide him from
his enemies, now he cryeth,
<hi>Haue mercy vpon me<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> O God,
according to thy louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of thy mercies, put away
mine iniquities. I know my
iniquities, and my sin is euer
before me.</hi> Sinne we see is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13661:92"/>
the fruit of security, and by
that godly mans example, it
appeareth that some trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are better than a quiet
and secure estate, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
also by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who
being magnified in the sight
of all Nations, and was free
from feare of trouble, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
proud, his heart was
lifted vp; but when God had
sent him an enemy <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi>
to rouse him by threats, &amp;
sicknes to afflict him, then he
became humble, then he fel to
his prayers to God, and God
then did hide him in his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
in the secret place of
his pauilion did he hide him,
&amp; in his sicknes set him again
vpon the rocke of health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:13661:93"/>
Gods owne children are
knowne by his fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
them: and they that
come into no troubles in this
life, liue they neuer so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
contented, may suspect
themselues, and may be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be none of his: and
therefore faith <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to
<hi>Iob, Blessed is the man whom
God correcteth and afflicteth
here.</hi> If then affliction and
troubles be the way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
blessed, or at least an
argument of Gods fauour;
with what patience should
we endure them; nay, with
what ioy should we embrace
them? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accounted
the afflictions of this present
life, not to be worthy of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13661:93"/>
glory which we shall enioy
hereafter.</p>
               <p>Why therefore should we
feare or repine against trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
sÃ©eing it is so necessary
for vs? It is not yet meant,
neither is it required of vs

to sÃ©eke troubles, as some

one of the sinnes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
It is required of vs,
onely when troubles of what

                  <p>O Lord my God in Iesus
Christ, who art onely
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13661:94"/>
wise in disposing all things
for all men, and to whose
will all creatures in Heauen,
Earth and Sea are subiect; and
none, be he neuer so mighty,
can withstand what thou wilt
haue done: Open thine eyes
and behold me, open thine
eares and heare mee, open
thine hands and releeue mee.
I am in trouble, not by
chance, but of thine owne wil;
not in thine anger to destroy
me, but in thy loue to reforme
me; my sinnes I doe confesse
haue offended thee, and yet
are they strong in mee, it is a
deadly disease which none can
cure<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but thou through the
bloud of thy sonne; O wash
me throughly from mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13661:95"/>
&amp; cleanse me from my
sinnes, vse not thy seuerity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, O Lord, for I were
neuer able to abide it: but as
thou hast begunne gently to
correct me, so proceed not as a
iust Iudge, but as a louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so shall not I wax worse
and worse, but shall grow
from vertue to vertue, from
faith to repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to newnesse of life
by thy spirit.</p>
                  <p>Make therefore thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
light vnto me by thy
supporting hand, that though
they be many, they exceed
not my power to beare them,
for I am of my selfe weake, but
assisted by thy spirit, I shall
become strong; and though I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13661:95"/>
be ignorant how to ease mee
of this burthen, he shall teach
mee that repentance, that
through faith in thy Sonne,
shal procure the mitigation of
mine afflictions: though they
be many and of diuers kinds,
they are all knowne of thee,
and all necessary for mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast sent them, and
that not in vaine, for all worke
and worke together for my
good through thy blessing.</p>
                  <p>I am cast downe, I am
brought low, I am scorned,
because of my basenesse and
troubles, but I beare it, and
keepe silence when I heare
the vpbraidings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of my late familiars,
who abandon my ancient-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13661:96"/>
because they wax aloft
and I become low: this yet
comes not to passe without
thee, thy hand is in euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the good of thine: if
enemies assaile me, thou bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
them; if pouerty and
want oppresse me, thou sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
it; if sicknesse afflict me,
thou doest it; and therefore
good: and none of these shall
exceed my strength, through
thy strength. As for mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
thou canst bridle
them, for pouerty and want
thou canst supply them, for
sicknesse and carnall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thou canst cure them: all
these haue their turnes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit

Lord I come vnto thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

I thy corrections as a

mortall.</p>
                  <p>Beare with my weaknesse
Lord, and lay not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

patience be, and the measure
of thy mercies aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>And as thou obseruest my
sinnes, so consider what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is fit for my reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I know thou art iust,
but most sweetly tempered
with mercy, yet no equality
betweene thy mercy and thy

mercy and truth, and there is
no iniustice in thy feuerity,
for thou shewest mercy to

and executest iustice iustly.</p>
                  <p>Who then can complaine

when all mens sinnes are

                  <p>Thou Lord hast promised

by the malice of

and continued many yÃ©eres
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13661:98"/>
in continual troubles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
being exercised, he betooke
himselfe to prayer to God,
liuing in hope that the time
would come wherein hee
should be frÃ©ed from <hi>Sauls</hi>

so should he bÃ©e at

in many yÃ©eres little or no
breathing time, or freedome
from afflictions, yet was his
faith strong, and his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in God firme, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the first, second
and third verses of this 27.
Psalme, wherein hÃ©e decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the fauour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, that he was <hi>his
light and his saluation,</hi> and
<hi>his strength,</hi> so that he feared
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13661:99"/>
not <hi>Saul,</hi> nor whatsoeuer
wicked enemies, being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that if they came vpon
him to take away his life,
God would make them to
stumble and fall, as by his
owne hands and Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
<hi>Goliah</hi> fell, and after
<hi>Saul</hi> his enemy by his owne
sword: so that in the first
Uerse hÃ©e tooke courage
through faith in God, and

in the secret place

And in this verse, <hi>Now shall

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:13661:99"/>
When <hi>Saul</hi> was dead his
mighty enemy, he tooke the
Gouernment of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but was not yet frÃ©e
from enemies; whereby wÃ©e
may see, that the death of one
enemy is the life of another;
and to teach vs not to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
at any time, but when
one danger is past, to looke
for another: yet not without
Hope, though cast downe, in
the end to be lifted vp and
raised againe. For as the
Moone wareth full, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
and the Sea ebbeth
and floweth, and as the sky
cleareth and cloudeth; so doe
the estates of men, high and
low, rise and fall, and fall
and rise. What a fall had
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13661:100"/>
                  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> being the darling of
his Father, to be sold as a
slaue, to be falsely accused,
and to be strictly imprisoned,
and yet in the end to bÃ©e so
highly aduanced?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid, shall
he lift vp my head:</hi> as if hÃ©e
could limit God the time to
raise him. No doubt, it was
not his meaning to tie God
to a certaine time: but when
<hi>Saul</hi> his Predecessor was
dead, &amp; the Crowne open sor
him, he might well say<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>Now,</hi>
that is, now hath God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the time to bring
that to passe, which long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had promised.</p>
               <p>IndÃ©ed when he was made
King, he might well say, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13661:100"/>
                  <hi>God had lifted vp his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his enemies round about
him;</hi> for he had many, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is shewed, and net a few,
euen of <hi>Sauls</hi> followers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
who when they saw <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
exalted, might enuy his
aduancement, being lifted vp
so farre aboue them, and had
then power to recompence
their wickednesse against
him. But he had no reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
spirit; if he had had, hÃ©e
would haue reuenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vpon <hi>Shemey,</hi> that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on him, and cursed him;
and vpon <hi>Doeg,</hi> that discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his abode to <hi>Saul:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these did he touch, but
as touching <hi>Shemey,</hi> though
he swore vnto him that hÃ©e
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13661:101"/>
would not slay him; yet hÃ©e
commanded <hi>Salomon,</hi> that
he should cause his hoare
head to goe to the graue with
bloud: which it sÃ©emeth hÃ©e
spake by the spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
fore-sÃ©eing that he should
die by the sword.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> deliuered
from his enemies, and lifted
vp aboue them, sheweth the
wonderfull power of God in
preseruing him, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
and loue in aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him, yet continued hÃ©e
not long without his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and enemies to exercise
him, though he were now
established in his Kingdome:
for he hauing peace &amp; securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a while, we find into what
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13661:101"/>
sinnes he fell, though he were
aduanced aboue his corporall
enemies, his spirituall foes
grew stronger than he; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is good that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, though neuer
so great in the world, haue
afflictions and troubles, lest
they forget God, as this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King for a time did, yet
vpon repentance God raised
him againe: Which example
of sinning we must auoid,
and imitate his repentance.</p>
               <p>By his assured confidence
in God he still withstood, and
preuailed against all that
rose vp against him: none
could make him afraid, but
rested still assured that God
would now, namely whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13661:102"/>
he was beset with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
lift vp his head aboue all
his enemies round about
him: His enemies in their
policies, became fooles; in
their strength, weake; and
all their deuices brought to
nought. So that <hi>Dauid</hi> might
well sing this ioyfull Song,
<hi>The Lord hath lifted vp my
head aboue all mine enemies
round about me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing preuaileth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
or against God: None
can be lifted vp to sit safely
without God: therefore the
man that is wise being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced,
will-imitate <hi>Dauid</hi>
in faith, and a holy resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
then shall he mount that
rocke that shall neuer bee
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13661:102"/>
moued, God shall maintaine
his lot, so that troubles shall
not dismay him, enemies
shall not hurt him, neither
shall any thing make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</p>
               <p>None must yet stand in
conceit, that <hi>Dauids</hi> infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and falls should bÃ©e a
priuilege for them to commit
sinne; but rather let his fall
be a-motiue to them, to bÃ©e
watchfull ouer their waies,
for the preuenting of like
danger, and to beware of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:
For easie it is for a
man to fall of himselfe, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> did, but without God
not to rise againe, and repent
as <hi>Dauid</hi> did. Though he fell
and was lifted vp, <hi>Saul</hi> fell
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13661:103"/>
and neuer rose; <hi>Peter</hi> fell and
rose againe; but <hi>Iudas</hi> fell,
and that finally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> had an eie vnto his
waies, and respect vnto his
walkings, to preuent a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
fall, so as his enemies
could not preuaile: yet hÃ©e
confessed, that it was the
Lord that supported him,
and made him to abide in
safety. It was not his owne
power, or wit, or policy,
but the mercy of God that
preserued him, and that lifted
vp his head aboue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
He was constant, and
waited the Lords leisure<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he
made not haste as hÃ©e might
haue done, hauing <hi>Saul</hi> twice
within his power: though he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13661:103"/>
were anointed King, yet
would he lay no violent
hands vpon him that was
pre-anointed and inuested,
but waited his time, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
did, whose head was lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp aboue his enuious
brethrer. <hi>Mordochay,</hi> and
the Jewes likewise with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
waited the time, and
were lifted vp aboue <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>man,</hi>
but otherwise, higher by the
gallowes than they.</p>
               <p>Many are lifted vp aboue
their enemies in conceit, and
yet themselues lifted vp as
enemies against themselues:
for the more man insulteth in
pride ouer other men, the
more the mighty triumph
ouer the weake, the rich ouer
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13661:104"/>
the poore, the glorious ouer
the base: and the more that
they in authority abuse and
tyrannize ouer them they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne,
so much the further
off are they from the true lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp, how high soeuer they
cary their heads: and so much
the more enemies they are
vnto themselues.</p>
               <p>There is no true lifting
vp without loue, for God is
loue, he lifteth vp the heart
and soule through faith aboue
the outward man, euen to
haue their conuersation in
heauen. This is the true and
swÃ©etest aduancement, this
is the glorious lifting vp of
the head: And thus was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
also lifted vp spiritually,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13661:104"/>
together with his outward
lifting vp, aboue his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
enemies.</p>
               <p>Many good men are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to honor and office; To
what end? Not onely not to
gaine earthly glory thereby,
or to enrich themselues by
sinister meanes thereby, and
to abuse their places, and
wrong their lifter and lifting
vp: but as <hi>Dauid</hi> being lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp, did acknowledge it to
be the Lords doing: and as
he was aduanced by him, so
did he sÃ©eke by all meanes to
aduance his glory; and
though he were lifted vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his enemies, he insulted
not ouer them, but gaue God
the praise, that his enemies
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13661:105"/>
triumphed not ouer him.</p>
               <p>Praise and thanksgiuing
are due vnto God, for euery
benefit and blessing hÃ©e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
vpon vs; and hÃ©e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it, especially of them
whom he lifteth vp aboue
their enemies: and that they
be lowly in their owne eies,
and louing to all, euen to
their enemies. And to learne
also of <hi>Paul,</hi> in a low estate
to be patient, and being lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp to be thankfull, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be grieued at the one,
nor to glory too much in the
other: In the one, pray to be
constant; in the other, giue
glory to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he knew by
his anointing, that he should
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13661:105"/>
be King after <hi>Sauls</hi> death,
continued yet humble, and
was yet contented to kÃ©epe
his fathers shÃ©epe (a meane
office, for a man anointed to
be a King) and thought it no
disparagement. And when
he was indÃ©ed exalted, hÃ©e set
not out his glory by outward
vanities: neither was hÃ©e
guarded with swaggering,
swearing Drunkards, and
with vile and vitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though with sufficient
noble attendants (his <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies)</hi>
abandoning his house
of the knowne wicked, and
retained such into his seruice
as he found to feare God.
And in stead of worldly vain-glory,
he went into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13661:106"/>
of God, and there offered
the sacrifices of prayer and
praise: and not himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but called the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and with them went,
not once, but many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the house of the Lord: He
was not ashamed, being a
King, to be the formost in
the seruice of God. And let
vs praise God for his like
mercy vouchsafed vnto vs,
and let vs imitate godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
               <p>Here is a liuely patterne of
a thankfull heart to God for
his aduancement, contrary
to the course of many, who
being lifted vp, not aboue
their enemies, but aboue
their equals; of whom many
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13661:106"/>
giue rather thankes to their
owne wit and policy, and to
inferior meanes, friends, or
money. But such their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
is but as the
building of <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp; though
their language be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
(but many times
changed) their manners of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
altered: They rise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, and oftentimes we
sÃ©e them fall of themselues.
If therefore thou be exalted,
remember <hi>Dauid,</hi> by whom,
and by what meanes he was
lifted vp. He praied, and the
Lord heard him, and he gaue
the whole glory to God.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer thou art, bÃ©e
thou neuer so eminent, think
not praier and praising God
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13661:107"/>
to be base exercises, or things
indifferent. They are the
works of Gods Saints, and
therein they exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
day and night. But
woe to them, that onely make
their praiers and suits vnto
men, forgetting God, and
that being lifted vp, offer the
sacrifice of praise vnto men
to their own deuices, to their
Siluer and Gold, &amp;c. Forget
not God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that can winke at
ambitious mens lifting vp,
and laugh at their fals.</p>
               <p>But when God affordeth
lawfull means to lift vp any,
he giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> assurance of his
approbation, and if they pray
for good successe, they shall
prosper and profit the place
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13661:107"/>
they execute, and the place
shall iustifie their integritie:
for, as without him, nothing
can come to good effect; So,
to whatsoeuer action he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his helping hand, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but prosper: And he that
is by him lifted vp, let him
not forget to pray and to

and howsoeuer they

yet as long as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

that thou canst and wilt in

euen of those that now scoffe

they shall againe receiue

fauourable vnto me. O helpe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13661:109"/>
me and deliuer me from them
that afflict me, and saue me,
for I trust in thee; and none
that trusteth in thee shall bee

thee, my sorrowes and my

and though I seeme to faint,
and my heart to faile me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my louers and my

my miseries, yet I wait on
thee, for comming, I know
thy helpe will come: for thou
art an vpright Iudge, though
thou haue brought me low, I
know thou canst and wilt lift
me vp againe; and they that
thinke thou hast vtterly forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me, shall see that there is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13661:110"/>
a God that hath a care of his

say now, Where is thy God
in whom thou seemest so

thee or releeue thee? thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest

thee not; thou seemest to

to a weake-minde: but
it daunteth me not, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
in thy mercies; I faint
not at these reproaches, for
they vpbraid not me, but
thee, saying as it were in
their hearts, it is bootlesse for
the distressed to trust in thee.</p>
                  <p>O consider this, my God,
and permit mee not (though
sore oppressed) to giue ouer
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13661:110"/>
calling continually and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

there is mercy, and with thee
is timely redemption: though
thou seeme to tarry long and
to giue no eare vnto my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(which maketh those that
are ignorant of thy waies to
thinke thou hast vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken

assured that thou forgettest

leaue mee but that thou wilt

lift me vp againe: and then
shall they that thus haue cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured

that indeed I haue not trusted

thou art a God indeed, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13661:111"/>
able and louing, willing
and ready to helpe thine in the
time of most need: I am thine,
O Lord, for in all my troubles
I haue hitherunto found thee
my God, my helper, and my
refuge, though there be that
haue said there is no helpe for
me in thee, I haue found them
lyers, for thou hast neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me nor forsaken mee hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therunto,
neither wilt thou
faile me or forsake me for euer.</p>
                  <p>Thou hast euer beene my
rocke and fortresse, and hast
euer deliuered mee, therefore
art thou worthy to be praised,
yea I will praise thee, for I
was left vnto thee as soone as
I was borne, and thou hast
euer beene a louing father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13661:111"/>
me: though as a father thou
hast gently corrected me, yet
thy louing kindnes thou hast
neuer withholden from me;
but when in my greatest trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and afflictions I haue
beene like to perish, thou hast
not left mee to the will of
mine enemies; and when they
they thought to reioyce most
at my miseries, thou hast lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp my head aboue mine
aduersaries: in thee therefore
will I trust, and not be afraid
what man can doe vnto me.
Haste thee to help me, O God

when they were deseruedly
ouercome, cryed for helpe at
God, but he neglected them
and reiected them, because
they cried being a wicked
people in their distresse for
helpe at Gods hands whom
they before despised. But

the people of God cried

cries, and there are cries that
none heare but God, as the

Likewise the sinnes

cryed vnto God for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

and though neuer so

               <p>
                  <hi>Dauids</hi> cry was of another

                  <hi>Dauids</hi> tended to the glory of
God and his owne succour
and safetie: and therefore
said he, <hi>Hearken vnto my
voice, O Lord, when I cry;</hi>
Which teacheth vs not to bÃ©e
mute, when any occasion of
feare or affliction may moue
vs to sÃ©eke the helpe of God:
We must cry vnto God, not
vnto dumb stocks and stones,
nor to any dead creature or
Angell, whom they are fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
framed to represent, but
vnto the liuing God; he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can heare, be our praiers
neuer so secret and silent. He
heard <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> onely
mouing their lips without
sound. So that it is not the
loudnesse of the voice, but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13661:114"/>
the affection of the heart that
maketh the cry, where unto
God giues eare: many no
doubt can and doe cry <hi>Lord,
Lord,</hi> and that loud enough,
and yet they are not heard
because they cry not in faith.
And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> did not
onely say, <hi>Lord hearken vnto
my cry,</hi> but withall craued
that God would <hi>haue mercy
vpon him,</hi> for men may cry
long enough and loud e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and not be heard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
GOD shew mercy.
Therefore saith <hi>Dauid, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vnto my voice when I
cry, haue mercy also vpon me
&amp; heare me;</hi> for God heareth
no mans prayer but in his
mercy, and therfore is <hi>mercy</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:13661:114"/>
in the first place so be sought,
but by faith, for he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> trusteth

be in neuer so great misery
or danger, if wee cry faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vnto God, he will heare
vs, and in his mercy helpe
vs: As <hi>Dauid</hi> complained
vnto God, saying, <hi>I am in a
wonderfull strait, let vs now
fall into the hands of the
Lord, (for his mercies are
great) and let vs not fall into
the hands of men.</hi> God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
mercy vnto thousands
that loue him and kÃ©epe his
Commandements, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them: but the wicked
and such as contemne his
Word he will not heare, for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13661:115"/>
they cry not in saith, they cry
onely for their owne neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
not referring the end
of their desires to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
they cry of themselues
with the lips only, they come
in their owne names, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
onely themselues and
their owne outward wants,
and fÃ©ele not nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their inward defects;
they are sinners and repent
them not, they aske therefore
and receiue not; <hi>They cry
vnto mee,</hi> saith God, <hi>but I
will not heare them, because
they pray without faith and
repentance. Therefore when
affliction &amp; anguish shall fall
vpon them, they shall call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, but I will not answer;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13661:115"/>
they shall seeke me, but shall
not finde me.</hi> But the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
afflicted he heareth, and
such as depart from their
sinnes and walke righteously
before him he considereth:
as <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>I cried vnto the Lord,</hi>
saith he, <hi>and hee heard mee,
and deliuered mee out of all

that feare the Lord nÃ©ed feare
no trouble, for mercy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth

nay before they cry he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

is euer vpon them, euen at
an instant to preuent whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13661:116"/>
danger; therefore may
the faithfull goe comfortably
forward in the strength of
the Lord trusting in him, and
they shall neuer be ashamed:
he is our strength and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and our defence: let vs

heare vs and helpe vs:
he will delay no further time
than may be for our good, hee
may sÃ©eme vnto vs long in
comming, but he will come
in a time conuenient, and his

and hope in vs, which if
these graces haue their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13661:116"/>
working in vs, we shall
finde that he will neuer faile
vs nor forsake vs, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
such as are ignorant of
Gods power and prouidence
may thinke, that vnlesse God
come at our first call he will
not come at all, which is an
argument they belÃ©eue not
Gods promises, for if they
did they would make no such
haste, but wait the Lords lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
not that he is so busted
as he cannot intend either to
heare vs or helpe vs, for his
eare is alwaies open to
heare, and his hand alwaies
able to helpe euery man as

<hi>the holy one of Israel,</hi> for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13661:117"/>
hee knowes the times and
seasons fit for euery of his
intentions; shall wee thinke
that <hi>Dauid</hi> in his extremest
dangers did not pray for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery,
yet though his saith
were great, he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
set frÃ©e, though he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, <hi>How long Lord, how
long, wilt thou absent thy
selfe for euer? Ioseph</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in his captiuity and
imprisonment, shall wee
thinke that hÃ©e cried not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord for deliuery,
and that instantly? and yet
he suffered him to endure the
very iron setters and stocks
vntill Gods appointed time
came, and then when the
counsell of the Lord had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13661:117"/>
tried them, then he
deliuered them, and shewed
the abundance of his mercies
towards them in aduancing
them both: we may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
murmure or repine at
Gods corrections, though
they continue in our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
long; it is not onely that
it is vnsauory to our carnall
mindes but for want of faith,
for where faith is strong it
produceth hope, and in hope
we wait with patience; and
we finde by experience that
hope and patience shall not
be in vaine. Then whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is afflicted, let them cry
vnto God to haue mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and that in a liuely
faith, and he will at least case
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13661:118"/>
them, if hÃ©e doe not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deliuer them: hee will
kÃ©epe his owne vnder his
owne hand, and not suffer
them to haue the frÃ©edome of
the raines at their owne
pleasure, knowing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulinesse
of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

which if he curbe it not,
will runne into euery sinne,
and make no conscience of
any impiety: as we may sÃ©e

God permitted him but to

               <p>Troubles and afflictions
fall not vpon vs without
Gods prouidence, though
Satan worketh what he can
to trouble vs, as appeareth

more doe the children of God
cleane vnto God for succour,

and that which Satan inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

worketh it for our good, for

who as they are truly Gods

corrupt nature, alwaies apt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13661:119"/>
to be puffed vp with a kinde
of pride and security, when
wee fÃ©ele the abundance of
Gods graces and fauours
towards vs, in his wisdome
and mercy taketh downe our

selues by corrections: as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
before he was afflicted
went awry; <hi>Manasses</hi> a great
Idolater, by troubles was
reclaimed, and then he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto God and humbled
himselfe; wÃ©e may sÃ©e it also
in the prodigall sonne, who
as long as hÃ©e had money to
bestow vpon his vanities
and lusts, he liued a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life against his father;
but when he was afflicted by
penury and want, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13661:120"/>
home to his father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
and crying vnto him
in effect as here <hi>Dauid</hi> doth;
<hi>O father hearken vnto my

and heare me,</hi> as much as if
hÃ©e had said, Father forgiue
mÃ©e.</p>
               <p>Gods corrections, though
grieuous and vnsauory for a
time, yet good and profitable
for vs, we are thereby the
more drawne from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in sinne, and made
more obedient vnto the will
of God, especially if they bÃ©e
seasoned with reuerence to
God that sends them with
faith, repentance, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
praier: then shall wÃ©e
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13661:120"/>
finde that they will bring vs
(being exercised with them)
the quiet fruit of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
Wherefore let vs not
onely not be discouraged at
the chastisements of God,
for they are in loue; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make vse of them for

reformation. Adding
daily and continuall praiers
vnto God, who smiteth vs;
neither to kill vs orto maime

do as schollers do, who when
they are in their vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
haue one eie (as it

were) to sÃ©e whether the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
obserueth them or no,
and should giue them a clap
before they were aware: We
are to be as wary of the hand
of God, and as the maiden
of the hand of her mistrisse;
so shall God hearken vnto

me: for I cannot preuailingly
cry vnto thee, vnlesse thou cry
in me by thine owne Spirit,
sanctifying my spirit, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
my spirit again by thy
spirit. Hearken, euen vnto thy

my spirit heare thy spirit, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to me, and in mee. So
shall my soule sound forth a
glorious voice, a sharpe and
piercing voice, a voice whose
sound shall ascend aboue the

with thee, euen Iesus
Christ the righteous: in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13661:123"/>
whose name, and for whose

vnto those that come and cry
faithfully vnto thee. Then I,
euen I, shall heare a most sweet

Grace resound in the eares of
my soule, that shall assure me
of answer of euery my peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>When I cry, <hi>Lord forgiue
me my sinnes,</hi> I shall heare, <hi>Thy
sinnes, O man, are forgiuen
thee:</hi> when I shall say, <hi>Open
thou my lips,</hi> I shall heare, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
thy mouth, and I will fill
it:</hi> When I shall say, <hi>Lord I

in my tentations, I shall heare,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13661:123"/>
                     <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee:</hi>
When I shall call vnto thee in
my necessities for helpe, I shall
heare, <hi>I will neuer faile thee,
nor forsake thee.</hi> This is thy
goodnesse, O Lord, and thy
mercy, therefore will I euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
pray vnto thee: O hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vnto my voice, when I
cry vnto thee, haue mercy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vpon me, and heare me.</p>
                  <p>The ground of all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
in all my troubles to bee
eased, is thy mercy; yea, thy
mercy onely. In mee there is
nothing worthy to bee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

only that maketh me to dwell

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13661:124"/>
therefore in thy mercy heare
me when I call vpon thee, and

thou, O God, art the God of

is (as it were) a
familiar confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwÃ©ene
the Lord and <hi>Dauid:</hi> God
saies vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in the
plurall number, to all that
are his, <hi>Seeke yee my face;</hi>
And <hi>Dauid</hi> againe in the
name of the faithfull replies,
<hi>Thy face, O Lord, will I seeke.</hi>
It sÃ©emeth to be a strange
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13661:125"/>
command, that we weake
Creatures that cannot looke
with stedfast eies vpon the
Sun, that is but one of his
inferior Creatures, but shall
be striken blinde with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
beames thereof, should
sÃ©eke and behold his face,
which none could euer sÃ©e
and liue. And it sÃ©emeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be as strange a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in <hi>Dauid,</hi> to say that hÃ©e
would sÃ©eke the face of God.
To sÃ©eke the Lord, is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of Scripture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
vs: but to sÃ©eke and
to sÃ©e his face, is not so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
commanded. But
these phrases of spÃ©ech differ
not, for both signifie the sÃ©ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his helpe, and are not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13661:125"/>
literally to be vnderstood, as
if God had a visible face to
be sÃ©ene; or that he had a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
being to be felt. God
is a spirit, and spiritually to
be sought, and spiritually to
be discerned, and is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to be sÃ©ene, but in
the face of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who
is also now glorified in the
heauens, not visibly to bee
apprehended by vs, vntill his
second comming.</p>
               <p>What is then meant by
the sÃ©eking of the face of
God? onely his fauour and
his protection in the time of
our danger: And to sÃ©eke
God, is to implore his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
prouidence, and helpe in
our afflictions: As <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:13661:126"/>
comforting the captiue <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
in Babylon: You shall
goe and pray vnto me,</hi> (saith
God) <hi>and I will heare you,
and if you seeke me, yee shall
finde me, if you seeke me with
all your hearts.</hi> And againe,
<hi>Azariah,</hi> said to <hi>Asa, Iuda</hi> and
<hi>Beniamin, The Lord is with
you while yee be with him:
And if yee seeke him, he will
be found of you; but if yee
forsake him, hee will forsake
you.</hi> God is present with
the faithfull by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
helping power, as long as
they hold him fast by their
praiers, and wrastle with
him with their faithfull peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as <hi>Iacob</hi> did with the
Angell, and cry vnto him till
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13661:126"/>
he answer, and neuer leaue
seeking of him, till hee finde
him. If we sÃ©eke him in the
Word, wÃ©e shall finde him
there, as the spirit hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
him, both a mercifull
God, and a consuming fire.
The faithfull finde him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
euen in this life: the
wicked shall finde him a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
Judge hereafter. The
first shall sÃ©e his face, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce:
the second shall sÃ©e his
face, and tremble. The first
shall sÃ©e, and behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his countenance with
great gladnesse for euer: the
second shall sÃ©e his face for a
moment in his last sentence,
and that with horror.</p>
               <p>God saies vnto all, <hi>Seeke
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13661:127"/>
yee my face,</hi> but few with
their hearts doe sÃ©eke him:
And that is the reason that
many call vpon him and are
not heard; they sÃ©eme to sÃ©eke
him, and finde him not: but
vnto the truly faithfull, hÃ©e
offereth himselfe as he did to
<hi>Moses; My presence shall goe
with thee, and I will giue thee
rest.</hi> This is the true behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the face of God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
his presence; namely,
when he is ready in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and prouidence to helpe
vs in our afflictions, and to
deliuer vs in our dangers;
any other presence of his in
this life we nÃ©ede not sÃ©eke,
his glory is aboue the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens:
What is man then
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13661:127"/>
that he should sÃ©eke to sÃ©e his
all-glorious face here in
earth, which <hi>Moses</hi> saw but
in a bush obscurely, in respect
of his full and compleat glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and yet with that sight
his face did shine so, as the
people could not abide the

lesse, the glory of the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
beauty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most high? whose dwelling
is in the heauens, and whose

which hast set thy glory aboue
the heauens,</hi> where he sitteth

of his, and is nÃ©ere
them when they call vpon
him, he turneth his face and
louing countenance towards
them, to cheare them and
comfort them; as for the
wicked, he beholdeth them a
farre off. <hi>I haue set the Lord</hi>
(saith <hi>Dauid) alwaies before
me, for he is at my right hand,
therefore I shall not slide:</hi> As
if he had said, I sÃ©e the face
of God continually: and hÃ©e
it is that preserueth me from
danger; so that mine <hi>heart
is glad, and my tongue reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
my flesh also doth rest
in hope.</hi> The tongue of men

necessary it is, that wee

vs, be it neuer so little, such
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13661:135"/>
is our frailty, that we begin

strength saileth vs, which
if we can apprehend, it is an
argument that we are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
destitute of the

carried away with our owne
corruptions as we neuer fÃ©ele
our owne wants of spirituall

sinne without touch of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

the spirit of God, &amp; therefore
run on stil in their impieties,

               <p>It is not so with them that
God hath chosen and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,

the least of Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
if but for a moment, for
they are seldome idle in one
kinde of holy duty or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
they either meditate on
the word and works of God,
they pray or offer the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of thankes to God, and
when they finde in them
selues a dulnesse to pray, or
ignorance how to pray, they
presently suspect that they
haue deserued by some
meanes that God hath left
them to themselues, who of
their owne power without
the helpe of the Spirit of
God cannot thinke a good
thought, much lesse faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and seruently pray vnto

him, and then fÃ©eling the
griefe of their hearts that
they cannot be comforted by
the exercise of these holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
finde the fault to bee in
themselues, and that God
for some sinne committed, or
some good dutie omitted, is
angrie with them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here,
they crie out vnto God, <hi>O
hide not thy face from me, nor
cast thy seruant away in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</hi>
So fearefull are the
children of God, to lose the
benefit of his presence, as
they thinke nothing so irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
vnto them as his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and therefore haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

is mercifull to them that are

sorrow and repentance is
the gift of God, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

often call to God for it, as a

There is nothing more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

and omit those holy duties
which he requireth. How can
hee looke vpon them in loue
that leaue him? How can he
but hide his face, and as it
were, cast them away in his
displeasure that neuer sÃ©eke
him or serue him? Nay, that
sÃ©eke him not with a pure
heart, and that continually?
for it is not enough to sinne
and serue him by turnes, as
if he allowed vs a time for
our selues to take our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
pleasures &amp; delights in,
and a time againe for him, to
haue our times wherein wÃ©e
cannot sinne, either being
glutted with sinne, or vnable
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13661:139"/>
to sinne. How can hee but
hide his face from such?
How can it be, but he must
cast away such in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure?
<hi>Dauid</hi> that thus
crieth out, that God had hid
his face from him, neuer
tooke such prophane liberty,
and yet through his humane
frailty, fell, and that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously:
but he lay not in it
as the reprobate doe; he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
his heart, and found it
corrupt, and falted it with
the teares of repentance:
<hi>Thou hast fed mee with the
bread of teares</hi> (saith he) <hi>and
giuen mee teares to drinke.</hi>
This is the true medicine to
cure the soule that hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Faith and Repentance.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13661:139"/>
And who so applieth it truly
to himselfe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did,
shall finde ease; and although
God sÃ©eme sometimes to
hide his face, it is but to
cause vs the more to sÃ©eke
it, and though he sÃ©eme to cast
vs off in displeasure, it is but
as a louing father that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
extreme anger to
his childe that hath offended
him, and maketh a shew as
if he will vtterly cast him off,
determining yet nothing
lesse. So though God the
most louing father to his
children sÃ©eme often angry
with vs, as he sÃ©emed to bee
with <hi>Dauid,</hi> it was more in
shew than in dÃ©ed (which we
may not slightly regard, for
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13661:140"/>
so we may indÃ©ed turne his
fatherly displeasure into iust
reuenge) let vs obserue in
wisdome the Lords waies,
how indÃ©ed he neuer winketh
long at our least sinne, for
many little sinnes make a
great cry, and when God
heareth their clamour hÃ©e
turneth away his face as a
thing loathsome vnto him, as
he did from <hi>Dauid</hi> for a time,
who fÃ©eling it, ranne crying
againe vnto God: <hi>O hide
not thy face from me, O Lord
nor cast thy seruant away in
displeasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou hast beene my suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
(saith <hi>Dauid) leaue mee

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13661:140"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> found that God had
hid his face from him, and
sÃ©emed displeased with him,
yet he tooke a godly courage
through saith, to put God in
minde of his former fauours
towards him, saying, <hi>Thou
hast beene my succour,</hi> and
thou changest not, thou art
still the same, and whom
thou hast once chosen, thou
neuer forsakest. He may be
angry with his dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for a time, but he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not long in his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
but when he with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
doth chastise a man
for his sinne, his beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth,
and all carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
are as it were irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
vnto him in respect of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13661:141"/>
the losse of Gods fauour.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Dauid</hi> sÃ©emed
much to bee troubled that
God did hide his face from
him, and to withhold his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

yet he had hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dÃ©eme
his fauour againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was before his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
which no doubt hee in
his heart acknowledged, not
to procÃ©ed of his owne deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
but of the meere and
frÃ©e mercy of God. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as hee first frÃ©ely chose
him without his desert, he
would not cast him off in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his humane frailties,
incident to all men, euen to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best men; but would rather
renew, maintaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:13661:141"/>
those diuine graces
which it had pleased God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to plant in him, and so
would returne againe vnto
him in loue, and turne his
face towards him againe, and
not vtterly to leaue him nor
forsake him; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was assured, that as
God had promised to be, so
he was, and would be, <hi>the
God of his saluation for euer:</hi>
for he neuer faileth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his promises to
a thousand generations. And
his gifts and callings are
without repentance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we be chosen of God,
we cleaue vnto God; if we
cleaue vnto God, God is
faithfull to succour vs, &amp; will

neuer leaue vs nor forsake vs.</p>
               <p>Though he seeme to hide

to be with him; we may
with like boldnesse build our

as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, by his former

held it as an argument
of Gods neuer failing help, in
that hee was ence his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
how much more may
such as haue often found him
their defence and succour as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
themselues, that though

                  <p>I haue runne too farre in the

rebelling against the law

to displeasure against mee,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13661:143"/>
wherein thou seemest to hide

Remember that I am thine,

therefore I cannot but confesse
indeed, that thou maiest turne

they might obserue more

want nothing that is good,
though hee sÃ©eme here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

peace, and rest, and glory for

               <p>Therefore in the meane

is but a little while: If we
want any thing for soule or

him and hee will supply it;
If any wrong vs or abuse
vs, to complaine to him and
he will redresse it. If we bÃ©e
sicke, he knoweth our disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
he is our Physician, and
knoweth whether life or
death be fittest for vs. If we
die, he will restore vs to life
eternall, therefore may wÃ©e

No Lord, I only bewray mine

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> was a man chosen of

he may be taxed or tax

And therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi>

Gods children, but haue
enemies, not onely corporall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13661:159"/>
but spirituall, among whom
the subtillest and strongest is
Satan, who looketh not so
much into what a man doth,
as into the inclination of his
heart by the things hee doth:
for by his workes he findeth
what is in man (for thoughts
are hid) and by his outward
actions he can collect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
hÃ©e is inclined: and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he workes and laies
his plots accordingly, and
most commonly he obserueth
in euery man some sinne that
raigneth and ruleth aboue all
other sinnes, which he hugs
(as it were) in his bosome:
there doth Satan apply his
greatest battery, knowing
that if he vanquish him in it,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13661:159"/>
and sÃ©e him to continue in it,
it is as much as if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
him to a thousand sins,
and therefore hee laieth baits
(according to a cunning
Fowler or Fisherman, that
hath one especiall bait for
each kinde of Fowle or Fish)
according to the desire of that
peculiar sin wherein a man
most delighteth, entertaining
euery occasion or fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

               <p>Euery raigning or rather

must be fed with the
satisfying of those corrupt

with the nature of that

it will euen eat vp their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and they will become

so of the rest.</p>
               <p>If therefore a man fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

an aduantage is it vnto his

that it is not enough to

who neuer rest day nor night,
seeking to draw (if it were

into the waies of the
wicked, and then againe to
moue and instigate the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to reproach vs for our
sinnes, so that wÃ©e must not
looke to liue here securely,
euen in our sÃ©eming most

raise vp one railing and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Shemei,</hi> some one traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Iudas,</hi> or one trecherous
<hi>Achithophel</hi> or another to

committed any knowne sin,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13661:164"/>
be it neuer so small, whether
in our place, conuersation or
profession, wee shall be sure
to heare it. Let vs liue neuer
so warily, neuer so ciuily, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so sincerely, we haue ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
enow to espy out our
secretest actions, to heare our
most priuate speech: for in
the most godly little sinnes
seeme great, and are soone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered;
and great sinnes in
the wicked sÃ©eme no sinnes,
therefore haue the wicked
few enemies whom they
feare to sÃ©e their waies, but
the godly many. It is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to a wicked man to bÃ©e
wicked, it is his profession:
as it is no blemish to the
beauty of an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> to be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13661:164"/>
blacke, it is his naturall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
and therefore as long
as none but wicked men
scandalize vs and condemne
vs, we nÃ©ed not be ashamed;
no, though they raile, reuile
and curse vs, wee nÃ©ed not
feare it, for in stead of their
curses God will blesse vs:
yet let vs pray, <hi>Teach me, O

vnto such as feare
God, and they indÃ©ed cannot
slÃ©epe vntill they haue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
some mischiefe against
the innocent whom they

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:13661:165"/>
occasions and aduantages to
worke them any violence;
though they be already affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
they will afflict them
more; if they bee already fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
they will euen tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to kÃ©epe them downe
that they may not rise. It is
their glory if they can adde
more sorrow to the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and more griefe to the
grieued; they are continually
trauelling with wickednes,
conceiuing mischiefe, but
they commonly bring forth a
lie; for the mischiefe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
intend to others fals in the
end vpon their owne heads,
and their cruelty vpon their
owne pates: they are snared
euen with the works of their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:13661:165"/>
owne hands, for God hath
euer, he doth, and euer will
preserue his owne from these
wicked men; though he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them somtimes bodily to
perish vnder their tyranny, it
is but to aggrauate the sins
of their persecutors, and the
sooner to bring his vnto their
finall glory. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
the most godly to bÃ©e
wary of their waies; for how
much the more godly, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and zealous they are in
walking with God, so much
the more malicious is Satan

We must endeuour to

from his precepts: <hi>This
is the way, walke in it.</hi>
Though it bee a strict way
and vnpleasant to a carnall
minde; it is a most swÃ©et and
comfortable way, a way that
leadeth here to happinesse,
and after to Heauen.</p>
               <p>There is another way, a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13661:167"/>
common high way, much
beaten by diuers passengers,
all carnall men traffike this
way, a very pleasant way,
wherein yet many haue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for a time, but they haue
found that as a man that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
too much hony, may sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
through the swÃ©etnesse of
it, so they were euen glutted
with the vanities that are
strewed in the way. It is a
way full of carnall content
indeed, but it is but short;
men are at their waies end
many times when they think
themselues not halfe way
there, and are grieued their
iourney is so soone done. But
when they come to the end of
the race, they suddenly finde
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13661:168"/>
a most fearefull gulph which
they cannot auoid; turne
backe againe they cannot as
ordinary trauellers often doe
when they haue mistaken
their way and take another;
but they that walke this high
and pleasant way must bÃ©e
enforced to stay, and to take
vp their hideous Inne, not
for a night as waifaring men
doe, but remaine there for
euer with the Deuill and his
Angels.</p>

                  <p>Thou hast set before vs a

to haue bÃ©ene much
troubled with enemies, and
yet sheweth in the second
verse of the same, that <hi>when
his enemies and his foes came
vpon him to eat vp his flesh,
they stumbled and fell.</hi> In
the third verse, hee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
such faith and confidence
in God, that <hi>though an Host
pitched against him, his heart
should not be afraid:</hi> Yet in
this twelfth verse, he sÃ©emeth
to feare againe, lest his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might yet preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and therefore
praieth, that <hi>God would not

vs, that when we thinke our

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:13661:173"/>
(as it were) out of the reach
of all enemies, not to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure:
for a reconciled enemy
may harbour secret mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
which although hÃ©e
will not for his counterfeit
promise sake, execute by his
owne publike violence; yet
he may suborne such secretly,
as may renew either the
open quarrell againe, or fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuse the innocent party.
And this as it sÃ©emeth did
<hi>Dauid</hi> finde: for when hÃ©e
thought all his enemies were
at peace with him, he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
some secret practises
against him, <hi>By false witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which were risen against
him,</hi> who accused him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
and procured him new,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:13661:174"/>
or moued his old Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
against him, which sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to afright him more,
than before an Host of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
could doe. For now hÃ©e
praieth, that God would not
giue him ouer to the lust of
them that before he feared
not; which sheweth, that a
second danger is more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
than a former: And
which also sheweth our too
much securitie, after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery
from a danger, as
though we nÃ©ed no more to
feare another to follow: But
if we obserue well the course
of the waies of wicked men,
we shal see, that they seldome
giue ouer to prosecute them
they once desired to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13661:174"/>
And God hath likewise
such an eie vnto his owne
children, that he will not haue
them idle; hee will exercise
them as long as they liue
heere; they must bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his crosses; they
must haue enemies as hee
had, they must suffer pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ignominy and disgrace
in the world as hee did:
Though he being Lord of all,
and could command all; hÃ©e

                  <hi>Saphira,</hi> haue spoken but the

should haue fallen dead at his

all, to teach vs that are

that is our master and Lord.
If they called him. <hi>Belsabub,</hi>
and he suffered them, why
should we take scorne to bÃ©e
despised, reproached, and ill
intreated, and our enemies
to insult ouer vs, and to haue
their lust fulfilled against vs,
euen to take away our liues?
We are but seruants, hÃ©e
was our Lord, yet he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and shall we thinke our

them that thus abused
him? We being culpable of a

and yet hath frÃ©ed vs from
the guilt and punishment of
all? Yet it behooueth vs to
pray as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: <hi>Giue mee
not ouer vnto the lust of mine
Aduersaries;</hi> For as there
were against Christ, so there
are false Witnesses risen vp
against vs, and such also as
speake cruelly: Cruell and
wicked men haue commonly
attending them, such as will
speake and practise what they
will haue them for gaine: if
they will haue them to accuse
any man falsly, they can coine
matter; This man said, <hi>If
they did destroy the Temple
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13661:176"/>
of Ierusalem which was made
with hands, he would build
it in three daies without
hands.</hi> Whereas indÃ©ed hÃ©e
said, that <hi>if they did destroy
the Temple of his body, hee
would raise it againe in three
daies,</hi> as he did. But by this
may be obserued the cunning
and subtilty of the Deuill,
that can and doth prompt his
wicked Instruments, how
they may peruert the words
and actions of the innocent,
to a sense cleane contrary to
their meaning, and make so
false a Glosse vpon it, as if it
were truth it selfe; and will
set such an audacious face
vpon it, as (if God deale not
with the falsly accused, as hÃ©e
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:13661:176"/>
did for the defence of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Susanna)</hi> they will haue
their lust of them. Such a
false witnesse was perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Ziba</hi> against <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Ionathan,
Sauls</hi> sonne, who accused him
most falsly to <hi>Dauid,</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him that <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>
went about to take from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
the kingdome, onely to
get <hi>Mephibosheths</hi> patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
as it is commonly the
end of all the testimonies
false witnesses giue, to gaine
outward reward thereby.
As the <hi>Iewes</hi> hired and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
false witnesses against
that most sanctified man <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>

               <p>It is a dangerous thing,

The accused seldome es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes,
vnlesse there be a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
to examine circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

things that God himselfe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth:
for of all men he is
the most dangerous; and
therefore no maruell, that
<hi>Dauid</hi> hauing such enemies
as made no conscience of

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> feared more false

of his enemies; who when
they came vpon him they
stumbled and fell; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was not dismaied if an

false combinations of

               <p>The tongue which God
made in the beginning good,

made the instrument of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13661:178"/>
and lies: For now in

are so estranged, as the one
vttereth what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other thinks
not, &amp; the other thinks what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other vtters not. The tongue
becomes an instrument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
which was made to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
the true meaning of
the heart: But where the
tongue speakes falsly, the
heart cannot be right; and
where the heart is corrupt,
the tongue cannot be sound.</p>
               <p>There was once a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of tongues; not of that
part which moueth to frame
the voice, for the tongue
it selfe remained as before it
was; but inforced to alter
the language: but now there
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:13661:178"/>
sÃ©emeth to be a confusion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene
the tongue and the
heart, which should be as
one: Both which being so
farre disioyned in consent
now, as it sÃ©emeth to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confusion of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
One knew not what
another said, when that one
language became so changed;
and who vnderstands now
what another speakes, when
he speakes what he meanes
not? How then can hee bee
truly vnderstood what hÃ©e
speakes? Men indÃ©ed are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
(as it were) false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses

when the tongue beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against the heart, and
the heart against the tongue.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:13661:179"/>
If then we become so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in our language,
when we call for one thing,
we bee offered another; all

                  <p>For thou hearest how
proudly, hatefully, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully
they speake against

But thou art a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

therefore (Lord) leaue me not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13661:181"/>
vnto their lust. Confirme my
faith in thee; powre thy grace
and holy spirit into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts of my soule, that I
sincerely seruing thee, may
either win their vnfained
friendship, or that thou wilt
preuent their malicious deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against me, and that I may
possesse mine owne in peace.
Although they now stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the open stage of the world,
and sound out the Trumpets
of their enuious and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
tongues of reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

proue them false witnesses

I cannot but confesse against

that I come short of some

                  <p>Lord, I am weake in

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13661:182"/>
but <hi>giue me not ouer to the lust

the cause of their hatred as

extenuating their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

what they haue done, and
what they intend thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,

                  <p>Rise vp therefore, O Lord,

<hi>There is no helpe for me in thee:</hi>
Yet Lord I dismay not, for

thine appointed time wilt lift

belongeth vnto thee, O

the bloudy and deceitful men.
But blessed and preserued shall

O Lord, let not mine enemies

him in deliuering him out of

O my soule</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi> in

that troubles and afflictions
euen to a faithfull man doe
at the first much disquiet his
heart, like as they that first
are committed to prison,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:13661:185"/>
they are much disquieted,
their hearts faint and are
much cast downe, vntill they
haue bÃ©ene for a time enured
to their restraint, and then
come by little and little to
themselues againe; so doe
they that vpon a sudden fall
into any affliction as <hi>Dauid</hi>
did, but hauing a little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that it is the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hee could then say vnto
his sad soule, <hi>Wait on God,

This sheweth the strong

who although his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
were so many and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy,
euen at the present, that
he was ready to faint vnder
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:13661:185"/>
them, yet hee waited with a
firme assurance, that the time
would come wherein hee
should reioyce againe and
praise God againe for his
helpe and certaine deliuery
which hee knew was not
farre off.</p>
               <p>This teacheth euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man in his afflictions
and troubles to repaire vnto
God in prayer, not to bÃ©e
daunted or dismaid, nor to
disquiet himselfe, but in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to possesse his soule,
waiting the time wherein
God hath appointed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

the Lords prouidence;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13661:186"/>
strugling and striuing by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

meanes hee may vse, and
those with faithfull prayer
vnto GOD to blesse the
meanes, for lawfull meanes
profit not, vnlesse they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
lawfully done, and that is
when and where God is
made, not onely a party, but
the principall in the meanes.
It was a very weake wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
that <hi>Dauid</hi> vsed against
<hi>Goliah,</hi> who was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed from the foot to the

small part of his whole body
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:13661:186"/>
vnarmed, and that was the
fore part of his head, but
God so directed the stone that
came out of his sling, that it
found that open way to cast
that monster of men to the
earth. If God had not added
strength to <hi>Dauids</hi> armes,
and by his prouidence carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the stone aright, <hi>Dauids</hi>
aime might haue failed the
marke; so whatsoeuer means
we vse, either in preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or easing our selues in
any kinde of affliction, if our
hearts be not seasoned with
faith in God, ioined with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
we may misse of our hope,
and so faint in the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our deliuery; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith <hi>Dauid, I should haue
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13661:187"/>
fainted except I had beleeued
to see the goodnesse of the
Lord.</hi> Except I had depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on his prouidence for my

and had taken hold and beene
assured of the true perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his promises to
ease me of mine afflictions,
I should haue sunke vnder
the burthen of my troubles.
God who is our Father is
goodnesse it selfe, of whom
and from whom wee obtaine
all things through faith in
his Sonne: <hi>by him we liue,
moue and haue our being;</hi>
and therefore there is none,
in whom or by whom wÃ©e
should sÃ©eke helpe in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
but in God alone. <hi>He is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:13661:187"/>
our hope and strength, and
helpe in troubles ready to bee
found:</hi> Therefore (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid)
I will neither faint nor
feare:</hi> and againe, <hi>my defence
is in God, who preserueth the
vpright in heart.</hi> He is God,
and none besides; he is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and none else; Why then
should we faint in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
Why should wee bee
daunted, though enemies rise
vp against vs? SÃ©eing this
God is our God, whose good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
helpe and deliuery (if
we belÃ©eue) we shall sÃ©e, and
our very enemies shall sÃ©e it
euen here, here in this vale of
misery amongst the sons of
men, he shall be our guide and
defence vnto death.</p>

UnbelÃ©efe is a most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
disease in the heart of
man, nothing succeedeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
vnto them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lÃ©eue
not in God: good things
vnto vnbelÃ©euers turne to
euill. As vnto a raw, crude, &amp;
a stomack ouercome with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
humors, the best
meat turnes to increase their
disease; so to an vnfaithfull
man all things worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the increase of Gods
iudgements against him. As
to the sonnes in law of <hi>Lot in

the Word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by <hi>Lot,</hi> for the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the City perished.
So the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to
whom God had promised to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:13661:188"/>
giue the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
in their iourney towards it,
did not onely not belÃ©eue the
Lord, but murmured against
him saying, <hi>Who shall giue
vs flesh to eat? would God we
had died in the land of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyt,
or in this Wildernesse:
would God wee were dead,
were it not better for vs to
turne into Aegypt?</hi> With
many such reproachful, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murous
&amp; faithlesse obiurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as well against God
himselfe as against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron:</hi> but for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
faintings &amp; murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
God answered their
impious desires to die, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in his heauy displeasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:13661:189"/>
The frailty of a faithlesse
man is great, he can beare
no troubles, hee can endure
no afflictions with any kinde
of patience, because hÃ©e hath
no true and sound vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of God and his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
He thinkes if he pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and by his naturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and meanes, can preuent
dangers and troubles, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them can vse sinister
meanes to ease them, hÃ©e as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes
it to his owne carnall
wisdome; but when that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth
not, but that hÃ©e is
pinched and dÃ©eply plunged
in distresses and miseries
which he cannot ease; then
hee begins to faint and to
murmur and cry, <hi>Who shall
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13661:189"/>
giue mee flesh to eat? How
shall I get mony to supply my
wants? Would God I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when I was young; would
God I were dead,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>The troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the wicked and the
godly differ not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew: the wicked may
bee poore, so may the most
godly: they may haue like
outward crosses and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but their bearing of
them is vnequall; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as before is said, faint
and fume, and murmur, and
grudge at euery small crosse
or affliction: and although
they heare the promises of
God, who is ready to helpe,
yet they belÃ©eue them not.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13661:190"/>
They can bee assured of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that hangs vpon Gods
promises: they would think,
and speake, and obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, as that Prince
in <hi>Samaria</hi> did, when <hi>Elisha</hi>
foretold from the mouth of
God plenty to that distressed
and besieged City: <hi>Though
the Lord</hi> (said hee) <hi>would
make windowes in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
could this come to passe?</hi>
So incredulous are men
without sound faith, that
once downe, they thinke they
shall neuer rise; once in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they shall neuer haue
ease: and this is the cause
that men sÃ©eming faithfull,
faint vnder their crosses, and
despaire in their afflictions:
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:13661:190"/>
but it is otherwise with the
truly faithfull indÃ©ed, who
know by the foretelling of
the Spirit of God in his
Word, that troubles attend
the godly as the shadow the
body; and therefore prepare
themselues before hand for
them, and reioyce in them, in
as much as they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
here of Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings:
So they are likewise
assured, that when his glory
shall appeare, they also shall
appeare with him in glory;
yet the most faithfull may
haue a kinde of fearefulnesse
and fainting for a time, but
not such as shall preuaile,
but they will soone ouercome
all such faithlesse qualmes by
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13661:191"/>
a liuely apprehension of
Gods ready helpe through
faith; and then they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dÃ©ed
say as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>I
should haue fainted except I
had beleeued to see the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Lord in the land
of the liuing.</hi> There is none
of himselfe so strong, but
when troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
come will faint if faith in
God faile them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His verse is a fit
and comfortable
conclusion of this
Psalme; shewing
herein that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
in all his troubles depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely on God; and by his
owne experience encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
himselfe and all other

and then, as he found they
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:13661:195"/>
shall finde, that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
faile nor forsake them
that truly trust in him.
Though <hi>Dauid</hi> say hÃ©ere,
<hi>Hope in the Lord;</hi> he speaks
not to the encouragement of
other men, excluding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
but rather stirreth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
his owne soule, his faith and
affections; as if hee should
haue said, <hi>O my soule, hope
in the Lord:</hi> Thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the goodnesse of the Lord
sufficiently in all thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
Thine enemies haue
not preuailed against thÃ©e:
Thy foes haue not had their
lust of thee; therefore as thou
hast heretofore hoped; so still
hope in the Lord, faint not,
but be strong; be not afraid
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:13661:196"/>
whatsoeuer befalleth thÃ©e, or
whosoeuer assaileth thÃ©e, be
not dismaied; for he that hath
hitherunto bÃ©ene thy helper
and refuge, will neuer leaue
thÃ©e nor forsake thÃ©e, if thou
hope in him and be strong in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ith. And though thou be in
danger, in trouble, and in
whatsoeuer affliction, and
sÃ©est no deliuery present;
trust in the Lord, and hÃ©e
will deliuer thÃ©e and comfort
thine heart: For if in trouble
and danger there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
deliuery, there were no
place for <hi>Hope;</hi> for Hope is
of things not sÃ©ene, not of
things presently enioyed.
Wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> exhorts
himselfe (as it were) and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:13661:196"/>
others to wait on God for
their deliuery out of their
miseries &amp; troubles, through
faith. <hi>Hope in the Lord, wait
on God with faithfull pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
Grudge not though
troubles arise, though crosses
come, and afflictions befall
thÃ©e; be strong, be constant,
take courage, murmur not,
fret not, disquiet not thy
selfe, but be strong, and trust
in the Lord.</p>
               <p>There are some, no doubt,
that can beare troubles,
nay fortures, with a sÃ©eming
inuincible patience in an ill
cause; carying themselues
with such a valorous force of
spirit, as if they had the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Quintessence of faith, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:13661:197"/>
an vndaunted hope; as wÃ©e
may reade of <hi>Reualiack, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thasar,</hi>
and other murtherers
of Kings. It is but a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
without true patience;
for without obedience to
Gods precepts, there is no
true religion; without true
religion, there can bee no
true faith; without true
faith, no true patience; and
therefore that patience that
is shewed in such, and like
capitall murtherers, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
constantly they may
sÃ©eme to endure their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it is but the delusion
Satan, that while they are
yet breathing, doth stand to
animate them to that sÃ©eming
patience, and resolution out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:13661:197"/>
which (the parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead) their consciences
shall neuer approue, but their
last gaspe shall carrie that
horror with it, that if it might
after outwardly appeare,
would manifestly testifie,
that as the cause for which
they suffered, was in it selfe
wicked, their punishments
legally and iustly deserued
and inflicted; their patience
would shew it selfe a kinde of
desperate running head-long
into their owne perdition:
Leauing then these men to
their owne Diabolicall
strength, let vs hope in the
Lord, let vs pray to become
strong in him, faithfull in
him, and truly patient in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:13661:198"/>
him in all our sufferings, for
there is no commendable suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for euill doing; and
therefore saith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to the faithfull: <hi>Let
none of you suffer as a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
or a theefe, &amp;c.</hi> But if any
man suffer as a Christian,
namely for Christs Gospels
sake, and for well doing, let
him not be ashamed, but let
him glorifie God in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
namely, that he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worthy to suffer for
the truth of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hope in the Lord;</hi> Here is
our confidence: <hi>Bee strong;</hi>
here is our constancy: <hi>And
he shall comfort thine heart;</hi>
Here is the end of <hi>Hope</hi> and
<hi>strength,</hi> comfort of the heart.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:13661:198"/>
Whosoeuer then hopeth of
helpe from any inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nay, from an Angell in
heauen, and excludes God;
or standeth vpon his owne
strength, wealth, wisdome,
friends, or worldly policy,
and thinketh by these, or any
of these to be freed from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
eased in troubles, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lÃ©eued
in want, exempting
God; nay, if hÃ©e take not the
counsell of God, by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his word and prayer;
his hope will proue but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and his strength as the
strength of a Bull-rush.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> bendeth his eies
from all these, to the loue,
power, and prouidence of
God, in whom and whose
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:13661:199"/>
aid he onely taketh for his
strength: assuring himselfe,
that he will not onely send
him outward relÃ©efe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his hope; but with
inward ioy and consolation
comfort his heart: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth he encourage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and others, to <hi>hope in
the Lord,</hi> and not in carnall
meanes: To bee strong in
faith in God, not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength
of humane aid. God must be
totally our hope &amp; strength,
or else he will be no part: for
a hope that is partly in God,
and partly in other meanes,
is not the hope that tieth the
promise of the true comfort,
but that hope that is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and made strong by
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:13661:199"/>
faith. To this hope is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
annexed, that when
dangers, enemies and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
beset a man round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
though he want things
necessary, though sicknesse
afflict him, though crosses
without and griefes within
doe oppresse him, though
friends saile him, and euery
thing sÃ©eme to goe against
him, and he be depriued of all
visible meanes to escape;
there remaineth yet <hi>hope
in the Lord</hi> to be patient, and
not to faint.</p>
               <p>This hope is the gift of
God: But there is a hope
that is common to carnall
men. They hope vpon some
probabilities sÃ©ene, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:13661:200"/>
As the hope of a son
for the inheritance of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or a friend, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vpon death to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them, and the like. This
is not that hope that <hi>Dauid</hi>
meanes, when he saies hope;
but a certaine kinde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
expectation of things
desired. But <hi>Dauids</hi> hope is
a sauing hope, necessarily
ioyned with saith and a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
waiting: For that which
we stedfastly belÃ©eue shall
come to passe; and in nothing
is the force of faith and hope
more sÃ©ene or felt, than in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and trials: For these
bring forth <hi>patience, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hope;</hi> which maketh the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13661:200"/>
godly to reioyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein is glory and no
shame: whereas in carnall
hope there is often shame
and seldome glory.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was so farre
from being ashamed of his
<hi>afflictions,</hi> as he gloried in
them, for the hopes sake
that is set before vs all, of a
most excellent issue, and end
of our hope; and as through
the holy Ghost, the God of
hope plentifully filled <hi>Paul</hi>
with ioy and strength, euen
in his afflictions, and with
peace in beleeuing the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whereby he abounded in
hope, that all his troubles,
trialls, and afflictions should
end with comfort; So let vs
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:13661:201"/>
pray vnto the same God of
hope to be filled with like
hope, that our afflictions may
likewise end in comfort;
which though we presently
possesse not, yet let vs with
that blessed Apostle, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
wait for it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pauls</hi> hope and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
aimed to heauenly, not
to earthly accomplishments;
not looking for the euent of
his hope in this life: How
then may his hope of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glory, and <hi>Dauids</hi> hope to
be defended and relÃ©eued here
in the land of the liuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre?
They may well stand
together: Euen as Christ by
healing of corporall diseases,
made men heauenly minded,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:13661:201"/>
and cleane by forgiuing their
sinnes; so <hi>Dauid</hi> praied not
so simply for corporall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,
but he praied also for
the light of the truth, that he
might dwell in the Temple
of God, for mercy, and the
like. And although <hi>Paul</hi> sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by his words to hope
onely for heauenly glory, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
for this life were
necessarily included. He that
duly and truly praies for
heauenly, cannot be frustrate
of earthly: and he that praies
faithfully for earthly, cannot
but therewith ioyne heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blessings; for true and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
hope includes both. He
therefore that through faith
in Christ doth hope in the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:13661:202"/>
Lord, and becommeth strong
in him: Hee will comfort
his heart with the supply
both of heauenly and earthly
blessings. As it is lawfull for
vs to pray vnto God for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
necessaries; so are wÃ©e
bound to hope and wait for
them. Without hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<hi>Dauid</hi> would neuer
haue entred the combat with
<hi>Goliah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WÃ©e must therefore hope
in the Lord and bee strong,
trusting in God, and our
hearts shall bee comforted.
We may not looke backe or
about vs for helpe, our helpe
commeth from heauen; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must we not hope, and
hope a hope partly from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:13661:202"/>
and partly from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath;
but our hope must bÃ©e
in God alone: yet not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
or despise the inferior
meanes that God vseth here
below, as his Instruments
for our good; in whom wÃ©e
may haue a kinde of hope, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> had in <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that
he would deale faithfully
with him in the matter of
<hi>Saul</hi> his father: so may wÃ©e
hope in man: but our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
must be in God alone.</p>
               <p>What God hath promised
in his Word, he will assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
performe to them
that truly belÃ©eue. And that
did <hi>Dauid</hi> finde, euen when
the Crowne was like to bÃ©e
taken from his head: Hee
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:13661:203"/>
fainted not, but held fast by
the accustomed loue and help
of God, and became strong in
faith, euen when his enemies
were in their fiercest fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. He waited still,
vsing little or no other resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
against his enemies,
than feruent praier to God,
and his counsell: and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
in patience was not
in vaine; for the Lord sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
his enemies without
the great force of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and
thereupon he tooke courage,
he hoped in the Lord, he was
strong in faith, and the Lord
did comfort his heart.</p>
               <p>He sought not as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
doe, sinister and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
meanes to be deliuered:
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:13661:203"/>
For when <hi>Saul</hi> his mortall
enemy pursued him with
deadly malice to take away
his life; yet when <hi>Saul</hi> fell
into his hands, and had him
twice in his power, and
might haue ended the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
and frÃ©ed himselfe of
danger, he would not doe it,
no, though he might haue
made present way for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the kingdome, whose
it was after <hi>Saul:</hi> yet neither
his owne perill wherein hÃ©e
daily stood, through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> nor his
owne future right to the
Crowne could moue him to
touch the Lords anointed;
contrary to the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ambitious men, both of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:13661:204"/>
former and latter ages, who
are loth to let slip any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
offered, be it neuer so
vniust, to aduance their
greatnesse. But <hi>Dauid</hi> staid
himselfe vpon hope, that God
who had so often deliuered
him, would still doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any vnlawfull meanes of
his owne, and in his time
appointed would aduance
him as he had promised, and
therefore waited the time
with patience, comforting
his heart in the middest of his
dangers. And long it was
not before he came lawfully
to that which before he might
and would not, because hÃ©e
hoped in God whom he knew
he should haue offended, if he
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:13661:204"/>
had taken the counsel of some
that aduised him.</p>
               <p>There is no hope to that
hope whereunto <hi>Dauid</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
himselfe &amp; others,
no strength to that strength:
and no mans heart can bÃ©e
truly comforted, but by the
comfort wherewith he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
his heart was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
therefore chÃ©ereth he vp
his owne soule with this holy
resolution, to hope in the
Lord, with this heauenly
strength, to be strong in the
Lord, and with that comfort
wherewith he was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Lord. There is
a hope that is vaine, a
strength that is weake, and
a comfort that is but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:13661:205"/>
Let vs then take hold
of that hope, &amp; that strength,
and that comfort that is of
God, and trust in him: So
shall we not nÃ©ed to be afraid
of enemies, to faint in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but shall be sure to
finde comfort in all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>that hope
that is deferred, is the fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the heart;</hi> but that
is but to the faint-hearted:
For if we wait not, it is no
hope; but if we abide with
patience Gods appointed
time, we shall enioy what we
hope for: And <hi>when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
commeth it is a tree of
life.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing often
gathered the fruit of this
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:13661:205"/>
trÃ©e, and fed thereon when he
fainted, he giues here of the
same fruit to others; <hi>Hope</hi>
(saith he) <hi>in the Lord, bee
strong,</hi> be not faint-hearted,
though <hi>hope</hi> be deferred: for
comming the thing we hope
for will tarry no longer than
a conuenient time, and then
it will comfort the heart.
<hi>Hope</hi> groweth strong, by the
effects of Gods goodnesse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
hoped for, and had:
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth,
encouraging the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
as <hi>Dauid</hi> did himselfe and
others, <hi>To hope, to be strong,</hi>
to <hi>trust in the Lord,</hi> and to
<hi>lay hold vpon the hope that is
set before vs, which hope we
haue as an anker of the soule,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:13661:206"/>
sure and stedfast.</hi> And this is
the <hi>comfort of the heart</hi> that
<hi>Dauid</hi> meaneth, euen our
faith in God, whereby wÃ©e
take hold of the assured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his promises, not
onely of temporall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but of spirituall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
blessings: And the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
waiting for them is our
<hi>Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How then can it bee, that
God who hath promised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the faithfull the life to
come, that with patience in
hope wait for it vnder the
crosse, should not consider &amp;
regard their dangers, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
afflictions, euen in this
life? For <hi>if he haue giuen his
Sonne to die for our sinnes,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:13661:206"/>
how should he not with him
giue vs all things to enioy?</hi>
Though wÃ©e must wait his
time<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he is not slacke as some
men count slacknesse, but is
alwaies ready and at hand;
he that hath promised, hee is
faithfull and true. Though
the vnfaithfull will not take
his word, not his hand, not
his oath; the faithfull know
and are assured, that <hi>he will
neuer faile them, nor forsake
them;</hi> Therefore <hi>hope in the

comfort thine heart: And
trust in the Lord.</hi>

Thou who art the God

                  <p>My sinnes, O Lord, I doe

                  <p>O let me not faint vnder thy

let mee euermore taste of thy

this thy mercy, O Lord, I

                  <p>Alas, good Father, such hath
beene the neglect of my duty

                  <p>Lord, what shall I say to
excuse me? What shall I bring
vnto thee to appease thee? If
I say the corruption of mine

and I did sinne; thou hast

the deeds of my corrupt flesh

therefore, Father, I cannot

This, this, O Lord, is the
gaine that my sinnes haue
gotten, not onely a dissolution

who hath power, Lord, by
his owne corrupt nature to
repent? By nature, Lord, I
sinne: How can I by the same
sinfull part, repent of that
wherein nature it selfe deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth?
A fountaine bringeth
not forth bitter water and
sweet: How then Lord can I
bring forth true repentance
out of a corrupt heart, as it is
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:13661:220"/>
corrupt? Yet Lord, though
my heart bee corrupt by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being made in part sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and holy by thy grace, it
shall so farre forth worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
as is thy grace pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull

that though sinne by nature

                  <p>Therefore, good Father, as
<hi>Esau</hi> the elder, gaue place and
became seruant to <hi>Iaakob:</hi> So
let sinne, which is in me the
first borne, giue place in mee
vnto sanctity: And let sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
haue the sole dominion in
my heart, then shall my heart
bring forth the good fruits of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:13661:220"/>
a godly life: though while I
liue here, the weeds of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
will also grow; but
Lord, let them not ouergrow
the good seed of thy spirit: but
let them wither and die before
they grow vp to beare any
fruit vnto death. But feed me
now at the last with the most
wholesome fruits of thy spirit,
and giue me grace to expresse
my sorrow for my sins that I
haue done with an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
heart, grieued that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I contriued sin in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  <p>Lord see and behold my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for my sins, if it bring not

it so with thy mollifying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:13661:221"/>
that it may worke in mee
that which may testifie that I

although while I carrie about

my best exercises cannot but
sauour of the fountaine from
whence they flow; if of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
corruptly; if of thy

                  <p>O season therefore my
heart, O Lord, my soule and
whole man with thy spirit,
that whatsoeuer I thinke,
speake, or doe, may sauour
from aboue, that I may feele in
my heart and soule a true and
liuely detestation of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
sauoureth of the loue of

the pride of life.</p>
                  <p>Giue me strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
all perfect obedience in
all righteousnesse, euen to the

obedience, which is also
thy gift: for none by his owne
power can thinke a good
thought, much lesse Lord,
worke any thing pleasing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, but the contrary:
therefore disclaime I all mine
owne merit, and cleaue onely
vnto thy mercy in Iesus
Christ; Humbly beseeching
thee for his sake to take
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:13661:224"/>
charge of me this day: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the malicious intentions
of Satan and his ministers:
mortifie mine owne sinfull
affections, and infuse into my
heart all diuine graces, that my
waies this day may nothing
sauour of sinne, but of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And as I haue by thee safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passed this night; so I may
begin, continue and end this
day, and all the daies of my
life, in thy faith, feare, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
And that in all
mine actions whereunto I am
bound by my place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
I may so walke and so
performe them, as that thy
blessing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> may accompany

me Lord an vpright heart, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:13661:224"/>
and let me euer receiue
counsell from thee, to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in whatsoeuer I purpose:
that so prospering, the glory
may bee thine, to whom all
power, wisdome, strength,
and glory belongeth, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>LOrd, as it hath now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thee to bring mee in
safetie to the end of this day,
and hast therein by many
blessings testified thy fatherly
care ouer me: so let my heart
within me through faith, and
faithfull obedience, testifie
mine vnfained thankfulnesse
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:13661:225"/>
to thee. The light of this day
hath afforded vnto mee that
benefit which the darknesse
of the night could not,
though to thee the day and
night are of equall light; for
with thee is no darknesse at
all. But to me, as I am blinde
by nature, the day and night
are of like darknesse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie:
though the light of
the day discouer visible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yet as long as the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the ignorance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things possesseth my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, I see not at all as I
ought to see: the light of the
day doth administer vnto my
corporall eies many outward
obiects, which often causeth
me inwardly to erre, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:13661:225"/>
to goe astray, as the
sinnes which I haue this day
committed, by the miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of mine eye may witnesse
against me. Forgiue it Lord
vnto me, and grant that the
light which thou hast created
good, turne not through my
corruption to thy dishonour
and my shame, but as the light
of the day is a most especiall
blessing to the good, to doe
good offices in this life; so let
me vse it to the doing of the
works of diuine light, not of
darknesse. Let it hence-forth
serue vnto mee as a Motiue to
the Contemplation of that
celestiall-light, that is neuer
ouershadowed with darknesse;
and to the obseruation of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:13661:226"/>
thine immensurable great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and power in creating
and preseruing of thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(visible) numberlesse.
Giue me grace, that I behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the infinite works of thy
hands, may with diuine mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
consider thy wisdome in
framing and disposing them;
thy deepe and vnfathomable
prouidence, in oftentimes
turning those things to the
comfort of those that are
thine, which their enemies
suppose and hope will tend to
their confusion. This also is
thy doing, maruellous in the
eies of such as either know
thee not, or that thinke all
things to come to passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy direction and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

Lord I haue this day found,
that thy wisdome hath dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
me, thy power hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
mee, and thy proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
guided me. And in thy
great mercy I haue finished
this day in safetie, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
many blessings at thy
hands; acknowledging yet
my selfe vnworthy of the
least of them, by reason that I
haue many waies offended
thee. Though I haue not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in my thoughts all my
sinnes, yet thou knowest
them: And if the righteous
man fall seuen times a day,
how often haue I that am all
corrupt, sinned this day?
None is so iust as sinneth
not, but he is blessed to whom
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:13661:227"/>
thou (O Lord) imputest it
not.</p>
                  <p>Sinners couet secrecy, they
hate to be seene, but loue the
sinne: darknesse is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and the night is as a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
to hide them in conceit,
when thou, O God, seest their
actions in the darke as at
noone day. O preserue mee
in thy light, Lord, and grant
I neuer couet to doe that in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
whereof I should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to commit it openly:
and euen this night now
come vpon mee, vouchsafe
Lord to ouerspread the bright
beames of thine all shining
light ouer me that sinne enter
not into my heart in the
darknesse of the same. And
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:13661:227"/>
let me make my night wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
as interims gained for
Meditation and Praier; And
that I may spend the intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of my sleepe in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my selfe to my finall rest:
That through thy power and
prouidence, I may rest safely
this night, free from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of soule and body: And
that rising againe in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I may not bee forgetfull
to giue thee the glory. And as
the night succeedeth the day,
and the day the night; so let
my faithfull praiers succeed
holy Meditation, and a holy
endeuour to worke righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
succeed my faithfull pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
                  <p>Let thine eares be open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

preuent whatsoeuer
mischiefe, Satan, or any mine

plot, practise, or endeuour to
execute against me: In hope
whereof, I doe commit and

concerneth me, into thy most

thine alone beloued. To
