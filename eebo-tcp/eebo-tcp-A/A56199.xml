            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the <hi>Archbishop</hi> himselfe, and his <hi>Servants,</hi> have confessed the <hi>verity,
reality</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Papers</hi> to divers who repaired to them for their own resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Fourthly, (which puts all out of question) had these <hi>Letters, Papers</hi> been <hi>Forgeries,</hi>
or <hi>Impostures,</hi> not reall <hi>verities,</hi> his Majesty himselfe, or the <hi>Oxford Mercury</hi> for him;
at least the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> Sir <hi>William Boswell, Andreas ab Habernfeld,</hi> or some of their
Instruments, being all living, and the Presses open; would long ere this have detected
this forgery, and disclaimed these Papers and Letters in Print: which neither of them
have done in seven Months space; whereas each of them on the contrary (as I am
informed) have avouched these severall Letters, Papers to be genuine, and their own.</p>
            <p>Finally, it had been a strange <hi>over-sight,</hi> yea <hi>madnesse</hi> in my self, and a great <hi>dishonour</hi>
to, a most <hi>impolitique devise</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to publish forged <hi>Letters</hi> in these emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

with other <hi>Remonstrances</hi> of that nature, most visibly appearing in the late

being unexpectedly commanded on that service) and then they must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it an indubitable verity; Since Sir <hi>William Boswell,</hi> the Archbishop himselfe,
if not his Majesty, and those who revealed this Plot, were perswaded of its reality
upon the first <hi>Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>overy,</hi> before it brake forth openly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who and what the Authour of this <hi>Discovery</hi> was; who the chiefe active instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Plot; when, and where they assembled; in what vigorous manner they
daily prosecuted it; how effectually they proceeded in it; how difficult it is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
or counter-work it, without speciall diligence, the Relation it selfe will best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.
Whose verity if any question, these Reasons will inforce beliefe:</p>
            <p>First, That the Discoverer was a chiefe Actor in this Plot, sent hither from <hi>Rome</hi>
by <hi>Cardinall Barbarino;</hi> to assist <hi>Con</hi> the Popes Legate in the pursute of it, and privy
to all the particulars therein discovered.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the horrour and reality of the conspiracy so troubled his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as it ingaged him to disclose it, yea to renounce that bloody Church and
Religion, which contrived it; though bred up in, preferred by it, and promised
greater advancements for his deligence in this designe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That he discovered it under an Oath of Secrecy, and offered to confirme
every particular by solemne Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94126:5"/>
Fourthly, That hee discovers the persons principally imployed in this Plot, the
places and times of their secret conventions; their manner and diligence in the
purs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ite of it, with all other circumstance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so punctually, as leaves no place for
doubt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The principall Conspirators nominated by him are notoriously known to
be fit instruments for such a wicked design.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Many particulars therein have immediate relation to the King and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
to whom he imparted this Discovery, and it had been an impudent boldnesse
and irrationall, frentick act, to reveale any thing for truth to the King and Bishop,
which they could disprove on their own knowledge.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Sir <hi>William Boswell,</hi> and the Archbishop, if not the King himselfe, were
fully satisfied, that it was reall and most important.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Some particulars are ratified by the Arch-bishops testimony, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
of his own life, written with his own hand some yeares before; and others
so apparent, that most intelligent men in Court and City, were acquainted with
them whiles they were acting, though ignorant of the plot.</p>
            <p>Finally, The late sad effects of this Conspiracy in all three Kingdomes, in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of this design, compared with it, are such a convincing evidence of its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and Gods admirable hand of Providence in bringing this concealed plot so sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
to light, (by an instrument unexpectedly raised from the grave of Exile and
imprisonment, to search the Arch-bishops papers, in the Tower, who had there seised
his in former times, and shut him up close prisoner in a Forraine Dungeon) such a
testimony from Heaven super-added to the premises, that hee who deemes it an
<hi>imposture,</hi> may well be reputed an <hi>Infidell,</hi> if not a <hi>Monster of incredulity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first overture and larger Relation of the plot it selfe were both writ in <hi>Latin,</hi>
as they are here Printed, and faithfully translated word for word, as neare as the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

            <p>THe offers (whereof your Grace will finde a Copy) here inclosed towards
a further and more particular discovery, were first made unto me at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hand, and in speech, by a friend of good quality and worth in this
place; But soone after (as soone as they could be put into Order) were
avowed by the principall party; and delivered me in writing by both together: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
promise, and Oath, which I was required to give, and gave accordingly, not to
reveale the same to any other man living but your Grace; and by your Graces hand,
unto his Majesty.</p>
            <p>In like manner they have tyed themselves not to declare these things unto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but my selfe; untill they should know, how his Majesty and your Grace
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94126:5"/>
would dispose thereof. The Principall giving me withall to know, That hee puts
himselfe, and this secret into your Graces power, as well because it concernes your
Grace so nearely after his Majesty: As that he knowes your wisdome to guide the
same aright: And is assured of your Graces fidelity to his Majesties Person, to our
State, and to our Church.</p>
            <p>First, Your Grace is humbly, and earnestly prayed, To signifie his Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
(with all possible speed) together with your Graces disposition herein, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to carry all with silence, from all, but his Majesty untill due time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When your Grace shall think fit to shew these things unto his Majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
To doe it immediately; not trusting to Letters; nor permitting any other person to
be by, or in hearing: And to entreat and counsell his Majesty as in a case of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to keep the same wholly, and solely in his own bosome, from the knowledge of
all other creatures living but your Grace; untill the businesse shall be cleare, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
in his Majesties and your Graces hands to effect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Not to enqure or demand the names of the parties from whom these
overtures doe come, or any further discoveries and advertisements in pursute of them
which shall come hereafter, untill due satisfaction shall be given in every part of them.
Nor to bewray unto any person but his Majesty, in any measure or kinde, that any
thing of this nature, or of any great importance is come from me.</p>
            <p>For as I may believe these overtures are verifiable in the way they will be layed;
and that the parties will not shrink: So I may accompt, That if never so little a
glimpse, or shadow of these informations shall appeare by his Majesties, or your
Graces speech or carriage, unto others, the meanes whereby the businesse may bee
brought best unto tryall, will bee utterly disappointed: And the parties who have
in Conscience towards God, and devotion to his Majesty; affection to your Grace,
and compassion of our Countrey, disclosed these things, will runne a present and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
hazard of their persons, and lives, So easily it will be conjectured (upon the
least occasion given upon his Majesties or your Graces parts) who is the discoverer?
By what meanes, and how he knowes so much of these things; And where he is?
These are the points, which together with the offers, they have pressed me especially
to represent most seriously unto your Grace.</p>
            <p>For my own particular, having most humbly craved pardon of any errour or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
that have befalne me in the mesnaging of this businesse, I doe beseech your

            <p>First, Whether, and in what order I shall proceed hereafter with the parties?</p>
            <p>Secondly, What points of these offers I shall chiefly, and first put them to enlarge
and cleare?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What other points and enquiries I shall propose unto them? And in
what manner?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94126:6"/>
Fourthly, How farre further I shall suffer my selfe to heare and know these things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Whether I shall not rather take the parties answers, and discoveries sealed
up by themselves, and having likewise put my owne seale upon them, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
or seeing what they containe, so to transmit them to his Majesty or your
Grace?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Whether I may not insinuate upon some faire occasion, That there will
be a due Regard held of them, and their service, by his Majesty and your Grace:
When all particulars undertaken in these generall offers, and necessary for perfecting
the discovery and work intended, shall be effectually delivered to his Majesty on
your Grace?</p>
            <p>Upon these heads, and such others as his Majesty or your Grace shall think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in the businesse, I must with all humility beseech your Grace to furnish me with
instructions, and warrant for my proceedings, under his Majesties hand with your
Graces attestation, as by his Majesties goodnesse, and Royall disposition is usuall in
like cases.</p>
            <p>May it please your Grace to entertaine a Cypher with me upon this occasion, I
have sent the Counterpart of one here inclosed: In the vacant spaces whereof your
Grace may insert such names more, with numbers to them, as you think requisite.</p>
            <p>If these overtures happily sort with his Majesties and your Graces minde, and shall
accordingly prove effectuall in their operation, I shall think my selfe a most happy
man, to have had my oblation in so pious a work for my most gratious Soveraign
and Master: More particularly, in that your Grace under his Majesty shall be, <hi>Opifex
rerum &amp; mundi melioris origo.</hi> Which I shall incessantly begge in my prayers at his
hands, who is the giver of all good things, And will never forsake, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who doe not first faile, and fall from him: The God of mercy and Peace. With
which I remaine evermore.</p>

Lord,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>AL my senses are shaken together as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as I revolve the present businesse,
neither doth my understanding suffice (to
conceive) what wind hath brought such
horrid things, that they should see the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
by me: for besides expectation this good
man became known unto me, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had
heard me discoursing of these Scottish stirs,
said that I knew not the nerve of the business,
that those things which are commonly scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroad are superficial: From that hour
he every day became more familiar to me;
who acknowledging my dexterity herein, with
a full brest powred forth the burdens of his
heart into my besome, supposing that he had
discharged a burden of conscience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was pressed. Hence he related to me
the Factions of the Iesuites, with which the
whole earthly world was assaulted; and
shewed, that I might behold how through
their poyson, Bohemia &amp; Germany were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
&amp; both of them maimed with an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable
wound; that the same Plague did
creep through the Realmes of England and
Scotland, the matter wherof revealed in the
adjacent writing, he discovered to me: which
things having heard<note n="*" place="margin">If a stranger were thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the hearing of this Plot, how should we our selves be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof?</note> my bowels were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
together, my loyns trembled with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that a pernicious gulf should be prepared
for so many thousands of soules: with words
moving the conscience, I inflamed the minde
of the man: he had scarce one hour concocted
my admonitions, but he disclosed all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94126:7"/>
and he gave free liberty that I should
treat with those whom it concerned, that they
might be informed hereof. I thought no delay
was to be made about the things: The same
houre I went to Master Boswell the Kings
Leger at the Hage, who being tied with an
oath of secrecie to me, I communicated the
businesse to him, I admonished him to weigh
these things by the ballance, neither to defer,
but act, that those who were in danger might
be speedily succoured: He, as becomes an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, mindfull of his duty, and having
nearer looked into the businesse, refused not
to obey the monitions: moreover, he forthwith
caused that an expresse should be dispatched;
and sent word back again what a most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
oblation this had been to the King and
your Grace; for which we rejoyced from the
heart, and we judged, that a safe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Deity had interposed it selfe in this
businesse, whereby you might be preserved.</p>
                     <p>Now that the verity of the things related
might be confirmed, some principall heads
of the conspiracy were purposely pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the knowledge of them might bee

                        </gap>rted from the circumvented society of
the conspirators.</p>
                     <p>Now the things will be speedily and safely
promoted into act, if they be warily proceeded
in at Bruxels. By my advise, that day should
be observed wherin the Packet of Letters are
dispatched, which under the title of, To
Monsieur Strario Archdeacon of Cambray,
tied with one cover are delivered to the post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
such a packet may be secretly brought
back from him, yet it will be unprofitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all the inclosed Letters are written
Characteristically. Likewise another Packet
comming weekly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, which is brought
under this subscription, To the most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lord Count Rossetti, Legat for the time;
these are not to be neglected: to whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Letters writ in the same Character are
included. That they may be understood, Reade
is to be consulted with. The forenamed day
of dispatch shal be expected: In Reades house
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94126:7"/>
an accumulated congregation may be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented;
which succeeding, it will be
your Graces part to order the businesse.
The intestine enemy being at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by Gods grace, all bitternesse of
minde which is caused on either side may
be abolished, delivered to oblivion, deleted

            <p>THe Relation of this horrid plot by a chiefe Actor in it, (with which the
Arch-Prelate acquainted the King, not many daies before this Parliament
began) lay concealed among the Arch-bishops papers, without any prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the conspirators (for ought appeares) who are since dispersed in
part by the Parliament, but neither dissolved nor taken off this plot, but become
more active in its prosecution, putting forth their last and utmost endeavours in all
places, to accomplish this their designe, which they have almost brought to maturity
to our shame and grief, by new raysed civill wars both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things in this plot, which concerne the Arch-bishop, may perchance seem

            <p>First; <hi>That the Popes Legat should presume to tempt the Archbishop with the offer of

and that he <hi>acquainted the King with it;</hi> not by way of complaint to crave justice

and his second consultation with the King concerning it, insinuates, that
the <hi>King rather inclined to, then against it,</hi> or at leastwise <hi>left it arbitrary to him
to accept or reject it as he best liked.</hi> As for his lukewarme severity in prosecuting
Papists, it appeares most lively by his <hi>Epistle to the King</hi> before his <hi>Conference</hi> with

<hi>God forbid that I should perswade a persecution in any kind, or practise it in the least</hi>

            <p>The second thing which may seeme strange to others, disaffected to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this;

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> forraigne Protestant States may receive full satisfaction.</p>
            <p>First, that there hath been a most cunning, strong, execrable conspiracie
long since contrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and for divers yeeres together most vigorously pursued
in <hi>England</hi> with all industry, policy, subtilty, engines, by many active, potent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
of all sorts, all sexes, to undermine the Protestant Religion, re-establish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and alter the very frame of civill government in all the Kings Dominions;
wherein a most dangerous visible progresse hath been lately made.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That to effect this traiterous designe, they have not onely secretly ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
some Monasteries of <hi>Monkes, Nunnes,</hi> in and about <hi>London;</hi> but sent over hither
whole Regiments of most active subtill <hi>Iesuits,</hi> incorporated into a particular new

Since which, this <hi>conjured society</hi> increasing in strength and number, secretly replanted
themselves in <hi>Queens-street</hi> and <hi>Long-acre,</hi> and their purses are now so strong, their
hopes so elevated, their designes so ripened, as they have there purchased, founded
a new <hi>magnificent Colledge</hi> of their owne for their habitation, neere the fairest build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

was here admitted without any such cautionary Oath, which would have crossed

            <p>Yea, whereas by<note n="*" place="margin">23. Eliz. c. 1. 35. Eliz. c. 1. 3. Iac. c. 3. 4, 5.</note> the Statutes of the Realm, it is made no lesse <hi>then high Treason

set footing in</hi> England, <hi>or any the Kings Dominions, to seduce any of his Subjects to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and Popish Recusants</hi> (much lesse then Priests, Jesuits, &amp; Legats) <hi>ought not to remain

Yet notwithstanding, this <hi>Popes Legate,</hi> and his confederates, have not only kept re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for divers yeeres, in or neer <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Court,</hi> and enjoyed free liberty
(without disturbance, or any prosecution of the Lawes against them) to seduce his

but likewise had familiar accesse to, and conference with, the <hi>King himselfe,</hi>
(under the name, notion, authority of the <hi>Popes Legat</hi>) by all Arts, Policies, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            </p>
            <p>6. That the Popish party &amp; Conspirators, have lately usurped a soveraign power,

the very condition in the plot which the King must condescend to, ere the Papists

done many thousands of them already. And then upon all these sad, most serious
considerations (the very thoughts whereof should cause their soules to bleed and
tremble) speedily to desert these trayterous Papists, ere they get all into their power,
and unite all their heads, hearts, hands, forces to the Parliaments party, who had so
