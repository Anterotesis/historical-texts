            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But I hope their Behaviour for the future, will ſufficiently clear them from ſuch an imputation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore apply my ſelf only to thoſe that do ſtill forbear our Communion; and offer ſomething very briefly, which I conceive may be uſeful for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their moſt known and ordinary Doubts; that as we do all profeſs the ſame Faith, we may all agree in the ſame way of Diſcipline, and Worſhip; and all become peaceable and orderly Members of the ſame Church. And for the obtaining this moſt Excellent end, Firſt, I ſhall deſire them impartially to conſider of ſome things that may incline them to be Peaceably minded, and tend to the removing of the general Prejudices they have unhappily conceived againſt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Then I ſhall endeavour to give what ſatisfaction I can to the chief <hi>Objections</hi> againſt us, which they are wont to urge in Defence of the preſent <hi>Separation.</hi> And laſtly, I ſhall exhort them to a brotherly <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> upon ſuch Motives and Arguments as the Goſpel ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, and make for the Credit and Safety of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>The things that I would commend to their ſerious Conſideration, which may ſerve to diſpoſe them to <hi>Peace,</hi> and to remove the <hi>Prejudices</hi> they have taken up, are ſuch as theſe. In the firſt place, they ſhould be very careful that it be not any <hi>ſiniſter</hi> end, or corrupt <hi>Paſſion,</hi> that did either engage them in the <hi>Separation</hi> at the beginning, or provokes them now to continue in it. I do not mention this becauſe I know any one of our Diſſenting Brethren to be guilty of it; but becauſe it muſt be confeſſed that mens minds are too often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94492:5"/>
by their carnal <hi>Intereſts</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> Theſe will be always mixing themſelves in all their Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; theſe do commonly blind and pervert their Judgments, and lead them into ten thouſand Errours. Theſe are the occaſion that Fancy ſometimes paſſes for Conſcience; that Melancholy Fumes are admired for Divine Inſpirations; and that the overflowing of our Gall is looked upon as pure Zeal. Theſe and the like are very dangerous and uſual Miſtakes, that do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proceed from the prevalency of our <hi>Paſſions.</hi> If therefore we do divide from a Church, it will moſt highly concern us to be very Cautious, that we be not acted by any ſuch Principle. For if we hope to Gain, and grow Rich by our Departure; if we are Aſhamed, or Scorn to retract the Opinions we have once Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; if we imagine we have more <hi>Light</hi> than the firſt Reformers, when indeed we are very Ignorant; if we cannot endure to be Oppoſed in any thing; if we Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and Repine at our Governours, when they require our Obedience where we are unwilling to pay it; theſe are ſigns that our <hi>Affections</hi> are turbulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly; and while we are thus diſpoſed, we can never be aſſured but that Covetouſneſs, Pride, and Impatience, might be the greateſt Motives that induced us to make a <hi>Separation,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt Arguments that we have to maintain it. But I cannot charge our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with theſe things; I believe that many of them may be Upright and Sincere in their Intentions. But becauſe they are all in the ſame eſtate of Degeneracy and Corruption which others are, I would intreat them to be very careful that they be never led away by theſe, or the like temptations; but that they would always labour to preſerve thoſe holy Diſpoſitions of Integrity, Meekneſs, Humility and Condeſcenſion, which are the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94492:5"/>
beſt Preparatives to the <hi>receiving of the Truth in the Love of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After they have thus freed their minds from all irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Deſigns,</hi> it would conduce exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the PEACE of the Church, if they would be ſure to expreſs their greateſt Care and Concern in the more <hi>Weighty</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial</hi> things of Religion. This would prevent many of the Quarrels that do often ariſe in matters but of ſmall Importance. If real Holineſs and Piety be the thing that we aim at, then when we may be ſecured of this, we ſhould not be ſo very forward to enter upon fierce and endleſs Diſputes, about the external Modes and Circumſtances of Worſhip. If I may ſerve God there in Spirit and in Truth, why ſhould a Gown, or a Cloak, or a Surplice fright me from the Church, when either of theſe is injoined by my Superiours? If I may be inſtructed in the way of Salvation and eternal Happineſs, why ſhould I forſake the Publick Aſſemblies, becauſe I am not allowed to join my ſelf to what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation I pleaſe; and had not an immediate hand in the choice of my Paſtor? When our hearts are bent upon the <hi>great</hi> things of Religion, we ſhall ſee but little Reaſon to be Contentious about matters of leſſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; a few indifferent Rites will ſcarce be able to tempt us to break off Communion with that Church, with which we are at perfect Agreement in all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Neceſſary points.</p>
            <p>The next thing that may tend to the promoting our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is the Conſideration of the heinous Nature and <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Schiſm;</hi> which is nothing elſe but the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> our ſelves from a True Church without any juſt Occaſion given. The want of due apprehenſions of the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> of this, ſeems to be the main Cauſe of our preſent Diviſions. Men are not generally ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible how much they do Oppoſe that Spirit of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94492:6"/>
               <hi>Peace,</hi> and brotherly Love, which ſhould diffuſe it ſelf through the whole Body of Chriſtian People, when they ſuppoſe every ſlender Pretence enough to juſtifie their departing from us, and ſetting up a Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Church. They think it a matter almoſt Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and that they are left to their own Choice to join with what Society of Chriſtians they pleaſe themſelves. Which giddy Principle, if it ſhould prevail, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw us into an abſolute Confuſion, and introduce all the Errours and Miſchiefs that can be imagined. But our bleſſed Lord founded but One Univerſal Church; and when he was ready to be Crucified for us, and <hi>Prayed not for the Apoſtles alone, but for them alſo that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 17. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould believe in him through their word;</hi> one of the laſt Petitions which he then put up, amongſt divers others to the ſame purpoſe, was, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us, that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> This it is plain was to be a viſible <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that might be taken notice of in the World, and ſo become an inducement to move men to the embracing of the Chriſtian Faith. Therefore as we would avoid the hardening of men in Atheiſm and Infidelity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Prayer of our dying Saviour, as much as in us lies, wholly ineffectual; we ſhould be exceeding Cautious that we do not wilfully <hi>Divide</hi> his holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. We are often warned of this; and how many Arguments does St. <hi>Paul</hi> heap together to perſwade us to keep the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>of Peace? One Body, and one Spirit, even as you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in one hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all.</hi> And how patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally does the ſame Apoſtle exhort us again to the ſame thing, by all the mutual endearments that Chriſtianity aſſords; <hi>If there be therefore any Conſolation in Chriſt,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2.</note>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94492:6"/>
               <hi>if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies; fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi> Theſe vehement Exhortations to <hi>Peace</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, do ſtrictly oblige us to hold Communion with that Church which requires nothing that is Unlawful of us. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not admit us, unleſs we profeſs a belief of Tranſubſtantiation, and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and a certain kind of Infallibility, no body knows where; unleſs we will worſhip the Hoſt, and Saints, and Images, and do many other things directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God: We cannot therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with her, unleſs we ſhould partake of her groſs and ſuperſtitious Errours. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not exact any thing from us that God has forbidden; therefore we may Communicate with her without Sin; and if we may, it muſt be a Sin in us if we do not do it. Certain it is that every cauſleſs <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is a very great one; ſo great, that ſome of the Antients have thought it is not to be expiated by the Blood of Martyrdom; and I know no Cauſe ſufficient to defend our leaving a Communion, but a neceſſity of being involved in <hi>Sin,</hi> if we ſhould remain in it. Now ſince it muſt be confeſſed that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a very grievous <hi>Sin;</hi> we had need be well aſſured that we have juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it, before we withdraw from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Church; and if we have raſhly withdrawn, we are bound to return without delay.</p>
            <p>Then we may conſider farther that all Chriſtians are <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This will appear from that paſſionate Intreaty and Admonition which the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gave the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when they were in danger of being rent into ſeveral Factions, upon miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

A Church that has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly rejected all the Errours and Corruptions of <hi>Rome;</hi> that admits of neither their Infallibility, nor Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; that allows no Purgatory, nor Indulgences, no adoration of Reliques, and Images, no Praying to Saints nor Angels; that does not think that God can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with idle Pilgrimages, or a forced Celibacy, or any ſet number of <hi>Ave</hi>'s and <hi>Pater noſter</hi>'s, or other formal Devotions exactly computed upon a ſtring of Beads, and muttered over in an unknown Tongue; that does not rob the Laity of half the Communion, nor teach them that ſtrange and contradictious Doctrine that the Elements are tranſubſtantiated into the real Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Lord's Supper; that does not only conſtantly deny theſe, and many more abſurd and erroneous Opinions of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but has always ſent forth as ſtout and able Champions to oppoſe them, as any the Chriſtian World affords. A Church whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is confeſſed to be Orthodox by the generality of our Diſſenting Brethren, and whoſe Diſcipline and Order of external Worſhip has nothing in it repugnant to any Law of God. And what imaginable ground can there then be to juſtifie a <hi>Separation</hi> from ſuch a Church? Certainly the uſe of a few Indifferent things, appointed only for Order's ſake, will not be enough to do it. Theſe are not Forbidden, and therefore cannot be Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves; and where God has not Forbidden, our Superiours may Command; and in all ſuch caſes we are bound to Obey.</p>
            <p>Some indeed there are that will not be ſatisfied with this. They tell us, that it is not ſufficient that a thing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94492:9"/>
be not <hi>Forbidden,</hi> but that it muſt be <hi>Commanded,</hi> or elſe it cannot be uſed in the Worſhip of God without Sin. But if this Opinion be true, I muſt confeſs that then it is Unlawful to hold Communion not only with ours, but with any Church that is, or ever was in the World; for I do not believe that One can be found amongſt them All, that has not required the uſe of ſome Indifferent thing that was not <hi>Commanded.</hi> Our Diſſenting Brethren themſelves will allow that the Time and Place of Religious Aſſemblies may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Authority. And if theſe neceſſary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be thus Determined, though they be not <hi>Commanded</hi> by God; then it will be as Lawful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what particular Geſtures and Habits ſhall be there uſed. For theſe are things of the ſame Nature; Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as neceſſary as Time and Place; and if we have any reſpect to the Decent and Reverent perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Service of God, they may be as neceſſary to be determined too. However it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that ſome things that are not Commanded may be Lawfully Enjoyned and Submitted to; and if ſome, then all that are of the ſame Indifferent nature; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there can be ſome ſufficient reaſon aſſigned why ſome ſhould be excepted, and ſome not; which will be very difficult where the Nature of the things is the ſame. And in our preſent caſe, it will be hard in the general to conceive how the Command of a Lawful Power ſhould make that Unlawful which was not <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> and by conſequence was Lawful before.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be ſtill inſiſted on, that nothing muſt be <hi>Commanded</hi> that God has not <hi>Commanded;</hi> they that are of this Perſwaſion, ſhould be very certain that they have clear proof out of the Scriptures for it before they undertake to <hi>Forbid</hi> that which God has not <hi>Forbidden;</hi> or elſe they ſtand condemned by their own Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94492:9"/>
Now the Arguments they bring for this out of the New Teſtament are very few: And thoſe very obſcure, and no way applicable to the matter in hand, without being mightily ſtrained: Thoſe out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not many; that which has been chiefly urged, and ſeems indeed the moſt pertinent and material, is this: The whole <hi>Levitical</hi> Service was particularly preſcribed by God himſelf, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtrictly charged to make the Tabernacle and all the Utenſils that belonged unto it, <hi>After the pattern that was ſhewed him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 40. Heb. 3. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>in the Mount. And</hi> Moſes <hi>verily was faithful in all his Houſe as a Servant; and ſo is Chriſt as a Son over his own Houſe;</hi> that is, the Church: Therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> laid down all the particular Rules to be obſerved in the Worſhip of God, under the Legal Diſpenſation, ſo has Chriſt under the Evangelical; and it is as dangerous to add, as it is to detract from theſe written Rules; we may no more do what is not <hi>Commanded,</hi> then what is <hi>Forbidden.</hi> This I take to be the main Argument that is brought againſt us in the preſent Controverſie; and if this can be Anſwered, all the reſt will be but of little Force.</p>
            <p>Therefore to give what ſatisfaction I can to this, I ſay firſt, that throughout the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Law and the Goſpel are compared, the ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew the exact Correſpondence there was betwixt the Type and the Antitype; and not that our Saviour had as particularly preſcribed the Order of external Worſhip, as <hi>Moſes</hi> by Gods appointment had done. For it is certain he did not; to give but one inſtance of very many: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Celebrating the Paſſeover, how it ſhould be Killed, and how it ſhould be Eaten, is ſet down with every minute Circumſtance: But the Inſtitution of the Supper of our Lord is not ſo delivered unto us: We
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94492:10"/>
have only a ſhort Narative, with a general Command ſuperadded; <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> And when <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> repeats it again, he does it without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25.</note> of the Poſture of Receiving. The Goſpel which teaches us a more Spiritual way of Serving God, is not ſo particular in the Circumſtantials of Worſhip as the Law was; and we muſt not affirm that it is, becauſe we would have it ſo. We cannot prove that Chriſt has actually done this, becauſe we imagine that he ſhould have done it. It would be better argued if we ſhould ſay, The Goſpel has not expreſsly determined theſe things, as the Law did; therefore they are left to the prudent determination of <hi>thoſe that have the Rule over</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>us,</hi> to whom we are Commanded to be <hi>Obedient, and ſubmit our ſelves;</hi> that the Epiſcopal Power may be equivalent to the Sacerdotal; and the Service of God as regularly Adminiſtred in the Church, as it was in the Temple.</p>
            <p>Beſides it was not a ſin, even under the Law, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and obſerve ſome things, relating to the Worſhip of God, that were not written. And theſe could not be eſteemed additions to the Word, if they were not impoſed as Divine Precepts, but as Prudent Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, appointed only for the more Orderly manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the external Offices of Religion. But that any thing ſhould be Unlawful meerly becauſe it is not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> is a Doctrine, I think, that was never heard of among Jews or Chriſtians, till very lately. God had <hi>Commanded</hi> the ſetting up of a Tabernacle, and moſt punctually deſcribed how it ſhould be made: We have been told that there was not to be one <hi>Pin</hi> about it, for which there was not ſome ſpecial Direction. And God never <hi>ſpake a word concerning building of an Houſe;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> 2 Sam. 17.</note> yet this notwithſtanding, <hi>David,</hi> without any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 17.</note> had it in his thoughts to build one; and <hi>Nathan</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94492:10"/>
in his private judgment approved of the deſign; and God himſelf, though he ſuſpended the execution of it for ſome time, commended him for it, and rewarded his pious Intentions, with a promiſe of <hi>building him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 6. 8.</note> another kind of <hi>Houſe,</hi> by confirming the ſettlement of the Crown in his Family. Which is proof enough that every thing then that was not <hi>Commanded,</hi> was not therefore Sinful. The antient Church of the Jews were ſo fully ſatisfied in this, that they made no Scruple of ordering divers things, for which they could not find a <hi>Command.</hi> The Feaſt of the Dedication is a known and pregnant inſtance; it was of modern and humane Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and yet our Saviour vouchſafed to be preſent at <note place="margin">John 10. 22.</note> it. Some things they a little altered, and added others, at the Paſſeover; as their eating of it not Standing, but Sitting, or Lying at the Table; and their Singing a Paſchal Hymm after it; which with ſome other like Uſages, were obſerved by our bleſſed Lord, and his Diſciples; and it can be no leſs than Blaſphemy then to conceive, that there could be any thing that was Sinful in them. The whole matter may be concluded thus: If it were not Sinful under the Law, where the external Form of Divine Worſhip was particularly, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to admit of certain Uſages that were not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> then much leſs is it Sinful to do ſo now under the Goſpel, where the external Form is not ſo ſpecified; where we have little more than ſuch general Rules as theſe, to be reſpectively applied by Superiors and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors: <hi>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40. Heb. 13. 17. Rom. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you: Where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been ſomething the longer in conſidering this Argument, becauſe the whole debate muſt iſſue here; which way ſoever this be decided, the Controverſie is at an end. If our Church require any thing of us that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94492:11"/>
is Unlawful, we are bound to <hi>Separate</hi> from her; if ſhe do not, we are ſtrictly ingaged to Communicate with her. They therefore that Divide, ſhould firſt ſhew that ſhe injoyns ſomething Unlawful. But that never was, and I verily believe never can be made appear. For we are told, in the Perſon of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>All things are Lawful;</hi> which muſt of neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12. 10. 23.</note> of things that are not <hi>Forbidden:</hi> And then ſince it cannot be charged upon our Church, that ſhe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands any thing that is <hi>Forbidden;</hi> it muſt be granted that ſhe Commands nothing but what the Apoſtle has declared to be <hi>Lawful.</hi>

Why ſhould we be afraid to joyn in Communion with a Reformed Church, whoſe Doctrine is Orthodox, whoſe Rites are Innocent, whoſe Government is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical? A man would wonder truly what could be pleaded in defence of a Separation, when none of theſe can be juſtly accuſed. And yet there are certain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections brought againſt us, which thoſe that withdraw would fain perſwade us to think ſufficient to juſtifie their Departure. To ſome of the chief of theſe I ſhall now endeavour to give what ſatisfaction I can.</p>
            <p>Our Diſſenting Brethren therefore are wont to plead; That there is a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Set <hi>Form</hi> of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed; That there are certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined; That the uſe of theſe Controverted things gives great <hi>Scandal</hi> to the weak; That they cannot Safely join in our <hi>mixt Communion;</hi> That they leave our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94492:11"/>
for the ſake of <hi>greater Edification,</hi> which they can find elſewhere: And for theſe Reaſons they think they are neceſſitated to depart from ours, and ſet up Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to themſelves, according to the beſt Models that every one is able to draw. This is certainly a very dangerous adventure; and can never be juſtified by ſuch Arguments, as are produced; which might be all eaſily anſwered upon the general Principle I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; That none of the things againſt which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are made are Unlawful; and therefore they cannot make our Communion Unlawful; and if that be not Unlawful, it muſt be Unlawful to divide from it. This might be Reply enough to the moſt, if not all the Objections that are, or can be brought. But becauſe it may be thought more ſatisfactory by ſome, I ſhall give a particular, though very ſhort Anſwer to thoſe I have now propoſed.</p>
            <p>The Firſt and Great thing that is objected againſt our Church, is preſcribing a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Set <hi>Form</hi> of Prayers to be conſtantly uſed in Publick Worſhip. This is that which has raiſed a great many Clamours; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds have been extremely incenſed and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt it; it has been cryed out upon as <hi>Idolatrous, Popiſh, Superſtitious,</hi> and I know not how many hard Names it has been called. But I am glad to find the temper of our Diſſenting Brethren altered ſo much for the better: We do not now ſo often hear thoſe bitter exclamations of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon, Baal</hi> and <hi>Dagon:</hi> The <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is not eſteemed ſuch an abominable thing, as ſome ignorant and heady Zealots were wont to count it. Among thoſe that have but too openly favoured the <hi>Separation</hi> the more conſiderable part, both for Number and Sobriety, do not only allow that a <hi>Form</hi> is Lawful, but will freely acknowledge that ours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſo; and therefore they will admit of Occaſional; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94492:12"/>
if ſo, I cannot ſee what can withhold them from a full and conſtant Communion with us. Certainly that which is Lawful once or twice, muſt be Lawful always. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may take ſome delight to ſee the old Heats in any meaſure abated, and that the leaſt advances are made towards Peace. God grant that this Conceſſion may prove a ſtep to a happy and perfect Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo I hope it may; for our Brethren can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any longer offended with thoſe Forms in which they do ſometimes join themſelves. Nay thoſe that have not yet proceeded ſo far, but are ſtill afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Defiled in our way of Worſhip, cannot have any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to Condemn it for being a <hi>Form.</hi> The Jews had <hi>Forms</hi> in their Publick Aſſemblies, which this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were duly frequented by our bleſſed Saviour: He delivered a <hi>Form</hi> himſelf, in his Sermon on the <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Mount, and taught the ſame again to his Diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <note place="margin">Luke 11. 2.</note> and Commanded them to uſe it: Some <hi>Forms</hi> were received very early among the Antient Chriſtians; who have been followed in this by all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches; but the Lawfulneſs of them was never called in queſtion heretofore: For how could it, ſince they are no where Forbidden? Or if a Command be thought requiſite to make them Lawful, the other way is no more Commanded than this; and therefore upon that Principle they muſt be both equally Lawful or Unlawful: So that if any Prayer be Lawful, a <hi>For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> muſt be confeſſed to be ſo. The Arguments in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

other, that it is an hinderance to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer. The firſt of theſe has very little difficulty in it. The ordinary wants and neceſſities of Chriſtians are always the ſame, and we may Petition to have them ſupplied in the ſame Words; and for other things, it may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be foreſeen that they may happen ſometimes; and ſutable <hi>Forms</hi> may be compoſed to be uſed upon ſuch Occaſions: Where theſe cannot be fitly applied, peculiar Offices may be ſet forth; as has been uſual in ſuch caſes: Where the exigency is great, and will not admit of ſo much delay as is neceſſary for that, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is at Liberty to uſe his own Conceptions. But this cannot be urged for the Excluſion of a <hi>Liturgy.</hi> It were very unreaſonable to deprive the Church of known and approved <hi>Forms,</hi> and leave her to the mercy of extemporary Effuſions only; for the ſake of a few Contingencies, which may happen but very rarely, if at all, in a whole Age.</p>
            <p>The other thing that is alledged would be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, if it were really true, That <hi>Forms</hi> did indeed <hi>hinder</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer. But this they do not: For it is a groſs and carnal Miſtake to imagine that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer can conſiſt in a readineſs of Expreſſion, and a natural or acquired volubility of Tongue; Arts and Accompliſhments whereof many Wicked men have been great Maſters; and wherein as many Good ones may be very deficient. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer muſt be acknowledged to be nothing elſe but an inward good and pious Diſpoſition of the Soul, wrought in us by the Grace of God; an unfeigned Humility and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our ſelves, when we confeſs our Sins, and beg for Pardon; an affectionate Senſe of our Wants, when we ask for all things neceſſary, both for this and the other Life; an holy exultation of Mind, when we offer up our Praiſes and Thanks for the Bleſſings we have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94492:13"/>
received; a full Reſignation of our Concerns to God's diſpoſal, and a Dependance upon his Promiſes for the granting our Requeſts, when we have made our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes unto him. Theſe are the great Indications of the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer; and theſe are ſo far from being <hi>Hindered,</hi> that they may be very much Helped, and Advantaged by a <hi>Form.</hi> A man queſtionleſs may be more ſeriouſly Affected, in all theſe reſpects, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> more heartily to a <hi>Form</hi> of ſound Words which he hath known, and conſidered before, than he can to ſome uncertain Expreſſions which he never heard, nor thought on; and poſſibly may not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor be ſatisfied in, when he hears them. The perplexity and doubtfulneſs of Thoughts, which muſt often ariſe, when we would join in Prayers we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with, is directly Oppoſite to that Faith and Aſſurance with which we ſhould Pray; and can ſcarce be prevented but by a well digeſted and ſtudied <hi>Form;</hi> that may be Weighed, and ſoberly Aſſented to, by thoſe that are required to join in it.</p>
            <p>But ſome think that it may be manifeſt from <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> that <hi>Forms</hi> are a <hi>hinderance</hi> to the very inward <hi>Spirit</hi> of Devotion. They have found their Affections very cold and ſlat, at our uſual ſtated <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer; but when they hear a man Pray without a <hi>Form,</hi> they are mightily raviſhed, and almoſt tranſported; and this difference of Temper they obſerve in themſelves has prevailed with many, of the more undiſcerning ſort eſpecially, to forſake our Communion. But it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very dangerous to judge of things not by our Underſtandings, but by the various impulſes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Affections. When we have Scripture and Reaſon on our ſide, we cannot be Deceived; but when we Determine, as we are ſwayed by the preſent byaſs of our Paſſions; theſe may be Charmed, or Raiſed, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94492:13"/>
Flattened, by ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Spirits;</hi> and quickly betray us into ſtrong Deluſions. Therefore if any one ſhould be tempted, as ſome have been, to leave the Church on this Account, that he thinks he may be more <hi>affected</hi> in another Place; before he goes, I would deſire him to conſider what it is that does thus <hi>Affect</hi> him: If it be the Matter and Subſtance of the Prayer, I ſuppoſe that may be uſually the ſame, at leaſt as good in our ordinary Offices, as it is in their unpremeditated Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſo it will not be neceſſary to make a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for this: If it be only the chiming and harmony of the Words he is taken with, this is no more but a kind of ſenſitive Delight; and to apply the Prophet's Expreſſions here, it is but like <hi>a very lovely Song of one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 32.</note> 
               <hi>that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> this will by no means excuſe our departing from the Publick Aſſemblies; this would be in effect to ſay, that we may make Diviſions in the Church of God, to gratifie our own private, and it may be miſtaken Fancies. But if any one hath left us for a time upon this Pretence, and made ſome Trial of both ways, then I would deſire him ſtrictly to examine his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether he have not often been as Dull and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different at a Conceived Prayer, as ever he was at the Service of the Church: And then on the other ſide, let him conſider, whether he do not believe that very many may be as ſerious and devout at the Common Prayer, as ever he was at any in the other way he is pleaſed to prefer: And after he has thus inquired, if he ſee Reaſon to acknowledge both, as doubtleſs he will, then the Scales will be even at the leaſt: <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> will ſhew, that men may be Fervent and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate with a <hi>Form,</hi> and Cold and Inattentive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one. And therefore when we are heavy, liſtleſs, and unaffected at a Prayer by a <hi>Form;</hi> this Defect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94492:14"/>
proceed from the Manner of the Devotion, but from the Indiſpoſition of the Perſon that uſes it. And when we <hi>Separate</hi> upon this occaſion, we are guilty of a double Iniquity, in Dividing the Church without ſufficient Cauſe; and charging our own Formality upon a good and wholeſome Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>My intended brevity will not permit me to give a particular Anſwer to all the Exceptions that have been taken at our <hi>Liturgy;</hi> only in the general I ſay, I know nothing in it that can be pretended to be Sinful in it ſelf. The moſt that is urged are ſome ſuppoſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; which if we ſhould grant to be real, they cannot make our Communion Unlawful; and then, as I have often intimated, it muſt be a Sin to <hi>Separate</hi> from it; and we may not commit a Sin to decline an Inconvenience: This would be to <hi>do evil that good may come</hi> of it. They that are willing to improve every ſlight Exception into a Cauſe of <hi>Separation,</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this. The queſtion is not, whether there be not any thing in the Order of our Divine Service which a man could wiſh to be altered? for that can never be expected under any Conſtitution. The main inquiry is this, whether any thing Unlawful be appointed to be uſed, which will make an Alteration not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, but neceſſary? and whether we are bound to withdraw till ſuch Alteration be made? Which has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been proved: Men generally forbear our Publick Worſhip, without ever examining into it, upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground but becauſe they prefer their own Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way before it. Which I do not admire; but this is very ſtrange and unreaſonable, that they ſhould take ſuch a diſguſt at our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and fly away from it, as if it were <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> when they never have ſo much as read it; at leaſt conſidered it, as they ought. And here I ſhall take the Confidence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94492:14"/>
to affirm that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſome abhor ſo much, was made and reviewed with that Prudence and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Care and Circumſpection, that there is not any thing now extant in that kind, that has been compos'd with greater Wiſdom, and Piety. If we ſhould take the liberty to compare it with the performances in the other way; (not to mention the many undecent, incoherent, irreverent expreſſions, to ſay no worſe, that might be collected) let any Prayer made occaſionally and <hi>extempore</hi> by the ableſt and moſt cautious of thoſe that magnifie that way, and deſpiſe ours, be taken exactly in writing, and publiſhed to the World; and I am very confident, that one Man, without any great pains, may find more things really exceptionable, in that ſingle Prayer, in a ſhort time, than the ſeveral Parties of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, with all the diligence they have hitherto uſed, have been able to diſcover in the whole Service of our Church in more than a hundred years. And yet ſome of our Brethren, that ſeek induſtriouſly for Scruples in the Common Prayer, will readily join in other ſudden conceived Prayers, without any Scruple; when they cannot tell but that there may be ſome dangerous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in every Sentence, and ſome great Indecencies and Abſurdities in every Word. This is ſuch partiality, and unequal dealing, as cannot be eaſily excus'd.</p>
            <p>But if they ſhould allow of the <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> there are certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> injoyn'd, which they think give them occaſion enough to depart from our Communion. A Man that were unacquainted with the true State of our caſe, that ſhould ſtand by and only hear the bitter Cries and Invectives that have been made againſt <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> would be ready to imagine that ſure our Church was nothing elſe almoſt but <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> But he would be mightily ſurprized, when upon inquiry he ſhould find, that theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94492:15"/>
had occaſioned all this noiſe, ſhould be no more than Three; the <hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>Croſs</hi> after Baptiſm, and <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> at the Sacrament. He would be amazed to think that theſe ſhould be the things, about which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſſy Books had been written! ſo great diſcords and animoſities rais'd! Such a flouriſhing Church once quite deſtroyed, and now moſt miſerably divided, after it had been ſo happily reſtored! And his wonder muſt be increaſed, when he ſhould perceive that of theſe Three, there was but One, and no more, in which the People were any way concerned. The <hi>Croſs</hi> and the <hi>Surplice,</hi> are to be uſed only by the Miniſter; and if his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be ſatisfied, no Mans elſe need to be diſturb'd about them. To <hi>Kneel</hi> at the Lord's Supper all indeed are commanded; but ſuppoſing this to be unlawful, it could hinder us only from partaking in that Ordinance, and not in the reſt. But of that farther by and by.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I do not underſtand but that ſome <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and particular Determinations of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are abſolutely neceſſary in the Worſhip of God; ſince it cannot be performed without them; they that will have no <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> can have no external Worſhip. This I think will not be denied. But the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that are appointed in our Church are thought by ſome to be <hi>ſignificant, ſuperſtitious,</hi> and breaches of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Liberty;</hi> and therefore not to be indured. Theſe are the great Objections againſt the few <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that are in uſe among us; and theſe I ſhall briefly Conſider.</p>
            <p>Firſt we are told our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are <hi>ſignificant:</hi> And why may not a <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> be Lawful? Are not Kneeling, and lifting up the Eyes and Hands to Heaven <hi>ſignifications</hi> of the Reverence we owe to the Divine Majeſty? Yes: But <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that <hi>ſignify</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing naturally, may be permitted; but not thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94492:15"/>
that <hi>ſignify</hi> by inſtitution. There ſhould be ſome ſolid reaſon, or ſome plain Scripture Authority brought, to to make this difference good: And here it is pleaded that every <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> is a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and it is downright <hi>Popery</hi> to make more <hi>Sacraments,</hi> than God has made. This I confeſs were very material, if it could be proved. But we acknowledge nothing to be a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but what is <hi>An outward and viſible ſign of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Common Prayer in the Catech.</note> 
               <hi>an inward and ſpiritual grace, given unto us, ordained by Chriſt himſelf, as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us thereof.</hi> Now if this be a true Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as it is owned by us, and muſt be acknowledged by our Diſſenting Brethren that talk ſo much of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Doctrine of our Church; then our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> though they ſhould be never ſo <hi>ſignificant,</hi> cannot be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> becauſe they want ſo many Neceſſary and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conditions that are required to make a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> They are not of Divine <hi>Ordination</hi> and Appointment, they are of no efficacy to confer any <hi>Grace,</hi> neither are they any <hi>Pledges,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurances</hi> of it. But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant every <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> to be a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi> for it is neither pleaſant nor profitable to quarrel about Words: There is but one of the Three <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and that is the <hi>Croſs</hi> at Baptiſm, that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be <hi>ſignificant;</hi> and that indeed is made, <hi>In</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Baptiſm.</note> 
               <hi>token that</hi> the party newly baptized <hi>ſhall not hereafter be aſhamed to confeſs the faith of Chriſt crucified,</hi> &amp;c. But this <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> was very anciently, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, uſed at Baptiſm, and upon ſeveral other occaſions, by the Primitive Chriſtians, in deſiance of all ſorts of Infidels, and as we do it, <hi>in Token</hi> that they were <hi>not aſhamed</hi> of a <hi>crucified</hi> Saviour. Our Church in this does but follow the example of the pureſt and holieſt Profeſſors of the Goſpel that ever were; and that but at a diſtance too, in doing that but once, which they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94492:16"/>
repeated often. And this can ſcarce be called a <hi>Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremony.</hi> It is not appointed to Repreſent any thing unto us, but only to remind us of a Duty we are bound to do. Like the <hi>Altar</hi> that was built by the Children of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh, Not for burnt-offering, nor for ſacrifice; but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joſh. 22. 26.</note> 
               <hi>that it might be a Witneſs.</hi> And if any one ſhould think the <hi>Surplice</hi> were ordered to be worn to denote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Life, that does more eſpecially become thoſe that are particularly devoted to the Service of God; it is more than our Church has declared; but yet no man were to be blamed, that ſhould take occaſion from hence, to let his thoughts expatiate into a pious and ſeaſonable Meditation, and conſider how incongruous it would be, to have his inward parts full of filtheneſs and corruption, when his outſide was covered with a clean white Linnen Garment. The Sum is, every <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremony</hi> is not a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and none of ours can be properly ſaid to be <hi>ſignificant,</hi> repreſenting, <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical;</hi> but only <hi>Commemorating,</hi> or if any man pleaſe to call them ſo, <hi>Profeſſing ſigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though they cannot be proved to be <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yet they may be <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and that is Objection enough againſt them. And I confeſs that they may be <hi>Superſtitious;</hi> but not in themſelves, for ſo they are perfectly Indifferent; but according to the Opinion or Conceit of thoſe that uſe them, or uſe them not. There may be <hi>Superſtition</hi> in the Obſerving of theſe, and there may be as much in the forbearing. <hi>Superſtition</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a groundleſs Fancy attended ſometimes with an anxious Fear, and ſometimes with a fond Hope, that God is pleaſed or diſpleaſed with the bare performance or forbearance of what he hath neither Commanded nor Forbidden. He therefore that thinks he offends God in doing of that he has not Forbidden; and he that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94492:16"/>
imagines he ſhall pleaſe him, by the obſerving of what he has not Commanded, are both in ſome degree, and it may be, equally <hi>Superſtitious.</hi> And then the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> that is exerciſed about the Obſervation of theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> muſt lie on the part of our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who think they ſhould Sin in keeping them, though they generally confeſs they are not Forbidden; and not on ours, who declare them to be Indifferent, and no otherwiſe acceptable unto God, but as they are the effects of Obedience to our Superiours, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the preſervation of Diſcipline and Order in the Church.</p>
            <p>But it is farther urged by ſome, that theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are a <hi>Breach</hi> of our Chriſtian <hi>Liberty.</hi> I need not enter upon a Diſcourſe of this; but as far as it concerns the matter in hand, I ſay; That the being freed from the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law is a part, though not the greateſt part of Chriſtian <hi>Liberty;</hi> but then it is not ſo much our being freed from obſerving it, as from the Neceſſity of obſerving it. The Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily obſerve it for ſome time upon Prudential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; and impoſed ſome things, as the <hi>abſtaining</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 15. 29.</note> 
               <hi>from bloud, and from things ſtrangled;</hi> and yet they were <hi>Free,</hi> becauſe whatever they did of this Nature, they did it not with an Opinion of any Neceſſary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that lay upon them to do it, but upon other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; moſt commonly out of condeſcenſion to the weakneſs of the Jewiſh Converts. And if ſome <hi>Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Rites might not only be obſerved, but impoſed then; there can be no reaſon why a few Indifferent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> may not be appointed now, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon the <hi>Liberty</hi> which Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us. Such things cannot be an infringment of that, but only when they are ſuppoſed to be either Unlawful or Neceſſary by Divine Command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94492:17"/>
               <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is the <hi>Ceremony</hi> that is wont to be the moſt ſcrupled, is as little liable to the Objections, that I have now anſwered, as either of the other. It would be very uncharitable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to ſay as ſome have done, that it is an Act of Worſhip to the outward Elements; when the Church has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this to be <hi>Idolatry, to be abhorred of all faithful</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rubr. after the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> If it ſhould be ſaid that we ought to receive in the ſame poſture, that they received at the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: We cannot certainly tell what that was: If it were that which is moſt probably Conjectured, it is never uſed: it is wholly laid aſide by thoſe that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the moſt Zealouſly for it. But ſure if the particular Geſture had been ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as ſome do imagine, there would have been ſome plain, and expreſs mention of it ſomewhere in the Scripture; which there is not, as I have noted before. And then it muſt be very unwarrantable in thoſe, that <hi>Separate</hi> from our Church, becauſe they will not receive in that reverent manner which She has preſcribed. If there had been nothing injoyned in this matter, a Man upon a ſerious apprehenſion of the infinite mercies of God, through the merits and mediation of his bleſſed Saviour, could ſcarce have forborn falling upon his Knees, when he came to partake of the Sacrament of his moſt precious Body and Blood. The commemoration of the Death and Paſſion of the Son of God, by which he was Redeemed, would ſtrike him almoſt naturally, into the humbleſt poſture of Adoration. But if any reverence be granted to be due at ſuch a time, I am ſure <hi>ſitting</hi> at the Table, is a very unfit poſture to expreſs it. Or if any Man ſhould like it better than that which is required with us; yet to make this an occaſion of departing from our Communion, would argue but too little value for the peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94492:17"/>
But ſome there are who though they be convinced of the Lawfulneſs of all theſe Rites and Uſages, and for their own particular could joyn with us well enough; yet they dare not do it, for fear of giving <hi>Scandal</hi> and Offence to thoſe that are not ſatisfied in theſe things. This matter of <hi>Scandal</hi> has been ſo vehemently pleaded ſometimes, as if it were the only thing to be regarded in all Church Conſtitutions; and that they were to be immediately diſuſed, whatever Authority injoyned them, aſſoon as any ſhould be offended at them. This puts all external Order in Chriſtian Aſſemblies into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tottering condition, ready to be preſently overturned, by every little Scruple, that may chance to ariſe. But for anſwer to this we muſt obſerve: That they are the Weak, and Ignorant that take Offence: That their doubts and ſcruples are not to be nouriſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <note place="margin">See Rom. 14.</note> but only born with for a time; That they are bound to take all due Care, and convenient Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Inſtruction, that they may be fully ſatisfied; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> and that it is in things meerly indifferent, ſuch as <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> where we are obliged to any compliance, for the avoiding of <hi>Scandal.</hi> Theſe things thus briefly premiſed, let it be conſidered; whether they who eſteem themſelves rather more Knowing than others who ſeem unwilling to part with their Doubts; and who have entertained ſome Prejudices againſt thoſe that would inform them better, are to be treated like weak Brethren? And whether we ought to yield to them, where Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority has determined the contrary; unleſs we could prove our Obedience as indifferent as the things ſcrupled at are ſuppoſed to be? If it ſhould be ſaid that we ought; yet at leaſt it cannot be ſafely done, till it be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that all the weak are of one ſide. For in our preſent Caſe, if there ſhould be as many, as doubtleſs there are, that would be offended to ſee the manner of our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94492:18"/>
Worſhip altered, as there are to ſee it impoſed; then though the command of our Superiors ſhould ſignify nothing, we ſhould yet be upon equal terms, on the account of <hi>ſcandal</hi> only; and as much bound not to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> as they think they are to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> by their own Principle. But in a word, no <hi>ſcandal</hi> taken at an Indifferent thing, can be ſo great as the Sin, and Scandal both, of Confuſion and Diſorder, and Contempt of Authority.</p>
            <p>There is another Exception near akin to this: ſome have thought they muſt withdraw from us, becauſe of our <hi>mixt Communions,</hi> and that ſome which they judg unworthy Receivers, are admitted to the Lord's Table. This Objection proves nothing but a Supercilious Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and a great want of Charity in thoſe that make it. What care they may take in their new way of Diſcipline, I cannot tell; but our Church has given the Miniſter a Power of rejecting thoſe that are guilty <note place="margin">See Rubr. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> of any known and ſcandalous Sin. And this is as much as can be done; the open Sinner may be excluded, but the cloſe Hypocrite will eſcape the narroweſt ſearch, that humane Induſtry can make. But if any <hi>notorious evil Livers</hi> ſhould be admitted through the ignorance, inadvertency, or negligence of the Miniſter; their Unworthineſs cannot defile thoſe that Communicate with them. It is generally thought that the Curſed Traytor <hi>Judas</hi> did partake of the Holy Supper, when it was firſt inſtituted by our Lord. God be praiſed, I have not heard, that amongſt us, the abuſes of this Ordinance, did ever ariſe to that Degree that they were at among the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> when at the very time of receiving, <hi>one was Hungry, and another Drunken:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 21.</note> and yet the Apoſtle does not Command them to forſake the <hi>Communion</hi> of that Church, where theſe ſcandalous Enormities were committed. Every man is charged
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94492:18"/>
to <hi>Examine himſelf,</hi> and not another, before he preſume <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> 
               <hi>to eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> And it would be very well, if all men would hearken to this holy and pious Admonition; for he that inquires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly into his own Sins, will find great cauſe to be Humble and Penitent, and ſo may become a worthy Communicant: But he that is curious to pry into the miſcarriages of other men, will be apt to be vain, proud, ſelf-conceited, and cenſorious; which will make him as unfit for the Table of the Lord, as any of thoſe Faults which he ſo ſcornfully condemns in his Neighbour, that he eſteems himſelf, and the Ordinances of God pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by his Company.</p>
            <p>But if none of theſe Pleas, I have mentioned, ſhould be ſufficient; many think they may leave our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies only for the ſake of <hi>greater Edification,</hi> which they can find elſewhere. This I believe prevails with great numbers, of the more ignorant eſpecially, to depart from us. And I would to God they might obtain what they ſay they depart for; and that they were indeed more <hi>Edified,</hi> and did grow in Grace, under what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery ſoever it be. But alas! this talk of <hi>greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification</hi> is many times meer wantonneſs, and inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of humour; and too often rather in Fancy than effect. Men conceit that they are better <hi>Edified,</hi> not when they are more fully inſtructed in any weighty point of Faith; or more perfectly informed in ſome neceſſary Duty; or more efficaciouſly moved to the practice of what they Know; but when they are more gratified, and pleaſed, at the hearing of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or the like. This is nothing but one ſort of thoſe <hi>itching Ears</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of. And they that are <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4 3.</note> troubled with this diſeaſe, inſtead of being <hi>Edified,</hi> as they pretend, are commonly the moſt ignorant of all; and as blamable as any in their ordinary Converſation.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94492:19"/>
I wiſh we had not too many examples of the truth of this. For beſides that, it is great odds but that they make an unwiſe choice in the Teacher they ſet up to themſelves at laſt; they likewiſe provoke God to leave them to the vanity of their own Minds, when they depend rather on the ſuppoſed abilities of a man, than the bleſſed influences of the holy Spirit; and look more at <hi>Paul that plants,</hi> and <hi>Apollo that waters,</hi> then at <hi>God that gives the increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we have all things neceſſary to the building us up in our moſt holy Faith, in the Communion of the Church; it will be but a poor excuſe for our Dividing from it, that we hoped to be better <hi>Edified;</hi> when we had no incouragement at all to hope it, as long as we continued in the ſtate of <hi>Separation,</hi> upon this pretence. For it is the bleſſing of God alone, and not any mans skill in diſpenſing them, that can make the Word and Ordinances any way beneficial unto us. With the help of his Grace, thoſe means of inſtruction which we ſometimes undervalue the moſt, may be profitable to our Salvation: Without it our Ears may be tickled, and our Fancies pleaſantly entertained for the time; but we cannot be truly <hi>Edified</hi> by the moſt fluent and popular Tongue, nor the moſt melting and pathetical Expreſſions in the World.</p>
            <p>I have briefly examined the chief Objections that are brought againſt the eſtabliſhed Order, and Conſtitution of our Church; and do not find that any, or all of them together, are of force enough to move an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Perſon to forſake her Communion. It may not be done upon the account of <hi>Liturgy, Ceremonies, Scandal, mixt Communion,</hi> or out of hopes of <hi>greater Edification.</hi> I might have eaſily inlarged upon all theſe particulars; but the compaſs of my preſent Deſign would not allow it. And I have ſome hopes that theſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94492:19"/>
and other points in difference, may be handled by others to better advantage, and to the ſatisfaction of thoſe that are not yet convinced, and to the happy ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a laſting <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> among all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this divided Church. God grant that all our indeavours may tend this way; and that the Divine Goodneſs may make them Succeſsful. If theſe Papers ſhould chance to fall into the hands of any one of thoſe that have <hi>Separated</hi> from us, I would intreat him not to be Offended at them; but to look upon the Author, as a well-meaning Man, that was willing to throw a little Water upon the common flame, that is like to conſume us. They were not written, I am ſure with any bitterneſs of Mind, or Expreſſion; but out of meer pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee a poor, lamentable, diſtreſſed Church, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing away, and ready to periſh by deſperate Wounds, and Convulſions within her own Bowells. Such ſad and Melancholy thoughts as theſe apprehenſions muſt needs occaſion, could ſcarce be vented in angry and provoking Language. But ſome are ſo tender of the Opinions they have taken up, that whether true or falſe, they cannot indure to have them touched: They are impatient of the calmeſt Oppoſition; and when you offer any thing to perſwade them, though it ſhould be to brotherly Love and Peace among Chriſtians, they ſuſpect you for an Enemy, and think that you come to ſet traps in their way to inſnare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. But I hope this ſhort Diſcourſe will not be incountered by any ſuch Prejudice; but that it may be peruſed, with the ſame Impartiality that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>On this preſumption, I ſhall be bold to exhort all thoſe that now Diſſent, to a Brotherly <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> upon ſuch motives and arguments, as the Goſpel ſuggeſts, and make for the Credit and Safety of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94492:20"/>
Religion. It will be readily acknowledged by every ſo ber and intelligent men, that Peace, and Amity, and a good Correſpondence betwixt the ſeveral Members of which they conſiſt, is the only Beauty, Strength, and Security of all Societies; and on the contrary, that the nouriſhing of Animoſities, and running into oppoſite Parties and Factions, does mightily weaken, and by degrees almoſt unavoidably draw on the Ruin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of any Community, whether Civil or Sacred. Concord and Union therefore will be as neceſſary for the Preſervation of the Church, as of the State. It has been known by too ſad an Experience, as well in ours as other Ages, what a pernicious Influence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Broils and Quarrels among Chriſtians have had. They have been the great ſtumbing Block to Jews, Turks, and Heathens; and the main hinderance of their Converſion; they have made ſome among our ſelves to become Doubtful and Sceptical in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they have led others into many dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that ſhake the very Foundations of our Faith; and ſome they have tempted to caſt off the Natural ſenſe they had of the Deity, and imboldened to an open and profeſſed Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the moſt uſual Fruits, which the unhappy Differences in the Church are wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; over and above the particular Unkindneſſes and uncharitable Feuds, which they commonly beget a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians of the ſame Perſwaſion, as to all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and weighty matters of Belief. And it were a thing very deſirable in all reſpects, that theſe at leaſt ſhould be all firmly United in the ſame holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They that have the ſame Articles of Faith, and hope to meet in the ſame Heaven, through the Merits of the ſame Lord, ſhould not be afraid to come into the ſame Aſſemblies, and join ſeriouſly in ſending, up the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94492:20"/>
ſame Prayers, and participating of the ſame Sacraments. Beſides, the many ſtrict Precepts and other ſtrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which we have unto this; our Saviour <hi>Died</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 52.</note> 
               <hi>that he might gather together in One, the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad.</hi> And ſhould we not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this end of his Death, if we ſhould ſet thoſe at Strife and Variance which he intended to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite?</hi> Nay, might we not be ſaid, in ſome ſort, to <hi>Crucifie the Son of God afreſh;</hi> if we ſhould Mangle and Divide any ſound and healthful part of that Body of which he owns himſelf to be the Head? If indeed our Church did require us to make profeſſion of any falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Opinions; if in the external Order and Worſhip we were injoined to do any thing contrary to any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command; we were bound in ſuch Inſtances to withdraw from her: But if her Doctrine be highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by moſt of our Diſſenting Brethren; and her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Service ſuch, as is not any way inconſiſtent with any Law of God; then we are indiſpenſably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to join in Communion with her. For, as has been intimated ſeveral times, and it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated too often, Nothing but the Unlawfulneſs of Communicating can make a <hi>Separation</hi> Lawful.</p>
            <p>But if it be reſolved that the Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt be forſaken, notwithſtanding that neither her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor Diſcipline can be juſtly condemned; it would yet be convenient to bethink our ſelves, what might be the moſt adviſable to be done after we had left it. Whether we ſhould ſet up another way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in the room of it: Or whether every one ſhould have the Liberty of following that which he fancied the beſt. If we are for the ſetting up another way; it muſt be either <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independency:</hi> For if there ſhould be any other new Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are not yet of Reputation enough to be put
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94492:21"/>
in Competition with theſe two great Pretenders to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right. And <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which had once the faireſt hopes of eſtabliſhing it ſelf, is now grown weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in compariſon of what it was; and thoſe few which would ſtill be thought of that Perſwaſion, are manifeſtly departed from their own Principles, and are fain to ſupport themſelves by Gathered Aſſemblies, which they were not wont to allow. <hi>Independency</hi> therefore ſeems at this time to be the prevailing way; but their manner of Gathering Members, and Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into particular Congregations, their <hi>holy Band, ſpecial Agreement,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> which they make eſſential to the Conſtituting of a Church, are things which have not the leaſt foundation in the holy Scriptures; neither were they ever Countenanced by the practice of any Orthodox Chriſtians in former Ages. But put the caſe we ſhould admit of either of theſe Forms of Diſcipline and Government, we ſhould be as far, if not farther from being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> than we are now. For they have both been known to have been very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Impoſers, wherever they have had the Power of Commanding; and as they have ſometimes been, ſo they would ſoon again become more odious to the ſeveral Subdiviſions of Diſſenters than <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf. And this being a thing ſo eaſily foreſeen, we are not now urged with the neceſſity of ſetting up either of theſe. The great expedient that has been propoſed of late, is to indulge a Liberty of chooſing what Church, and what way of Worſhip any man pleaſes; that is, to grant a publick <hi>Toleration</hi> of divers Religions. But this, though it might gratifie the preſent humor of ſome part of the Nation, and ſerve ſome mens Occaſions bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any Eſtabliſhment, would be quickly diſliked by moſt of thoſe that now contend ſo Zealouſly for it. For there muſt needs be a conſtant Emulation and Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94492:21"/>
betwixt the ſeveral <hi>Tolerated</hi> Parties, which would give a continual Diſturbance; and as ſoon as any of them began to grow Numerous and Powerful, and had any Hopes of ſucceeding, they would preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it very neceſſary to impoſe their own Diſcipline upon all the reſt; and this probably might ſoon put an end to the ſo much deſired and magnified way of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Or if we could ſuppoſe them contented to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Freedom to others which they injoyed themſelves, yet it could not poſſibly be avoided, but that this Indulgence muſt ſtrangely multiply our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; while ſome Members of their <hi>Separate</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would take Offence, and withdraw, and make choice of a new Paſtor, and incorporate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another new Church, and that after a while, upon the like Pretences, might be ſplit into another, and another, and ſo on without any ſtop. And then this would certainly ſet open the Gate to a Flood of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſuch monſtrous and extravagant Opinions, as muſt be confeſſed, by the moſt prejudiced Diſſenter, to be of far more dangerous conſequence to the cauſe of Religion than that ſober and pious <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and thoſe few indifferent <hi>Rites</hi> which are now injoined. This the experience of the Late Times found to be true. The Church of <hi>England</hi> was no ſooner overthrown, but ſome of thoſe that had been the moſt forward and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to pull her down, when they ſaw how ſuddenly the ſwarms of other Sectaries increaſed upon them, were forced to acknowledge that the Conſtitution which they had deſtroyed, was a great check and reſtraint to thoſe Errors, which grew Bold and Licencious under the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they had procured. The Biſhops then, who juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been the common Theme of Popular Obloquy, had ſome good Words unwillingly dropt upon them, and their Diligence and Succeſs in ſuppreſſing Abſurd, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94492:22"/>
and many times Blaſphemous Doctrines, was allowed ſome juſt Commendation. That Government which they had traduced and rendered as odious as was poſſible, by all the arts of Defamation that could be uſed, was found upon Trial to be far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, by ſome of its greateſt Enemies, than that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and Confuſion they had contended for with ſo much Violence.</p>
            <p>But if we cannot be made ſufficiently Apprehenſive of the diſmal Effects, that will almoſt Naturally follow upon a Publick <hi>Toleration;</hi> yet methinks we ſhould now be a little Suſpitious of it, ſince we know it is the main Engine the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been working with theſe many years. If there be no Remedy but that our Church muſt fall, let us not throw it down our ſelves, by methods of their Preſcribing; let us not act as if we were proſecuting the Deſigns of the Conclave; and proceed juſt as if we were governed by the Decrees of the pretended Infallible Chair. We may be aſhamed to look ſo like Tools in the hands of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> when we ſuffer our ſelves to be guided by thoſe meaſures which they had taken, and talk and do as they would have us; as if we were immediately inſpired from <hi>Rome.</hi> For we cannot be ignorant that <hi>Toleration</hi> has been a Device of theirs; and it would not be any part of our Wiſdom to grow unreaſonably fond of the Invention of our Enemies; and think to ſtrengthen the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt by thoſe very means which their Subtilty and Malice had contrived to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>But if this Conſideration ſhould be laid aſide; What need can there be otherwiſe, that we ſhould deſire to be Indulged in our departure from a Church, when we may Communicate with a ſafe Conſcience? As we may certainly do in ours; whoſe greateſt Adverſaries have not been able, after the moſt curious Search they could
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94492:22"/>
make, to find out one thing in the whole Conſtitution which they could poſitively affirm to be Forbidden; and till that can be made appear, we muſt ſtill ſay that it cannot be Unlawful. If the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things be thought a ſufficient ground for a <hi>Separation;</hi> (as it is now generally urged, ſince the proof of their Unlawfulneſs is deſpaired of) then we muſt have <hi>Separated</hi> from the Apoſtolical Churches, who had ſome ſuch Uſages, as the Holy Kiſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe Indifferency is acknowledged by their being wholly diſuſed: We muſt have <hi>Separated</hi> from the firſt Churches that ſucceeded them, which had all ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things injoined: We muſt <hi>Separate</hi> at this time from all the Reformed Churches in the World; for there is none of theſe which does not require the uſe of ſuch things, as we ſhould judge cauſe enough to depart from them: Nay, when we have once <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> from the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon this account, we muſt then <hi>Separate</hi> from one another, and every man muſt be a Church by himſelf; for it is impoſſible that any Society, whether meerly Humane, or Chriſtian ſhould ſubſiſt, without the orderly determination of ſome Indifferent things. And ſure we can never hope to maintain our <hi>Separation</hi> upon ſuch a Principle, as would not only part us from all the Churches that are, or ever were, and tear Chriſtendom into ten thouſand pieces; but ſcarce leaves us ſo much as the Notion of a Church, and makes Chriſtian Communion abſolutely impracticable. Let us not give thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing that Church which has always oppoſed them with the greateſt Vigor, and been the conſtant mark of their Envy, quite Ruined, or extreamly Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by a pernicious Miſtake, that would Divide and Divide us again, and again, and never make any end of Dividing. Let us ſhew at leaſt that we are well incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94492:23"/>
unto Peace, by coming as far as we can; and if there ſhould be any thing that we may poſſibly ſuſpect to be Unlawful, let not this hinder us from joining in thoſe other holy Offices, in which we have not any pretence of a Doubt. Let not our groundleſs Scrupling at a Ceremony, or two, fright us from the whole Worſhip of God, againſt which we have not any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe that eſteem our Communion in all particulars utterly Unlawful, which I ſuppoſe are but very few, and I know they have but very ſlight Arguments for the ſevere Judgment they paſs upon us; if they will meet, let them do it in the moſt private manner that they can, without any vain Oſtentation of their Numbers, which cannot be any Satisfaction to their Conſciences, but may make their Adherents over for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bold, and tend to the creating of Jealouſies in the Government. And while they are upon theſe terms, they cannot reaſonably expect any Connivance. They might ſooner hope for it from his Majeſties won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and often experienced Clemency; when they ſhall make it appear that their Diſſent is modeſt and humble, and ſuch as has no other but a Religious Deſign in it: Than when they aſſume a high degree of Confidence, and think to extort Indulgencies by Clamors and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and reſolve to Aſſemble openly in Oppoſition to a Royal Command; as if it were a piece of Chriſtian Fortitude to outbrave Authority. Theſe are but ill Methods of courting the Favour of a Prince. But I hope for the future we ſhall all, upon all Occaſions, behave our ſelves as becomes good Subjects, and ſober Chriſtians, and make no Diſturbances neither on a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil nor Eccleſiaſtical account.</p>
            <p>Let it Pity us at laſt to ſee the Ghaſtly Wounds that are ſtill renewed by the continuance of our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94492:23"/>
Let us have ſome Compaſſion on a Bleeding Church that is ready to Faint, and in eminent Danger of being made a prey to her Enemies, by the unnatural Heats and Animoſities of thoſe that ſhould Support and Defend her. Why ſhould we leave her thus Deſolate and Forlorn, when her preſent Exigencies require our moſt Cordial Aſſiſtance? If the condition of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion were ſuch as God's Laws did not allow, we might forſake her that had forſaken him. But ſince this cannot be Objected againſt her; ſince ſhe exacts no Forbidden thing of us, Let us ſtrengthen her Hands by our unanimous Agreement; and ſince we do not Condemn her Doctrine, let us not Deſpiſe her Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſince the Subſtantials of Religion are the ſame, let not the Circumſtances of external Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be any longer an Occaſion of Difference amongſt us. And ſo ſhall we bring Glory to God, a happy Peace to a Divided Church, a conſiderable Security to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and probably Defeat the ſubtle Practices of <hi>Rome,</hi> which now ſtands gaping after All; and hopes by our Diſtractions to repair the loſſes ſhe has ſuffered by the Reformation. May the Wiſdom of Heaven make all Wicked Purpoſes unſucceſsful; and the bleſſed Spirit of Love heal all our Breaches, and proſper the Charitable Endeavours of thoſe that follow after PEACE. <hi>Amen.</hi>
