            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE first Lesson is the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> that CHRIST teacheth us in his <hi>Schoole,</hi> is this, <hi>For a man to deny himselfe,</hi> and so is it also the highest taske that is set to any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These words were spoken to them all, a great many professed Christ, and thronged upon him.</hi> Therfore Christ taught them a lesson, that most of them never thought of. <hi>If any one will follow me, let him deny himselfe.</hi> The Condition is, <hi>let him deny himselfe,</hi> the terms are selfe-denyall.</p>
               <p>Selfe-deniall consisteth,
<list>
                     <item>1. In denying our selves in all good things.</item>
                     <item>2. In all evill Things.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In all good things, Selfe-denyall ought to be in all good things. 1. <hi>Internall.</hi> 2. <hi>Externall.</hi> Internall as the understanding, will, and affection. So in morall Habits, as <hi>Temperance, Fortitude, Wisedome, &amp;c.</hi> 3. In labour of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even of such as are gotten by study. 2. Selfe-denyall ought to be in Externall good things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:94800:2"/>1. <hi>In matters of duty.</hi> 2. <hi>In Objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Jn matters of duty, that is toward God, where is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a main duty between true exercise of Piety, and Counterfeit, Those are true, which are set down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and none else; <hi>for God will be served of himselfe, he commandeth not as man prescript.</hi> 2 <hi>Here appears the vainnesse of that duty which is prescribed of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those of men may be knowne <hi>like trees by their fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of humane invention, set upon the <hi>Conscience,</hi> those who maintain it, cannot but confesse the <hi>superstition</hi> which they maintaine.</p>
               <p>The next thing, is the duty we owe to our Neighbor, as of <hi>charity, of equity, of mercy</hi>: when we have done all that is commanded, we must confesse we are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Here is selfe-denyall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet there may be duties of Piety, where there is a want hereof, as</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>There may bee seeming charity, yet fals. There may be a giving up of the body to be burned, yet want of charity; because not proceeding from Faith. Even in these workes a Christian must deny himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To condemn all <hi>Popish Charity,</hi> and many which they call good works, instead of <hi>denying themselvs</hi> in those works, <hi>they deny Christ</hi>; for in those works, they say they deserve the Kingdome of <hi>Heaven.</hi> For there is salvation in none other but in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To condemn another sort of carnall profane men that build their salvation on common duties, works of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; who say that they doe all men right (<hi>though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are compelled so to doe</hi>) this overthrowes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> this is not to deny <hi>themselves,</hi> but to deny <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. To put a difference between true <hi>charity</hi> and false, some men are naturally given to be upright, to doe Justice, to deale upright. <hi>This is not to deny ones selfe, to build in these; for this is not of Grace: for workes of Grace humble a man.</hi> This may be a tryall of our grace; if they be of grace, <hi>thou wilt deny thy selfe in them.</hi> In the next place, we are to consider of certaine <hi>objects,</hi> of a threefold relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <hi>ANd first a Naturall Relation,</hi> as to <hi>Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wife, Children, kindred, &amp;c.</hi> we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our selves <hi>in all relation, where th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t we must hate them. Mat.</hi> 10.35. No marvell then if the world cry out of <hi>Christ,</hi> and call him a seditious Person. For a man to hate his Parents, as he is a Father; but to deny obodience to his father, so farre as he is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd from comming to <hi>Christ.</hi> A noteable <hi>Example</hi> is in <hi>Deutr.</hi> 13.6. <hi>The Sonne must not conceale the Father, if he seeke to bring him to Idolatry.</hi> We must not acknowledge Father and Mother in bidding us to do that which <hi>Christ forbiddeth. Mat.</hi> 23.9. So there is a noteable <hi>Psalm. Deutr.</hi> 33.9. <hi>This denyall brought a blessing upon them, and it is a Type of the Gospell.</hi> For every true <hi>Beleever</hi> is a <hi>Priest,</hi> and must not in that respect looke upon outward <hi>Relation,</hi> in <hi>competition with Christ: but deny our selves in those things, which otherwise we are bound to love by the Law of Nature. Trample upon thy Father, cast off thy wife and children, saith a Father, if they seeke to draw thee from Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> To condemne the Papist who hang all their Faith and Religion on their Ancestors; because they liv'd and dy'd in this Religion: this is to set up the Parents against <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To reprove too many <hi>Papists</hi> in this Land, that doe propagate their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Childrens Children in that <hi>Religion.</hi> Many amongst us, that send their Children to <hi>Monasteries in Rome,</hi> to make them <hi>bondslaves in darknesse for ever.</hi> God be thanked we have good Lawes, &amp; I hope we shall have them increased by the happy <hi>Parliament</hi>; but happy were it, if there were good <hi>Magistrates</hi> to put those Lawes in practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. <hi>For Parents that professe Religion.</hi> When the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Christ</hi> toucheth the heart, then they see the true way whose heart is so touched.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94800:3"/>Yet how many Parents cannot endure that their children doe outstrip their Parents in purity, even for this they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre their own children, and sometime dispossesse them; and cannot endure them: this is lamentable: Kings in their own Thrones, are not above Christ, much lesse Parents in their Families. If God come into their Families, into the hearts of their children; shall Parents lift their hands up against Christ to abhorre and hate their own children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this? The body is received from the Parents, but the soule from God; Parents may instruct their children, but not to keepe them from Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4. For Children that have received a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of light from Christ, then the Parents they must be modest and humble, &amp; beare their reproches patiently for Christ: but if the Parents will keep them from Christ, we must hate &amp; deny our Parents: but in the mean time to be patient to convince them, and (if possible) to perswade them 5. To perswade these children, that they follow this light, and not let their Parents, nor any friend in the world draw them from Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The <hi>2.</hi> Relation is civill,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> A Christian must deny himself in all civill Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Princes or States make Lawes against the Law of Christ, against his Religion, &amp; his pure Ordinances, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning punishment to those that will not observe them.</p>
               <p>Herein a true <hi>Christian</hi> must deny himselfe, both in matter of terrour, and in matter of favour. 1. In matter of terrour, whatsoever is threatned against a man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. a <hi>Christian</hi> may say, I am lower then all the terrours of the world can hurt me. We should deny our selves with <hi>Paul,</hi> and be reday, not onely to be bound, but to dye for <hi>Christ. Theodorus</hi> (an <hi>Heathen</hi> man) was told, that he should rot above ground, I care not (saith he) it is all one to me, to rot above, or under ground. Thus a <hi>Christian</hi> should resolve against all feares, and terrour whatsoever, for <hi>Christ.</hi> So for matter of favour, as <hi>Polyc Carpus</hi> had great promotion promised in the time of <hi>persecution,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb facs="tcp:94800:4"/>
I have served <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, fourty and he hath alwayes bin a good Master to me, and I will not deny him now, this is selfe-denyall. How many have bin overcome with these things for want of <hi>selfe-deniall.</hi> Those that are compelled to Popery and Popish wayes, are not <hi>Christs</hi> followers, but the followers of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Some may say, what need we to have such a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as this of <hi>selfe-denyall,</hi> in respect of civill Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be taught as now?</p>
               <p>

If some by <hi>Reformation</hi> be reformed, and not others, will they be quiet? No, the nearer we come to <hi>Christ,</hi> the more we must looke for <hi>persecution,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12.

               <p>A <hi>Christian</hi> must deny himselfe in pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, even the delights of meate and drink, and lawfull recreation, which are in themselves lawfull meat &amp; drink in a continuall moderation, keeping himselfe from excesse, and sometime in a totall abstinence for a time.</p>

                  <hi>When a soule is over-charged, he is more fit to lye downe then to run.</hi> 3. <hi>It brings many evils upon a state, Luke</hi> 20. Swilling in drink brought a deluge. So in <hi>Lots time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorrah</hi> did eat and drink, and swill, till fire came downe from Heaven, and burnt them all to Ashes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 4. <hi>It brings a man in the way to hell. Luke</hi> 16. <hi>Dives</hi> there, he was so full that he forgot poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and now he must pinch for it in Hell-flames, burning in torments for ever. A Christian may have great occasion of mirth: but then we must have most care of all.

Is this a time to be so <hi>desperate</hi>? It is true, perhaps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow we shall dye, but is this a time to drink and swill, and feast: <hi>no it is rather a time to deny our selves</hi>; for wee may be shut up in our houses before tomorrow night, and perhaps dye tomorrow, and be swept away with the <hi>Plague: is this a time to gorge our selves with eating and drinking</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94800:5"/>what issue may we expect from hence: we had indeed a day of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> but we had need, that the next day should have bin a day of <hi>Humiliation</hi>; for then was the Plague amongst us.</p>
               <p>Indeed, when the motion of <hi>humiliation</hi> was made, one in the City (&amp; <hi>that of great note too</hi>) made answer, that <hi>Winter</hi> was comming on, and then the Plague would be stayed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> We have had many dayes of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> both publick, and private.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Those that doe so, doe well, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. If they doe it in sincerity. Many that doe it in their private <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> shall have a blessing on them. But let not this content us, that others doe it; but let us all, each in our <hi>Families,</hi> humble our selves by Fasting and Prayer, every Parish, and every Family. I hope this is not against the Law, I am sure it is not against Gods Law, to have such meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord stirre up the hearts of all those whom it doth concerne to call for Fasting and Prayer, in these evill times.</hi>
