            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Dare not venture to send this Play bare-fac'd
into the World, without saying something in
its Defence: I am very sensible of the many
nice Judgments I expose my self to, who may justly
find an infinite Number of Faults in it; which, I
profess ingenuously, I am not able to mend; for,
indeed, I am altogether unacquainted with the Stage
and those Dramatick Rules, which others have with
so much Art and Success observed. It was the
first I ever made Publick by appearing on the Stage,
which, (with the Advantage it met with, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Acting) is all the Recommendations I have for
exposing it, in its own naked Simplicity, without any
Ornaments of Language or Wit; therefore, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the best Apology I can make for my Self and
Play, is, that 'tis the Error of a weak Woman's Pen,
one altogether unlearn'd, ignorant of any, but her
Mother-Tongue, and very far from being a perfect
Mistress of that too; and confess I have but just Wit
enough to discern I want it infinitely; yet these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb facs="tcp:50798:3"/>
which should have dissuaded me, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the Inclinations I had for Scribling from my
Childhood. And when our Island enjoyed the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Incomparable Mrs <hi>Behn,</hi> even then I had
much ado to keep my Muse from shewing her Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence;
but, since her death, has claim'd a kind of
Privilege; and, in spite of me, broke from her
Confinement.</p>
            <p>The Plot was taken from a small Novel; which, I
must needs own, had Design and Scope enough to
have made an excellent Play, had it met with the
good Fortune to have fall'n into better Hands; but,
as it is, I venture to send it abroad, where, if it finds
but a favourable Reception from my own Sex, and
some little Incouragement from the other, I will
study in my next to deserve it: Which then, perhaps,
may make me ambitious enough to be known; but,
in the mean time, I humbly beg the Favour to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

            <l>THis is a Woman's Treat y'are like to find;</l>
            <l>Ladies, for Pity; Men, for Love be kind;</l>
            <l>Else here I come, her Champion, to oppose</l>
            <l>The two broad-sides of dreadful Wits and Beaux:</l>
            <l>'Tis odds indeed; but if my Sword won't do,</l>
            <l>I can produce another Weapon too.—</l>
            <l>But to my Task,—Our Author hopes indeed,</l>
            <l>You will not think, though charming <hi>Aphra</hi>'s dead,</l>
            <l>All Wit with her, and with <hi>Orinda</hi>'s fled.</l>
            <l>We promis'd boldly we wou'd do her Right,</l>
            <l>Not like the other House, who, out of spite,</l>
            <l>Trump'd up a Play upon us in a Night.</l>
            <l>And it was scarcely thought on at the most,</l>
            <l>But Hey-Boys, <hi>Presto!</hi> conjur'd on the Post.</l>
            <l>These Champions bragg'd they first appear'd in Field,</l>
            <l>Then bid us tamely article and yield;</l>
            <l>So did the <hi>French,</hi> and thought themselves secure;</l>
            <l>But, to their cost, have fairly lost <hi>Namur.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And so much, Gentlemen, by way of Satyr,</l>
            <l>Now I am come t' examine your good Nature:</l>
            <l>Since 'tis a Lady hopes to please to Night,</l>
            <l>I'm sure you Beau's will do the Ladies Right.</l>
            <l>Clap ev'ry Scene; and do your selves the honour,</l>
            <l>Loudly to boast the Favours you have done her.</l>
            <l>So may the <hi>Play-House, Park,</hi> and <hi>Mall</hi> befriend you,</l>

            <byline>Written by Mr. Motteux.</byline>
            <l>OVR Poetess is troubled in her Mind,</l>
            <l>Like some young Thing, not so discreet as kind,</l>
            <l>Who, Without Terms, has her dear Toy resign'd.</l>
            <l>You all are wild to bring her to the touch;</l>
            <l>You beg, you press, you swear, and promise much;</l>
            <l>'Twere well if your performances were such.</l>
            <l>Our Authress now is in, at your Devotion,</l>
            <l>Tho' she, perhaps to please you, want the Notion,</l>
            <l>Be gen'rous once, she'll quickly mend her Motion.</l>
            <l>For, pray take notice, 'tis her Maidenhead,</l>
            <l>(that of her Brain I mean) and you that wed</l>
            <l>Feel seldom easie Joys, till that is fled.</l>
            <l>If you are kind, she's willing to go on;</l>
            <l>But if you turn her off, the Nymph turns Nun;</l>
            <l>And what a scandal wou'd be to the Nation,</l>
            <l>Sheu'd some for want of Trade leave their Vocation;</l>
            <l>And, among Friars <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>Occupation?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I'm much afraid a Woman's like a Play,</l>
            <l>Yeu'd have 'em new and pretty ev'ry Day,</l>
            <l>Or, else, your Servant; 'Gad I cannot stay.</l>
            <l>'Tis true, you wait a while in expectation</l>
            <l>(When up the Curtain flies) of Recreation;</l>
            <l>But you all go, when ere <hi>the Play</hi> is done;</l>
            <l>Then down the Curtain drops, and whip you're gone,</l>
            <l>And thence to tell ungrateful Truths you run.</l>
            <l>Be kinder; let our unknown Fair appease ye,</l>
            <l>Tho' you mislike her Play, her Face may please ye:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:50798:4"/>
She hides it now, yet she mislikes the Task,</l>
            <l>But knows how much you love a Visard Mask.</l>
            <l>Yet sure she must be safe among You here;</l>
            <l>We Beaux can ne're be Criticks on the Fair:</l>
            <l>As for you, Judges, if I rightly know ye,</l>
            <l>You shou'd think that ungrateful Task below ye.</l>
            <l>Ye Braves, that made your Campaign at the Wells,</l>
            <l>Storming the Breach of some Fair Citadels,</l>
            <l>If kind, may chance to find out where she dwells.</l>
            <l>Ladies, for your own sakes you must be kind;</l>
            <l>Lest, while we scarce one writing Beauty find,</l>
            <l>Vain Man deny your Sex the Graces of the Mind.</l>
            <l>Take you her part, the Men of course submit,</l>
            <l>And so your Beauty shall secure her Wit.</l>
            <l>Let all these Reasons kindly draw you in,</l>

than the scandalous World will allow to our Petticoats, which we could
not attempt this Undertaking in without hazard to our Modesty. Besides,
should I meet with the Man whose outside please me, 'twill be impossible by
any other means to discover his Humour; for they are so used to flatter and
deceive our Sex, that there's nothing but the Angel appears, tho' the Devil lies
lurking within, and never so much as shews his Paw till he has got his Prey

a good Housewife; or else some gay young fluttering Thing, who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Beau, and wants my Fortune to maintain him in that Character:
Such an opinionated Animal, who believes there needs no more to reach a
Ladies Heart than a boon mien, fine Dress, the Perriwig well adjusted, the
Hand well managed in taking Snuff, to shew the fine Diamond-Ring, if he's
worth one; sometimes a conceited Laugh, with the Mouth stretch'd from one
Ear to t'other, to discover the white Teeth, with sneak and cringe in an affected
Tone, cries Damn me, Madam, if you are not the prettiest Creature my Eyes
ere saw! 'Tis impossible for me to live if you are so cruel to deny me; with
a world of such foolish stuff, which they talk all by rote; no, my <hi>Julia,</hi> I'll

                  <p>No, I dare swear for her; however frollicksome she is in her
Humour, she'd scorn to look on any Thing was basely born: but I
have often heard her declare she would, when ever she married,
match her self where she found more Merit than Estate. I know so
