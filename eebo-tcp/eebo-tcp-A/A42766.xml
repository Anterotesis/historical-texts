            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though they digge deep to hide their counsels; is not this a time of Gods over-reaching and befoolling all plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wits? they have conceived iniquity, and they shall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But albeit these be foule sports in the Churches face, which offend the eyes of her glorious Bridegroome, Jesus Christ, yet that which doth lesse appeare, is more dangerous, and that is the cause of all this evill, in the very bowells and heart of the Church; the people of the land, great and small, have not as yet prepared their hearts unto the Lord their God: mercy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the land, but the land is not prepared for mercy; I shall say no more of the disease at this instant.</p>

The particulars whereof, I shall not touch, till I have in the first place resolved a difficult, yet profitable question.</p>

            <p>I am herein very much strengthned while I observe <note n="t" place="margin">Compare <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 37. 27. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 2. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 3, 4, 5. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 1. &amp; 21. 15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 2. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 8, 9. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16, 17. &amp; 21. 24. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 2. &amp; 39. 1. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 8 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 12. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 1. to v. 8. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 4. to v. 9. <hi>Ezek</hi> 48 31, 32 33, 34. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 12, 13. 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 4 with <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 11. &amp; 4. 1.</note> many parallel passages betwixt the vision of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the Revelation of <hi>Iohn;</hi> and while I remember withall that the Prophets doe in many places fore-tell the institution of the Ordinances, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Worship of the New Testament, under the termes of Temple, Priests, Sacrifices, &amp;c. and do set forth the deliverance and stability of the Church of Christ, under the notions of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> of bringing back the captivity, &amp;c. God speaking to his people at that time, so as they might best understand him.</p>
            <p>Now if you aske, how the severall particulars in the vision may be particularly expounded, and applyed to the Church of Christ? I answer, the Word of God, the <hi>River that makes glad the Citie of God,</hi> though it have many easie and knowne Foords, where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41601:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any of Christs Lambs may passe thorow, yet in this Vision and other places of this kind, it is <hi>a great deep,</hi> where the greatest Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant (as he said) may swim. I shall not say with the Jewes, that one should not read the last nine Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> before he be thirty yeers old: Surely a man may be twice thirty yeers old, and a good Divine too, and yet not able to understand this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Some tell us, that no man can understand it without skill in <hi>Geometry,</hi> which cannot be denyed: but there is greater need of <hi>Ecclesiometry,</hi> if I may so speak, to measure the Church in her length or continuance through many generations; in her breadth or spreading through many Nations; her depth of humiliation, sorrowes, and sufferings: her height of faith, hope, joy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to measure each part according to this pattern here set before us.</p>
            <p>Wherein, for my part, I must professe (as <hi>Socrates</hi> in another case) <hi>Scio quod nescio.</hi> I know that there is a great mystery here which I cannot reach. Only I shall let forth unto you that little light which the father of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ights hath given me.</p>
            <p>I conceive that the Holy Ghost in this Vision hath pointed at foure severall times and conditions of the Church; that wee <note place="margin">Foure things holden forth in the Vision. 1. The materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Temple as a Type.</note> may take with us the full meaning, without addition or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.</p>
            <p>Observing this rule, that what agreeth not to the Type, must be meant of the thing typified; and what is not fulfilled at one time, must be fulfilled of the Church at another time. <note place="margin">v Codex Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doth cum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentariis Const. l'Emper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First of all, it cannot be denyed, that he points in some sort at the restitution of the Temple, worship of God, and City of Jerusalem, after the captivitie, as a type of the Church of Christ: for though many things in the vision do not agree to that time, as hath been proved, yet some things doe agree: this as it is least intended in the Vision, so it is not fit for me at this time to insist upon it. But he that would understand the forme of the Temple of Jerusalem, the severall parts, and excellent structure thereof, will find enough <hi>(b)</hi> written of that subject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this and other prophecies of building againe the Temple, may well be applyed to the building of the Christian Church by the Master-builders the Apostles, and by other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41601:6"/>
of the Gospel since their dayes: Let us heare but two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Apostles themselves applying those prophecies to <note place="margin">2. The Church of the Gentiles</note> the calling of the Gentiles; the one is <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 6. 16. For ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> The other is <hi>James,</hi> who applyeth to the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that prophecie of <hi>Amos, After this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruines thereof, and I will set it up,</hi> Act. 15. 16.</p>
            <p>But there is a third thing aimed at in this prophesie, and that more principally then any of the other two, which is the repairing of the <note place="margin">3. A more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church in the latter dayes.</note> breaches and ruines of the Christian Church, and the building up of <hi>Zion</hi> in her glory, about the time of the destruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and the conversion of the Jewes; and this happinesse hath the Lord reserved to the last times, to build a more excellent and glorious Temple then former generations have seen. I meane not of the building of the materiall. Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which the Jewes doe fancie and look for; But I speak of the Church and people of God; and that I may not seeme to expound an obscure Prophesie too conjecturally, which many in these <note place="margin">Proved by five reasons.</note> dayes doe, I have these Evidences following, for what I say.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> in those places which I last cited, doe apply the prophesies of building a new Temple to the first fruits of the Gentiles, and to their first conversion, then they are much more to be applyed to the fulnesse of the Gentiles, and most of all to the fulnesse both of Jewes and Gentiles, which we wait for. <hi>Now if the fall of them</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 11. 12.</note> (saith the Apostle, speaking of the Jewes) <hi>be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulnesse?</hi> And <note n="y" place="margin">Ib. vers. 15.</note> again, <hi>If the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world; what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</hi> Plainly insinuating a greater encrease of the Church, and a larger spread of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, at the conversion of the Jewes, and so a fairer Temple, yea another world in a manner to be looked for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord himselfe in this same chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. speaking of the Temple here prophesied of, saith, <hi>The place of my Throne,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41601:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they nor their Kings &amp;c.</hi> Which as it cannot be understood of the Jewes after the Captivity, who did againe forsake the Lord, and were forsaken of him, as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> noteth upon the place; so it can as ill be said, to bee already fulfilled upon the Christian Church, but rather that such a Church is yet to be expected in which the Lord shall take up his dwelling for ever, and shall not be provoked by their defilements and whoredomes, againe to take away his Kingdom, and to remove the Candlestick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This last Temple is also prophesied of by <note n="z" place="margin">Isa. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Isa. 2. 2. And it shall come to passe in the last dayes, that the mountaine of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountaines</hi> (even as here <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did see this Temple <hi>upon a very high mountaine, chap 40. 2.) and shall be exalted above the hils, and all Nations shall flow unto it, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ib. v. 4.</note> 
               <hi>And they shal beat their swords into Plough shares, and their speares into pruning books: nation shall not lift up sword against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither shall they learn war any more.</hi> Here is the building of such a Temple as shall bring peaceable and quiet times to the Church, of which that Evangelicall Prophet speaketh in <note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 11 9. &amp; 60. 17, 18.</note> other places also. And if we shall read that which followeth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 5. as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase doth. <hi>And the men of the house of Jacob shall say, Come yee, &amp;c.</hi> then the building of the Temple there spoken of, shall appeare to be ioyned with the Jewes conversion; But howsoever, it is ioyned with a great peace and calme, such as yet the Church hath not seen.</p>

            <p>I shall here build onely one Doctrine, which will be of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great use for such a day as this. <hi>If either we would have mercy to our selves, or would doe acceptable service in the publike Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we must not onely cease to doe evill and learne to doe well, but also be ashamed, confounded, and humbled for our former evill wayes.</hi> Here is a two-fold necessity, which presseth upon us this duty, to loath and abhorre our selves for all our abominations, to bee greatly abashed and confounded before our God.

and laid in the dust, that <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> the Lord may be just when he speaketh, and cleare when he judgeth.

And how shall wee think, that it can stand with the honour of the most high God, that wee seem to draw neare unto him, and to walk in his wayes, while in the mean time we do not acknowledge our iniquitie, and even accuse, shame, judge and condemne our selves? Nay <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the first necessity of the duty which this Text holdeth forth. The Lord requireth of us not onely to doe his will for the future, but to be ashamed for what we have done amisse before.</p>
            <p>The other necessity of it (which is also in the Text) is this, that <note place="margin">As the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, so is the judgement.</note> except we be thus ashamed and humbled, God hath not promised to shew us the pattern of his house, nor to reveale his will unto us. Which agreeth well with that <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>The meek will he teach his way:</hi> and <hi>vers. 12. What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall chuse,</hi> and <hi>vers. 14. The secret of the Lord is with them that feare him, and hee will shew them his Covenant.</hi> There is <hi>sanctification</hi> in the affections, and here is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41601:9"/>
               <hi>humiliation</hi> in the affections, spoken of as necessary means of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the knowledge of the will of God. Let the affections be ordered aright, then light which is offered, shall be seen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but let light be offered, when disordered affections doe overcloud the eye of the minde, then all is in vaine.</p>
            <p>In this case, a man shall be <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 58. 4, 5.</note> like <hi>the deaf Adder,</hi> which will not be taken by the voice of the charmers, <hi>charming never so wisely.</hi> Let the helme of reason be stirred, as well as you can imagine, if there be a contrary winde in the sailes of the affections, the ship will not answere to the helme. It is a good argument: hee is a wicked man, a covetous man, a proud man, a carnall man, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled man. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he will readily miscarry in his judgement. So Divines have argued against the Popes infallibility. The Pope hath been, and may be a profane man. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he may erre in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and decrees. And what wonder, that they who receive not the love of the truth, be given over <note n="z" place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 9, 10.</note> to <hi>strong delusion, that they should beleeve a lie?</hi> It is as good an argument. Hee is a humbled man, and a man that feareth God. <hi>Ergo</hi> (in so far as he acteth and exerciseth those graces) the Lord shall teach him in the way that he shall choose. I say, in so farre as he acteth those graces: because when he grieves the spirit, and cherisheth the flesh, when the child of God is more swayed by his corruptions, then by his graces, then he is in great danger to be given up to the counsell of his own heart, and to be deserted by <note n="a" place="margin">Io. 16. 13.</note> the holy Ghost, which should leade him <hi>into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we must take notice of a seeming contradiction here in the <note place="margin">An Obiection answered.</note> Text. God saith to the Prophet in the former <hi>verse, Shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities.</hi> And <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is first instructed, then ashamed. And here it is quite turned over in my Text; If they be ashamed, shew them the House.</p>
            <p>I shall not here make any digression unto the debates and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of School-men, what influence and power the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have upon the understanding and the will. I will content my self with this plain answer. Those two might very well stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: light is a help to humiliation, and humiliation a help to light. As there must be some work of faith, and some apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41601:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Love of God, in order before true Evangelicall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet this repentance helpeth us, to beleeve more firmly, that our sinnes are forgiven. The soul in the pains of the new birth, is like <note n="b" place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which appeareth in that woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47, 48. shee wept much, because she loved much, she loved much, because shee beleeved, and by faith had her heart enlarged, with apprehending the rich grace, and free love of Christ to poore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: this faith moves her bowells, melts her heart, stirres her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, kindles her affection. Then, and not till then, she gets a prop to her faith, and a sure ground to build upon. It is not till shee have wept much, that Christ intimates mercy, and saith, <hi>Thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> Just so is the case in this Text. Shew them the House, saith the Lord, that they may be ashamed; Give them a view of it, that they may think the worse of themselves, that they want it, that they may be ashamed for all their iniquities, whereby they have separate betwixt their God and themselves, so that they can not <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 27 4.</note>

               <hi>their glory is their shame,</hi> and if the Lord doe not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes to see their shame, <hi>their end</hi> will be <hi>destruction.</hi> Is it a light matter to swear and blaspheme, to coine and spread lies, to devise calumnies, to break Treaties, to contrive trecherous plots, to exercise so many barbarous cruelties, to shed so much blood, and (as if that were too little) to bury men quick? Is all this no matter of shame? And when they have so often professed to be for the true Protestant Religion, shall they not be ashamed to thirst so much after Protestant blood, and in that cause desire to associate themselves with all the Papists at home and abroad, whose assistance they can have, and particularly with those match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse monsters (they call them Subjects) of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who (if the computation fail not) have shed the blood of some hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in that Kingdome? for our part, it seems, they are resolved to give the worst name to the best thing, which wee can doe, and therefore they have not been ashamed to call a Religious and Loyall Covenant, a traiterous and damnable Covenant.

ceaseth to do evill, but repenteth not of the evill, he who applieth himselfe to reformation, but is not ashamed of former defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is in danger both of Gods displeasure, and of miscarrying in his judgement about Reformation.

            <p>

            <p>Secondly, VVhen the Ministers of State, or others, having authority in Church or Common-wealth, take the boldnesse to doe such acts, the Kingdome is not blamelesse; for they durst not have done as they did, had the Land but disclaimed, discountenanced, and cryed out against them.

Rogers <hi>of faith,</hi> chap. 10.</note> yet the servants of God have charged it with great presumption, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath said <note n="s" place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> with the Church of <hi>Laodicea, I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.</hi> It hath bin proud of its Clergy, learning, great revenues, peace, plenty, wealth, and abundance of all things. And as the Apostle <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 2.</note> chargeth the <hi>Corinthians, yee are puffed up, and have not rather mourned,</hi> that the wicked ones <hi>might be taken away from among you.</hi> And would God this presumption had taken an end when God did begin to afflict the Land. It did even make an Idoll of this Parliament, and trusted to its owne strength and Armies; which hath provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God so much, that he hath sometimes almost blasted your hopes that way, and hath made you to feele your weaknesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where you thought your selves strongest: God would not have <hi>England</hi> say, <note n="u" place="margin">Iude 7. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Mine owne hand hath saved me.</hi> Neither will he have <hi>Scotland</hi> to say, <hi>My hand hath done it:</hi> But he wil have both to say, His hand hath done it, when we were lost in our own eyes. God grant that your leaning so much upon the arme of flesh bee not the cause of more blowes. God must be seen in the worke, and he will have us to give him all the glorie, and to say <note n="x" place="margin">Isa. 26. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast wrought all our works for us.</hi> O that all our presumption may be repented of, and that the land may be yet more deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Assuredly God will arise and subdue our enemies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand deliverances for <hi>Jacob:</hi> but it is as certaine, God will not doe this, till we be more humbled, and (as the Text saith) asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all that we have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> there is another Motive more Evangelicall: let <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be humbled even for the mercy, the most admirable mercy <note place="margin">4 Because of Gods goodnes.</note> which God hath shewed upon so undeserving, and evill deserving a Kingdome. See it in this same Prophecy: <note n="y" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 62, 63.</note> 
               <hi>I will establish my Covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord That thou maist remember, and bee confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41601:14"/>
all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</hi> And <note n="z" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 32.</note> again: <hi>Not for your sakes doe I this, saith the Lord God, be it knoun unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your owne wayes O house of Israel. O my God</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ezra 9. 6.</note> saith <hi>Ezra, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee.</hi> And what was it that did so confound him? you may find it in that which followeth: God had shewed them mercy, and had left them a remnant to escape, and had given them a naile in his holy place, and had lightned their eyes. <hi>And now,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ib. vers. 10.</note> saith he, <hi>O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Let us this day compare (as he did) Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and our own guiltinesse. <hi>England</hi> deserved nothing, but to get a bill of divorce, and that God should have said in his wrath, Away from me, I have no pleasure in you: but now hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you into the bond of his Covenant, he rejoyceth over you to doe you good, and to dwell among you, his Banner over you is love. O let our hard hearts be overcome and be confounded with so much mercy, and let us be ashamed of our selves, that after so much mercy, we should be yet in our sinnes and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</p>
            <p>There is a third application, which I intend for the Ministerie, <note place="margin">3 Application to the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance rare.</note> who ought to goe before the people of God in the example of Repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>tance and humiliation. You know the old observation, <hi>Rarò vidi Clericum poenitentem, I have seldome seen a Clergie man penitent.</hi> As Christ <note n="c" place="margin">Mark 10. 24, 25.</note> saith of rich men, I may say of learned men, it is easier for a Camell to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a man that trusts in his Learning to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of heaven. He will needs maintaine the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of all which he hath done, and will not bee (as this Text would have him) ashamed of all that hee hath done. Yet it is not impossible with God to make such a one deny himselfe, and that <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. Yet examples there bee of it</note> whatsoever in him exalts it selfe against Christ, should bee brought in captivity to the obedience of Christ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all that were converted by the Ministerie of the Apostles, I wonder most at the conversion of a great company of Priests, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 7. I doe not suspect (as <note n="e" place="margin">Casaubon. <hi>&amp;</hi> Beza.</note> two learned men have done) that the Text is corrupted in that place, and that it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41601:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should be otherwise read. I am the rather satisfied, because there is nothing there mentioned of the Conversion of the high Priest, or of the chiefe Priests, the heads of the four and twenty Orders, which were upon the Councell, and had condemned Christ: the place cannot be understood, but of a multitude of common or inferiour Priests: Even as by proportion in <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi> Reformation, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Chron. 29. 34.</note> 
               <hi>the Levites were more upright in heart than the Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now many of the Inferiour Clergie (as they were abusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called) are more upright in heart, unto this present reformation then any of those who had assumed to themselves high degrees in the Church. The hardest point of all is, so to embrace and follow reformation, as to be ashamed of former prevarications and pollutions. But in this also the holy Ghost hath set exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before the Ministers of the Gospel. I read 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 15. The Priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt-offerings into the House of the Lord.</hi> They thought it not enough to be sanctified, but they were ashamed that they had been before defiled. A great Prophet is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have his Judgement rectified, which had been in an errour, but he is ashamed of the errour he had been in. <note n="g" place="margin">Psa. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41601:15"/>
be ashamed for it, God shall make them bear their shame, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is pronounced in the next Chapter, verse 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. against the Levites, who had gone astray, when <hi>Israel</hi> went astray after their Idolls: and according to that <hi>Malach. 2, 8, 9. Ye have corrupted the Covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of Hosts, Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and last application of this doctrine, is for every Christian. The Text teacheth us a difference betwixt a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, <note place="margin">4. Application to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</note> and a truly humbled sinner. The one is ashamed of his sinnes, the other not. By this mark, let every one of us trie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self this day. It is a saving grace to be truly and really ashamed of sinne. It is one of the promises of the Covenant of grace, <note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Then shall ye remember your owne evill wayes, and your doings that were not good, and shall loath your selves in your owne sight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> Trie then, if thou hast but thus much of the work of grace in thy soul, and if thou hast, be assured of thy interest in Christ and in the New Covenant. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate may have somewhat which is very like this grace; but <hi>I</hi> shall lay open the difference, betwixt the one and the other, in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To be truly ashamed of sinne, is to be ashamed of it as an <note place="margin">Five markes of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of the childe of God, and that of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</note> act of filthinesse and uncleannesse. The childe of God, when he comes to the throne of grace, is ashamed of an unclean heart. though the world cannot see it. A naturall man at his best look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon sinne, as it damneth and destroyeth the soule, but hee cannot look upon it, as it defiles the soul. Shame ariseth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a filthy act, though no other evill be to follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As wee are ashamed of acts of filthinesse, so of acts of folly. A naturall man may iudge himself a fool in regard of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or consequents of this sinne, but he is not convinced that sinne in it self is an act of madnesse and folly. When the childe of God is humbled <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 18.</note> hee becomes a foole in his own eyes, hee perceives he hath done like a mad foole; Therefore hee is said then to <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 15. 17.</note> come to himself.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41601:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
3. The childe of God is ashamed of sinne <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 130 4. Rom. 2. 4.</note> as an act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse and unthankfulnesse to a sweet mercifull Lord: though there were no other evill in sinne, the conscience of so much mercy and love so farre abused, and so unkindly recompensed, is that which confoundeth a penitent sinner. As the wife of a kinde husband, if she play the whore (though the world know it not) and if her husband, when he might divorce her, shall still love her and receive her into his bosome; such a one, if she have at all any sense or any bowels of sorrow, must needs bee swallowed up of shame and confusion for her undutifulnesse and treachery to such a husband. But now the Hypocrite is not at all troubled or afflicted in spirit for sinne as it is an act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Shame, <note n="o" place="margin">Gellius lib. 19. cap. 6. Pudor est timor justae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensionis. Ita enim Philosophi definiunt, <gap reason="foreign">

The childe of God is ashamed of the very guiltinesse, and of that which may bee justly laid to his charge: the Hypocrite not so. <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 15 30.</note> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> was not ashamed of his sinne, but he was ashamed that <hi>Samuel</hi> should reprove him before the Elders of the people. Christs adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were ashamed, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 17. not of their errour, but because their mouthes were stopped before the people, and they could not answer him. A hypocrite is ashamed, <note n="q" place="margin">Ier. 2. 26.</note> 
               <hi>as a thiefe is ashamed when he is found;</hi> mark that, <hi>when he is found:</hi> a thiefe is not ashamed of his sinne, but because he is found in it, and so brought to a shamefull end.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the cause of God is in hand, a true penitent is so ashamed of himselfe, that he feares the people of God shall be put to shame for his sake, and that it shall goe the worse with them, because of his vilenesse and guiltinesse. This made <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 69. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> pray, <hi>O God, thou knowest my foolishnesse, and my sinnes are not hid from thee: let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for my sake, O God of Israel.</hi> The sorrow and shame of a hypocrite (as all his other seeming graces) are rooted in self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, not in the love of God: he hath not this in all his thoughts, that he is a Spot or Blemish in the body or Church of Christ,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41601:16"/>
and therefore to be humbled, lest for his sake God be displeased with his people; lest such a vile and abhominable sinner as he is bring wrath and confusion upon others, and make Israel turne their back before the enemy. O happy soule that hath such thoughts as these.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the first part of the Text, wherein I <note place="margin">Second part of the Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> have beene the larger, because it most fitteth the work of the day.</p>
            <p>The second followes, <hi>Shew them the forme of the house,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Doctrines which doe here arise, I shall first explaine the particulars mentioned in this part of the Text, so as they may agree to the spirituall Temple or Church of Christ, which in the beginning I proved to be here intended.</p>
            <p>First, wee finde here the forme and fashion of a house, in which the parts are very much diversified one from another: <note place="margin">The fashion of the house.</note> there are in a formed and fashioned house, doores, windowes, posts, lintels, &amp;c. There is also a multitude of common stones in the walls of the house. Such a house is the visible ministeriall Church of Christ, the parts whereof are <hi>partes dissimilares,</hi> some Ministers, and Rulers, some eminent Lights; others of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rank of Christians, that make up the walls. If God hath made one but a small pinning in the wall, he hath reason to be content, and must not say, why am not I a post, or a corner stone, or a beame? Neither yet may any corner stone despise the stones in the wall, and say, I have no need of you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Prophet was here to shew them <hi>the goings out</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The gates.</note> 
               <hi>of the house, and the commings in thereof.</hi> These are not the same, but different gates; it is plaine, <hi>chap. 46. 9. When the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the land shall come before the Lord in the solemne feasts, hee that entreth in by the way of the north-gate to worship, shall goe out by the way of the south-gate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he shall not returne by the way of the gate whereby hee came in.</hi> And that not only to teach us order, and the avoiding of confusion (occasioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tides of a multitude) but to tell us further, that <note n="s" place="margin">Luke 9. 62.</note> 
               <hi>no man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdome of God.</hi> Wee must not goe out of the Church the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41601:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way that we came in, (that were a doore of defection) but hold our faces forward till we go out by the doore of death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Text hath twice <hi>all the formes thereof:</hi> which I <note place="margin">The formes within and without.</note> understand of the outward formes, and of the inward formes; which two I finde very much distinguished by those who have written of the forme and structure of the Temple. The Church is exceedingly beautified, even outwardly, with the Ordinances of Christ; but the inward formes are the most glorious: <note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 17. 20, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>For behold the kingdome of God is within you:</hi> and it <hi>commeth not with observation.</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 45. 13.</note> 
               <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within;</hi> yet even <hi>her clothing is of wrought gold.</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Chap. 42. 15.</note> When the Angel had made an end of measuring the inner house, then hee brought forth <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by the east-gate (which was the chiefe gate by which the people commonly entred) and measured the utter wall in the last place. Gods method is, first to try the heart and reines, then to give to a man according to his works, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 10. So should we measure by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>eed of the Sanctuary, first, the inner house of our hearts and minds, and then to measure our utter walls, and to judge of our profession and externall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Prophet is commanded to write in their sight <hi>all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The laws of it.</note> 
               <hi>the ordinances thereof, and all the lawes thereof:</hi> for the Church is a house, not only in an <hi>Architectonick</hi> but in an <hi>Oeconomick</hi> sense: It is Christs Family governed by his own Lawes; and a <note n="y" place="margin">Rev. 11. 1.</note> Temple which hath in it <hi>them that worship,</hi> it hath the owne proper lawes of it, by which it is ordered. <hi>Aliae sunt leges Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarum, aliae Christi,</hi>

two is wanting: for the light of truth without the engraving of truth, may bee extinguished: and the engraving of truth, without the light of truth, may be obliterate.</p>
            <p>All these I shall passe, and only pitch upon two Doctrines which I shall draw from this second part of the Text: One concerning the will of Gods commandement, what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of Israel to doe; Another concerning the will of Gods decree, what he hath purposed himselfe to doe.</p>

            <p>The Text giveth some clearing to this point.

            <p>But to cleare it a little further, I put two characters upon those circumstances which are not determined by the word of God, but left to be ordered by the Church, as shall be found most convenient. First, they are not things sacred, nor proper to the Church, as hath beene said; they are of the same nature, they serve for the same end and use, both in sacred and civill things: for order and decency, the avoiding of confusion and the like, are alike common to Church and Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I shall describe them as <note n="o" place="margin">

               </note> a short application of the Doctrine unto you (Honourable and Beloved) you may plainly see from what hath beene said, that neither Kings, nor Parliaments, nor Synods, nor any power on earth, may impose or continue the least Ceremony upon the consciences of Gods people, which Christ hath not imposed. Therefore let neither antiquity, nor custome, nor conveniency, nor prudentiall considerations, nor shew of holinesse, nor any pretext whatsoever, plead for the reservation of any of your old Ceremonies, which have no ground nor warrant from the word of God.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41601:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vers. 7. in this same Chapter, and with Chap. 37. 26, 27. will easily make it appeare, that this shewing of the patterne, and all this measuring, was not only in reference to Israels duty, but to Gods gracious purpose towards Israel: According to that <hi>Zechar. 1. 16. Therefore thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall bee built in it, saith the Lord of Hostes, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Now this vision cannot be said to be fulfilled in <hi>Zorobabels</hi> Temple, as I proved before: Only here take notice, that the second destruction of the Temple by the <hi>Romans,</hi> was worse then the first by the <hi>Babylonians:</hi> That desolation was repaired; but this could never be repaired, though <note n="t" place="margin">Wolph. lection. memor.

And about the same time (to observe that by the way) the famous Delphick Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was without mans hand, by fire and earthquake, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and never built againe; To tell the world, that neither Judaisme, nor Paganisme should prevaile, but the Kingdome of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Where then must we seek for the accomplishment of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> vision, I meane for the new Temple, in which the Lord will dwell for ever, and where his holy Name shall be no more polluted? Surely we must seek for it in the dayes of the Gospel, as hath beene before abundantly proved. But that the thing may be the better understood, let us take with us, at least, some few generall observations, concerning this Temple of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as it representeth what should come to passe in the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>First of all, there is but one Temple, not many shewed to <note place="margin">The Churches unity.</note> him: which is in part, and shall bee yet more fulfilled in the Church of the new Testament; according to that <hi>Zech. 8. 9. And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall goe out of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> Which is the same that we have <hi>Ezech.</hi> 47. 1. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; <hi>And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.</hi> The like promise

we finde elsewhere; <note n="u" place="margin">Ier. 32. 39. Ezech. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way.</hi> It is observed, that for this very end of uniformity, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens also did erect Temples, that they might all worship the same Idoll God in the same manner. The plague of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church hitherto hath beene Temple against Temple, and Altar against Altar. <note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 6. 3.</note> 
               <hi>But thou O Lord, how long?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Temple and City are very large and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, <note place="margin">Her encrease.</note> as I shewed in the beginning; and <note n="y" place="margin">Ezech. 48. 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> the City had three gates looking toward each of the foure quarters of the world.

               </note> the holy waters issuing from the threshold of the Temple, and rising so high, that they were waters to swimme in. God hath said to his Church; <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 54. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the place of thy Tent, and let them stretch forth the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left.</hi>

               <hi>the fountaines of the great deep,</hi> and open <hi>the windowes of heaven:</hi> and the Gospel will prove a second flood which will over-flow the whole earth, though not to destroy it (as <hi>Noahs</hi> did) but to make it glad: <note n="g" place="margin">

            <p>The fourth thing wherein <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Temple representeth the <note place="margin">Her strength.</note> Church of Christ, is in regard of the great strength thereof. <note n="u" place="margin">Chap. 40. 2.</note> It stood <hi>upon a very high mountaine.</hi> The materiall Temple also in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as it is described by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> was a very strong and impregnable place.

               </note> some of our sound and learned Writers, who have had occasion to expresse their judgement about it. And it hath no affinity with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an earthly or temporall kingdome of Christ: or of the Jewes their building againe of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the materiall Temple; and their obtaining a dominion above all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: or the like</p>
            <p>I shall now bring home the point. There are very good grounds of hope, to make us think that this new Temple is not farre off: And (for your part) that Christ is to make a new face of a Church in this Kingdome, a faire and beautifull Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for his glory to dwell in: And hee is even now about the work.</p>
            <p>For first, <hi>the set time</hi> to build <hi>Zion</hi> is come, when the people of God <hi>take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof, Psal.</hi> 102. 13, 14, 16. The stones which the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> refused, are now chosen for corner stones; and the stones which they choosed, doe the builders of <hi>Zion</hi> now refuse: <hi>Ier.</hi> 51. 26. <hi>They shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations.</hi> Those that have any thing of Christ and of the Image of God in them, begin to creep out of the dust of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41601:21"/>
and to appeare like starres of the morning. Nay to go further then that, the old stones the Iewes, who have beene for so many ages lying forgotten in the dust, those poore <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 147. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Outcasts of Israel</hi> have of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ate come more into remembrance, and have beene more thought of, and more prayed for then they were in former generations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, are there not great preparations and instruments <note place="margin">Application to this time. Six signs that God is to build a new Temple in <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> fitted for the work? Hath not God called together for such a time as this, the present Parliament, and the Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, his <hi>Zorobabels,</hi> and <hi>Iehoshua's,</hi> and <hi>Haggaies,</hi> and <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riahs?</hi> Are there not also hewers of stones, and bearers of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens? much wholsome preaching, much praying and fasting, many petitions put up both to God and man? the Covenant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so going through the Kingdom as the chief preparation of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for the work? Is not the old rubbish of Ceremonies daily more and more shovelled away, that there may bee a clean ground? and is not the Lord by all this affliction humbling you, that there may be a deep and a sure foundation layd?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the work is begun and shall it not be finished? God hath layd the foundation, and shall he not <hi>bring forth the head stone? Zechar.</hi> 4. 7. 9. Christ hath put Antichrist from his utterworks in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and he is now come to put him from his inner works in <hi>England. His work is perfect,</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 32. 4.</note> saith <hi>Moses. I am alpha and omega,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I may adde three other signes whereby to discern the time, from <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 1. the place before cited. First, Is there not now a measuring of the Temple, Ordinances and worshippers, by <hi>a reed like unto a rod?</hi> the reed of the Sanctuary in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies hand, and the rod of Power and Law in your hand, are well met together. Secondly, there is a Court which before seemed to belong to the Temple, left out and not measured: <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 25. 29.</note> 
               <hi>from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which hee hath.</hi> The <hi>Samaritans</hi> of this time, who <note n="p" place="margin">2 King. 18. 33. 34.</note> serve the Lord, and serve their own Gods too, and do after the manners of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41601:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have professed (as they of old to the Jewes, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 2.) that they would build with you, that they will bee for the true Protestant Religion as you are, that they will also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the reformation of abuses, for the ease of tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But God doth so alienate and separate betwixt you and them, by his overruling providence, discovering their designes against you, and their deep engagements to the Popish party; as if he would say unto them, <hi>you have no portion, nor right, nor memoriall in Ierusalem, Neh.</hi> 2. 20. Or as it is in the Parable concerning those who had refused to come when they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; yea had taken the servants of Christ, and entreated them spitefully, and killed them; the great King hath said in his wrath, that they shall not taste of his supper, and hee sends forth his Armies, to destroy those Murtherers, and to burn up their City, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 6. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 24.

La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vater Hom. 9. in lib.

               <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the time seemeth to answer fitly: The new Temple is built when the 42 Moneths of the Beasts raigne, and of the treading down the holy City, (that is by the best Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1260 yeares) come to an end. This computation (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) should begin rather before the foure hundreth yeare of Christ, then after it, both because the Romane Emperour (whose falling was the Popes rising) was brought very low before that time, by the warres of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations and otherwise, which will appeare from History. And further because <note n="c" place="margin">Innoc. epist. 2. ad Victricium Rothomag.

Another of our Antiquaries noteth not long before that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that Antichrist did then begin to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to exalt himselfe over all other Bishops.</p>
            <p>Now if wee should reckon the beginning of the Beasts reign about the time of that Councel, the end of it will fall in, at this very time of curs: But I dare not determine so high a point: Gods work will ere it be long, make a clearer Commentary upon his word: Only let this bee remembred, we must not think it strange, if after the end of the 1260 yeares, Antichrist be not immediately and utterly abolished, for when that time is ended he makes warre against the Witnesses, yea overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and killeth them: But that victory of his lasteth only three dayes and a halfe, and then God makes as it were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead: and a tenth part of the great City fals before the whole fall, See <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 3. 7. 11. 13. Whether this killing of the Witnesses (which seemeth to be the last act of Antichrists power) be past, or to come, I can not say; God knowes. But assuredly, the acceptable yeare of Israels Jubilee, and the day of vengeance upon Antichrist, is comming, and is not farre off.</p>
            <p>But now is there no other application to be made of this point? Is all this said to satisfie curious wits, or at the best, to <note place="margin">The practicall use hereof.</note> comfort the people of God? Nay, there is more then so: it must be brought home to a practicall use.

               <hi>every man that hath this hope in him, purisieth himselfe:</hi> So answerably, the assurance of the new Temple, and of the sweet dayes to come, serveth for a twofold practicall use; even as <hi>David</hi> also applieth Gods promise of <hi>Solomons</hi> building the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 10. for thus hee speaketh to the Princes of Israel, ver. 19. <hi>Now set your heart and your soule to seek the Lord your God, arise therefore and build yee the sanctuary of the Lord God:</hi> And this is beside the charge which he giveth to <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

Let me therefore (Honourable Worthies) leave in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes this one point more; Many of the Servants of God who have stood in this place (and could do it better then I can) have been calling upon you to go on in the work of Reformation. <hi>O be</hi>

            <p>Set before you also the example of the Iewes, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God did stirre them up to the building of the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. 1. 2. they say not we must first build the walles of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> to hold out the enemy; but the Text saith, <hi>they began to build the house of God.</hi>
