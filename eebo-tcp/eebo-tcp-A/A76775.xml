            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Hell, and that the ſoul is mortal: denying likewiſe, that the Son of God commeth with recovering Grace, and diſcoveries and tenders of a ſpiritual and eternal Happineſſe and Glory. But to conſute them of their Errors and to evince and make forth unto the world, that there is a God, we need look no further, then <hi>Iuſtin Martirs Sermon ad Gentes,</hi> proving the unity of the Godhead out of the Heathens themſelves, <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the <hi>Sybils, Sophocles, Homer, Plato, Pythagoras,</hi> &amp;c.

               </gap>ll be ſo diligent as to deceive men of eternal Happineſſe, and bring them to unſpeakable miſery, then ſure there is ſuch a happineſſe and miſery; and the former being true, <hi>ergo</hi> the latter: for ſaith he, as the joys of heaven are beyond our conceiving; ſo alſo are the pains of Hell; everlaſting torment is unconceivable torment. Alas! doth it not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell us that there is a Divell, labouring to deprive man of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when men are drawn to commit ſuch monſtrous ſins? Such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty as the Romans uſed to the Jews at the taking of Jeruſalem, ſo many thouſand Chriſtians ſo barbarouſly murthered; ſuch bloudy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:166763:3"/>
as thoſe of <hi>Nero, Sylla, Calligula, Meſſala, Caracalla,</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Pontiffs,</hi> the French maſſacre, the Gun powder plot, the Spaniſh Inquiſition, and their murthering of 50 millions of Indians in 42 years, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Acoſta</hi> their Jeſuite. Men invading their own neighbours and brethren, with an unquenchable thirſt after their bloud, and meerly becauſe of their ſtrictneſſe in the common profeſſed Religion, as the late cruel wars in England have declared.</p>
            <p>As touching the clear and frequent diſcovery of the verity of the Scriptures (though many deformed Creatures in ſtead of reformed Chriſtians, in this latter Age, ſay, they are needleſs, and deny the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof) it is the Word of God, as great <hi>Chamier</hi> calleth i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, who likeneth it to the Revelations made to the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And, indeed, of what exceeding great neceſſity is it, to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all true Beleevers, to be ſoundly perſwaded of the truth of Scripture? As Gods own veracity is the prime Foundation of our Faith, from which particular Axioms receive their verity: ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the principal foundation <hi>quod patefactionem,</hi> Revealing to us, what is of God, without which Revelation, it is impoſſible to beleeve. Therefore ſhould not the foundation be both ſurely and firmly laid, the Superſtructure cannot be firm, where the foundation is ſandy; neither can the affections and actions of any be ſound or ſtrong, where their Beleef is unſound or infirm. Again, Learned Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> ſaith, That the looſe and unſetled Faith of many in theſe times, in denying the Scripture, and eternal Reſt, proceeds from the fiery Darts and forcible Engines of Satan.</p>
            <p>And whereas many of them deny, that the Soul of man remaineth and liveth after Death, becauſe they ſee nothing go from him but his breath; it is undeniable, but that the Saints do aſcend to the moſt Higheſt Throne: And this every true Beleever ought to apply unto himſelf implicitely, Though many in this Age are grown to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, that they laugh at all that is ſaid of another Life, and ſay, that there is no ſuch thing as a Devil, &amp;c. But famous <hi>Zanchy</hi> affirmeth, that it is as clear as the Sun, that the Air is full of Devils; becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Gods Word, experience it ſelf doth teach it, and ſundry arguments we ſhall here recite to maintain it; <hi>to wit,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> affirmed of himſelf, that at <hi>Coburge</hi> he oftimes had an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of burning Torches, the ſight whereof did ſo affright him, that he was near ſwooning: Alſo in his own Garden the Devil appeared to him in the likeneſſe of a black Boar; but then hs made light of it.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:166763:3"/>
               <hi>Sozomen,</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, writes of <hi>Apelles</hi> a Smith, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in <hi>Aegypt</hi> for working Miracles, who in the night, while he was at work, was tempted to uncleanneſs by the Devil, appearing in the ſhape of a beautifull Woman. And learned <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, that one like a glorious young man (being the Apparition of a good Angel) ſtood by one of his fellow Presbyters at his death, as he was afraid, and praying againſt death, and ſaid to him, <hi>Are you afraid to ſuffer? Are you afraid to go forth? What ſhall I do with you?</hi> As chiding him for his lothneſs to ſuffer death for Chr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt. Yea, Godly, ſober <hi>Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> affirms, that he had ſeen ſtrange ſights and Apparition, and many credible perſons of his acquaintance have told him, that they have not onely ſeen them, but had much talk with ſpirits: Among the reſt he mentions one of his Aunts, who ſitting ſad at the fire after the death of her Husband, there appeared one unto her in the likeneſs of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and another like a Franciſcan Frier: The former told her, that he was her Husband, and came to tell her ſomewhat; which was, that ſhe muſt hire ſome Prieſts to ſay certain Maſſes for him, which he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought her: Then he took her by the hand, promiſing to do her no harm; yet his hand ſo burned hers, that it remained black ever after, and ſo they vaniſhed away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lavater</hi> alſo himſelf, who hath writ a book wholly of Apparitions, a Learned, Godly, Proteſtant Divine, tells us, That it was then an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable thing, confirmed by the teſtimonnies of many honeſt and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible perſons, that ſometime by night, and ſometime by day, they have both ſeen and heard ſuch things; and that ſome going to bed, had their cloaths plucked off them; others heard ſomewhat lying down in the bed with them, others heard it walking in the chamber by them; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were the ſouls of ſuch or ſuch perſons lately departed, that they were in grievous torments; and if ſo many Maſſes were but ſaid for them, or ſo many Pilgrimages undertaken to the ſhrine of ſome Saint, they ſhould be delivered; theſe things with many ſuch more, ſaith pious <hi>Lavater,</hi> were then frequently and undoubtedly done, and that where the doors were faſt locked, and the room ſearched, that there could be no deceit.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Sleidan</hi> relateth the ſtory of <hi>Creſcentius</hi> the Popes Legate, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a deadly ſickneſs by a fearfull Apparition in his Chamber. Moſt credible and Godly Writers tell us, That on the twentieth day of June, in the year of our Lord 1484. many Blaſphemous and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166763:4"/>
wretches (holding the ſame Tenents with the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Shakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of our times) met together in great numbers, both Men, Women, and Children at a Town called <hi>Hammel in Germany,</hi> where they acted the Scene of Sathan, reviling and Blaſpheming, nay threatning the Almighty and Omnipotent God: And not content with this, ſet their Children, to the number of 130. on a high place within half a mile of the aforeſaid Town, to dare and defie the Lord of all ſpirits. But mark the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that befel them in a moment: while they were bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth theſe Diabolical Imprecations, the Lord thundred Vengeance upon them, the ſaid 130 Children being carried away by the Devil in a flame of fire, and were never ſeen again. But I need ſay no more of this; there is enough written already, not onely by <hi>Cirogna, Delus, Paracelſus,</hi> and others of ſuſpected credit; but alſo by godly and faithfull Writers, as <hi>Lavater Agricola, Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zanchy</hi> thinks, it is the very ſubſtance of Devils that enters men, and that they have bodies more ſubtile then the Air, by which they enter. But if any doubt whether there be any ſuch thing, credible Hiſtory, and late expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may ſufficiently ſatisfie him; for in need, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the diſpoſſeſſion of the Devil out of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons together, in a room in Lancaſhire, at the prayers of ſome godly Miniſters, is very famous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> thought that all Phrenetick perſons, and Ideots, and all bereaved of their Underſtanding had Devils, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Phyſitians might eaſe them by remedies. And indeed the preſence of the Devil may conſiſt with the preſence of a diſeaſe, and evil humor, and with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Means. <hi>Sauls</hi> melancholy Devil would be gone when <hi>David</hi> played on the Harp. So that learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians think, that the Devil is frequently mixed with ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166763:4"/>
diſtempers, and hath a main hand in many of their ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Foreſtus</hi> mentioneth a Country man that being caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to melancholly through diſcontent at ſome injuries that he had received, the Divel appeared unto him in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a man, and perſwaded him to make away himſelf rather then to bear ſuch indignities; and to that end adviſed him to ſend for Arſenick to poiſon himſelf. But the Apothecary would not let him have it, except he would bring one to promiſe that he ſhould not abuſe it; whereupon the Divel went with him as his Voucher, and ſo he took a dram, but though it tormented him, yet it did not preſently kill him; wherefore the Devil brought him afterward a rope, and after that a knife to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied himſelf; at which ſight the man being affrighted was moſt miraculouſly recovered unto his right mind again.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, to prove that man hath a future happineſs or miſery, is drawn from the argument of the Devils compact with Witches. It cannot be onely his deſign, of hurting their bodies that maketh him enter into theſe contracts with them; for that he might procure by other means as likely. It is a childiſh thing to conceit that the Devil cares ſo much for a few drops of their bloud, is not the bloud of a beaſt or other creature as ſweet? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be onely the acknowledgement of his power that he aims at; nor a meer deſire of being honoured or worſhipped in the world, as <hi>Porphirius</hi> and other Pagans have thought: for he is moſt truly ſerved, where he is leaſt diſcerned, and moſt abhorred, when he moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. His Apparitions are ſo powerfull to convince the Ranters of our times, who believe not that there is either God, or Devill, or Heaven, or Hell, that I am perſwaded he would far rather keep out of ſight, and that for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166763:5"/>
moſt part he is conſtrained by GOD to appear againſt his will.</p>
            <p>So that by theſe attempts of Sathan, to deceive and deſtroy ſouls, it is evident, That there is an eſtate of Happineſs or miſery to every man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life. See Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> of the Immortality of the Soul: And Mr. <hi>Roſs</hi> his Philoſophical Touchſtone, in Anſwer to it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, all thoſe Arguments which every Common Play Book, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher almoſt can afford you, to prove the immortality of the Soul, will alſo ſerve to prove the point in hand. But many can apprehend theſe Arguments from ſenſe, who cannot yet reach, and will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by other Demonſtrations: As Temptations, Apparitions, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions diſpoſſeſſions, and Witches, are moſt excellent means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a Ranting Sadduce, that there are Angels and Spirits; ſo alſo by conſequence, that there is a Reſurrection, and eternal Life.</p>
            <p>From whence, be pleaſed to obſerve, how long did the moſt learned Philoſophers ſtudy, before they could know thoſe few, rude, imperfect notions, which ſome of them did attain to, concerning Eternity? They were gray with age and ſtudy, before they could come to know that which a Child of ſeven years old may now know by the benefit of Scripture.</p>
