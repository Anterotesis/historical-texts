            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sundry opinions have been hatched about the subject of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>)
a man may clearly discerne with his eye, and as it
were touch with his finger that according to the verity of

            <p>It cannot be denied to be a pious and prudentiall <hi>act</hi> for

            </p>
            <p>First, That neither Your <hi>Honours,</hi> nor those excellent and

<hi>Israel</hi> to their <hi>apprehensions, debates, conclusions,</hi> rejecting or
neglecting the humble and faithfull suggestions of any, though

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50277:6"/>Secondly, That the present and future <hi>generations</hi> of the

thou thinkest thy conscience bound to smite at him that dares to
waken thee? Yet in the middest of all these <hi>civill</hi> and <hi>spirituall
Wars</hi> (I hope we shall agree in these particulars.)</p>
            <p>First, how ever the proud (upon the advantage of an higher

            <p>Secondly, what ever Worship, Ministry, Ministration, the best
and purest are practised without <hi>faith</hi> and true perswasion that
they are the true institutions of God, they are sin, sinfull worships,
Ministries, &amp;c. And however in Civill things we may be servants

<hi>Rome</hi> it selfe without the sight of a <hi>Bible</hi>) to beleeve as the Church

            </p>
            <p>First, you may please to consider the speech of <hi>King Iames,</hi> in his
<hi>Majesties Speech</hi> at <hi>Parliament,</hi> 1609. He saith, it is a sure <hi>Rule</hi> in <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
that God never loves to plant his <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>bloodshed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his <hi>Highnesse Apologie,</hi> pag. 4. speaking of such <hi>Papists</hi> that
tooke the Oath, thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I gave good proofe that I intended no <hi>persecution</hi> against them for
<hi>conscience</hi> cause, but onely desired to bee secured for <hi>civill obedience,</hi>
which for <hi>conscience</hi> cause they are bound to performe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And pag. 60. speaking of <hi>Blackwell</hi> (the <hi>Arch-priest</hi>) his <hi>Majesty</hi>
saith, <q>It was never my intention to lay any thing to the said <hi>Arch-Priests</hi>
charge (as I have never done to any) for <hi>cause of conscience.</hi>
               </q>
And in his <hi>Highnesse Exposition</hi> on <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. printed 1568. and after
1603. his <hi>Majesty</hi> writeth thus: <q>Sixthly, the compassing of the <hi>Saints</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50277:14"/>
and the <hi>besieging</hi> of the <hi>beloved</hi> City, declareth unto us a certaine <hi>note</hi>
of a <hi>false Church,</hi> to be <hi>Persecution,</hi> for they come to seeke the <hi>faithfull,</hi>
the <hi>faithfull</hi> are them that are sought: the <hi>wicked</hi> are the <hi>besiegers,</hi> the
<hi>faithfull</hi> are the <hi>besieged.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the saying of <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland:</hi> 
               <q>I am <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Men,</hi> not of <hi>Consciences,</hi> a Commander of <hi>Bodies,</hi> not of <hi>Soules.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath thus written:</p>
            <p>
               <q>And notwithstanding the successe of the later times (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
sundry <hi>opinions</hi> have beene hatched about the subject of
<hi>Religion</hi>) may make one clearly discerne with his <hi>eye,</hi> and as it were
to touch with his <hi>Finger,</hi> that according to the veritie of <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and a <hi>Maxime</hi> heretofore told and maintained, by the ancient
Doctors of the <hi>Church;</hi> That <hi>mens consciences</hi> ought in no sort to bee
<hi>violated, urged,</hi> or <hi>constrained;</hi> and whensoever men have attempted
any thing by this <hi>violent course,</hi> whether openly or by secret meanes,
the issue hath beene <hi>pernicious,</hi> and the cause of great and wonderfull
<hi>Innovations</hi> in the principallest and mightiest <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi>
of all Christendome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And further his <hi>Majesty</hi> saith: <q>So that once more we doe professe
before <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>whole World,</hi> that from this time forward wee are
firmly resolved not to <hi>persecute</hi> or <hi>molest,</hi> or suffer to be <hi>persecuted</hi> or
<hi>molested,</hi> any person whosoever for <hi>matter of Religion,</hi> no not they that

to the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>States,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And for the practice of this, where is <hi>persecution</hi> for cause of <hi>conscience</hi>
except in <hi>England</hi> and where <hi>Popery</hi> reignes, and there neither in all
places, as appeareth by <hi>France, Poland,</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>Nay, it is not practised amongst the <hi>Heathen</hi> that acknowledge not
the <hi>true God,</hi> as the <hi>Turke, Persian,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reas.</note> because <hi>persecution</hi> for cause of conscience is condemned
by the ancient and later <hi>Writers,</hi> yea and <hi>Papists</hi> themselves.</p>

               <hi>Hilarie</hi> against <hi>Auxentius</hi> saith thus: The <hi>Christian Church</hi> doth not
<hi>persecute,</hi> but is <hi>persecuted.</hi> And lamentable it is to see the great folly of
these times, and to sigh at the foolish opinion of this world, in that men
thinke by humane aide to helpe <hi>God,</hi> and with worldly pompe and
power to undertake to defend the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> I aske you <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
what helpe used the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the publishing of the <hi>Gospel?</hi> with
the aid of what power did they preach <hi>Christ,</hi> and converted the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
from their <hi>idolatry</hi> to <hi>God?</hi> When they were in <hi>prisons,</hi> and lay in
<hi>chaines,</hi> did they praise and give thankes to God for any <hi>dignities, graces,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50277:15"/>
and <hi>favours</hi> received from the <hi>Court?</hi> Or do you thinke that <hi>Paul</hi> went

the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> sought he <hi>protection</hi> from <hi>Nero, Vespasian?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostles</hi> wrought with their <hi>hands</hi> for their owne <hi>maintenance,</hi>
travailing by <hi>land</hi> and <hi>water</hi> from <hi>Towne</hi> to <hi>Citie,</hi> to preach <hi>Christ:</hi> yea
the more they were <hi>forbidden,</hi> the more they <hi>taught</hi> and preached <hi>Christ.</hi>
But now alas, <hi>humane helpe</hi> must <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>protect</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> and give the
same countenance to and by vaine and <hi>worldly honours.</hi> Doe men seek
to defend the <hi>Church of Christ?</hi> as if hee by his power were unable to
performe it.</p>
            <p>The same against the <hi>Arrians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> now, which formerly by induring <hi>misery</hi> and <hi>imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
was knowne to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> doth now terrifie others by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,

of the <hi>world,</hi> when as the true <hi>Church</hi> cannot but be hated of the

            <p>
               <hi>Tertull. ad Scapulam:</hi> It agreeth both with <hi>humane reason,</hi> and <hi>naturall
equity,</hi> that every man <hi>worship</hi> God uncompelled, and beleeve what he
will; for it neither hurteth nor profiteth any one another mans <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
and <hi>Beleefe:</hi> Neither beseemeth it any <hi>Religion</hi> to compell another

those that freely and with good will offered, and not from the <hi>contrary.</hi>

Your Power extends not so farre as to command any thing in <hi>Gods

            <p>Lastly, the Papists, the <hi>Inventors of Persecution,</hi> in a wicked Booke

            <head>THE ANSWER OF Mr. IOHN
COTTON of Boston in New-England,
To the aforesaid ARGUMENTS against
Persecution for Cause of Consciene.</head>
            <head type="sub">Professedly mainteining Persecution for
Cause of Conscience.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Question</hi> which you put, is, Whether <hi>Persecution</hi> for cause
of <hi>Conscience,</hi> be not against the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the
<hi>King of Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by <hi>Persecution</hi> for Cause of <hi>Conscience,</hi> I conceive you
meane, either for professing some point of <hi>Doctrine</hi> which you believe
in Conscience to be the Truth, or for practising some <hi>Worke</hi> which in
<hi>Conscience</hi> you believe to be a <hi>Religious 'Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in Points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> some are <hi>fundamentall,</hi> without right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
whereof a Man cannot be <hi>saved:</hi> Others are <hi>circumstantiall</hi> or lesse
principall, wherein Men may differ in judgement, without prejudice
of <hi>salvation</hi> on either part.</p>
            <p>In like sort, in Points of <hi>Practice,</hi> some concerne the waightier Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the <hi>Law,</hi> as, What <hi>God</hi> we worship, and with what kinde of
<hi>Worship;</hi> whether such, as if it be <hi>Right,</hi> fellowship with <hi>God</hi> is held; if
<hi>Corrupt,</hi> fellowship with Him is lost.</p>
            <p>Againe, in Points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> lesse Principall: either
they are held forth in a meeke and <hi>peaceable</hi> way, though the Things be
<hi>Erroneous</hi> or unlawfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Or they are held forth with such <hi>Arrogance</hi>
and <hi>Impetuousnesse,</hi> as tendeth and reacheth (even of it selfe) to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
of <hi>Civill Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, let me adde this one distinction more: When we are perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for <hi>Conscience</hi> sake, It is either for <hi>Conscience</hi> rightly informed, or
for erronious and blind <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things premised, I would lay down mine Answer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in certaine <hi>Conclusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it is not lawfull to persecute any for <hi>Conscience</hi> sake <hi>Rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for in <hi>persecuting</hi> such, <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe is persecuted in them,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for an <hi>Erronious</hi> and <hi>blind Conscience,</hi> (even in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50277:17"/>
and weighty Points) It is not lawfull to persecute any, till after
<hi>Admonition</hi> once or twice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> and so the Apostle directeth, 7 <hi>it.</hi> 3. 10. and
giveth the Reason, that in <hi>fundamentall</hi> and principall points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or Worship, the Word of <hi>God</hi> in such things is so cleare, that
hee cannot but bee convinced in <hi>Conscience</hi> of the dangerous
Errour of his way, after once or twice <hi>Admonition,</hi> wisely and
faithfully dispensed. And then if any one persist, it is not out of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
but against <hi>his Conscience,</hi> at the Apostle saith <hi>vers.</hi> 11. He is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and sinneth, being condemned of Himselfe, that is, of his owne
<hi>Conscience.</hi> So that if such a Man after such Admonition shall still <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi>
in the Errour of his way, and be therefore punished; He is not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted</hi>
for Cause of <hi>Conscience,</hi> but for sinning <hi>against</hi> his Owne <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In things of lesser <hi>moment,</hi> whether Points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> or
<hi>Worship,</hi> If a man hold them forth in a Spirit of Christian <hi>Meeknesse</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> (though with <hi>Zeale</hi> and <hi>Constancie</hi>) he is not to be <hi>persecuted,</hi> but
<hi>tolerated,</hi> till <hi>God</hi> may be pleased to manifest his Truth to him, <hi>Phil. 3. 17.
Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But if a Man hold forth or professe any <hi>Errour</hi> or false way, with
a <hi>boysterous</hi> and <hi>arrogant</hi> spirit, to the disturbance of <hi>Civill peace,</hi> he
may justly be punished according to the qualitie and measure of the
<hi>disturbance</hi> caused by him.</p>
            <p>Now let us consider of your <hi>Reasons</hi> or <hi>Objections</hi> to the contrary.</p>
            <q>Your first head of <hi>Objections</hi> is taken from the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Because Christ commandeth to let alone the <hi>Tares</hi> and
<hi>Wheat</hi> to grow together unto the <hi>Harvest,</hi> Mat. 13. 30. 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Tares</hi> are not <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> but partly <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> like
unto the <hi>Godly,</hi> but indeed <hi>Carnall,</hi> as the <hi>Tares</hi> are like to <hi>Wheat,</hi> but
are not <hi>Wheat.</hi> Or partly such Corrupt <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Practices</hi> as are
indeed unsound, but yet such as come very neere the Truth, (as <hi>Tares</hi>
doe to the <hi>Wheat</hi>) and so neere, that Good men may be taken with
them, and so the Persons in whom they grow, cannot be rooted out,
but good will be rooted up with them. And in such a case <hi>Christ</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
for <hi>Toleration,</hi> not for <hi>penall prosecution,</hi> according to the 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. In <hi>Math. 15. 14. Christ</hi> commandeth his Disciples to let

or <hi>Common-weale,</hi> but to his private <hi>Disciples,</hi> concerning the <hi>Pharises,</hi>
over whom they had no power. And the Command he giveth to let
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50277:17"/>
them alone, is spoken in regard of troubling themselves or regarding
the offence, which they tooke at the wholesome <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospell:</hi>
As who should say, Though they be offended at this Saying of mine,
yet doe not you feare their <hi>Feare,</hi> nor bee troubled at their offence,
which they take at my <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not out of sound Judgement, but out
of their <hi>Blindnesse.</hi> But this maketh nothing to the Cause in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> In <hi>Luk. 9. 54. 55. Christ</hi> reproveth his <hi>Disciples,</hi> who would have

All men, suffering evill patiently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Both these are <hi>Directions</hi> to <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospell</hi> how to
deale (not with <hi>obstinate offenders</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> that sinne against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but) either with Men without, as the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> were, and
many unconverted <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> whom <hi>Titus</hi> (as an <hi>Evangelish</hi>)
was to seeke to convert: Or at best with some <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> in
the <hi>Church,</hi> who though carnall, yet were not convinced of the errour
of their Way: And 'tis true, it became not the Spirit of the <hi>Gospell</hi> to
convert Aliens to the Faith of <hi>Christ</hi> (such as the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> were) by
<hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone;</hi> nor to deale harshly in publique Ministerie or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conference with all such contrary minded men, as either had not
yet entred into <hi>Church-Fellowship,</hi> or if they had, yet did hitherto sinne
of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> not against <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But neither of both these Texts doe hinder the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
to proceed in a Church-way against Chruch-members, when they
become <hi>Scandalous offenders,</hi> either in <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Doctrine:</hi> much lesse doe
they speake at all to Civill <hi>Magistrates.</hi>

Weapons</hi> should cease in the dayes of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> Isa. 2. 4. &amp; 11. 9. Mic. 4.
3. 4. And the <hi>Apostie</hi> professeth, The weapons of our <hi>Warfare</hi> are not
<hi>carnall,</hi> 2 Cor, 10. 4. And <hi>Christ</hi> is so farre from persecuting those that
would not be of his <hi>Religion,</hi> that he chargeth them, when they are
persecuted themselves, they should <hi>pray,</hi> and when they are <hi>cursed</hi> they
should <hi>blesse</hi> The reason whereof seemeth to be, that they who are
now <hi>Persecuters</hi> and wicked persons, may become true <hi>Disciples</hi> and
<hi>Converts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Those <hi>predictions</hi> in the <hi>Prophets</hi> doe onely shew, First, with
what kind of <hi>Weapons</hi> he will subdue the <hi>Nations</hi> to the Obedience of
the Faith of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> not by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>Weapons</hi> of Warre,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50277:18"/>
but by the Power of his <hi>Word</hi> and Spirit, which no man doubteth
of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, those <hi>predictions</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> shew what the meeke and
peaceable <hi>temper</hi> will be of all the true Converts to <hi>Christianity,</hi> not
<hi>Lions</hi> or <hi>Leopards,</hi> &amp;c. not cruell <hi>oppressors,</hi> nor malignant <hi>opposers,</hi> or
<hi>biters</hi> of one another. But doth not forbid them to drive ravenous
<hi>Wolves</hi> from the <hi>sheepfold,</hi> and to restraine them from devouring the
Sheepe of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, The weapons of our <hi>warfare</hi> are not <hi>carnall</hi>
but <hi>spirituall,</hi> he denyeth not <hi>civill weapons of Iustice</hi> to the <hi>Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
Rom.</hi> 13. but onely to <hi>Church officers.</hi> And yet the weapons of
such officers he acknowledgeth to be such, as though they be <hi>spirituall,</hi>
yet are ready to take <hi>vengeance</hi> of all <hi>disobedience, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 6. which hath
reference (amongst other Ordinances) to the censure of the <hi>Church</hi>
against <hi>scandalous offenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When <hi>Christ</hi> commandeth his <hi>Disciples</hi> to blesse them that curse them
and persecute them, he giveth not therein a rule to <hi>publick officers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Commonweale,</hi> to suffer notorious sinners, either in <hi>life</hi>
or <hi>doctrine,</hi> to passe away with a <hi>blessing:</hi> But to private <hi>Christians</hi> to
suffer <hi>persecution</hi> patiently, yea and to pray for their <hi>persecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, it is true, Christ would have his <hi>Disciples</hi> to bee farre from
persecuting (for that is a <hi>sinfull oppression</hi> of Men for <hi>righteousnesse</hi> sake)
but that hindreth not but that he would have them execute upon all <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi>
the <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>vengeance</hi> required in the Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.</p>

<hi>God</hi> become true <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Converts,</hi> yet we may not doe evill that
good may come thereof: And evill it would bee to tolerate notorious
evill doers, whether <hi>seducing teachers,</hi> or <hi>scandalous livers. Christ</hi> had
something against the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Pergamus</hi> for tolerating
them that held the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
for tolerating <hi>Iesabel</hi> to teach and seduce, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. 20.</p>
            <p>Your second Head of <hi>Reasons</hi> is taken from the <hi>profession</hi> and <hi>practice</hi>
of famous <hi>Princes,</hi> King <hi>Iames, Stephen</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereunto a treble answer may briefly be returned.</p>
            <p>First, we willingly acknowledge, that none is to be persecuted at all,
no more then they may be oppressed for righteousnesse sake.</p>
            <p>Againe, we acknowledge that none is to be punished for his <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
though mis-informed, as hath been said, unlesse his <hi>errour</hi> be <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50277:18"/>
or seditiously and turbulently promoted, and that after due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of his <hi>conscience,</hi> that it may appeare he is not punished <hi>for his
conscience,</hi> but for sinning <hi>against his conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, we acknowledge none is to be <hi>constrained</hi> to beleeve
or professe the true <hi>Religion</hi> till he be convinced in judgement of the
<hi>truth</hi> of it: but yet restrained he may from blaspheming the <hi>truth,</hi> and
from seducing any unto pernicious errours.</p>
            <p>2. Wee answer, what <hi>Princes</hi> professe or practise, is not a rule of
<hi>conscience:</hi> they many times tolerate that in point of <hi>State policy,</hi> which
cannot justly be tolerated in point of true <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Princes</hi> many times tolerate offendours out of very <hi>necessity,</hi>
when the offenders are either too many, or too mighty for them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
in which respect <hi>David</hi> tolerated <hi>Ioab</hi> and his <hi>murthers,</hi> but <hi>against
his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. We answer further, that for those three Princes named by you,
who tolerated <hi>Religion,</hi> we can name you more and greater who have
not tolerated <hi>Heretickes</hi> and <hi>Schismatickes,</hi> notwithstanding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>conscience,</hi> and arrogating the Crowne of <hi>Martyrdome</hi> to their
sufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great at the request of the Generall <hi>Councell of Nice,</hi>
banished <hi>Arrius</hi> with some of his fellowes. <hi>Sozom. lib. 1. Eccles. Hist.
cap.</hi> 19. 20. The same <hi>Constantine</hi> made a severe Law against the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</hi>
And the like proceedings against them were used by <hi>Valentinian,
Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> reporteth in <hi>Epist.</hi> 166. Only <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the <hi>Apostata</hi> granted liberty to <hi>Heretickes</hi> as well as to <hi>Pagans,</hi> that
he might by tolerating all <hi>weeds</hi> to grow, choake the vitals of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
which was also the practice and sin of <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as famous for her <hi>government</hi> as any of the former,
it is well knowne what Lawes she made and executed against <hi>Papists.</hi>
Yea and King <hi>Iames</hi> (one of your own witnesses) though he was slow
in proceeding against <hi>Papists</hi> (as you say) for <hi>conscience</hi> sake, yet you
are not ignorant how sharply and severely he punished those whom
the malignant world calleth <hi>Puritanes,</hi> men of more <hi>conscience</hi> and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
faith then he tolerated.</p>
            <p>I come now to your third and last argument, taken from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ancient and later <hi>Writers,</hi> yea even of <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, who
have condemned <hi>persecution</hi> for conscience sake.</p>
            <p>You begin with <hi>Hilary,</hi> whose testimony we might admit without
any prejudice to the truth: for it is true, the Christian <hi>Church</hi> doth not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50277:19"/>
persecute, but is persecuted. But to excommunicate an <hi>Hereticke,</hi> is
not to persecute; that is, it is not to punish an innocent, but a culpable
and damnable person, and that not for <hi>conscience,</hi> but for persisting in
<hi>errour</hi> against light of <hi>conscience,</hi> whereof it hath beene convinced.</p>
            <p>It is true also what he saith, that neither the <hi>Apostles</hi> did, not may
we propagate <hi>Christian Religion</hi> by the Sword: but if <hi>Pagans</hi> cannot
be won by the <hi>Word,</hi> they are not to be compelled by the <hi>Sword.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
this hindreth not, but if they or any others should <hi>blaspheme</hi>
the true <hi>God,</hi> and his true <hi>Religion,</hi> they ought to be severely punished;
and no lesse doe they deserve, if they <hi>seduce</hi> from the truth to damnable
<hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Writer (which is <hi>Tertullian</hi>) speaketh to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the place alledged by you. His intent is onely to restraine <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula</hi>
the <hi>Romane Governour</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> from the <hi>persecution</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi>
for not offering sacrifice to their <hi>gods:</hi> And for that end fetcheth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from the Law of <hi>Naturall Equity,</hi> not to compell any to any
<hi>Religion,</hi> but to permit them either to beleeve willingly, or not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
at all. Which wee acknowledge, and accordingly permit the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
to continue in their <hi>unbeleefe.</hi> Neverthelesse it will not therefore
be lawfull openly to tolerate <hi>the worship of devils</hi> or <hi>Idols,</hi> or the <hi>seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of any from the <hi>truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, Another mans <hi>Religion</hi> neither hurteth nor
profiteth any; it must be understood of <hi>private worship</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in private: otherwise a false <hi>Religion</hi> professed by the Members
of a <hi>Church,</hi> or by such as have given their <hi>Names</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> will be the
<hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>desolation</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as appeareth by the threats of Christ
to the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia, Revel.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Your next Authour <hi>Hierom</hi> crosseth not the <hi>truth,</hi> nor advantageth
not your <hi>cause:</hi> for we grant what he saith, that <hi>Heresie</hi> must bee cut
off with the Sword of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> But this hindreth not, but that being
so cut downe, if the <hi>Hereticke</hi> still persist in his <hi>Heresie,</hi> to the <hi>seduction</hi>
of others, he may be cut off by the <hi>civill sword,</hi> to prevent the <hi>perdition</hi>
of others. And that to bee <hi>Hieromes</hi> meaning appeareth by his note
upon that of the Apostle, [A <hi>little Leaven</hi> leaveneth the whole <hi>lumpe</hi>]
therefore (saith he) a <hi>sparke</hi> as soone as it appeareth, is to be extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the <hi>Leaven</hi> to be removed from the rest of the <hi>dough, rotten pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of flesh are to be cut off, and a <hi>scabbed beast</hi> is to be driven from the

               <hi>rotten flesh,</hi> perish by the <hi>scabbed beast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brentius</hi> (whom you next quote) speaketh not to your <hi>Cause.</hi> We
willingly grant him and you, that Man hath no power to make <hi>Lawes,</hi>
to bind <hi>Conscience.</hi> But this hindreth not, but that Men may see the
Lawes of <hi>God</hi> observed, which doe bind Conscience.</p>
            <p>The like Answer may be returned to <hi>Luther,</hi> whom you next al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge.
First, that the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> extendeth
no further then over the <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Goods</hi> of their Subjects, not over
their <hi>Soules:</hi> And therefore they may not undertake to give <hi>Lawes</hi> to
the <hi>Soules</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> of Men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> doth not use the Arme of <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Power</hi> to compell men to the <hi>Faith,</hi> or profession of the <hi>Truth;</hi> for
this is to be done by <hi>Spirituall weapons,</hi> whereby <hi>Christians</hi> are to be
<hi>exhorted,</hi> not <hi>compelled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this hundreth not that <hi>Christians</hi> sinning against <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Conscience,</hi> may justly be censured by the <hi>Church</hi> with <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi>
and by the <hi>Civill Sword</hi> also, in case they shall corrupt others
to the perdition of their <hi>Soules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Popish Book,</hi> we weigh it not, as knowing
(whatsoever they speake for <hi>Toleration of Religion,</hi> where themselves
are under <hi>Hatches</hi>) when they come to sit at <hi>Sterne,</hi> they judge and
practise quite contrary, as both their <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Iudiciall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
have testified to the World these many yeares.</p>
            <p>To shut up this Argument from <hi>Testimonie</hi> of <hi>Writers.</hi> It is well
known, <hi>Augustine</hi> retracted this Opinion of yours, which in his
younger times he had held, but in after <hi>riper age</hi> reversed and refuted,
as appeareth in the second Book of his <hi>Retractations,</hi> chap. 5. and in his
Epistles 48. 50. And in his 1. Book against <hi>Parmenianus,</hi> cap. 7. he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that if the <hi>Donatists</hi> were punished with death, they were justly
punished. And in his 11 Tractate upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> They murther, saith he,
<hi>Soules,</hi> and themselves are afflicted in <hi>Body:</hi> They put men to <hi>everlasting
death,</hi> and yet they complaine when themselves are put to suffer <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Optatus</hi> in his 3. book, justifieth <hi>Macharius,</hi> who had put some <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
to death; that he had done no more herein then what <hi>Moses,
Phincas,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had done before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernard</hi> in his 66 Sermon <hi>in Cantica:</hi> Out of doubt (saith he) it is
better that they should be restrained by the Sword of Him, who beareth
not the Sword in vaine, then that they should be suffred to draw many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50277:20"/>
others into their <hi>Errour.</hi> For he is the <hi>Minister of God</hi> for <hi>Wrath</hi> to
every evill doer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement is well knowne, who procured the death of
<hi>Michael Servetus</hi> for pertinacie in <hi>Heresie,</hi> and defended his fact by a
Book written of that Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beza</hi> also wrote a Booke <hi>de Haereticis Morte plectendis,</hi> that <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
are to be punished with <hi>Death. Aretius</hi> likewise tooke the like
course about the Death of <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> and justified the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
proceeding against him, in an History written of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Finally, you come to answer some maine Objections, as you call
them, which yet are but one, and that one objecteth nothing against
what we hold. It is (say you) no prejudice to the Common-wealth,
if Libertie of Conscience were suffred to such as feare God indeed,
which you prove by the examples of the Patriarchs and others.</p>
            <p>But we readily grant you, Libertie of Conscience is to be granted
to men that feare God indeed, as knowing they will not persist in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
or turbulent Schisme, when they are convinced in Conscience of
the sinfulnesse thereof.</p>
            <p>But the Question is, Whether an Heretick after once or twice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
(and so after conviction) or any other scandalous and hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
offender, may be tolerated, either in the Church without Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
or in the Common-wealth without such punishment as
may preserve others from dangerous and damnable infection.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought needfull to be spoken, for avoyding the
Grounds of your Errour.</p>
            <p>I forbeare adding Reasons to justifie the Truth, because you may
finde that done to your hand, in a Treatise sent to some of the Brethren
late of <hi>Salem,</hi> who doubted as you doe.</p>

because he holdeth or practiseth what he beleeves in <hi>conscience</hi> to be a

with Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> third <hi>distinction.</hi> 
                     <q>In point of Practice (saith he) some
concerne the weightier duties of the Law, as, What God we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and with what kind of Worship: whether such, as if it be Right,
fellowship with God is held; if false, fellowship with God is lost.</q>

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>It is worth the inquirie, what kind of <hi>Worship</hi> he intendeth;
for <hi>Worship</hi> is of various signification: whether in generall acceptation
he meane the <hi>rightnesse</hi> or <hi>corruptnesse</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The true Ministrie a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</note> or the <hi>Ministry</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> or the Ministrations of the <hi>Word, Prayer, Seales, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And because it pleaseth the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to make the <hi>Ministry</hi> one
of the <hi>foundations</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion, (Heb.</hi> 6. 12.) and also to make
the <hi>Ministrie</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> to be two speciall
works (even of the Apostles themselves) <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. I shall desire it
may be well considered in the feare of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, concerning the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> The <hi>New-English Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
when they were new elected &amp; ordained <hi>Ministers</hi> in <hi>New Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d,</hi>
must undeniably grant,<note place="margin">The New English Ministers examined.</note> that at that time they were no <hi>Ministers,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their profession of standing so long in a true <hi>Ministry</hi> in
<hi>Old England,</hi> whether received from the Bishops (which some have
maintained true) or from the People, which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> &amp; others better
liked, and which <hi>Ministrie</hi> was alwayes accounted perpetuall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible:
I apply, and aske, Will it not follow, that if their new <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi>
and <hi>Ordination</hi> be true, the former was false? and if false, that in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50277:24"/>
exercise of it (notwithstanding <hi>abilities, graces, intentions, labours,</hi> and
(by Gods gracious, unpromised, &amp; extraordinary blessing) some <hi>successe</hi>)
I say, will it not according to this distinction follow, that according to
visible <hi>rule, Fellowship</hi> with <hi>God</hi> was lost?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning <hi>Prayer;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Common Prayer cast off, &amp; written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by the New-English.</note> The <hi>New English Ministers</hi> have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
and written against that <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Common</hi> or
set formes of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which yet themselves practised in <hi>England,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they knew that many servants of <hi>God</hi> in great sufferings
witnessed against such a <hi>Ministrie</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> and such a <hi>Ministrie</hi> of
<hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peace.</speaker>
                  <p>I could name the <hi>persons, time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> when some of them
were faithfully admonished for using of the <hi>Common prayer,</hi> and the
Arguments presented to them, then seeming weake, but now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
sound: yet at that time they satisfied their hearts with the
practice of the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> who used to read only
some of the choicest selected Prayers in the <hi>Masse-booke,</hi> (which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
was also their own practice in their using of the <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi>)
But now according to this <hi>distinction,</hi> I ask whether or no fellowship
with <hi>God</hi> in such prayers was lost.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>I could particularize other <hi>exercises</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied (according to this <hi>distinction</hi>) to be of the <hi>waightier points</hi>
of the <hi>Law,</hi> to wit, [What <hi>God</hi> we <hi>Worship,</hi> and with what kind of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi>]
wherein fellowship with <hi>God</hi> (in many of our unclean and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<hi>Worships</hi>) hath been lost. Only upon these premises I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
First, that <hi>Gods</hi> people, even the <hi>standard-bearers</hi> and <hi>leaders</hi> of
them (according to this distinction) have worshipped <hi>God</hi> (in their
sleepy <hi>ignorance</hi>) by such a kind of <hi>Worship,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gods</hi> people have worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God with false worships.</note> as wherein <hi>fellowship</hi> with <hi>God</hi>
is lost; yea also this it is possible for them to do, after much <hi>light</hi> is risen
against such <hi>Worship,</hi> and in particular, brought to the eyes of such <hi>holy</hi>
and <hi>worthy</hi> persons.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Secondly, there may be inward and secret <hi>fellowship</hi> with <hi>God</hi> in false
<hi>Ministeries</hi> of <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It pleaseth God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his promise, to convey blessings &amp; comfort to His, in false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</note> (for that to the eternall prayse of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Mercy</hi> beyond a word or promise of <hi>God</hi> I acknowledge) when
yet (as the distinction saith) in such <hi>worship</hi> (not being <hi>right</hi>) <hi>fellowship</hi>
with <hi>God</hi> is lost, and such a <hi>service</hi> or <hi>ministration</hi> must be lamented and
forsaken.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I observe that <hi>Gods people</hi> may live and die in such kindes of
<hi>worship,</hi> notwithstanding that <hi>light</hi> from <hi>God</hi> publikely and privately,
hath beene presented to them, able to convince: yet not reaching to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50277:25"/>
their <hi>conviction</hi> and forsaking of such wayes, contrary to a <hi>conclusion</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
exprest,<note place="margin">Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not so easie and cleare.</note> to wit, [That <hi>fundamentals</hi> are so cleere, that a man
cannot but be convinced in <hi>Conscience,</hi> and therefore that such a person
not being convinced, he is <hi>condemned of himselfe,</hi> and may be <hi>persecuted</hi>
for sinning against his <hi>conscience.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I observe that in such a maintaining a clearnesse of <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi>
or waightier <hi>points,</hi> and upon that ground a persecuting of men,
because they sinne against their <hi>consciences,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> measures that to
<hi>others,</hi> which himselfe when he lived in such <hi>practices,</hi> would not have
had measured to himselfe. As first, that it might have beene affirmed
of him, that in such <hi>practices</hi> he did sinne against his <hi>conscience,</hi> having
sufficient light shining about him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that hee should or might lawfully have beene cut off by
<hi>death</hi> or <hi>banishment,</hi> as an <hi>Hereticke,</hi> sinning against his owne <hi>conscience.</hi>
               </p>

this: The <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>company</hi> of <hi>worshippers</hi> (whether true or false)
is like unto a Body or Colledge of <hi>Physitians</hi> in a <hi>Citie;</hi> like unto a

sue and implead each other at the <hi>Law,</hi> yea wholly breake up
and dissolve into pieces and nothing, and yet the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Citie</hi> not

of the <hi>Citie,</hi> and so the <hi>well-being</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> thereof is essentially

Citie-punishments</hi> distinct from theirs. The <hi>Citie</hi> was before them, and
stands absolute and intire, when such a <hi>Corporation</hi> or <hi>Societie</hi> is taken
down. For instance further, The <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Civill state</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
distinct from the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Diana</hi> in the Citie, or of the <hi>whole city.</hi>
Againe, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which were Gods people,
converted and call'd out from the <hi>worship</hi> of that <hi>City</hi> unto <hi>Christianitie</hi>

Now suppose that <hi>God</hi> remove the <hi>Candlestick</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> yea

(if men be true and honestly ingenuous to <hi>Citie-covenants, Combinations</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus in the Citie of <hi>Smirna</hi> was the Citie it selfe or Civill estate one

               <p>To wipe off therefore these fowle <hi>blurs</hi> and <hi>aspersions</hi> from the faire
and beautifull face of the <hi>Spouse</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> I shall select and propose 5 or
6 cases, for which <hi>Gods witnesses</hi> in all Ages and Generations of Men,
have been charged with <hi>arrogance, impetuousnes,</hi> &amp;c. and yet the <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Iudge</hi> of all men, hath graciously discharged them from
such crimes, and maintained and avowed them for his <hi>faithfull</hi> and
<hi>peaceable</hi> servants.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Gods</hi> people have <hi>proclaimed, taught, disputed</hi> for divers months
together, a <hi>new Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Worship</hi> projected
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50277:26"/>

                  <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> where they have lived, or where they have
travelled, as did the <hi>Lord Iesus Himselfe</hi> over <hi>all Galile,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
after Him in all places, both in the <hi>Synagogues</hi> and <hi>Market-places,</hi>
as appeares <hi>Acts 17. 2. 17. Acts</hi> 18. 48. Yet this no <hi>Arrogance</hi> nor
<hi>Impetuousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Gods <hi>servants</hi> have been <hi>zealous</hi> for their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi>
even to the very faces of the Highest, and concerning the persons of
the Highest, so far as they have opposed the <hi>Truth</hi> of God: So <hi>Eliah</hi>
to the face of <hi>Ahab,</hi> It is not <hi>I,</hi> but <hi>thou,</hi> and thy <hi>Fathers</hi> house that
troublest <hi>Israel:</hi> So the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> concerning <hi>Herod,</hi> Goe tell that
<hi>Fox:</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> God delivered me from the mouth of the <hi>Lion;</hi> and to
<hi>Ananias,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods people</hi> have been <hi>immoveable, constant</hi> and <hi>resolved</hi> to the
<hi>death,</hi> in refusing to submit to false <hi>Worships,</hi> and in <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing</hi>
the true <hi>worship,</hi> contrary to expresse command of <hi>publicke Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi>
So the three <hi>famous Worthies</hi> against the command of <hi>Nobil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi>

and the uniforme <hi>conformity</hi> of all <hi>Nations</hi> agreeing upon a
false <hi>worship, Dan.</hi> 3. So the Apostles (<hi>Acts</hi> 4 and 5 chap.) and so the
witnesses of <hi>Iesus</hi> in all ages, who loved not their lives to the <hi>death
(Rev.</hi> 12.) not regarding sweet <hi>life</hi> nor bitter <hi>death,</hi> and yet not <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi>
nor <hi>Impetuous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods people</hi> since the comming of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ Jesus the only Lord and King to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> the
<hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> have openly and constantly profest, that no Civill <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>
no <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Caesar</hi> have any power over the <hi>Soules</hi> or <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of their Subjects, in the matters of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> but
the <hi>Civill Magistrates</hi> themselves; yea <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Keisars</hi> are bound
to subject their owne soules to the <hi>Ministery</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> of this <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings.</hi> Hence was the
charge against the <hi>Apostles</hi> (false in <hi>Civill,</hi> but true in <hi>spiritualls</hi>) that
they affirmed that there was another <hi>King,</hi> one <hi>Iesus, Acts</hi> 17. 7. And
indeed, this was the great charge against the <hi>Lord Iesus Himself,</hi> which
the <hi>Iews</hi> laid against Him, and for which he suffered Death, as appears
by the Accusation written over His Head upon the Gallows, <hi>Iohn 9. 19.
Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was and is the summe of all true preaching of the Gospell
or glad newes,<note place="margin">That Christ is King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone over conscience is the sum of all true preaching.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That God anointed Jesus to be the sole King and
Governour of all the Israel of God in spirituall and soule causes, <hi>Psal.
2. 6. Acts</hi> 2. 36. Yet this Kingly power of His he resolved not to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50277:27"/>
in His owne Person, but Ministerially in the hands of such Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which he sent forth to preach and baptise, and to such as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that word they preached, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. And yet here no <hi>Arrogance</hi> nor
<hi>Impetuousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>Gods people</hi> in delivering the Minde and Will of God concerning
the Kingdomes and Civill States where they have lived, have seemed
in all shew of common sense and rationall policie (if men looke not
higher with the eye of saith) to endanger and overthrow the very Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
State,<note place="margin">Gods people have see men the disturbers of Civill State.</note> as appeareth by all <hi>Ieremses</hi> preaching and counsell to King
<hi>Zedechia,</hi> his Princes and people, insomuch that the charge of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was, that he discouraged the Army from fighting
against the Babylonians, and weakned the Land from its own defence,
and this charge in the eye of reason, seemed not to be unreasonable or
unrighteous, <hi>Ier.</hi> 37. 38. chapters, and yet in <hi>Ieremy</hi> no <hi>Arrogance</hi> nor
<hi>Impetuousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Lastly, <hi>Gods people</hi> by their preaching, disputing, &amp;c. have beene
(though not the cause) yet accidentally the occasion of great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and divisions,<note place="margin">Gods word and people the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of tumults.</note> yea tumults and uproares in Townes and Cities
where they have lived and come, and yet neither their Doctrine nor
themselves <hi>Arrogant</hi> nor <hi>Impetuous,</hi> however so charged: For thus

or with force of Armes, Swords, Guns, Prisons, &amp;c.) that it may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tend to breake, but may actually breake the civill peace, or peace of
the Citie.</p>
               <p>Yet these instances propounded are cases of great opposition and
spirituall hostility, and occasions of breach of civill peace: and yet as
the borders (or matter) were of gold: so the speckes (or manner, <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</hi>

and inoffensive.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I answer, that it is possible and common for persons of
soft and gentle nature and spirits to hold out falshood with more seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
meeknesse and peaceablenesse, then the Lord Jesus or his servants
did or doe hold forth the true and everlasting Gospell. So that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer

No wonder if <hi>Adonijah</hi> and all his company be amazed and troubled at
the sound of the right Heyre King <hi>Salomon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon the inheritance, unto which they had no right, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 38.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50277:28"/>
Hence all those tumults about the Apostles in the <hi>Acts,</hi> &amp;c. whereas
good eyes are not so troubled at light; vigilant and watchfull persons
loyall and faithfull, are not so troubled at the true, no nor at a false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

practices are held forth, &amp; yet no breach of civil peace from the doctrine
or practice, or the manner of holding forth, but from that wrong and
preposterous way of suppressing, preventing, and extinguishing such
doctrines or practices by weapons of wrath and blood, whips, stockes,
imprisonment, banishment, death, &amp;c. by which men commonly are
perswaded to convert Heretickes, and to cast out uncleane spirits,

from the bright shining Sunne of Righteousnesse, which is able, in the
soules and consciences of men to dispell and scatter such fogges and

                  <p>First, that he holds it not lawfull to persecute any for conscience
sake rightly informed, for in persecuting such (saith he) Christ himself
is persecuted: for which reason, truly rendred, he quotes <hi>Act. 9. 4. Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi>

shall as soone finde darknesse in the bright beames of the Sunne, as in
this so cleare and shining a beame of Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ Jesus in
his Truth must not be persecuted.</p>
                  <p>Yet this I must aske (for it will be admired by all sober men) what
should be the cause or inducement to the Answerers mind to lay down
such a Position or Thesis as this is, <hi>It is not lawfull to persecute the Lord
Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Search all Scriptures, Histories, Records, Monuments, consult with
all experiences, did ever <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Ahab, Iezabel,</hi> Scribes and
Pharises, the Jewes, <hi>Herod,</hi> the bloudy <hi>Neroes, Gardiners, Boners,</hi> Pope

                  <p>No, saith <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Isrealites are idle, and therefore speake they
of sacrificing: <hi>David</hi> is risen up in a conspiracy against <hi>Saul,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
persecute him: <hi>Naboth</hi> hath blasphemed God and the King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stone him: <hi>Christ</hi> is a seducer of the people, a blasphemer against
God, and traytor against <hi>Caesar,</hi> therefore hang him: Christians are

                  <speaker>Peace.</speaker>
                  <p>One thing I see apparantly in the Lords over-ruling the pen
of this worthy Answerer,<note place="margin">All perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of Christ professe not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute him.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> a secret whispering from heaven to him,
that (although his soules ayme at Christ, and hath wrought much for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50277:29"/>
Christ in many sincere intentions,<note place="margin">All perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of Christ, professe not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute him</note> and Gods mercifull and patient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance)
yet he hath never left the Tents of such who think they doe
God good service in killing the Lord Jesus in his servants, and yet they
say, if we had beene in the dayes of our Fathers in Queene <hi>Maries</hi>
dayes, &amp;c. we would never have consented to such persecution: And
therefore when they persecute Christ Jesus in his truths or servants,
they say, Doe not say you are persecuted for the Word for Christ his
sake, for we hold it not lawfull to persecute Iesus Christ.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Let me also adde a second; So farre as he hath beene a Guide (by
preaching for persecution) I say, wherein he hath beene a Guide and
Leader, by mis-interpreting and applying the Writings of Truth, so far
I say his owne mouthes and hands shall judge (I hope not his persons,
but) his actions, for the Lord Jesus hath suffered by him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 3. and
if the Lord Jesus himselfe were present, himselfe should suffer that in
his owne person, which his servants witnessing his Truth doe suffer for
his sake.</p>

                  <p>THeir second Conclusion is this: <q>It is not lawfull to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
erroneous and blinde conscience, even in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
and weighty points, till after admonition once or twice,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 11. and then such consciences may be persecuted, because the
Word of God is so cleare in fundamentall and weighty points, that
such a person cannot but sin against his conscience, and so being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of himselfe, that is, of his conscience, hee may be persecuted
for sinning against his owne conscience.</q>

                  <p>I answer, in that great battell betweene the Lord Jesus and
the Devill, it is observable that Sathan takes up the weapons of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and such Scripture which in shew and colour was excellent for
his purpose: but in this 3. of <hi>Titus,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes of the Birds of
heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. a man may evidently see the snare; and I know the
time is comming wherein it shall bee said, Surely in vaine the Net is
laid in the sight of the Saints (heavenly Birds.)</p>

               <p>So palpably grosse and thicke is the mist and fog which Sathan hath
raised about this Scripture, that he that can but see men as trees in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

sleepe Gods people are fallen into concerning the visible Kingdome of

hath so many hundred years been the pretended Bulwark

be the refuge and defence of (as I hope) the Lambes and little ones of

                  <p>BRight <hi>Truth,</hi> since this place of <hi>Titus</hi> is such a pretended
Bulwark for persecuting of Hereticks, &amp; under that pretence
of persecuting all thy followers, I beseech you by the bright beames
of the Sun of Righteousnesse, scatter these mists, and unfold these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
out of the Text:</p>
                  <p>First, What this Man is that is an Hereticke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How this Hereticke is condemned of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What is this first and second Admonition, and by whom it
is supposed to be given.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What is this rejecting of Him, and by whom it is supposed
this Rejection was to be made.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">What is meant by Hereticke in <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     </note> What is this Heretick? I find him commonly defined to be
such an one as is obstinate in Fundamentalls, and so also I conceive the
Answerer seems to recent him, saying, That the Apostle renders this
reason, why after once and twice Admonition, he ought to be persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because in fundamentall and principall points of Doctrine and
Worship, the Word of God is so cleare, that the Hereticke cannot but
be convinced in his owne Conscience.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>But of this reason, I finde not one tittle mentioned in this Scripture:
for although he saith such an one is condemned of himselfe, yet he saith
not, nor will it follow that fundamentalls are so cleare, that after first
and second Admonition, a person that submits not to them is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of himself, any more then in lesser points. This 11 verse hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the former verses. <hi>Titus</hi> an Evangelist, a Preacher of glad
Newes, abiding here with the Church of Christ at Creet, is required
by <hi>Paul</hi> to avoid, to reject, and to teach the Church to reject Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
disputes, and unprofitable questions about the Law: Such a
like charge it is as he gave to <hi>Timothy,</hi> left also an Evangelist at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50277:30"/>
If it should be objected what is to be done to such contentious vain
strivers about Genealogies and questions unprofitable? The Apostle
seems plainly to answer, Let him be once and twice admonished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Yea, but what if once and twice admonition prevaile not?</p>
               <p>The Apostle seems to answer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, and that is, the man
that is wilfully obstinate after such once and twice admonition, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
him.</p>
               <p>With this Scripture agrees that of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4, 5. where <hi>Timothy</hi> is
commanded to withdraw himselfe from such who dote about questions
and strife of words.</p>
               <p>All which are points of a lower and inferiour nature, not properly
falling within the tearms or notions of those (<gap reason="foreign">

and (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>) foundations of the Christian Profession, to wit, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead workes, Faith towards God, the doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismes,
and of laying on of hands, the Resurrection, and eternall
Judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Concerning these Fundamentalls (although nothing is so little in
the Christian Worship, but may be referred to one of these six, yet) doth
not <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> speake in those places by me alledged, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
of any of these, as may evidently appeare by the context and scope?</p>
               <p>The beloved Spouse of Christ is no receptacle for any filthy person,
obstinate in any filthynesse against the purity of the Lord Jesus, who
hath commanded his people to purge out the old leaven, not only grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
portions, but a little leaven which will leaven the whole lumpe;
and therefore this Hereticke or obstinate person in these vaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
questions, was to be rejected, as well as if his obstinacie had
been in greater matters.</p>
               <p>Againe, if there were a doore or window left open to vaine and
unprofitable questions, and sinnes of smaller nature, how apt are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to cover with a silken covering, and to say, Why, I am no <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke</hi>

               <p>THis will appeare, if we examine the two last <hi>Quaries</hi> of this place

               <p>First then, <hi>Titus,</hi> unto whom this <hi>Epistle</hi> &amp; these <hi>directions</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
(and in him to all that succeed him in the like work of the <hi>Gospell</hi>
to the Worlds end) he was no <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Civill State,</hi> armed with
the <hi>majestie</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> of a <hi>materiall sword,</hi>

the <hi>Gospel</hi> or <hi>Glad tidings,</hi> armed onely with the <hi>Spirituall sword</hi> of the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> and such <hi>Spirituall weapons</hi> as (yet) through <hi>God</hi> were
mighty to the casting down of <hi>strong holds,</hi> yea every <hi>high thought</hi> of
the <hi>highest head</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> in the world, 2 Cor. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>Therefore these first and second Admonitions were not <hi>civill</hi> or <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi>

               <p>But not from the Civill <hi>Magistrate</hi> (to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes not this
<hi>Epistle,</hi> and who also is not bound once and twice to admonish,

<hi>practices</hi> as are indeed unsound, but yet such as come very near the truth
(as <hi>Tares</hi> do to the <hi>Wheat</hi>) and so neer that <hi>good</hi> men may be taken with
them, and so the persons in whom they grow cannot bee rooted out,
but good <hi>Wheat</hi> will be rooted out with them. In such a case (saith he)

                  <p>The <hi>substance</hi> of this <hi>Answer</hi> I conceive to be first <hi>negative,</hi>

               <p>That the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> intendeth not <hi>doctrines</hi> or <hi>practices</hi> by the <hi>tares</hi>

thinke that because the tender Consciences of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

&amp;c. are commonly and presently knowne by every <hi>husbandman</hi> to differ
from the <hi>wheat,</hi> and to be opposite, and contrary, and hurtfull unto it.</p>
               <p>Now whereas it is pleaded that these <hi>tares</hi> are like the <hi>wheat,</hi> and so
like that this <hi>consimilitude</hi> or likenesse is made the ground of this <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi>
viz. That <hi>tares</hi> must needs signifie <hi>hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>doctrines,</hi> or <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi>
who are like <hi>Gods children, Truth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I answer, first, The <hi>Parable</hi> holds forth no such thing, that the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the <hi>tares</hi> should deceive the servants to cause them to suppose
for a time that they were good <hi>wheat,</hi> but that as soone as ever the <hi>tares</hi>
appeared, ver. 26. the <hi>servants</hi> came to the <hi>housholder</hi> about them, ver. 27.
the Scripture holds forth no such time wherein they doubted or suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
what they were.</p>

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>I answer,<note n="*" place="margin">The false and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Christians appeare as soon as the true and faithfull.</note> The one appeared as soone as the other, for so the

as early, and put forth themselves as appeared also.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is such a <hi>dissimilitude</hi> or <hi>unlikenesse,</hi> I say such a <hi>dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,</hi>
that as soone as <hi>tares</hi> and <hi>wheat</hi> are sprung up to blade and

                  <p>It may be said true: So when the <hi>hypocrite</hi> is manifested,
then all may know him, &amp;c. but before <hi>hypocrites</hi> be manifested by
<hi>fruits</hi> they are unknowne.</p>
                  <p>I answer, search into the <hi>Parable,</hi> and aske when was it that the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
first complained of the <hi>tares</hi> to the <hi>housholder,</hi> but when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
or came in sight, there being no <hi>interim,</hi> wherein the servants
could not tell what to make of them, but doubted whether they were
<hi>wheat</hi> or <hi>tares,</hi> as the Answerer implies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when was it that the <hi>housholder</hi> gave charge to let them
alone, but after that they appeared, and were known to be <hi>tares,</hi> which
should imply by this <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Answerer,</hi> that when men are

               <p>Now after the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> had propounded that great <hi>leading Parable</hi>

               <p>FIrst then, these Tares are such sinners as are opposite and contrary

                  <p>Answ. Their opposition here against the <hi>children</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
is such an opposition as properly sights against the <hi>Religious state</hi>
or Worship of the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is manifest, that the Lord Jesus in this parable intends

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe secondly, in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> whose <hi>kingdoms,
officers, lawes, punishments, weapons,</hi> are spirituall and of a Soule-nature,
he will not have <hi>Antichristian idolaters, extortioners, covetous, &amp;c.</hi> to be
let alone, but the <hi>uncleane</hi> and <hi>lepers</hi> to be thrust forth, the old <hi>leaven</hi>
purged out, the <hi>obstinate</hi> in sinne spiritually <hi>stoned</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> and put away
from Israel; and this by many degrees of gentle <hi>admonition</hi> in <hi>private</hi>
and <hi>publique,</hi> as the case requires.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if neither <hi>offenders</hi> against the <hi>civill Lawes, State</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>
ought to be let alone; nor the <hi>Spirituall estate,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
ought to beare with them that are <hi>evill,</hi> Revel. 2. I conclude, that these
are sinners of another nature, <hi>Idolaters, False-worshippers, Antichristians,</hi>
who without discouragement to true Christians must be let alone and
permitted in the world to grow and fill up the measure of their sinnes,
after the <hi>image</hi> of him that hath sowen them, untill the great Harvest

                  <p>First, I answer, that as the <hi>civill State</hi> keepes it selfe with a
<hi>civill Guard,</hi> in case these <hi>Tares</hi> shall attempt ought against the <hi>peace</hi> and
<hi>welfare</hi> of it, let such <hi>civill offences</hi> be punished, and yet as <hi>Tares</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to <hi>Christs Kingdome,</hi> let their <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> be tolerated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>spirituall State, City,</hi> or <hi>Kingdome</hi> hath <hi>lawes,</hi>
and <hi>orders,</hi> and <hi>armories,</hi> (whereon there hang a thousand <hi>Bucklers,

or <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Lord</hi> himself knows who are his, &amp; his <hi>foundation</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
sure, his <hi>Elect</hi> or chosen cannot perish nor be finally deceived.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> here in this Parable layes downe two <hi>Reasons,</hi>
able to content and satisfie our <hi>hearts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e patiently this their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi>
and <hi>Antichristianity,</hi> and to permit or let them alone.</p>
                  <p>First, lest the good Wheat bee pluckt up and rooted up also out of
this <hi>Field</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> if such <hi>combustions</hi> and <hi>fightings</hi> were, as to pluck
up all the false professours of the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>good wheat</hi> also
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50277:37"/>
would enjoy little peace, but be in danger to bee pluckt up and torne
out of this world by such bloody <hi>stormes and tempests.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore as <hi>Gods people</hi> are commanded, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. to pray for the
peace of <hi>materiall Babell,</hi> wherein they were captivated, and 1 <hi>Time.</hi> 2.
to pray for all men, and specially <hi>Kings and Governors,</hi> that in the peace
of the <hi>civill State</hi> they may have peace. So contrary to the opinion and
practice of most (drunke with the Cup of the <hi>Whores fornication</hi>) yea,
and of <hi>Gods</hi> owne people fast asleepe in <hi>Antichristian Dalilahs</hi> laps,
<hi>obedience</hi> to the command of <hi>Christ</hi> to let the <hi>tares</hi> alone, will prove the
onely meanes to preserve then Civill Peace, and that without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to this command of Christ, it is impossible (without great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
against the <hi>Lord</hi> in carnall policy, which will not long hold
out to preserve the <hi>civill</hi> peace.</p>
                  <p>Beside, Gods people the good Wheat are generally pluckt up and
persecuted, as well as the vilest idolaters, whether Jewes or Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
which the Lord Jesus seemes in this <hi>Parable</hi> to foretell.</p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Reason</hi> noted in the <hi>Parable</hi> which may satisfie any man
from wondring at the <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The great &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</note> is this: when the <hi>world</hi> is ripe in

you depart from this, I must crave your patience to satisfie one <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
and that is; These servants to whom the <hi>Housholder</hi> answereth,
seem to be the <hi>Ministers</hi> or <hi>Messengers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> not the <hi>Magistrates</hi>
of the <hi>civill State,</hi> and therfore this charge of the Lord Jesus is not given
to <hi>Magistrates</hi> to let alone <hi>false worshippers</hi> and <hi>idolaters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, being spoken by the <hi>Lora Iesus</hi> to his <hi>Messengers,</hi> it seemes
to concern <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as before was spoken, and not <hi>false
worshippers</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> or <hi>World.</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>I answer, first,<note place="margin">The civill Magistrate not so particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken to as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Masters in the New Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, and why.

proved, that these <hi>tares</hi> are not <hi>offenders</hi> in the <hi>civill State.</hi> Nor second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> when once discovered so to bee, and that
therefore the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> intends a grosser kinde of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> professing
the name of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> in the field of the <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I acknowledge this command [Let them alone] was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
spoken to the <hi>Messengers</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> who have no
<hi>civill power</hi> or <hi>authority</hi> in their hand, and therefore not to the <hi>civill
Magistrate, King,</hi> or <hi>Governour,</hi> to whom it pleased not the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi>
by <hi>himselfe</hi> or by his <hi>Apostles</hi> to give particular <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>directions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their <hi>behaviour</hi> and carriage in Civill <hi>Magistracy,</hi> as they have
done expresly concerning the duty of <hi>fathers, mothers, children, masters,
servants,</hi> yea and of <hi>Subjects</hi> towards <hi>Magistrates, Ephes. 5. &amp; 6. Colos.
3. &amp; 4. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conceive not the reason of this to be (as some weakly have done)
because the Lord Jeus would not have any <hi>followers</hi> of his to hold the
place of <hi>civill Magistracy,</hi> but rather that he foresaw, and the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
in the <hi>Apostles</hi> foresaw how few <hi>Magistrates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A twofold state of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the persecuted under the Roman Emperors, and the Apostate ever since.</note> either in the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
or apostated state of Christianity would imbrace his yoake: in
the persecuted state, Magistrates hated the very name of Christ or
Christianity: In the state apostate some few Magistrates (in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
holy and precious, yet) as concerning their places, as they have
professed to have beene Governours or Heads of the Church, have
beene so many false Heads, and have constituted so many false visible
Christs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I conceive this charge of the Lord Jesus to his <hi>Messengers</hi>
the <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Proclaimers</hi> of his minde, is a sufficient declaration
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50277:38"/>
of the minde of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> if any <hi>civill Magistrate</hi> should make
question what were his <hi>duty</hi> concerning <hi>spirituall</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in them all that succeed them, being commanded
not to pluck up the <hi>Tares,</hi> but let them alone, received from the <hi>Lord

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods Messengers</hi> are herein commanded not to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or denounce a <hi>present destruction</hi> or <hi>extirpation</hi> of all false <hi>professours</hi>
of the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> which are <hi>whole Townes, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieremy</hi> did thus pluck up <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in those fearfull Prophecies hee

                  </p>
                  <p>Such <hi>denunciations</hi> of present temporall <hi>judgements</hi> are not the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers</hi>

               <p>First, that the <hi>Tares</hi> in this <hi>Parable</hi> cannot signifie <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Tares</hi> cannot signifie Hypocrites in the Church either

in that the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> commanding to let them alone, that is, not onely
not be offended themselves, but not to meddle with them; it appeares
it was no <hi>ordinance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> for the <hi>Disciples</hi> to have gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

which many fall at, to wit, <hi>Pauls</hi> appealing to <hi>Caesar;</hi> which since he
could not in common sense doe unto <hi>Caesar</hi> as a competent <hi>Iudge</hi> in
such cases, and wherein he should have also denied his own Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or office, in which regard (to wit in matters of Christ) he was

&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it had been an Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> that all <hi>Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
were bound to judge in causes <hi>spirituall</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> as to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

               <p>I answer, that place of <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 23. will appeare to be far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               <p>Thirdly, Gods Israel of old were earnest with God for a King, for an
Arme of Flesh, for a King to protect them, as other Nations had.
Gods Israel still have ever been restlesse with God for an Arme of flesh.</p>
               <p>God gave them <hi>Saul</hi> in his anger, and took him away in his wrath:
And God hath given many a <hi>Saul</hi> in his Anger, that is, an Arm of Flesh
in the way of his Providence, (though I judge not all persons whom
<hi>Saul</hi> in his Calling typed out, to be of <hi>Sauls</hi> spirit) for I speake of a
State and outward visible Power only.</p>
               <p>I adde, God will take away such stayes on whom Gods people rest,
in his wrath, that King <hi>David,</hi> that is, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the <hi>Antitype,</hi> in his

               <p>And therefore I conclude, it was in one respect that the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi>
said, Let them alone, because it was no Ordinance for any <hi>Disciple</hi> of

                  <p>I answer, It is a <hi>truth,</hi> the mischiefe of a blinde <hi>Pharises</hi>
blinde <hi>guidance</hi> is greater then if he acted Treasons, Murders, &amp;c. and
the losse of one soule by his seduction is a greater mischiefe then if he
blew up Parliaments, and cuts the throats of Kings or Emperours, so
pretious is that invaluable Jewell of a Soul, above all the present lives
and bodies of all the men in the world I and therefore a firme Justice
calling for <hi>eye</hi> for <hi>eye, tooth</hi> for <hi>tooth, life</hi> for <hi>life;</hi> calls also <hi>soule</hi> for <hi>soule,</hi>
which the blinde-guiding seducing <hi>Pharisee</hi> shall surely pay in that

               <p>I answer secondly, <hi>Dead men</hi> cannot be infected, the <hi>civill state</hi> the
<hi>world,</hi> being in a naturall state dead in sin (what ever be the <hi>State-Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
unto which <hi>persons</hi> are forced) it is impossible it should be infected:
Indeed the <hi>living,</hi> the <hi>beleeving,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>spirituall state,</hi> that and
that onely is capable of <hi>infection;</hi> for whose helpe we shall presently

see what <hi>preservatives,</hi> and <hi>remedies</hi> the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> hath appointed.</p>
               <p>Moreover as we see in a <hi>common plague</hi> or <hi>infection</hi> the names are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the names are taken, not one <hi>elect</hi> or chosen of <hi>God</hi> shall perish, <hi>Gods

                  <p>First, if the <hi>civill Magistrates</hi> hee <hi>Christians,</hi> or members of the
<hi>Church,</hi> able to <hi>prophesie in the Church of Christ,</hi> then I say as before,
they are bound by this command of <hi>Christ</hi> to suffer opposition to

                  <p>So also it pleaseth the Answerer to acknowledge in these words:
<q>It becomes not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to convert <hi>Aliens</hi> to

                     </hi> in the beginning of

unto the Lord both in <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> and unto the 9 verse of

                  <p>And from the 9 ver. to the end of the 13 he plainly discourseth of

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is that verse 7 of this 13 Chap. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of <hi>love</hi> to all men (<hi>Magistrates and subjects</hi>) verse 7. 8.

                  <p>If any man doubt (as the Papists speak) whether a man may

                     <note place="margin">How love ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the Law</note> every man of found judgement is ready

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Apostle speaks not here of perfect observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the second Table without failing in word or act toward
men, but layes open the summe and sustance of the <hi>Law,</hi> which is
<hi>love,</hi> and that he that walkes by the rule of <hi>love</hi> toward all <hi>men
(Magistrates</hi> and <hi>subjects</hi>) he hath rightly attained unto what the
<hi>Law</hi> aimes at, and so in <hi>Evangelicall obedience</hi> fulfills and keeps the
<hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence therefore againe in the 9 verse having discoursed of the
5 Command in this point of <hi>Superiours,</hi> he makes all the rest of the
Commandements of the second Table, which concerne our <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And verse 10 <hi>Love</hi> worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore
<hi>love</hi> is the fulfilling of the Law, that is (as before) the <hi>Law</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <p>From thence (sweet <hi>Peace</hi>) may we well observe,<note place="margin">Some give to the Magistrate what is not his, and take from him that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per to him.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is not to punish all <hi>Evill,</hi> according to
this their <hi>confession.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>I answer, first, by assenting to the generall Proposition,
that it is most true, like unto Christ Jesus himselfe, a sure <hi>foundation,</hi>
1 Cor. 3. Yet what is built upon it, I hope (by Gods assistance) to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50277:54"/>
make it appeare is but <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble, dead</hi> and <hi>withered,</hi> not suiting
that <hi>golden foundation,</hi> nor pleasing to the Father of <hi>mercies,</hi> nor
<hi>comfortable</hi> to the Soules of men.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>evill</hi> (saith he) to tolerate notorious evill doers, seducing
Teachers, scandalous livers.</p>
                  <p>In which speech I observe 2 evills:</p>
                  <p>First that this <hi>Proposition</hi> is too large and generall, because the
<hi>Rule</hi> admits of <hi>exception,</hi> and that according to the will of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is true, that <hi>Evill</hi> cannot alter its nature, but it is alway
<hi>Evill,</hi> as <hi>darknesse</hi> is alway <hi>darknesse,</hi> yet</p>
                  <p>2. It must be remembred, that it is one thing to <hi>command,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Evill is always Evill, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it may in case be good.</note> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale,</hi>
to <hi>councell,</hi> to <hi>approve Evill,</hi> and another thing to <hi>permit</hi> and
<hi>suffer Evill</hi> with <hi>protestation</hi> against it, or <hi>dislike</hi> of it, at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>approbation</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, this <hi>sufferance</hi> or <hi>permission</hi> of <hi>Evill</hi> is not for its ownsake,
but for the sake of <hi>Good,</hi> which puts a respect of <hi>Goodnesse</hi> upon such
<hi>permission.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that for <hi>Gods</hi> owne <hi>Glorie</hi> sake (which is the highest
Good) he endures, that is, <hi>permits</hi> or <hi>suffers</hi> the <hi>Vessels of Wrath,
Rom.</hi> 9. And therefore although he be of pure eyes, and can behold
no iniquitie, yet his pure eyes patiently and quietly beholds and
permits all the <hi>idolatries</hi> and <hi>prophanations,</hi> all the <hi>thefts</hi> and <hi>rapines,</hi>
all the <hi>whoredomes</hi> and <hi>abominations,</hi> all the <hi>murthers</hi> and <hi>poysonings;</hi>
and yet I say, for his <hi>glory</hi> sake he is patient, and long permits.</p>
                  <p>Hence for his peoples sake (which is the next Good in his Son)
he is oftentimes pleased to permit and suffer the wicked to enjoy
a longer <hi>reprive.</hi> Therefore he gave <hi>Paul</hi> all the <hi>lives</hi> that were in
the ship, Acts 27.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he would not so soone have destroyed <hi>Sodome,</hi> but
granted a longer <hi>permission,</hi> had there been but 10 righteous, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
Therefore, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5. had he found some to have stood in the <hi>gap,</hi> he
would have spared others. Therefore gave he <hi>Iesabel</hi> a time or
space, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for his Glory sake hath he permitted longer <hi>great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
who afterward have perished in their season, as we see in the
case of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Ninevites</hi> and <hi>Amorites. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it pleased the <hi>Lord</hi> not onely to permit the many <hi>evills</hi>
against his owne honourable ordinance of <hi>Mariage</hi> in the world,<note place="margin">Deut. 24.</note>
but was pleased after a wonderfull manner to suffer that sin of many
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50277:55"/>
wives in <hi>Abraham, Iacob, David, Salomon,</hi> yea with some expression
which seeme to give <hi>approbation,</hi> as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>

and is it not true that <hi>seducing teachers</hi> are <hi>notorious evill doers?</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>I answer: far be it from me to deny either: and yet in
two things I shall discover the great <hi>evill</hi> of this joyning and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
<hi>seducing teachers, and scandalous livers</hi> as one adaequate or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
object of the Magistrates care and worke to suppresse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</p>
                  <p>First, it is not an <hi>Homogeneall</hi> (as we speake) but an <hi>Heterogeneall</hi>
commixture or joyning together of things most different in kindes
and natures, as if they were both of one consideration.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>For who knowes not but that many <hi>seducing teachers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seducing tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, either Pagan, Jewish or Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, may yet be obedient subjects to the Civill lawes.</note> either of
the <hi>Paganish, Iewish, Turkish,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian</hi> Religion, may be clear
and free from <hi>scandalous offences</hi> in their life, as also from <hi>disobedience</hi>
to the Civill Lawes of a State? Yea the <hi>Answerer</hi> himselfe hath
elsewhere granted, that if the Lawes of a <hi>Civill State</hi> be not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the <hi>Peace</hi> is not broken.</p>
               <p>Againe, who knowes not that a <hi>seducing teacher</hi> properly sinnes
against a <hi>Church</hi> or Spirituall estate and Lawes of it, and therefore
ought most properly and onely to bee dealt withall in such a way,
and by such weapons as the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> himselfe hath appointed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50277:56"/>
                  <hi>gainsayers, opposites</hi> and <hi>disobedients</hi> (either within his Church or
without) to be <hi>convinced, repelled, resisted,</hi> and <hi>slaine</hi> withall.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>scandalous offendours</hi> against <hi>Parents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scandalous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers against the Civill state who they are.</note> against <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
in the 5 Command. and so against the <hi>life, chastity, goods</hi> or
<hi>good name</hi> in the rest, is properly transgression against the Civill
State and Commonweale, or the worldly state of Men: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consequently if the World or Civill State ought to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Civill Government</hi> or <hi>Governours;</hi> such scandalous effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
ought not to be tolerated, but supprest according to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and prudence of the said <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as there is a fallacious conjoying and confounding
together persons of severall kindes and natures, differing as much
as Spirit and Flesh, Heaven and Earth each from other. So is there
a silent and implicite <hi>justification</hi> to all the unrighteous and <hi>cruell
proceedings</hi> of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> against all the Prophets of <hi>God,</hi> the
<hi>Lord Iesus</hi> Himselfe, and all His Messengers and Witnesses, whom
their Accusers have ever so coupled and mixed with notorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<hi>doers</hi> and <hi>scandalous livers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> was a <hi>troubler</hi> of the <hi>State; Ieremy</hi> weakned the hand
of the people: yea <hi>Moses</hi> made the people neglect their worke:
the <hi>Iewes</hi> built the Rebellious and bad City: the three Worthies
regarded not the command of the King: <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> deceived the
people, was a <hi>conjurer</hi> and a <hi>traytor</hi> against <hi>Caesar</hi> in being King of

Christian) therefore He was numbred with <hi>notorious evill doers,</hi> and
nailed to the Gallowes between two Malefactours.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Paul</hi> and all true Messengers of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
seducing and seditious teachers and turners of the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
downe: Yea and to my knowledge (I speake with honourable

(saith he) had something against the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of

                  <p>I may answer with some admiration and astonishment
how it pleased the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>lights,</hi> and most jealous God to darken
and vaile the eye of so pretious a man, as not to seek out and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some Scriptures (in the proofe of so weighty an assertion) as
at least might have some colour for an influence of the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in such cases: for</p>
               </sp>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Toleration. Rev. 2. 14. 20. examined.</note> he saith not that Christ had ought against the City <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi>
(where Sathan had his throne <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.) but against the
<hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> in which was set up the Throne of Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christs Charge is not against the Civill Magistrate of
<hi>Pergamus,</hi> but the Messenger or Ministry of the Church in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I confesse so far as <hi>Balaams</hi> or <hi>Iesabels</hi> doctrine main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a liberty of <hi>corporall fornication,</hi> it concerned the City of
<hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thiatira,</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> of those Cities to
suppresse not only such <hi>practices,</hi> but such <hi>Doctrines</hi> also, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Emperour</hi> justly punished <hi>Ovid</hi> the Poet, for teaching the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Art of Love, leading to and ushering on <hi>laciviousnesse</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Yet so far as <hi>Balaams</hi> teachers or <hi>Iesabel</hi> did seduce the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> or <hi>Thiatira,</hi> to the worship of the
<hi>Idolaters</hi> in <hi>Pergamus</hi> or <hi>Thiatira</hi> (which will appeare to be the
case) I say so far I may well and properly answer, as himselfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
before those Scriptures, brought from <hi>Luc. 9. &amp; 2 Tim.</hi> 2. to
prove <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>permission</hi> to men opposite, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>These <hi>Scriptures</hi>
(saith he) are <hi>directions</hi> to <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, and in the
end of that passage he addes, Much lesse doe they speake at all to
<hi>Civill Magistrates.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Either these <hi>Churches</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> thereof had power
to suppresse these doctrines of <hi>Balaam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters &amp; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer sufficient from <hi>Christ</hi> to suppresse <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> and <hi>Iesabel</hi> seducing to false worship.</note> and to suppresse <hi>Iesabel</hi> from
teaching, or they had not:</p>
               <p>That they had not cannot be affirmed, for <hi>Christs Authority</hi> is
in the hands of his <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Churches, Matth. 16. &amp; 18. &amp;
1 Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>If they had <hi>power,</hi> as must be granted, then I conclude <hi>sufficient
power</hi> to suppresse such persons, who ever they were that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Balaams</hi> doctrine in the Church at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> although the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50277:57"/>
                  <hi>Magistrates</hi> themselves of the City of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> (if Christians)
and to have suppressed <hi>Iesabel</hi> from teaching and seducing in the
<hi>Church</hi> had she been <hi>Lady, Queen,</hi> or <hi>Empresse,</hi> if there were no
more but teaching without hostility: And if so, all <hi>power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thiatira,</hi> and
all submitting or appealing to them, in such cases, must needs fall
as none of <hi>Christs</hi> appointment.</p>
               <p>Lastly, From this perverse wresting of what is writ to the
<hi>Church</hi> and the Officers thereof, as if it were written to the <hi>Civill
State</hi> and Officers thereof; all may see how since the <hi>Apostacie</hi> of

                     <q>Againe, Princes many times tolerate offendours out of very
necessity, when the offenders are either too many or too mighty

(without any particular reply) returnes two things.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>First, that Princes profession and practice is no rule of
<hi>conscience:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. Cottons unequall dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Princes.</note> unto this as all men will subscribe, so may they also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how the Answerer deales with Princes.</p>
                  <p>One while they are the nursing Fathers of the Church, not only
to feed, but also to correct, and therefore consequently bound to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50277:58"/>
iudge what is true <hi>feeding</hi> and <hi>correcting:</hi> and consequently <hi>all men</hi>
are bound to submit to their <hi>feeding</hi> and <hi>correcting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another while, when Princes crosse Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> judgement and
practice, then it matters not what the <hi>profession</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is; for (saith he) their <hi>profession</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> is no Rule to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I aske then, unto what <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Princes</hi> will themselves
or any so perswaded submit, as unto <hi>keepers</hi> of both <hi>Tables,</hi> as unto
the <hi>Antitypes</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> and nursing <hi>Fathers</hi>
and <hi>Mothers</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, will it not evidently follow, that by these Tenents they
ought not to submit to any Magistrates in the world in these cases,
but to Magistrates just of their owne <hi>conscience:</hi> and</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that all other <hi>Consciences</hi> in the world (except their
owne) must be persecuted by such their Magistrates?</p>
                  <p>And lastly, is not this to make Magistrates but <hi>steps</hi> and <hi>stirrops</hi>

                        </gap>ration.</note> yet in the second he must acknowledge with me, that
there is a <hi>necessity</hi> sometime of <hi>State Toleration,</hi> as in the case of <hi>Ioab,</hi>
and so his former <hi>affirmation</hi> generally laid downe [<hi>viz.</hi> that it is
evill to tolerate <hi>seducing Teachers,</hi> or <hi>scandalous livers</hi>] was not duly
waighed in the <hi>Balance</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, I affirme that that State policy and State necessity,
which (for the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> and preventing of Rivers of <hi>civill
Blood</hi>) permits the <hi>Consciences</hi> of men, will bee found to agree most
punctually with the <hi>Rules</hi> of the best <hi>Politician</hi> that ever the <hi>World</hi>
saw, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> in comparison of whom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50277:59"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>That absolute Rule of this great <hi>Politician</hi> for the peace of the
<hi>Field,</hi> which is the <hi>World,</hi> and for the good and peace of the <hi>Saints,</hi>

                  <p>HIs third Answer is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For those three <hi>Princes</hi> named by you who tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<hi>Religion,</hi> we can name you more and greater who have not
tolerated <hi>Heretickes</hi> and <hi>Schismatickes,</hi> notwithstanding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Conscience, and their arrogating the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
to their sufferings.</q>

                        <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great at the request of the <hi>Generall Councell</hi> at
<hi>Nice,</hi> banished <hi>Arrius,</hi> with some of his <hi>Fellowes, Sozom. lib. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The same <hi>Constantine</hi> made a severe Law against the <hi>Donatists:</hi>
and the like proceedings against them were used by <hi>Valentinian,
Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> reports in <hi>Ep.</hi> 166. Onely
<hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi> granted liberty to <hi>Heretickes,</hi> as well as to
<hi>Pagans,</hi> that he might by tolerating all weeds to grow, choake
the <hi>vitals</hi> of <hi>Christianity:</hi> which was also the practice and sinne
of <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrian.</hi>

                        <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> as famous for her <hi>Government</hi> as most of the
former, it is well knowne what Lawes she made and executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Papists:</hi> yea and <hi>K. Iames</hi> (one of your owne <hi>Witnesses</hi>)
though he was slow in proceeding against <hi>Papists</hi> (as you say) for
Conscience sake, yet you are not ignorant how sharply and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
he punished those whom the <hi>malignant</hi> World calls <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
men of more <hi>Conscience</hi> and better <hi>Faith</hi> then the <hi>Papists</hi>

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>Unto this I answer: First, that for mine owne part I
would not use an <hi>argument</hi> from the number of <hi>Princes,</hi> witnessing
in profession of practice against <hi>Persecution</hi> for cause of <hi>Conscience;</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50277:59"/>
for the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> must not bee received with
respect of <hi>faces,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Princes of the world seldome take put with Christ.</note> be they never so high, princely and glorious.</p>
                  <p>Precious <hi>Pearles</hi> and <hi>Iewels,</hi> and farre more precious <hi>Truth</hi> are
found in muddy shells and places. The rich <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>golden Truth</hi>
lye hid under <hi>barren</hi> hills, and in <hi>obscure</hi> holes and <hi>corners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The most <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Glorious God</hi> hath chosen the <hi>poore</hi> of the
<hi>World:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Princes not persecuting are very rare.</note> and the <hi>Witnesses</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> (Rev. 11.) are cloathed in <hi>sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi>
not in <hi>Silke</hi> or <hi>Sattin, Cloth of Gold,</hi> or <hi>Tissue:</hi> and therefore I
acknowledge, if the number of <hi>Princes</hi> professing <hi>persecution</hi> bee
considered, it is rare to finde a <hi>King, Prince</hi> or <hi>Governour</hi> like <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Earth, and
who tread not in the steps of <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Fox,</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> the <hi>Lyon,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
or secretly persecuting the name of the <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> such were
<hi>Saul, Ieroboam, Ahab,</hi> though under a maske or pretence of the
name of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that purpose was it a noble speech of <hi>Buchanan,</hi>

                  <p>SEcondly, I observe how inconsiderately (I hope not

                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>Civill Obedience</hi> may be performed from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his observation on <hi>Revel</hi> 20. that true and certaine
note of a <hi>false Church,</hi> to wit, <hi>persecution:</hi> The wicked are <hi>besiegers,</hi>
the <hi>faithfull</hi> are <hi>besieged.</hi>
                  </p>

Now to confound these, is <hi>Babel;</hi> and Jewish it is to seek for

                  <p>Thirdly, he passeth by in the speech of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that

For Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> must grant, that either <hi>King Iames</hi> was not fit to be
a King, had not the essentiall <hi>qualifications</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> in not being
able rightly to judge who ought to be persecuted, and who not, or
else he must confesse that <hi>King Iames</hi> and all <hi>Magistrates</hi> must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
such whom in their <hi>Conscience</hi> they judge worthy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>I say it againe (though I neither approve Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or K.
<hi>Iames</hi> in such their persecutions, yet) such as hold this Tenent of
persecuting for <hi>Conscience,</hi> must also hold that <hi>Civill Magistrates</hi>
are not essentially fitted and qualified for their function and office,
except they can discerne clearly the difference betweene such as
are to be punished and persecuted, and such as are not.</p>
               <p>Or else if they be essentially qualified, without such a religious
spirit of discerning, and yet must persecute the <hi>Hereticke,</hi> the <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke,</hi>
&amp;c. must they not persecute according to their conscience
and perswasion. And then doubtlesse (though he bee excellent for

                  <p>In the <hi>Answerers</hi> second <hi>conclusion</hi> (in the entrance of

I have there made it evident) a Spirituall <hi>rejecting</hi> or <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi>
from the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and so comes not neer the question.</p>
                  <p>Here again he would prove <hi>Churches</hi> charged to be false, because

                  <p>IN the next place he selecteth one passage out of <hi>Hilarie,</hi>
(although there are many golden passages there exprest
against the use of <hi>Civill</hi> Earthly Powers in the Affaires of <hi>Christ.</hi>)
The passage is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is true also what he saith that neither the <hi>Apostles</hi> nor We
may propogate <hi>Christian Religion</hi> by the <hi>Sword:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Who cannot be won by the Word, must not be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the

cannot he won by the <hi>Word,</hi> they are not to be compelled by the
<hi>Sword:</hi> Neverthelesse this hindreth not (saith he) but if they or
any other should <hi>blaspheme</hi> the true <hi>God</hi> and his true <hi>Religion,</hi> they
ought to be severely punished: and no lesse doe they deserve, if
they <hi>seduce</hi> from the <hi>Truth</hi> to damnable <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Idolatrie.</hi>

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>In which Answer I observe, first his Agreement with
<hi>Hilarie,</hi> that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> may not be propagated by the
<hi>Civill Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto which I reply, and aske then what meanes this passage in
his first answer to the former speeches of the <hi>Kings,</hi> viz. <q>We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that none is to be <hi>constrained</hi> to beleeve or professe
the <hi>true Religion,</hi> till he be convinced in judgement of the Truth
of it: implying 2 things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that the <hi>Civill Magistrate,</hi> who is to constraine with the
<hi>Civill Sword,</hi> must judge all the <hi>Consciences</hi> of their Subjects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be convinced or no.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> discerns that his Subjects
<hi>consciences</hi> are convinced, then he may constraine them <hi>vi &amp; armi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hostily.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly,<note place="margin">Constraine upon Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in Old and New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> the <hi>Civill State</hi> and <hi>Magistracie</hi> judging in
<hi>spirituall things,</hi> who knowes not what <hi>constraint</hi> lies upon all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>
in <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> to come to <hi>Church,</hi> and pay <hi>Church
duties,</hi> which is upon the point (though with a <hi>sword</hi> of a finer gilt
and trim in <hi>New England</hi>) nothing else but that which he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>Hilarie</hi> saith true, should not be done, to wit, a <hi>propagation</hi> of
<hi>Religion</hi> by the <hi>Sword.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:50277:64"/>
Againe, although he confesseth that <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> ought
not to be by the <hi>sword:</hi> yet he maintaineth the use of the <hi>sword,</hi>
when persons (in the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Civill State,</hi> for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied)
<hi>blaspheme</hi> the true <hi>God,</hi> and the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and also seduce
others to damnable <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Idolatrie.</hi> Which because he barely
affirmeth in this place, I shall defer my Answer unto the after <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> and the Elders of New English Churches; where
Scriptures are alleadged, and in that place (by <hi>Gods</hi> assistance) they
shall be examined and answered.</p>

mountaines of <hi>Leopards?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But comming to the Helme (as he speaks of the <hi>Papists</hi>) how,

(I hope in their persons <hi>Lambes</hi>) unnaturally and partially expresse

                  </p>
                  <p>O that the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven might please to tell them how abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable

                  <p>I readily acknowledge (as formerly I did concerning
the testimony of <hi>Princes</hi>) that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is too hard for <hi>Christ</hi> at
<hi>votes</hi> and <hi>numbers:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Superstition &amp; persecution have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny votes from Gods owne people.</note> yea and beleeve that in many points (wherein

<hi>superstition</hi> and <hi>persecution</hi> have had more suffrages and votes
from <hi>Gods</hi> owne people then hath either been honourable to the
<hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>peaceable</hi> to their owne or the soules of others: Therefore
(not to derogate from the pretious <hi>memory</hi> of any of them) let us
briefly consider what they have in this point affirmed.</p>
                  <p>To begin with <hi>Austin:</hi> 
                     <q>They murther (saith he) soules, and
themselves are afflicted in body, and they put men to everlasting
death, and yet they complaine when themselves are put to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

                  </p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Austins</hi> saying for persecution examined.</note> This <hi>Rhetoricall perswasion of humane wisdome</hi> seems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reasonable in the eye of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> but one <hi>Scripture</hi> more
prevailes with faithfull and obedient soules then thousands of plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>le
and eloquent speeches: in particular,</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Scripture</hi> useth <hi>soule-killing</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Soul-killing.</note> in a large sense, not only for
the <hi>teaching</hi> of <hi>false prophets</hi> and <hi>seducers,</hi> but even for the <hi>offensive
walking of Christians,</hi> in which respect 1 Cor. 8.) a true <hi>Christian</hi>
may be guilty of destroying a soule for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died, and
therefore by this rule ought to be hanged, burned, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That plausible similitude will not prove that every
false <hi>teaching</hi> or false practice actually kills the <hi>soule,</hi> as the <hi>body</hi>
is slaine, and slaine but once, for <hi>soules</hi> infected or bewitched may
againe <hi>recover,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. Gal. 5. 2 Tim. 2. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for <hi>soule-killings,</hi> yea also for <hi>soule-woundings</hi> and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> hath appointed <hi>remedies</hi> sufficient in his <hi>Church.</hi>
There comes forth a <hi>two edged sword</hi> out of his <hi>mouth</hi> (Rev. 1. and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50277:68"/>
Rev. 2) able to cut downe <hi>Heresie</hi> (as is confest) yea and to kill the
<hi>Hereticke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Punishments provided by Christ Jesus against Soule-killers and Soule-woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> yea and to punish his <hi>soule</hi> everlastingly, which no <hi>sword</hi>
of <hi>steele</hi> can reach unto in any punishment comparable or imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and therefore in this case we may say of this <hi>spirituall soule-killing</hi>
by the <hi>sword</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> mouth, as <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous
person, 2 Cor. 2. <hi>Sufficient</hi> is this <hi>punishment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Although no <hi>Soule-killers,</hi> nor <hi>Soule-grievers</hi> may be
suffred in the <hi>Spirituall</hi> State or Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Church;</hi>
yet he hath commanded that such should be suffered and permitted
to be and live in the <hi>World,</hi> as I have proved on <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
thousands and millions of <hi>soules</hi> and bodies both, must be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and cut off by <hi>civill combustions</hi> and bloody warres about
<hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I argue thus: The Soules of all men in the World are
either naturally <hi>dead in Sin,</hi> or alive in <hi>Christ.</hi> If dead in sinne, no
man can kill them,<note place="margin">Men dead in Sin, cannot be Soule kill'd. A Nationall enforced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill War for Religion the two great preventers of soule conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and life.</note> no more then he can kill a <hi>dead man:</hi> Nor is it a
false Teacher or false Religion that can so much <hi>prevent</hi> the means
of <hi>Spirituall life,</hi> as one of these two; Either the <hi>force</hi> of a <hi>material
sword,</hi> imprisoning the Soules of men in a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Nationall Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Ministery</hi> or <hi>Worship;</hi> Or secondly, <hi>Civill warres</hi> and <hi>combustions</hi>
for <hi>Religion</hi> sake, whereby men are immediately cut off without any
longer <hi>meanes</hi> of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now againe, for the Soules that are alive in <hi>Christ,</hi> he hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
appointed <hi>Ordinances</hi> powerfully <hi>sufficient</hi> to maintaine and
cherish that <hi>life, Armour of proofe</hi> able to defend them against <hi>men</hi>
and <hi>devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Soule once alive in Christ, is like Christ himselfe,
(<hi>Revel.</hi> 1.) alive for ever, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.) and cannot die a <hi>spirituall
death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, Grant a man to be a <hi>false Teacher,</hi> an <hi>Heretick,</hi> a <hi>Balaam,</hi>
a <hi>Spirituall Witch,</hi> a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> a <hi>Persecuter,</hi> breathing out <hi>blasphemies</hi>
against <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Soule killers prove (by the grace of Christ) Soule savers.</note> and <hi>slaughters</hi> against his <hi>followers,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did,
<hi>Act.</hi> 9.
I say, these who appeare <hi>Soule-killers</hi> to day, by the grace of <hi>Christ</hi>
may prove (as <hi>Paul) Soule-savers</hi> to morrow: and saith <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Timothy (1 Tim.</hi> 4.) thou shalt save thy selfe and them that heare
thee: which all must necessarily be prevented, if all that comes
within the sense of these <hi>Soule-killers,</hi> must (as guilty of blood) be

                  <p>More particularly concerning <hi>Moses,</hi> I quaerie what <hi>commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
or <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> either <hi>Optatus</hi> or the <hi>Answerer</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend?
Probably that passage of <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. wherein <hi>Moses</hi> appointed
a slaughter either of a <hi>person</hi> or a <hi>city</hi> that should depart from the
<hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> with whom that <hi>Nationall Church</hi> was in Covenant.
And if so, I shall particularly reply to that place in my Answer to
the Reasons hereunder mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Phineas</hi> his zealous Act:</p>
                  <p>First, his slaying of the <hi>Israelitish</hi> man, and woman of <hi>Midian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phineas his act discussed.</note>
was not for <hi>spirituall,</hi> but <hi>corporall</hi> filthines.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, no man will produce his <hi>fact</hi> as presidentiall to any
<hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> so to act in any <hi>Civill state</hi> or <hi>Commonweale;</hi>
although I believe in the <hi>Church of God</hi> it is <hi>presidentiall</hi> for either
<hi>Minister</hi> or <hi>people</hi> to kill and slay with the <hi>two-edged sword</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> any such bold and open presumptuous sinners as these
were.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, concerning <hi>Eliah:</hi> There were two famous <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Eliah</hi>
of a killing nature:</p>
                  <p>First, that of slaying 850 of <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly of the two <hi>Captaines</hi> and their Fifties, by fire, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the first of these,<note place="margin">Elia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters examined.</note> it cannot figure or type out any <hi>materiall
slaughter</hi> of the many thousands of <hi>false Prophets</hi> in the World by
any <hi>materiall sword</hi> of Iron or Steele: for as that passage was <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:50277:69"/>
so finde we not any such <hi>commission</hi> given by the <hi>Lord
Iesus</hi> to the Ministers of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And lastly, such a slaughter must
not only extend to all the false <hi>prophets</hi> in the World, but (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Answerers</hi> grounds) to the many thousands of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of <hi>Idolaters</hi> and false <hi>worshippers</hi> in the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi>
of the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the second Act of <hi>Eliah,</hi>

But the question is, whether an Heretick after once or twice
Admonition, (and so after Conviction) and any other scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and heynous offender, may be tolerated either in the Church
without Excommunication, or in the Common-weale without
such punishment as may preserve others from dangerous and

                  <p>I Here observe the <hi>Answerers partiality,</hi> that none but such
as truly feare God should enjoy <hi>Libertie</hi> of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

first is only the gift of <hi>God,</hi> the second and third are too commonly
practised upon this ground.</p>
                  <p>Againe, since there is so much controversie in the World, where
the name of <hi>Christ</hi> is taken up, concerning the true <hi>Church,</hi> the

aske who shall judge in this case, who be they that feare God?</p>
                  <p>It must needs be granted, that such as have the power of <hi>suffring</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Dangerous consequences flowing from the Civill Magistrates judging in Spirituall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> such <hi>Consciences,</hi> must judge: and then must it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
(as before I intimated) that the <hi>Civill State</hi> must judge of the

<hi>God,</hi> must judge of the feare of <hi>God:</hi> also that their <hi>judgement</hi> or

Or that there is no lawfull <hi>Magistrate,</hi> who is not able to
judge in such cases. And lastly, that since the <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> of all
<hi>Civill Authority</hi> is founded in the <hi>consent</hi> of the People, that every
<hi>Common-weale</hi> hath radically and fundamentally in it a power of
true discerning the true feare of God,<note place="margin">The World turned upside down.</note> which they transfer to their

unto whose Civill Government he may submit: and then (as I said
before) there must be no <hi>World,</hi> nor is it lawfull to live in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath not a true discerning Spirit to judge them that feare

                  <p>Lastly, although this worthy <hi>Answerer</hi> so readily grants, that
<hi>Libertie</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> should be suffred to them that feare <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:<note place="margin">The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full answer of the Ministers of the Church of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the Ministers of the Church of Old England.</note> yet we know what the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi>

not then be said (as it was by one, passing sentence of <hi>Banishment</hi>

the <hi>Iudge</hi> not to respect the poore in the cause of <hi>judgement,</hi>
commands him not to respect the holy or the godly person?</p>

judge and punish in Spiritual <hi>causes,</hi> his <hi>power, authority</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
must be either <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>Civill,</hi> or else he hath none at all,
and so acts without a <hi>commission</hi> and warrant from the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Civill Magistrate confest to have no Civill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over the soules of men.</note>
and so consequently stands guilty at the Bar of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for such his practice as a transcendent <hi>Delinquent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>civill power,</hi> these worthy <hi>Authors</hi> confesse that the
<hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>civill Magistrate</hi> extendeth no further then over
the <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>goods</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and therefore hath no <hi>civill

power</hi> over the <hi>Soule,</hi> and therefore (say I) not in <hi>Soule-causes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is here confest in this passage, that to attaine his
Civill end or <hi>Bonum temporale,</hi> he hath no <hi>Spirituall power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nor spirituall.</note> and
therefore of necessitie out of their own mouths must they be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for provoking the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> without either <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Spirituall
power,</hi> to judge, punish and persecute in <hi>Spirituall causes;</hi> and to
feare and tremble, lest they come neere those <hi>frogs</hi> which proceed

by the same <hi>Arguments</hi> which the <hi>Authours</hi> here use stirre up the

               <p>IN the next place I observe upon the point of <hi>Delinquencie,</hi> such
a <hi>confusion,</hi> as <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> may stand amazed at: If the
<hi>Church</hi> offend (say they) after advice refused, in conclusion the
<hi>Magistrate</hi> must redresse, that is, punish the <hi>Church</hi> (that is, in
<hi>Church offences</hi> and cases) by a course of <hi>Civill justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other side, if the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> offend after <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

<hi>censure,</hi> that is, to Excommunication, as is afterward more largely

               <p>Now I demand, if the <hi>Church</hi> be a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> who shall judge?

Whence I observe, (which is monstrous in all cases in the <hi>World</hi>)
that one person, to wit, the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Magistrate,</hi> shall be at one
time the <hi>Delinquent</hi> at the <hi>Bar,</hi> and the <hi>Iudge</hi> upon the <hi>Bench.</hi>
This is cleere thus: The <hi>Church</hi> must judge when the <hi>Magistrate</hi>
offends; and yet the <hi>Magistrate</hi> must judge when the <hi>Church</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends;
and so consequently in this case must judge whether she
contemne <hi>Civill Authority</hi> in the Second <hi>Table,</hi> for thus dealing
with him: Or whether she have broken the rules of the first Table,
of which (say they) God hath made him <hi>Keeper</hi> and <hi>Conserver.</hi> And
therefore, though the <hi>Church</hi> make him a <hi>Delinquent</hi> at the <hi>Bar,</hi>
yet by their confession <hi>God</hi> hath made him a <hi>Iudge</hi> on the <hi>Bench.</hi>
What <hi>blood,</hi> what <hi>tumults</hi> hath been, and must be spilt upon these

Or secondly, shall she say the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is not a true <hi>Magistrate'</hi>

                  <p>Therefore, thirdly, they must ingenuously and honestly confesse,

but a <hi>Commonweale</hi> of <hi>Families</hi> agreeing to live together
for common good?</p>
                  <p>Now in <hi>families,</hi> suppose a beleeving <hi>Christian Husband</hi> hath an

her from her conscience unto his, as that if for his conscience

                  <p>Now as a <hi>husband</hi> by his <hi>love</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> and holy <hi>conversation</hi> in

the appearance of <hi>civill violence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">If the charge of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was left with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, then was he bound to turne the whole world into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Flock, and Spouse of Christ.

have no power (though as members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale
they may have power) of erecting or altering formes of
Civill Government, electing of Civill officers, inflicting Civill
punishments (no not on persons excommunicate) as by deposing
Magistrates from their Civill Authoritie, or withdrawing the
hearts of the people against them, to their Lawes, no more then
to discharge wives, or children, or servants, from due obedience
to their husbands, parents, or masters: or by taking up armes

                  <p>Here are divers considerable <hi>passages</hi> which I shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     </gap>r <hi>controversie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, whereas they say, that the <hi>Civill Power</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Civill power originally and fundamentally in the people.</note> may erect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
what <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>civill Government</hi> may seeme in <hi>wisedome</hi> most
meet, I acknowledge the <hi>proposition</hi> to be most true, both in it self,
and also considered with the end of it, that a <hi>civill Government</hi> is an
<hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to conserve the <hi>civill peace</hi> of people, so farre
as concernes their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> as formerly hath beene
said.</p>
                  <p>But from this <hi>Grant</hi> I infer, (as before hath been touched) that
the <hi>Soveraigne, originall,</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>civill power</hi> lies in the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
(whom they must needs meane by the <hi>civill power</hi> distinct from
the <hi>Government</hi> set up.) And if so, that a People may erect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
what <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> seemes to them most meete for
their <hi>civill condition:</hi> It is evident that such <hi>Governments</hi> as are by
them erected and established, have no more <hi>power,</hi> nor for no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
time, then the <hi>civill power</hi> or people consenting and agreeing
shall betrust them with. This is cleere not only in <hi>Reason,</hi> but in
the experience of all <hi>common-weales,</hi> where the people are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their <hi>naturall freedome</hi> by the power of <hi>Tyrants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if so, that the Magistrates receive their power of governing
the Church,<note place="margin">Mr. Cotton and the New-English Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters give the Government of Christs Church or Spouse into the hands of the people or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</note> from the People; undeniably it followes, that a <hi>people,</hi>
as a <hi>people,</hi> naturally considered (of what <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> soever
in <hi>Europe, Asia, Africa</hi> or <hi>America</hi>) have fundamentally and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,
as men, a power to governe the <hi>Church,</hi> to see her doe her
<hi>duty,</hi> to correct her, to redresse, reforme, establish, &amp;c. And if this
be not to pull <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and subject
them unto <hi>naturall,</hi> sinfull, inconstant men, and so consequently
to <hi>Sathan</hi> himselfe, by whom all <hi>peoples</hi> naturally are guided, let

                  <p>THeir fifth Head is concerning the Magistrates power in
making of Lawes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, they have power to publish and apply such Civill Lawes
in a State as either are exprest in the Word of God in <hi>Moses</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicialls
(to wit, so far as they are of generall and morall equity,
and so binding all Nations in all Ages) to bee deducted by way
of generall consequence and proportion from the word of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For in a free State no Magistrate hath power over the bodies,
goods, lands, liberties of a free people, but by their free consents.
And because free men are not free Lords of their owne estates,
but are onely stewards under God, therefore they may not give
their free consents to any Magistrate to dispose of their bodies,
goods, lands, liberties at large as themselves please, but as God (the
soveraigne Lord of all) alone. And because the Word is a perfect
rule as wel of righteousnes as of holines, it will be therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that neither the people give consent, nor that the Magistrate
take power to dispose of the bodies, goods, lands, liberties of the
people, but according to the Lawes and Rules of the Word of
God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, in making Lawes about civill and indifferent things
about the Commonweale.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, he hath no power given him of God to make what laws
he please, either in restraining from, or constraining to the use of
indifferent things, because that which is indifferent in its nature,
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> sometimes bee inexpedient in its use, and consequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. it having been long since defended upon good
ground, <hi>Quicquid non expeait, quatenus non expedit, non licet.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:50277:83"/>
                     <q>Secondly, he hath no power to make any such Lawes about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things, wherein nothing good or evill is shewne to the
people, but onely or principally the meere authority or wil of the
imposer for the observance of them, <hi>Colos. 2. 21, 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 23,
compared with <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 6.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is a prerogative proper to God to require obedience of the
sonnes of men, because of his authority and will.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The will of no man is <hi>Regula recti,</hi> unlesse first it bee <hi>Regula
recta.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is an evill speech of some, that in some things the will of the
Law, not the <hi>ratio</hi> of it, must be the Rule of Conscience to walke
by; and that Princes may forbid men to seeke any other reason
but their authority, yea when they command <hi>frivola &amp; dura.</hi> And
therefore it is the duty of the Magistrate in all lawes about indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things, to shew the Reasons, not onely the Will, to shew
the expediency, as well as the indifferency of things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For we conceive in Lawes of this nature, it is not the will of
the Lawgiver onely, but the Reason of the Law which bindes.
<hi>Ratio est Rex Legis, &amp; Lex est Rex Regis.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, because the judgement of expedient and inexpedient
things is often difficult and diverse, it is meet that such Lawes
should not proceed without due consideration of the Rules
of Expediency set downe in the Word, which are these three:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, the rule of Piety, that they may make for the glory of
God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, the rule of Charity, that no scandall come hereby to
any weake brother, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, the Rule of Charity, that no man be forced to submit
against his <hi>conscience, Rom.</hi> 14. 14. 23. nor be judged of contempt
of lawfull <hi>Authority,</hi> because he is not suddenly perswaded of the
<hi>expediency</hi> of indifferent things; for if the people be bound by <hi>God</hi>
to receive such Lawes about such things, without any triall or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the <hi>conscience,</hi> but must judge them <hi>expedient</hi> because
the <hi>Magistrate</hi> thinkes them so, then the one cannot be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>In this passage these worthy Men lay downe such a

thousand <hi>shields</hi> and <hi>bucklars, Cant</hi> 4. to wit, that invincible <hi>Truth,</hi>
That no man is to be <hi>persecuted</hi> for cause of <hi>conscience:</hi> The ground
is this: The <hi>Magist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ate</hi> hath not <hi>power</hi> to make what <hi>Lawes</hi> he
please, either in <hi>restraining</hi> or <hi>constraining</hi> to the use of indifferent
things: And further he confesseth that the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> not
the <hi>will</hi> of it must be the rule of conscience. And they adde this
impregnable reason: viz. <q>If the people be bound to receive
such Lawes without satisfaction to conscience, then one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be punished for following the other, in case he shall sinne
contrary to Christ Jesus, who saith, If the blinde lead the blinde,
they shall both fall.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I argue, If the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> have no power to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine</hi>
or <hi>constraine</hi> their <hi>subjects</hi> in things in their owne nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,<note place="margin">Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to have power to urg the conscience in indifferent things.</note> as in eating of <hi>meats,</hi> wearing this or that <hi>garment,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and that they shall sinne, if they follow the
<hi>Magistrates</hi> command, not being perswaded in their owne soule

be much more unlawfull and heynous in the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

fall in first, yet they shall in after him, and upon him, to his greater
and more dreadfull judgement.</p>
                  <p>In particular thus, If the Magistrate may restraine me from that
gesture in the Supper of the Lord, which I am perswaded I ought
to practice, he may also restraine me by his commands from that
Supper of the Lord it selfe in such or such a Church according to
my conscience.</p>
                  <p>If he cannot (as they grant) constraine me to such or such a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <q>Thirdly, in matters Ecclesiasticall we beleeve, first,
That Civill Magistrates have no power to make or constitute

in his Word for the well ordering of the Church; for
the Apostle solemnely chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him all
Goverours of the Church, before God and the Lord
Jesus Christ (who is the only Potentate, the King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords) that the Commandement given by him for the
ordering of the Church be kept without spot unrebukeable to
the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. 15. And
this Commandement given in the Word, the Apostle faith is able
to make the man of God perfect in all Righteousnesse, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
17. And indeed the adminstration of all Christs affaires doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
aime at spirituall and divine ends (as the worship of
God and the salvation of mens soules:) and therefore no Law
nor meanes can be devised by the wisdome or wit of man that
can be fit or able to reach such ends, but use must be made of such
onely as the divine Wisdome and holy Will of God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, We beleeve the Magistrates power in making
Lawes about Church affaires, is not only thus limited and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Christ to matters which concerne the substance of Gods
worship and of Church government, but also such as concerne
outward order, as in Rites and Ceremonies for uniformities sake:
For we finde not in the Gospell that Christ hath any where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for the uniformity of Churches, but onely for their unity.</q>

                     <q>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> in matters of Christian libertie commendeth the unity of
their Faith in the holy Spirit, giving order that wee should not
judge nor condemne one another in difference of judgement and
practice of such things where men live to God on both sides, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
though there were some errour on one side, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. to the 6.

                  <p>
                     <q>When the Apostle directeth the Church of Corinth that all
things be done decently and in order, he meant not to give po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to Church Officers, or to Civill Magistrates to order what
ever they should thinke meet for decencie and order; but only
to provide that all the Ordinances of God be administred in the

of God in his Word concerning the right ordering of the Church,
may and ought to publish and declare, establish and ratifie such
Lawes and Ordinances as Christ hath appointed in his Word for
the well ordering of Church affaires, both for the gathering of
the Church, and the right administration of all the Ordinances of
God amongst them in such a manner as the Lord hath appointed
to edification. The Law of <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> 7. 23. was not
usurpation over the Churches liberty, but a Royall and just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of them: Whatsoever is commanded by the God of

                     </gap>Tis true, <hi>Ezra</hi> most piously and justly gave thankes to God for
putting such a thing into the heart of the King: But what makes
this pattern for the Laws of Civil Governours now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell?<note place="margin">Ezra's thanks<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giving for the Kings decree examined.</note> It suited well with that Nationall state of Gods Church, that
the Gentile King should release them, permit them to returne to
their own Land, assist them with other favours, and enable them to
execute punishments upon offenders according to their Nationall
State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:50277:89"/>
But did God put such a thing as this into the heart of the King,
viz. to restraine upon paine of Death all the millions of men under
his Dominion from the Idolatties of their severall and respective
Countries? to constraine them all upon the like penaltie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to the Worship of the God of Israel, to build him a Temple,
erect an Altar, ordaine Priests, offer sacrifice, observe the Fasts and
Feasts of Israel? yea did God put it into the Kings heart to send
Levites into all the parts of his Dominion, compelling them to
heare; which is but a naturall thing (as some unsoundly speake)
unto which all are bound to submit?</p>
                  <p>Well however, <hi>Ezra</hi> gives thankes to God for the <hi>Kings,</hi> and
so should all that feate God in all Countries,<note place="margin">The duty of all Civill States toward the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Subjects.</note> if he would please to
put it into the hearts of the Kings, States and Parliaments, to take
off the yoakes of Violence, and permit (at least) the Consciences
of their Subjects, and especially such as in truth make Conscience

then, or Gods <hi>Ezra's</hi> and Israelites now, to acknowledge the care
and charge of Gods worship, Church and Ordinances, to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shoulders of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> or any other Civill Prince or
Ruler.</p>
                  <p>Lastly for the Confirmation or Ratification which they suppose
Magistrates are bound to give to the Lawes of Christ,<note place="margin">Christ needs no humane confirmations.</note> I answer,
Gods cause, Christs Truth, and the two-edged sword of his Word,

to confirme and ratifie them. If we receive the witnesse of an
honest man, the witnesse of the most holy God is greater,
1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>The result and summe of the whole matter is this: 1. It may
please <hi>God</hi> sometimes to stir up the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Earth to permit
and tolerate, to favour and countenance <hi>Gods</hi> people in their <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,</hi>

                  <p>THe sixt question is this: How far the <hi>Church</hi> is subject
to their Lawes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>All those (say they) who are members of the Commonweale
are bound to be subject to all the just and righteous Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and therefore (membership in Churches not cutting men off
from the membership in commonweales) they are bound to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
even every soule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. as Christ himselfe and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were in their places wherein they lived, and therefore to
exempt the Clergy (as the Papists do) from Civill subjection, and
to say that <hi>generatio Clerici, is corruptio subditi,</hi> is both sinfull and
scandalous to the Gospel of God; and though all are equally
subject, yet Church members are more especially bound to yeeld
subjection, and the most eminent most especially bound, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because conscience doth more strongly binde, but also because
their ill examples are more infectious to others, pernicious to the
State, and provoke Gods wrath to bring vengeance on the
State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Hence if the whole Church or officers of the Church shall
sin against the State or any person by sedition, contempt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
heresie, blasphemy, oppression, slander, or shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
any of their members from the service of the State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <p>First, those Scriptures produced concerne only the people of

Church of Christ Jesus, which (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> confesseth) is not
Nationall but Congregationall of so many as may meet in one

shew the difference betweene that Nationall Church and State of
Israel,<note place="margin">The Law of putting to death blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Secondly, If the Rulers of the Earth are bound to put to death
all that worship other gods then the true God, or that blaspheme
(that is speake evill of in a lesser or higher degree) that one true
God; it must unavoidably follow that (the beloved for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sake) the Jewes whose very Religion blasphemeth Christ in
the highest degree, I say they are actually sonnes of death, and all
to be immediately executed according to those quoted Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Townes, Cities, Nations and Kingdomes of
the World must generally be put to the sword, if they speedily
renounce not their Gods and Worships, and so cease to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the true God by their Idolatries: This bloody consequence
cannot be avoided by any Scripture rule, for if that rule be of force

what heapes upon heapes in the slaughter houses and shambles of
Civill Warres must the world come to, as I have formerly noted,
and that unnecessarily, it being not required by the Lord Jesus for
his sake, and the Magistrates power and weapons being essentially
Civill, and so not reaching to the impiety or ungodlinesse, but the
incivility and unrighteousnesse of tongue or hand?</p>

at my tender heart! Oh when shall the Prince of peace

propose their 7 head: viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In what order may the Magistrate execute punishment on a
Church or Church-member that offendeth his Lawes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, grosse and publicke notorious sinnes which are against
the light of conscience as Heresie, &amp;c. there the Magistrate kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
him under safe ward should send the offendour first to the
Church to heale his conscience, still provided that the Church
be both able and willing thereunto: By which meanes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
shall convince such an ones conscience that he seeketh
his healing, rather then his hurt.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:50277:91"/>
                     <q>The censure also against him shall proceed with more power
and blessing, and none shall have cause to say that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
persecutes men for their consciences, but that he justly
punisheth such an one for sinning rather against his conscience,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 0.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, in private offences how the Magistrate may proceed,
see Chap. 12. It is not materiall whether the Church or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
take it first in hand. Only with this caution, that if the State
take it first in hand, they are not to proceed to death or banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
untill the Church hath taken their course with him, to
bring him to Repentance, provided that the Church be willing
and ready thereunto.</q>
                  </p>

Heresie, &amp;c.</p>

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>Here I have many just exceptions and considerations
to present.</p>
                  <p>First, they propose a distinction of some sinnes: some are against
the light of conscience, &amp;c. and they instance in Heresie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I have before discust this point of an Heretick sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
light of conscience: And I shall adde that howsoever they
lay this down as an infallible conclusion that all Heresie is against
light of Conscience; yet (to passe by the discussion of the nature
of Heresie, in which respect it may so be that even themselves may
be found hereticall,<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after light presented, and exhortations powerfully pressed,
either Turkes or Pagans, Jewes or Antichristians, strongly even to
the death hold fast (or rather are held fast by) their delusions.</p>
                  <p>Yea Gods people themselves, being deluded and captivated are
strongly confident even against some fundamentalls,<note place="margin">Gods people as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will be found obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errors in which suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution doth harden.</note> especially of
worship, and yet not against the light, but according to the light or
eye of a deceived conscience.</p>
                  <p>Now all these consciences walke on confidently and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
even to the suffering of death and torments, and are more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed in their beleefe and conscience, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and cruell courses of persecution are used toward them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, speakes not the Scripture expresly of the Jew, <hi>Isa. 6.

                  <p>THeir eighth question is this: viz. What power Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
have about the gathering of Churches?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, the Magistrate hath power, and it is his duty to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and countenance such persons, as voluntarily joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in holy Covenant, both by his presence (if it may be) and
promise of protection, they accepting the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
from other neighbour Churches.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, he hath power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o forbid all Idolatrous and corrupt
Assemblies, who offer to put themselves under their patronage,
and shall attempt to joyne themselves into a Church-estate, and
if they shall not hearken, to force them therefrom by the power
of the Sword, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 8. For our tolerating many Religions
in a State in severall Churches, beside the provoking of God, may
in time not only corrupt, leaven, divide, and so destroy the peace
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50277:93"/>
of the Churches, but also dissolve the continuity of the State, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ours whose wals are made of the stones of the Churches:
it being also contrary to the end of our planting in this part of
the World, which was not only to enjoy the pure Ordinances,
but to enjoy them all in purity.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, He hath power to compell all men within his grant,
to heare the Word, for hearing the Word of God is a duty which
the light of Nature leadeth even Heathens to: The Ninivites
heard <hi>Ionah,</hi> though a stranger, and unknowne unto them, to be
an extraordinary Prophet, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3. And <hi>Eglon</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi>
hearing that <hi>Ehud</hi> had a message from God, he rose out of his
seat for more reverent attention, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 20.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Yet he hath no power to compell all men to become members
of Churches, because he hath not power to make them fit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
for the Church, which is not wrought by the power of the
Sword, but by the power of the Word: Nor may he force the
Churches to accept of any for members, but those whom the
Churches themselves can freely approve of.</q>

                  <p>To the first branch of this <hi>head,</hi> I answer, That the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>
should encourage and countenance the <hi>Church,</hi> yea and
protect the persons of the <hi>Church</hi> from violence, disturbance, &amp;c.
It being truly noble and glorious, by how much the <hi>Spouse</hi> and

of the <hi>World,</hi> in <hi>glory, beauty, chastity</hi> and <hi>innocency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, all <hi>Magistrates</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> do this: viz. Incourage and
protect that <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>worshippers,</hi> which they judge
to be true and approve of; but not permitting other consciences

children, though unexcommunicate, no nor permit them to worship
God after their consciences, and as their Mother hath taught them
this secretly and silently, they have a minde to doe, which publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they would seem to <hi>disclaime,</hi> and professe against.</p>

                  <p>Deare <hi>Peace,</hi> These are more then conjectures, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
now espie, and all that love the purity of the worship of the
living God should lament such halting: I shall adde this, not only
doe they partially neglect to cut off the wicked of the Land, but
such as themselves esteemed beloved and goldy have they driven
forth, and keep out others which would come unto them, eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
godly by their owne confession, because differing in conscience

and worship from them, and consequently not to be suffered in
their holy Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But having examined that Scripture alledged, let us now weigh
their Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First (say they) the not cutting off by the sword, but tolerating
many <hi>Religions</hi> in a State would provoke God: unto which</p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Christ Jesus never appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but his owne to be cut off by the Civill Sword.</note> first (and here being no Scripture produced to these
<hi>Reasons,</hi> shall the sooner answer) that no proofe can be made from
the <hi>Institutions</hi> of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> that all Religions but one are to be
cut off by the <hi>Civill Sword;</hi> that Nationall <hi>Church</hi> in that typicall
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> being abolished, and the <hi>Christian Commonweale</hi> or
<hi>Church</hi> instituted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I affirme that the cutting off by the Sword other
<hi>Consciences</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> is (contrarily) most provoking unto God,<note place="margin">A bloudy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>
expressely against his will concerning the Tares <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. as I
have before proved; as also the bloudy <hi>mother</hi> of all those mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
mischiefes (where such cutting off is used) both to the <hi>soules</hi>
and <hi>bodies</hi> of men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let <hi>conscience</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> speake how in the not cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off their many <hi>Religions,</hi> it hath pleased God not only not to be
provoked, but to prosper the state of the united Provinces our next
neighbours, and that to admiration.</p>

                  <speaker>Peace.</speaker>
                  <p>The second reason is, such tolerating would leaven, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and destroy the peace of the Churches.</p>

that the permitting to <hi>leaven</hi> of false <hi>doctrine</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Civill

of <hi>leaven</hi> in <hi>persons, doctrines</hi> or <hi>practices</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> that indeed
will corrupt and spread, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. but this <hi>Reason</hi> should
never have been alledged, were not the particular <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>New

                  <p>Their third <hi>Reason</hi> is, it will dissolve the <hi>continuity</hi> of the

                  <p>I answer briefly to this bare <hi>affirmation</hi> thus, that the true
<hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>wall</hi> spirituall and mysticall, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>Then consequently a false Church or Company is a false or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>wall,</hi> and none of <hi>Christs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>civill State, Power</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> is a <hi>civill wall, &amp;c.</hi> and</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the <hi>walls</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> or stone about a City are the naturall

                  <p>Now in consideration of these foure wals I desire it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>If this have reference to that practice amongst them, <hi>viz.</hi>
that none but members of <hi>Churches</hi> enjoy <hi>civill</hi> freedome amongst
them (ordinarily) in imitation of that <hi>Nationall Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then I answer, they that follow <hi>Moses Church consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>)
which the <hi>New English</hi> by such a practice implicitely doe)
must cease to pretend to the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his <hi>institutions.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, their <hi>civill New English State</hi> framed out of their <hi>Churches</hi>

                  <p>Concerning <hi>Eglon</hi> his rising up: First, <hi>Eh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But how doe both these instances mightily convince and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

<hi>Church</hi> estate differing from their owne, though for personall <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
and excellency of gifts reverenced by themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to the point of <hi>compulsion:</hi> It hath pleased the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi>
to appoint a two fold Ministry of his Word.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">A two fold Ministry of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and feeding.</note> for <hi>unbeleevers</hi> and their <hi>conversion,</hi> according to <hi>Math. 28.
19. Marc.</hi> 16 15, 16. and the constant practice of the Apostles in

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, a Ministry of <hi>feeding</hi> and <hi>nourishing</hi> up such as are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
and brought into <hi>Church estate,</hi> according to <hi>Ephes. 4. &amp;c.</hi>
Now to neither of these doe we finde any compulsion appointed by
the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> or practised by any of his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50277:96"/>
The compulsion preached and practised in <hi>New England,</hi> is not to
the hearing of that <hi>Ministry</hi> sent forth to convert unbeleevers, and
to constitute <hi>Churches:</hi> for such a <hi>Ministry</hi> they practise not: but
to the hearing of the word of <hi>edification, exhortation, consolation,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
onely in the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>worshippers:</hi> I apply,</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> came first to <hi>Corinth</hi> to preach <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> by
their
Rule the Magistrates of <hi>Corinth</hi> ought by the Sword to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
all the people of <hi>Corinth</hi> to heare <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Paul never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any civill compulsion.</note> after a Church of <hi>Christ</hi> was gathered (by their rule)
the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> ought to have compelled the people
still (even those who had refused his Doctrine, for the few onely
of the Church embraced it) to have heard the Word still, and to
have kept one day in seven to the <hi>Christians God,</hi> and to have come
to the <hi>Christians Church</hi> all their dayes. And what is this but a setled
formality of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> unto which a people are brought
by the power of the sword?</p>
                  <p>And however they affirme that persons are not to be compelled
to be <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The New English for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to church all their daies, and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them not to any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as they say) they force the people then to be of no religion all their dayes,</note> nor the Church compelled to receive
any: Yet if persons be compelled to forsake their Religion which
their hearts cleave to, and to come to <hi>Church,</hi> to the <hi>worship</hi> of the
<hi>Word, Prayers, Psalmes,</hi> and <hi>Contributions,</hi> and this all their dayes:
I aske whether this be not this peoples Religion, unto which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
they shall be quiet all their dayes, without the inforcing
them to the practice of any other Religion? And if this bee not so,
then I aske, Will it not inevitably follow, that they (not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
but) enforce people to bee of no Religion at all, all their
dayes?</p>
                  <p>This toleration of Religion, or rather irreligious <hi>compulsion,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all <hi>tolerations</hi> monstrous, to wit, to compell men to bee of no
<hi>Religion</hi> all their dayes. I desire all men and these worthy <hi>Authors</hi>
of this Modell, to lay their hands upon their heart, and to consider
whether this <hi>compulsion</hi> of men to heare the <hi>Word,</hi> (as they say)
whether it carries men, to wit, to be of no <hi>Religion</hi> all their dayes,
worse then the very <hi>Indians,</hi> who dare not live without <hi>Religion</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they are perswaded.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I adde, from the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> and practice
of the Apostles (Acts 2. 42.) where the Word and Prayer is joyned
with the exercise of their <hi>fellowship,</hi> and breaking of Bread; in
which Exercises the <hi>Church</hi> continued constantly: that it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50277:97"/>
that a <hi>Civill State</hi> may as lawfully compell men by the <hi>civill

<hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Fellowship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, they are all of the same <hi>nature, Ordinances</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi>
(I speake of the <hi>feeding Ministrie</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> unto which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are compell'd) and <hi>Church Worship.</hi> Secondly, every <hi>conscience</hi>
in the <hi>World</hi> is fearfull, at least shie of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of
other <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Worships,</hi> and of holding Spirituall fellowship in
any of their Services. Which is the case of many a Soule, viz. to

                     <q>Secondly, the Maintenance of Church-officers being to arise
from all those who are ordinarily taught thereby (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6.) hence
it is the dutie of the Civill Magistrate to contend with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

good education of youth; and it lying chiefly in the hand of the

Schooles, take care for fit Governours and Tutours, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to all the Churches, if they see it meet, that in all the
Churches within the Jurisdiction once in a yeare, and if it may
be, the Sabbath before the Generall Court of Election, there be
a Free-will offering of all people for the maintenance of such
Schooles: And the monies of every Towne so given, to be

                  <p>In the choice of officers, it is very obscure what they
mean by this supreme power of Christ Jesus sending to preach.</p>
                  <p>We know the Commission of the Lord Jesus to his first Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to goe into all Nations to preach and gather Churches, and
they were immediately sent forth by him: but Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> elswhere

<hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>mediate,</hi> that is, from the <hi>Church.</hi>

whence according to the <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the nature of the

is a <hi>Ministery</hi> before the <hi>Church,</hi> gathering and espousing the

                  <p>I answer, first we find not in the first <hi>institution</hi> and
<hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne,</hi>
that ever any such two, or three, or more, did gather and
constitute themselves a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> without a <hi>Ministrie</hi> sent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50277:98"/>
from <hi>God</hi> to invite and call them by the <hi>Word,</hi> and to receive them
unto <hi>fellowship</hi> with <hi>God</hi> upon the receiving of that <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No president of any people in the Gospell converting &amp; gathering themselves, without some Messenger sent from the Lord to effect those ends.</note> And therefore it may very well be quaeried how without
such a Ministry two or three become a Church? and how the power
of Christ is conveyed unto them; Who espoused this people unto
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> was espoused by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor.
11.? If it be said themselves, or if it be said the Scriptures, let
one instance be produced in the first <hi>patternes</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of such
a Practice.</p>
                  <p>It hath been generally confest, that there is no comming to the
<hi>Mariage feast</hi> without a <hi>Messenger</hi> inviting, sent from <hi>God</hi> to the
<hi>Soules</hi> of men, <hi>Matth. 22. Luc. 14. Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>We finde when the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> turned to <hi>God</hi> from their <hi>Idolls</hi>
to serve the living and true <hi>God, 1 Thessal.</hi> 1. 9. it pleased <hi>God</hi> to

                  <p>You know (deare <hi>Truth</hi>) it is a common plea, that Gods

                  <p>Two things must here be cleered:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Professed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not onely from sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table in personall Repentance, but from false worship also.</note> doth their <hi>conversion</hi> amount to externall turning from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls,</hi>
I Thess. 1. 9. beside their internall <hi>Repentance, Faith, Love, &amp;c.</hi>
Secondly, who wrought this <hi>conversion,</hi> who begot these Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
(for though the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might have ten thousand <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
yet <hi>Paul</hi> had begotten them by the <hi>Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> himselfe elsewhere acknowledgeth)
<hi>God</hi> sendeth many <hi>Preachers</hi> in the way of his <hi>providence</hi> (even in

                  <p>But as there seems yet to be desired such <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> as the first <hi>institution</hi> and <hi>patterne</hi> calls for: So also
such a <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>converting</hi> of <hi>Gods people</hi> from <hi>Antichristian Idols</hi>
to the <hi>Christian Worship:</hi> And therefore such a <hi>Ministry</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, if it should be granted that without a <hi>Ministry</hi> sent from
<hi>Christ</hi> to gather <hi>Churches,</hi> that <hi>Gods,</hi> people in this Country may be

                  <p>We are now come to the 11 Head<note place="margin">11 Head.</note> which concernes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
power in worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, they have power (say they) to reforme things in the
worship of God in a Church corrupted, and to establish the pure
worship of God, defending the same by the power of the sword
against all those who shall attempt to corrupt it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For first, the reigning of Idolatry and corruption in Religion
is imputed to the want of a King, <hi>Iudges</hi> 17. 5, 6.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, Remissenes in Reforming Religion, is a fault impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them who suffered the High Places in <hi>Israel</hi> and in <hi>Gallio,</hi>
who cared not for such things, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, Forwardnesse this way is a duty not only for Kings
in the Old Testament, but for Princes under the New, 1 <hi>Tim 2. 2.
Rom. 13. 4. Esay</hi> 49. 23. Neither did the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> reforme
things amisse as types of Christ, but as Civill Magistrates, and so
exemplary to all Christians. And here Reformation in Religion
is commendable in a Persian King, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 23. And it is well
knowne that remissenes in Princes of Christendome in matters of
Religion and Worship (divolving the care thereof only to the
Clergy, and so setting the Hornes thereof upon the Churches
head) hath been the cause of Antichristian inventions, usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and corruptions in the Worship and Temple of God.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, they have no power to presse upon the Churches, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Law (as hath been said before) nor by Proclamation and
command, any sacred significant ceremonies, whether more or
lesse, Popish or Jewish rite, or any other device of man, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

dayes: They having beene so accursed of God, so abused by
man, the imposing of some ever making way for the urging of
more, the receiving of some making the conscience bow to the
burthen of all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Fourthly, they have not power to governe and rule the acts of
worship in the Church of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is with a Magistrate in a State, in respect of the acts of those
who worship in a Church, as it is with a Prince in a Ship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though he be governour of their persons (else he should not
be their Prince) yet is not governour of the actions of the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(then he should be Pilot:) Indeed if the Pilot shall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
erre in his action, he may reprove him, and so any other
passenger may: Or if he offend against the life and goods of any,
he may in due time and place civilly punish him, which no other
passenger can doe: For, it is proper to Christ, the Head of the
Church, as to prescribe, so to rule the actions of his own worship
in the wayes of his servants, <hi>Esay</hi> 96, 7. The government of the
Church is upon his shoulder, which no Civill officer ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
And therefore Magistrates have no power to limit a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
either to what he shall preach or pray, or in what manner
they shall worship God, lest hereby they shall advance themselves
above Christ, and limit his Spirit.</q>

                  <p>In this generall Head are proposed two things.</p>
                  <p>First, what the Magistrate ought to doe positively concerning
the worship of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:50277:104"/>
Secondly, what he may doe in the worship of God.</p>
                  <p>What he ought to doe is comprised in these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, he ought to reforme the worship of God when it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ought to establish a pure worship of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ought to defend it by the sword: he ought to restrain
Idolatry by the sword, and to cut off <hi>offendours,</hi> as former passages
have opened.</p>
                  <p>For the proofe of this positive part of his duty are propounded
three sorts of Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>First, from the practice of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, some from the New <hi>Testament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from the practice of <hi>Kings</hi> of other <hi>Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto which I answer.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The argument from the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian and Persian kings re-minded.</note> concerning this latter, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Persian Kings,

way by his <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> after his owne holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for those of the New <hi>Testament</hi> I have (as I beleeve)
fully and sufficiently answered.</p>

                  <p>Are not all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> alike cleane unto <hi>God,</hi> or

                  <p>Hence <hi>Christians</hi> now are figuratively in this respect called

that whosoever would not seeke <hi>Iehovah the God of Israel,</hi> should

                  <p>But may whole <hi>Nations</hi> or <hi>Kingdomes</hi> now (according to any

                  <p>Lastly, what slaughters both of men and women must this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily

                  <p>I have yet to adde a third <hi>consideration</hi> concerning the
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of that Land and people.</p>
                  <p>They were to be (unlesse in their <hi>captivities</hi>) of their <hi>Brethren,</hi>

                  <p>But first, who can deny but that there may be now many law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Governours, Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> in the <hi>Nations</hi> of the World,

                        </gap> Reasons proving that the Kings of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and Judah cannot have any other but a Spirituall Antitype.</note> whether the Kings of Israel and
Judah were not types of Civill Magistrates? now I suppose by
what hath been already spoken, these things will be evident.</p>
                  <p>First, that those former <hi>types</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> of their
<hi>Worships,</hi> were <hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> of a <hi>spirituall Land, spirituall People,</hi>

                     </gap>e.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, although the Magistrate by a Civill sword might well
compell that Nationall Church to the externall exercise of their
Naturall Worship:<note place="margin">Civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion was proper in the Nationall Church of the Jewes, but most impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Christian, which is not Nationall.</note> yet it is not possible (according to the rule of
the New Testament) to compell whole Nations to true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Regeneration, without which (so farre as may be
discerned true) the Worship and holy Name of God is prophaned
and blasphemed.</p>
                  <p>An Arme of Flesh, and Sword of Steele cannot reach to cut the
darknesse of the Mind, the hardnesse and unbeleefe of the Heart,
and kindely operate upon the Soules affections to forsake a long
continued Fathers worship, and to imbrace a new, though the best
and truest. This worke performes alone that sword out of the
mouth of Christ, with two edges, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. &amp; 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we have not one tittle in the New Testament of <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> concerning such a <hi>parallel,</hi> neither from <hi>Himselfe,</hi> nor from

                     <note place="margin">Neither Christ Jesus nor his Messengers have made the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate Israels Antitype, but the contrary.</note> with whom he conversed fourty dayes after his

of it, viz. the <hi>common-weale</hi> or <hi>safety</hi> of such a <hi>people</hi> in their <hi>bodies</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>civill</hi> Nature of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> we have proved to receive

and <hi>Christianitie</hi> taken away, and the <hi>candlestick</hi> removed, makes it
ne're the lesse a Commonweale.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> the Civill work and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magistrate</note> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> expresly relates the worke of the <hi>civill

to wit, (not the <hi>contribution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for any <hi>spirituall</hi> work,
but) <hi>tribute, toll, custome</hi> which are <hi>wages</hi> payable by all sorts of men,

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Since the <hi>civill Magistrate,</hi> whether <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
States,</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> can receive no more in <hi>justice</hi> then
what the People give, and are therefore but the <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> and
<hi>instruments</hi> of the people (simply considered,<note place="margin">Most strange, yet most true consequences from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magistrates now being the Antitype of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</note> without respect to this
or that <hi>Religion</hi>) it must inevitably follow (as formerly I have tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched)
that if <hi>Magistrates</hi> have received their power from the <hi>people,</hi>
then the greatest number of the people of every Land have received
from <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> a power to <hi>establish, correct, reforme</hi> his <hi>Saints</hi> and
<hi>servants,</hi> his <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>spowse,</hi> the <hi>Church:</hi> And she that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 149.) binds <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>chaines,</hi> and
<hi>Nobles</hi> in <hi>links</hi> of <hi>iron,</hi> must her selfe be subject to the changeable
pleasures of the people of the <hi>World</hi> (which lies in <hi>wickednesse,
1 Iohn</hi> 5.) even in matters of Heavenly and <hi>spirituall</hi> Nature.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore in all controversie concerning the Church,
Ministrie and worship, the last Appeale must come to the Bar of the
People or Commonweal, where all may personally meet, as in some

suffer as guilty of the Princes death, and those that perished with

the Prince ought not to governe and rule the actions of the ship,
but such whose office and charge and skill it is.</p>

                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:50277:124"/>
The result of all is this:<note place="margin">The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall of the ship to the Church, &amp;c.</note> The Church of Christ is the Ship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Prince (if a member, for otherwise the case is altred) is a

                  <p>In this respect every Christian in the Church,<note place="margin">The meanest Christian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his knowledg and grace, to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est who have received none or lesse grace of Christ.</note> man or woman (if

ought to be yeelded by all men.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if in matters of <hi>Religion</hi> the <hi>King</hi> command what is
contrary to <hi>Christs</hi> rule (though according to his <hi>perswasion</hi> and

                  <p>Concerning the Magistrates power in the Censures of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First (say they) he hath no power to execute or to substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
any Civill officer to execute any Church censure, under the
notion of Civill or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>cclesiasticall men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, Though a Magistrate may immediately Civilly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
such an offender, whose secret sinnes are made manifest by
their casting out, to be injurious to the good of the State; yet
such offences of excommunicate persons, which manifestly hurt
not the good of the State, he ought not to proceed against them,
sooner or later, untill the Church hath made her complaint to
him, and given in their just Reasons for helpe from them: For
to give libertie to Magistrates without exception to punish all
excommunicate persons within so many moneths, may prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the person who needs, to the Church who may desire,
&amp; to God who cals for longer indulgence from the hands of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, for persons not excommunicate, the Magistrate hath
no power in mediately to censure such offences of Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
by the power of the Sword, but onely for such as doe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50277:125"/>
hurt the peace of the State: Because the proper end of
Civill Government being the preservation of the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the State, they ought not to breake downe those bounds,
and so to censure immediately for such sins which hurt not their
peace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Hence, first, Magistrates have no power to censure for secret
sinnes, as deadnesse, unbeleefe, because they are secret, and not
yet come forth immediately to hurt the peace of the State; we say
immediately, for every sinne, even originall sinne, remotely hurts
the Civill State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, hence they have no power to censure for such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
sinnes in Church members, which being not hainous may
be best healed in a private way by the Churches themselves. For
that which may be best healed by the Church, and yet is prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the State, may make a deeper wound and greater rent in
the peace both of Church and State: the Magistrates also being
members of the Church, are bound to the rule of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> not
to produce any thing in publike against a brother, which may bee
best healed in a private way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now we call that private,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, which is only remaining in Families, not knowne of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others:
and therefore a Magistrate to heare and prosecute the
complaint of children against their parents, servants against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
wives against their husbands, without acquainting the
Church first, transgresseth the rule of Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly, that which is between members of the same Church
or of divers Churches: for, it was a double fault of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.) first to goe to Law, secondly to doe it before an
Infidell, seeing the Church was able to judge of such kinde of
differences by some Arbitratours among themselves: So that
the Magistrates should referre the differences of Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to private healing, and try that way first: By meanes
whereof the Churches should be free from much scandall, and the
State from much trouble, and the hearts of the godly from much
griefe in beholding such breaches.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, such offences which the Conscience of a Brother dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with another privately, dares not as yet publish openly,
comming to the notice of the Magistrate accidentally, he ought
not to make publique as yet, nor to require the Grand Jurie to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50277:125"/>
present the same, no more then the other private brother, who is
dealing with him, untill hee see some issue of the private way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, hence they have no power to put any to an oath <hi>ex
officio,</hi> to accuse themselves, or the brethren, in case either <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
suspecti,</hi> or <hi>praetensi,</hi> because this preserves not, but hurts many
wayes the peace of the State, and abuseth the ordinance of an
Oath, which is ordained to end controversies, not to begin them,
Heb. 6. 16.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Fourthly, hence they have no power to censure any for such
offences as breake either no Civill Law of God, or Law of the
State published according to it, for the peace of the State being

                  <p>In this passage (as I said before) I observe how weakly
and partially they deale with the soules of <hi>Magistrates</hi> in telling

doe her duty, punish, &amp;c. and yet in this passage the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
of the <hi>Churches</hi> not only sit <hi>Iudges</hi> over the <hi>Magistrates</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <p>I grant the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is the only <hi>rule, light</hi> and <hi>lanthorn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To give the government of the Church to the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and yet to abridge his conscience, what is it but to sport with holy things? &amp;c.</note> in
all cases concerning <hi>God</hi> or Man: and that the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell</hi>
are to teach this way, hold out this <hi>Lanthorne</hi> unto the feete of
all men: but to give such an absolute power in <hi>Spirituall</hi> things to
the <hi>Civill Magistrate,</hi> and yet after their owne ends or <hi>Consciences</hi> to
abridge it, is but the former sporting with holy things, and to walk
in <hi>Contradictions,</hi> as before I noted.</p>
                  <p>Many of the particulars, I acknowledge true, where the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
is a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> yet some passages call for <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
and some for <hi>Observation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, in that they say, the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against the offences of an <hi>Excommunicate</hi> person, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
hurt not the good of the <hi>state,</hi> untill the <hi>Church</hi> hath made
her complaint for helpe from them. I observe 2 things:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">An evident contradiction.</note> a cleare grant, that when the <hi>Church</hi> complayneth for
helpe, then the <hi>Magistrate</hi> may punish such <hi>offences</hi> as hurt not the
good of the <hi>state:</hi> and yet in a few lines after, they say, the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
have no power to censure such <hi>offences</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> members
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50277:126"/>
by the power of the <hi>civill sword,</hi> but only such, as doe immediately
hurt the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>civill state;</hi> and they adde the <hi>Reason,</hi> because
the proper end of the <hi>civill Government,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An excellent confession of the proper end of Civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. When Civill Lawes are not broken, it is confest that Civill Peace is not hurt.</note> being the preservation of
the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of the <hi>state,</hi> they ought not to breake downe
those <hi>bounds,</hi> and so to censure immediately for such <hi>sinnes</hi> which
hurt not their <hi>peace.</hi> And in the last place, they acknowledge the
<hi>Magistrate</hi> hath no power to punish any, for any such offences as
breake no <hi>civill Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>state,</hi> published accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it: For the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>state,</hi> (say they) being preserved by

                  <p>But what should be meant by this passage? <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That
they cannot give <hi>liberty</hi> to the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to punish without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

                  <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be this hath reference to a <hi>Law</hi> made formerly in
<hi>New England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A strange law in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land formerly against Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>communicate persons.</note> that if an excommunicate person repented not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(as I have heard) three <hi>months</hi> after sentence of <hi>excommunication,</hi>
then the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> might proceed with him.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>worthy men</hi> see cause to question this <hi>Law</hi> upon good <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
rendred, though it appears not by their words that they wholly
condemne it, only they desire a longer time, implying that after
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50277:126"/>
some longer time the Magistrate may proceed: and indeed I see
not, but according to such <hi>principles,</hi> if the <hi>Magistrate</hi> himselfe
should be cast out,<note place="margin">A dangerous doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all civill Magistrates.</note> he ought to be proceeded against by the <hi>Civill

yea though <hi>happily</hi> he had not offended against either <hi>bodies</hi> or <hi>goods</hi>
of any subject.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from this true <hi>confession</hi> that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> ought not to
punish for many sinnes above mentioned: I observe how they
crosse the <hi>plea</hi> which commonly they bring for the <hi>Magistrates</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of false <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Many sins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to be punished by the Magistrate and yet they also charge him to punish all sin, Rom. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Heretiques,</hi> &amp;c. [<hi>viz.</hi> Rom. 13. The
<hi>Magistrate</hi> is to punish them that doe evill:] and when it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
True, evill against the <hi>Second Table,</hi> which is there onely
spoken of, and against the <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Goods</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> which
are the proper <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>Civill Magistrate,</hi> (as they confesse:)
It is replied, why is not <hi>Idolatry</hi> sinne? <hi>Heresie</hi> sinne? <hi>Schisme</hi> and
false <hi>Worship</hi> sinne? Yet heere in this passage many <hi>evils,</hi> many <hi>sins,</hi>
even of <hi>Parents</hi> against their <hi>Children, Masters</hi> against their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Husbands</hi> against their <hi>Wives,</hi> the <hi>Magistrate</hi> ought not to
meddle with.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Originall sin charged to hurt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely (but falsely) the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill state.</note> I dare not assent to that assertion, <q>
                        <hi>That even origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sinne remotely hurts the civill State.</hi>
                     </q> Tis true, some doe, as <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to murther, theft, whoredome, slander, disobedience</hi> to <hi>Parents</hi>
and <hi>Magistrates:</hi> but <hi>blindnes</hi> of <hi>minds, hardnes</hi> of <hi>heart, inclination</hi>
to choose or worship this or that <hi>God,</hi> this or that <hi>Christ,</hi> beside the
true, these hurt not remotely the <hi>civill state,</hi> as not concerning it,

against their <hi>masters,</hi> of <hi>wives</hi> against their <hi>husbands,</hi> without

                  <p>First, I ask for one <hi>rule</hi> out of the <hi>Testament</hi> of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is built upon a supposition of what rarely falls

                  <p>Thirdly, it may here be questioned what power is now given
to the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> in <hi>Church matters</hi> and Spirituall affairs?</p>
                  <p>If it be answered that although <hi>Gods people</hi> may doe thus against
the <hi>Magistrates</hi> consent, yet others may not.</p>
                  <p>I answer (as before) who sees not herein partiality to themselves:<note place="margin">Grosse partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note>
                     <hi>Gods</hi> people must enjoy their <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
but all the Subjects in a <hi>Kingdome</hi> or <hi>Monarchie,</hi> or the whole
world beside, must be compelled by the power of the <hi>Civill Sword</hi>
to assemble thus and thus.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I demand who shall judge whether they are <hi>Gods
people</hi> or no,<note place="margin">If the Civill Magistrate be to build the Spirituall or Christian house, he must judge of the matter.</note> for they say whether the <hi>Magistrate consent</hi> or <hi>consent</hi>
not, that is <hi>judge</hi> so or not, they ought to goe on in the Ordinances
<hi>renuente Magistratu?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How agrees this with their former and generall <hi>assertion,</hi> that
the <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi> must set up the <hi>Christian Church</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi>
therefore by their owne grant he must judge the godly themselves,
he must discerne who are fit matter for the House of <hi>God, living

                  </p>
                  <p>Those <hi>worthy men,</hi> the <hi>Authours</hi> of these <hi>positions,</hi> and others of
their <hi>judgement</hi> have cause to examine their soules with feare and
trembling in the presence of <hi>God</hi> upon this <hi>intergatory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A close and faithfull inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the consciences of the authors of these positions</note> viz. whether

no they could not be willingly shut of the <hi>Civill power,</hi> and left on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their <hi>inoffensive liberties?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could also put a sad <hi>Quaerie</hi> to the <hi>consciences</hi> of some,<note place="margin">A sad quaerie to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their practice.</note> viz. what

place where they might set up <hi>Magistrates</hi> of their owne, and
a <hi>Civill Sword,</hi> &amp;c. How much is it to be feared that in case their

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, it may be questioned how it comes to passe that in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the <hi>Churches liberty</hi> more now under the <hi>Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>

                  <p>Are not all their hopes and arguments built upon the <hi>Christian

they scare the <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> (whom they account the <hi>gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>

no more in Gods worship then they?</p>
                  <p>But what can those instances of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> evill in hindring the

the practice of <hi>Iosiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An. <hi>Iosiah</hi> was in the type,<note place="margin">Josiah a type of Christ Jesus the King of the Church.</note> so are not now the severall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Commonweales, <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>Israel,</hi> whose state I have proved to be a <hi>None-such,</hi> and not to bee
parallel'd but in the <hi>Antitype</hi> the particular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
where <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> alone sits <hi>King</hi> in his owne most holy <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they propound meetings or <hi>assemblings ordinary stated</hi>
and <hi>constant, yearly</hi> and <hi>monthly</hi> unto which the <hi>civill Magistrate</hi>
should give <hi>liberty.</hi> For these meetings they propound plausible
arguments from the <hi>necessity</hi> of them from <hi>Christian fellowship</hi> from
<hi>Gods glory,</hi> from the experience of the benefit of them, and from
the good report of them, as also those two Scriptures, 1 Cor. 10.
32. 2 Cor. 11. 38.</p>
                  <p>To these I answer,<note place="margin">An unjust and partiall desire of liberty to some co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

permit <hi>liberty</hi> to the free and voluntary Spirituall meetings of
their Subjects, I shall subscribe unto them; but if they intend that
the <hi>Magistrate</hi> should give <hi>liberty</hi> only unto themselves, and not
to the rest of their <hi>subjects,</hi> that is to desire their owne <hi>soules</hi> only
to be free, and all other <hi>soules</hi> of their <hi>subjects</hi> to be kept in <hi>bondage.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:50277:131"/>
Secondly, if they intend that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> should inforce all
the <hi>Elders</hi> of such <hi>Churches</hi> under their <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> to keepe
<hi>correspondencie</hi> with them in such meetings, then I say (as before)
it is to cause him to give <hi>Libertie</hi> with a <hi>partiall</hi> hand, and <hi>unequall
Ballance:</hi> for thus I argue. If the <hi>Civill State</hi> and <hi>Civill officers</hi> be
of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> it is not proper for them to give <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie</hi>
or <hi>freedome,</hi> but to give honourable <hi>testimonie</hi> and <hi>approbation,</hi>
and their own personall <hi>submission</hi> to the <hi>Churches.</hi> But if the <hi>civill
State</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> be of another <hi>conscience</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> and shall be
bound to grant permission and libertie to them, their <hi>consciences</hi> and
<hi>meetings,</hi> and not to those of his own <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> also,
how will this appeare to be equall in the very eye of Common <hi>peace</hi>
and <hi>righteousnesse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For those <hi>yearely</hi> and <hi>monthly</hi> meetings, as we find not any such
in the first <hi>Churches,</hi> So neither will those generall <hi>arguments</hi> from
the plausible pretence of <hi>Christian</hi> fellowship, <hi>Gods</hi> glory, &amp;c.
prove such particular wayes of <hi>glorifying God,</hi> without some <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
or <hi>president</hi> of such a kind.</p>
                  <p>For those <hi>Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 33. &amp; 2 Cor. 11. 38. expressing the

                  </p>
                  <p>For as for the first, the <hi>Churches</hi> are not <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel:</hi>

                  <p>The 14. generall head is this,<note place="margin">14. Position examined.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> What power parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Churches</hi> have particularly over <hi>Magistrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First (say they) they may censure any Member (though a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate)
if by sinne he deserve it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, because Magistrates must be subject to Christ, but Christ
censures all offenders, 1 Cor. 5. 45.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Every Brother must be subject to Christs censure,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. But Magistrates are brethren, <hi>Deut,</hi> 17. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They may censure all within the Church, I Cor. 5. 12.
<q>But the Magistrates are within the Church, for they are either
without, or within, or above the Church: not the first, nor the
last, for so Christ is only above it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Fourthly, The Church hath a charge of all the Soules of the
members, and must give account thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Fifthly, Christs censures are for the good of Soules, I Cor. 5.
6. but Magistrates must not be denied any priviledge for their
Soules, for then they must lose a priviledge of Christ by being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Sixthly, In Church priviledges Christians are all one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 28. Col. 3. 11.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Magistrates may be censured for apparent and manifest sinne
against any Morall Law of God, in their judiciall proceedings,
or in the execution of their office. Courts are not Sanctuaries for
sin; and if for no sin, then not for such especially.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>First, because sinnes of Magistrates in Court are as hatefull to
God. 2. And as much spoken against, <hi>Isa. 10. 1. Mic.</hi> 3. 1.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50277:133"/>
Thirdly, God hath no where granted such immunity to them.
Fourthly, what a brother may doe privately in case of private of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that the Church may doe publikely in case of publike scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall.
But a private brother may admonish and reprove privately
in case of any private offence, <hi>Mat. 18. 15. Luc. 19. 17. Psal.</hi> 141. 5.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Lastly, Civill Magistracy doth not exempt any Church from
faithfull watchfulnesse over any member, nor deprive a Church of
her due power, not a Church member of his due priviledge, which
is to partake of every Ordinance of God, needfull and requisite to
their winning and salvation. <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THese Arguments to prove the <hi>Magistrate</hi> subject (even

                  </p>
                  <p>It is true in case of the <hi>Elders</hi> obstinacy in apparent sinne, the

was not a <hi>power</hi> over the <hi>Churches,</hi> as many <hi>Scriptures</hi> seem to imply.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the ordinary <hi>Officers</hi> ordained for the ordinary and constant guiding, feeding, and governing the <hi>Church,</hi> they were

<q>We like it well, that Churches be flower in proceeding to

in point of their Judiciall proceedings, unlesse it be in scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

satisfaction in a previous Advertisement. And though each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

and absolute within it selfe, yet where the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale
consists of Church members, it may be a point of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

as any thing may seeme doubtfull to them in the Magistrates case,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> may be further cleered by intelligence given from them; but

                  <p>
                     <q>First, all Magistrates ought to be chosen out of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,
<hi>Ezod. 18. 21. Deut. 17. 15. Prov.</hi> 29. 2. When the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

                  <p>
                     <q>1. Because if none but Church members should rule, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                     <p>In this <hi>Head</hi> are 2 branches:<note place="margin">A great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, viz. Whether only Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (that is as is intended) Godly persons in a particular Church estate, be only eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or to be chosen for Magistrates.</note> First concerning the
choice of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> that such ought to be chosen as are <hi>Church
members:</hi> for which is quoted, <hi>Exod. 18. 21. Dut. 17. 15. Proverbs</hi>
19. 29.</p>
                     <p>Unto which I answer: It were to be wished, that since the point
is so weighty, as concerning the <hi>Pilots</hi> and <hi>Steeresmen</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi>
and <hi>Nations,</hi> &amp;c. on whose <hi>abilitie, care</hi> and <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> depends
most commonly the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>safety</hi> of the <hi>commonweales</hi> they fall in:
I say it were to be wished that they had more fully explained what
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50277:135"/>
they intend by this <hi>Affirmative,</hi> viz. <hi>Magistrates</hi> ought to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of <hi>Church members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if they intend by this <hi>[Ought to be chosen]</hi> a <hi>necessitie</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenience,</hi>
viz. that for the greater advancement of <hi>common utilitie</hi>
and <hi>rejoycing</hi> of the people, according to the place quoted (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 2.)
it were to be desired, prayed for, and peaceably endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then I readily assent unto them.</p>
                     <p>But if by this <hi>[Ought]</hi> they intend such a <hi>necessitie</hi> as those
Scriptures quoted imply, viz. that people shall sin by choosing such
for <hi>Magistrates</hi> as are not members of <hi>Churches;</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi>
should have sinned, if they had not (according to <hi>Iethro's</hi> counsell,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 18. and according to the <hi>command</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Deut. 18.) chosen
their <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> within themselves in <hi>Israel:</hi> then I propose
these necessary <hi>Quaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First whether those are not lawfull <hi>Civill combinations, societies,</hi>

no <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is resident,<note place="margin">Lawfull Civil States, where Churches of Christ are not.</note> yea where his name was never yet

                     <p>4. If <hi>Magistrates</hi> ought (that is, ought only) to be chosen out
