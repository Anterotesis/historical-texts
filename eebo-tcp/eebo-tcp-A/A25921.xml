            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Seducing of <hi>Ann,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Edward Ketelbey,</hi> of <hi>Ludlow,</hi> Gent. TO THE Popiſh Religion, With ſome very Extraordinary Paſſages relating thereto, PARTICULARLY, Of the groſs Prevarications, and inſolent Boldneſs of the two Popiſh Biſhops <hi>Leyborn</hi> and <hi>Gifford</hi> in the Management of it.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly Preſented to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, now Aſſembled in Parliament.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>KETELBEY</hi> being often from home, particularly in the years 1696. and 1697. with his Wife and part of his Family, leaving only his Daughter, of the Age of Nineteen, and Servants at home, a Popiſh Family coming Strangers into the Town, and Living near him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Leave of the Daughter to walk in the Garden being pleaſant for Air, and by this means two young Ladies of that Family inſinuating themſelves into the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Acquaintance, with the aſſiſtance of one <hi>Windſor,</hi> a reputed Popiſh Prieſt, living with them, (who pretends to Practice Phyſick now, but in King <hi>James</hi> his Reign ſhewed himſelf more open) Seduced her to the Popiſh Religion; but Inſtructed her of what dangerous Conſequence it might be if diſcovered, both the Seducer and Seduced being puniſhable with Death; which made her for a long time diſown and forſwear her Converſion to Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47925:2"/>
The Mother coming firſt into the Country, found her Daughter's Temper and Humour Changed, diſowning her Mother's Power and Authority over her, and denying to do ſeveral Things ſhe Commanded without the Advice of her Friends, meaning the Papiſts that had Seduced her; And they having alſo Corrupted ſome of the Servants, after the Mother came home they gave Intelligence, whereby thoſe Papiſts often Converſed with the Daughter in private, as 'tis believed, and Conveying Books into her Hands, ſettled her in that Religion. But the Mother, for ſome time after ſhe came down, knew nothing of her Daughters new Friends, till coming one Morning early into her Chamber, the found her Reading in a Book in Bed; at which the Daughter being ſurprized, let it fall into the Bed, and denied that ſhe was Reading, or had any Book; but upon ſearch, it was found to be a Book wrote by <hi>Parſons</hi> the Jeſuit; which ſo ſtartled the Mother, that upon Searching the Daughter's Cloſet afterwards, ſhe found other Popiſh Books, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Papers, and other Things relating to Popery; with very Familiar, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Letters from one Mrs. <hi>Berrington,</hi> and a Daughter of the Lord <hi>Gerrard's</hi> of <hi>Bromley,</hi> who had been at <hi>Ludlow</hi> for ſome time before, but altogether Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Mr. <hi>Ketelbey</hi> and his Family.</p>
            <p>By theſe Letters, and other Things, the Mother found the Daughter had Changed her Religion as well as Manners; Yet did not think fit to publiſh the Matter, but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it to ſome particular Friends, and ſent her out of Town; Nor did ſhe at firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her Husband with it, who was then in <hi>London;</hi> only ſent him General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his long Abſence, whereby his Family ſuffered, and deſired his ſpeedy coming down. Whereupon he ſent down his Son, who ſoon diſcovered his Siſter's Change, and Imparted it to the Father: He ſoon after coming down himſelf, found it too true, and his Daughter full of Equivocations, and Lying Stories, and even denying that which ſeemed to be the moſt apparent Truth, as to the Circumſtances of her Change, the Method of her Seduction, and the Perſons who Seduced her, affirming, that ſhe was a very good Proteſtant, and gave out that there was nothing in it, but her Mothers Unkindneſs, who never Loved her from a Child, and Fondneſs to her Brother, which brought that Scandal and Reproach upon her of her being a Papiſt, on purpoſe to deprive her of her Father's Favour; and ſhe was ready to give him all the Satisfaction he ſhould deſire of her Sincerity in the Proteſtant Religion. To make this better believed, ſhe came conſtantly to Church, to Prayers, and the Sacrament; and upon her Examination by the Doctor of the Pariſh, and other Proteſtant Divines, they thought her Stedfaſt therein. She framed her Story ſo well, being Seconded by the Popiſh Gang, who ſeemed to diſown her, that it became a Reflection upon her Parents for their Jealouſie, and ſuppoſed Severity towards their Daughter, in charging her deſignedly with what they knew to be falſe: The Doctor himſelf often ſaying to the Papiſts, and others, that he believed her as good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant as himſelf: So ſoon had ſhe learnt the Art of Popiſh Diſſimulation. But ſhe would never confeſs how ſhe came by the Popiſh Books, only ſaying, that ſome of them ſhe found in <hi>Ludlow</hi> Caſtle; and the Servants being of her Party, owned ſome of the Books to be theirs, which the Daughter pretended ſhe had only a Curioſity to Read, that ſhe might be able to maintain an Argument, and to Ridicule the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>The Father being afflicted at this great Misfortune in his Family, and full of Fears and Jealouſies, in <hi>November</hi> 1698. brought his Family to <hi>London,</hi> to get the Aſſiſtance of able Divines; and particularly had her under the Care of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dean of <hi>Windſor,</hi> who Examined her ſeveral times, and believed her to be a good Proteſtant; Yet her Father would not be ſatisfied unleſs ſhe would Conſent to Abjure the Popiſh Religion before a Judge, or ſome Magiſtrate, according to a Form which was drawn up in theſe Words.</p>

And as a colour for her pretences to the Proteſtant Religion, ſhe took with her a Common-Prayer Book, and a Book upon the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Her Parents, immediately after her Deſerting them, put it in Print, with offers of a Reward to thoſe who would diſcover her, and bring her back to them; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring alſo they would receive her kindly. After this they were in ſearch and purſuit of her all manner of ways, both in <hi>London</hi> and the Country, and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the Stage-Coaches, and watching the Roads and Sea-Ports all this while, not in the leaſt miſtruſting Mrs. <hi>Relfe,</hi> who had left the Lodging ſome days before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of going into the Country, but had only removed her Lodging for that time, as appeared afterwards to avoid Suſpicion. And the Parents afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received an Information that <hi>Relfe</hi> and his Wife were met not far from their own Houſe on foot, with the Gentlewoman deſcribed in Print, the ſame day ſhe went away; they immediately ſent down thither, and by the Aſſiſtance of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Juſtice of the Peace of that County, who granted a Warrant, <hi>Relfe</hi>'s Houſe was ſearched; but the Daughter could not be diſcovered, being hid in a ſecret Cloſer, as hath been ſince Confeſſed.</p>
            <p>All means hitherto proving ineffectual for diſcovery of their Daughter, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Inquiring out Mrs. <hi>Relfe</hi>'s new Lodgings in <hi>London,</hi> (ſhe coming often to Town) at the firſt opportunity they could get, took up Mrs. <hi>Relfe</hi> by a Warrant from Juſtice <hi>Marſhal;</hi> who upon her Examination Swore that ſhe knew nothing of their Daughter, nor had ſeen her in ſeveral days before ſhe went away. But ſhe owned that ſhe believed her to be a Papiſt, and that ſhe had deſired her aſſiſtance to Convey her away from her Parents, that ſhe might have the free Exerciſe of her Religion, which ſhe the ſaid <hi>Relfe</hi> had refuſed to do, and knew not where their Daughter was, though at the ſame time ſhe had the poor deluded Creature in her own Houſe. But nothing being made out againſt her, ſhe was diſcharged for that time.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Relfe</hi> and the Daughter, ſome time after, thinking the Storm was over, and all things quiet, came to <hi>London,</hi> where ſhe was placed in a private Lodging: But her Parents never reſting, upon the loſs of their Child, tried all manner of ways to recover her; and at length by the Aſſiſtance of ſome of the Popiſh Party, had again an Information of her, and underſtood that ſhe had frequent Recourſe to the Lord of <hi>Montgomery</hi>'s, the Lord <hi>Stafford's,</hi> and other Popiſh Families, and never ſtaid long in a place, but had changed her Habit to prevent a Diſcovery: And that a Collection was made for Cloaths, and other Neceſſaries, to carry her away beyond Sea to a Nunnery. Whereupon her Parents applied themſelves to ſeveral Popiſh Prieſts, and ſome of the moſt noted Papiſts about Town, giving Gratuities: and promiſing greater Rewards, and ſometimes threatening them what ſhould be done if their Daughter were not returned back. By this means the Parents came to be informed, that ſhe was well, and in good and ſafe hands in a Proteſtant Family, as they pretended; but no further Inquiry was to be made, nor Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions asked then what they were willing to diſcover, nor the Name of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who made this Diſcovery; who often came to the Parents Lodgings about Eleven of the Clock at Night, and ſtayed about half an hour, where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived kindly, and with promiſe not to Trapan him, being as he confeſſed, under ſome dangerous Circumſtance himſelf; for he ſaid he was a Jacobite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, and Converſing often with Prieſts, and the Popiſh Party, had heard them Diſcourſe of ſuch a Convert, and ſaid he would do all the Service poſſibly he could by Conveying of Letters to her, though he had never ſeen her nor knew where ſhe was.</p>
            <p>Frequent Letters were by this way Conveyed from the Parents to the Daughter, and Anſwers returned, for a Month together, and Terms propoſed for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her Parents, on Condition they were Signed and Agreed to by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother and Brother, which Terms being not Conſented to by the Father, he made his Propoſal in the words following: That if his Daughter would come home, ſhe ſhould be Received and Treated by her Parents with as much Kindneſs as if ſhe had all along continued a Proteſtant; That ſhe ſhould have no Reſtraint, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or Paſſion uſed toward her upon the account of her Religion, but have the free Exerciſe of it; only with this Limitation, that ſhe ſhould admit at any time
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47925:4"/>
any of our Proteſtant Divines to Diſcourſe with her of Matters of Religion; and ſhe ſhould hearken to the Admonitions and Inſtructions of thoſe who ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour calmly and mildly to perſwade her to return to the Proteſtant Church; That ſhe ſhould not Tamper with, nor Endeavour to Seduce any Servant of theirs to the Popiſh Religion; That ſhe ſhould not have any Popiſh Prieſt come to her in her Father's Houſe, nor into any place thereunto belonging, but in caſe of Sickneſs, and that with her Parents Leave; That her Father would not be obliged with Men and Horſes to carry her to Maſs; but that ſhe ſhould give an account to her Parents when and where ſhe went, and continue in the Dutiful Subjection and Obedience of a Child, and that her Parents would not proſecute any Roman Catholick for what had already paſſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Terms being rejected by the Prieſts, the Treaty dropt, or at leaſt was at a ſtand, and the private Meſſenger no more appearing, the Parents fearing their Child would be ſent beyond Sea, if not ſpeedily prevented, made their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Popiſh Biſhops, and attended Biſhop <hi>Leyborn</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Gifford</hi> at their Lodgings in <hi>Queenſtreet,</hi> in the month of <hi>June,</hi> and produced the Abjuration, and acquainted them with the whole matter. They denied that they knew any thing of her, farther then that they had heard of ſuch a Convert. They ſaid that ſhe could not go to a Nunnery before they had Confirmed her, which was not then done, neither would they do it without her Parents Conſent; and promiſed to Summon their Clergy together, and when they knew in whoſe Hands ſhe was, her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <note place="margin">☞</note> ſhould have Notice: But afterwards they returned an Anſwer, That no ſuch Perſon was amongſt any of them: But they ſaid they had nothing to do with the Regulars, who were Governed by their own Provincials. And they added, That if ſhe was Reconciled to their Church, they believed it was done by ſome Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prieſt, for that no Engliſh Prieſt durſt do ſuch a thing: Yet notwithſtanding <note place="margin">☞</note> all theſe Profeſſions, they Lyed unto them; for the Daughter was Confirmed by them, both the Biſhops being preſent, as ſhe hath ſince Confeſſed.</p>
            <p>The Parents willing to leave no Stone unturned for the Recovery of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made an Intereſt to the <hi>Portugal Envoy,</hi> who not only Examined his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Domeſticks, Whether any ſuch Perſon had fallen into their Hands, but prevailed for the ſame favour from the other Foreign Miniſters; and ſent for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provincials before him, who ſent to the Prieſts of their ſeveral Orders, but could get no Intelligence of her; ſo that the laſt and only proper means, and moſt effectual as it proved in this Caſe, was to apply themſelves to the Government. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">☞</note> was ſitting all this time, which made the Action appear the more Bold and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and the Father drawing up a State of his Caſe in Writing, communicated the ſame to His Grace the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, the Secretaries of State, to ſome of the Judges, and to ſeveral of the Members of the Houſe of Commons; whereupon a Warrant was Granted by Mr. Secretary <hi>Vernon,</hi> to take up ſeveral Perſons, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Relfe;</hi> and by threatning to proſecute her for High-Treaſon, for carrying away and Seducing their Daughter to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, and Charging it home upon her, ſhe after many Doubles and Shifts, not knowing but the Daughter was come in, and had charged her with this, at length confeſſed the Matters of Fact, which before ſhe had denied upon Oath; namely, How ſhe her ſelf, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had carried the Daughter down to their Houſe in <hi>Surry,</hi> and had Concealed her upon the Search: Nay, ſhe conſeſſed, That the Daughter was in her Houſe at the ſame time when ſhe Swore before Juſtice <hi>Marſhall,</hi> That ſhe knew nothing of her. After this Confeſſion, ſhe fell upon her Knees to ask Pardon, and to beg the Injured Parents to Intercede for her, promiſing their Daughter ſhould be returned to them, if poſſibly ſhe could procure her, being then out of her Power; and, as ſhe feared, gone beyond Sea. But ſhe deſired leave with the Meſſenger to go to the Lord <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi>'s, the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s, and ſome other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Houſes, where ſhe knew the Daughter uſed, which were ſearched accordingly, and ſome Perſons taken up, who were Examined in the Secretary's Office; but the Daughter was not found all this time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47925:4"/>
Some of the Politick <hi>Papiſts</hi> finding the Government engaged in the Buſineſs, and Incenſed againſt their Proceedings, did think it now the beſt way for themſelves, and the ſafeſt way to get their Friends diſcharged out of Cuſtody, and to allay the Storm which they ſaw coming upon them, to deliver up the Child to her Parents, who had made a conſiderable Intereſt, and a fair progreſs in order to a ſevere Proſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Party. Therefore the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhops and Prieſts, not daring to appear themſelves in the matter, gave Notice to the <hi>Portugal Envoy</hi> of the Perſons Name, at whoſe Houſe ſhe was, and that ſhe ſhould be delivered up to her Parents ſuch a Day, if he would Interpoſe, and make Terms for her and them: And they inſiſted upon the Terms following, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That ſhe ſhould have the free Exerciſe of her Religion, and <hi>Papiſts</hi> to come to her; and that ſhe ſhould not be perplext with <hi>Proteſtant Divines</hi> further than ſhe deſired: That ſhe ſhould be received as a Child, and be allowed <note place="margin">☜</note> 40 <hi>s.</hi> a Year to buy <hi>Popiſh</hi> Books; and that if ſhe did not like to ſtay at Home, her Father ſhould allow her 40 <hi>l.</hi> a Year to maintain her in ſome <hi>Popiſh</hi> Family: Which Terms her Father utterly rejected.</p>
            <p>However ſome time after the <hi>Portugal</hi> Envoy giving Notice to the Parents, That he had Intelligence of their Daughter, they waited upon him at a <hi>Portugal</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Houſe by Appointment; where after ſome time the Daughter was brought to her Parents, and received by them with Joy from the Hands of ſome Prieſts who brought her thither, and with Thanks to the <hi>Envoy</hi> for his Aſſiſtance therein; who at the ſame time waved the Propoſals formerly made, and only inſiſted, That ſhe <note place="margin">☜</note> ſhould have the free Exerciſe of her Religion, and that all Perſons then in Cuſtody upon the Daughters Account, ſhould be Diſcharged, and no further Proſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at <hi>Ludlow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since her coming Home, ſhe hath confeſſed, That the Cloaths were made for her and another Young Woman, to be ſent beyond Sea to a Nunnery; and that after they had tried the Cloaths her Companion was ſent away, but ſhe was ſtayed, to be delivered up as a Peace-Offering againſt her will, for fear of a Proſecution. She owned that ſhe was put for ſome time into the Nunnery at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> to try how ſhe liked ſuch a Life; and that they had ſhewed her all the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Places about the Town. When ſhe came Home, ſhe was well furniſhed with <hi>Popiſh</hi> Books, but theſe her Parents took from her when ſhe came to <hi>Ludlow;</hi> and have ſince permitted no one to come near her but <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> But ſhe continues Obſtinate, refuſing to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to a <hi>Proteſtant Divine,</hi> tho' many Ingenious Men have been often with her, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon the Infallibility of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, and that there is no Salvation in any other: She refuſeth alſo to read any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Book but the Bible; and is ſo little fond of that, that ſhe ſays, if the Prieſts had enjoyned her the contrary; ſhe would never have looked into the Bible, but that they have not yet forbidden her that.</p>
            <p>Since the Daughters coming Home, ſhe hath made ſeveral Attempts to get away again; and by opening a Lock with another Key, did once get away in a Servant's Habit of the Family, but could not get off; and now ſhe is ſuffered to go no further than her Mother goes with her. But ſhe continues very Stubborn and Undutiful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, That ſhe had rather ſweep Kennels for her Livelihood, than Live as ſhe doth amongſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and hath wrote ſeveral Complaining Letters to her Friends in <hi>London,</hi> as ſhe calls the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> of her Father's Correction, burning her Books, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruel and ſevere uſage; and ſeveral Meſſages and Threats have been ſent to her Father upon that Occaſion, which Complaints are all falſe, ſhe being under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint at all from her Father further then what is herein before mentioned; and that is <note place="margin">☜</note> only in order to the Confinement from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which he reſolves to continue till he hath tried the utmoſt with her; deſiring the Prayers of all good <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> That God will be pleaſed to touch her Heart, and to Enlighten her Underſtanding, that ſhe may ſee the Snare wherein ſhe is taken, and the Miſchiefs both of Body and Soul, which muſt Inevitably fall upon her, if ſhe continues in this deluded Condition.</p>
