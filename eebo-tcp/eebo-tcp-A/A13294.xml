            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The poore innocent lambs of the sheepfold of Christ appointed for the shambles, strengthened their hearts in God, and in the power of his might, &amp; chose rather to suffer adversity with their brethren, then to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sin for a season, they were content to be racked,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.25</note> and would not be delivered, that they might bee partakers of a better resurrection,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.35</note> whose bodies torne with stripes vntill their very inward bowels were patent to the outward sight, witnessed the vnrent firmenesse and stability of their faith.

They were so supported with the power of that grace that commeth from aboue, that they were not terrified with the multiplied numbers of cruell torments, newly devised for dashing that invincible courage of faith which was seene in Christians.

Now therefore, let vs entreate of the <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Eutychian</hi> Persecutors, in the three subsequent Centuries. Other Heretiques, albeit they were fierce and cruell, such as the Donatists, yet their crueltie was like vnto the stighling of a fish,<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> when the water is ebbed, and shee is not covered with the deepenesse of over-flowing water: the more stirre she maketh, the nearer shee is vnto her death. But the Arrian and Eutychian Heretiques found Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours favourably inclined to the maintenance of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, such as <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> protectors of the Arrian heresie, <hi>Anastatius</hi> and <hi>Heraclius,</hi> favourers of the heresie of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> This support they had of supreame powers, strengthened the arme of Heretiques, and made them able to persecute the true Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, betwixt the ten great Persecutions, and the Arrian persecution, a short breathing time was granted by God vnto his Church, who will not suffer the rodde of the wicked perpetually to lie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the righteous, lest they put out their hand vnto inquity.

Men banished for the cause of Christ, by the Emperours edicts were returned from their banishment, restored to their offices, dignities, and possessions, which duely belonged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

At this time the Empire of the East was in the hands of the Empresse <hi>Irene,</hi> and in the hands of the Emperour <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> who had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Irene,</hi> and raigned in her stead. The Empire of the East was also weake at this time, as appeareth by a covenant of peace which they concluded with <hi>Charles,</hi> Emperour of the West: in the which no mention is made of <hi>Exarchatus Ravennae,</hi> to be rendred againe vnto them: onely that the Isle of Sicile, and the townes and lands which lie from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Eastward on the right hand, and from Manfredonia (sometimes called <hi>Syponto</hi>) on the left hand, compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

with the Seas, called <hi>Superum &amp; Inferum</hi>: these should remaine in the possession of the Emperours of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople. '<hi>Charles</hi> a prudent and godly Emperour, more sound and vpright in sundry heads of Christian doctrine, then many others: for hee detested the worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as vile Idolatry: as appeareth by his bookes wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tten against the second Councell of Nice. <hi>Charles</hi> was very friendly to Christians, and defended them against the violence and tyranny of their persecuting enemies: namely, against <hi>Godfridus,</hi> King of Denmarke, a fierce adversary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Christians, who dwelt in Saxony. Likewise hee subdued the Slavonians, and Bohemians, enemies to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion: and was iustly called <hi>Magnus,</hi> for his great exploits and valiant acts, which God prospered in his hand. <hi>Pipinus,</hi> the sonne of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> was declared King of Italy: who died before his father, and after his death hee appointed <hi>Bernard</hi> his nephew to raigne in Italy, with expresse commandement, That hee should bee obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his sonne <hi>Ludovicke,</hi> whome hee ordained to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour to himselfe in the Imperiall office. So the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> full of dayes, died in the 71. yeere of his age, and was buried in Aken.</p>

And when our holy father was dismounted from his horse, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did hold his left stirrop in steed of the right, and when the Pope was somewhat offended, thereat, the Emperour softly smiling craued pardon of his ouersight, because hee was not accustomed with such seruile offices.

                     </note> Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> required of him this condition that hee should fight against <hi>William</hi> Duke of Apulia for recouering of that Dukedome to the Chaire of Rome. Neuerthelesse the Pope not expecting the Emperours leasure, incited <hi>Emmanuell</hi> Emperour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople to driue <hi>William</hi> Duke of Apulia out of Italie, and addressed himselfe and his Cardinals to warrefare, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first excommunicated <hi>William</hi> Duke of Apulia. On the other part, <hi>William</hi> begged peace from the Pope, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to restore vnto him all that belonged to the chaire of Rome; and more also. But by the malignant Councel of his Cardinals, the Pope would not hearken to conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace, hoping to gaine more by warrefare. The Duke seeing no hope of peace brought his forces out of Sicile, ariued at Apulia, and did fight against <hi>Emmanuel</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:18150:74"/>
and did put him to flight. This done, hee marched fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward Benaventure, where the Pope and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls were expecting victorie. But the Duke so strictly pressed the cittie, that the Pope and his Cardinals were glad to sue for peace, which they refused before. The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace were these, that the Duke should invade no possession belonging to the Roman Church, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part the Pope should acknowledge <hi>William</hi> to be King of both Siciles.</p>
                  <p>The bad successe of the Popes enterprises was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the Emperour, who pondering in his own heart, the iniures which his predecessors had suffered by Popes, specially in bereauing them of the right of inuesting of Bishops, and in sending Ambassadors so frequently to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie to the great impouerishing of his dominions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Emperour conceiued such indignation, that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all Germanie,<note place="margin">

The Pope tooke all this matter grieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie, and perswaded the towns of Italie to make defection from the obedience of the Emperour, and specially the towne of Millan rebelled against him. But <hi>Fredericke</hi> brought them partly by force, and partly by feare vnder his subiection againe. In the end the Pope had recourse to the old weapons of his warfare, and he excommunicated the Emperour, but the Lord suffered not this proud Pope to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vnpunished, for as he was walking with his attendants, in a Towne called Anagnia, a flie entered into his throte, and choked his breath.</p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour was not free of trouble, in regard of the schisme that fell out in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, for two Bishops contended for the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to wit <hi>Alexander</hi> the third and <hi>Victor</hi> the fourth. The Emperour was required to pacifie this schisme, who gathered a councel at Papia, and desired both the Popes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18150:74"/>
to be present to heare their cause discussed in a lawfull as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie. But Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> disdained to be iudged of any man, and therefore he appeared not before the councell; For which cause the Emperour and the councell ratified the election of <hi>Victor</hi> the 4. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> fled to France and cursed both the Emperour, and his owne competitor <hi>Victor.</hi> Afterward by money and flatterie, (powerfull weapons in a declining age) he procured such fauour in the Citie of Rome that he was receiued gladly of the most part of the city. Pope <hi>Victor</hi> had ended his life before this time, to whom <hi>Guido</hi> Bishop of Cremona was appointed successour whom they called <hi>Paschalis tertius,</hi> and many followed him. When Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> came to Rome the Townes of Italie were in great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When the Emperour <hi>Frederike</hi> came to Italie, hee besieged this new builded towne called Alexandria, but was betraied by <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Bauaria, and Saxonia, so that he escaped hardlie in the habit of a seruant and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Germanie. The Emperour renewed his forces againe, and pierced into Italie with a great armie. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> fled to Venice. <hi>Otto</hi> the Emperours sonne on the other part with a well appointed nauie pursued after him, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a commandement from his father to attempt nothing against the Venetians vntil his owne comming. But the young man more hardie, then circumspect, encountred with the Venetians, and was ouercome, and taken prisoner.

                  <p>After this, some affirme, that he led an armie to Palestina, to fight against the Turks, and that hee prospered, vntill at length he was drowned in a certaine riuer. The Christians in Ierusalem had their last helpe and refreshment from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> king of France, and <hi>Richard</hi> king of England.

                  <p>After this fell out a ground of a new debate between the Emperour and the Pope.

But before the Emperour tooke his iourney to Asia, <hi>Honorius</hi> died, in whose roome succeeded <hi>Gregorius</hi> the ninth, who excommunicated the Emperour a new againe, because hee was compelled by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

to come backe from his iourney to Asia, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a space in Europe for the recouering of his health againe.</p>
                  <p>The next yeere after, to stop the mouth of the slanderous and cruell Pope, and to declare to the world, that the last yeere hee did not leave off his iourney by his owne volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary will, but by necessity: hee set forward with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and arrived at Ioppa.

                  <p>The Emperour being advertised of all these practices done against him in his absence, left in Asia <hi>Renaldus</hi> with his garisons, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding all the other bands to be vnder his appointment: And with all speed came with certaine gallies to Calabria, and within short space tamed his enemies, and recovered all his holds and dominions againe.

Also <hi>Fredericus Austriacus</hi> his sonne, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed for an enemy to the Common-wealth, from whom were taken Austria and Stiria, and brought againe vnder the Emperours obedience and fidelity: who having set Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many at quietnesse, left there <hi>Conradus Caesar</hi> his sonne, and with his army returned to Italy, to punish such as with <hi>Henry</hi> his eldest sonne had conspired against him, whose treasons were all detected at the condemnation of <hi>Henry Caesar,</hi> and chiefly the Popes, who vnderstanding that the Emperour with warlike furniture marched towards Italy, albeit hee fained himselfe to be reconciled, and a friend to him, yet was hee notwithstanding to him a most secret and intestine enemy. For hee sent to those cities who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against the Emperour, admonishing them that they should ioyne themselues together, and that they should fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish strongly their cities with garrisons, and send for aide to friends, and that with all their force they would prepare themselues for warre. Also hee sent Ambassadors to the Emperour to forbid him and his army to come forward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italy, and to say vnto him (not by way of entreaty, but imperiously) that what cause of controversie hee had against the Longobards, the same hee should commit to him, and stand to his arbiterment. The Emperour nothing regarding this foolish interditement, prosecuteth his purpose and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth towards Italy: where he brought vnder his subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those cities that rebelled against him, as Mantua, Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Ternisium, Patavium, and others: and then hee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward set vpon the great Hoast of Mediolanenses, the Brixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Placentines,<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:18150:79"/>The Pope perceiving the overthrow of his confederates, could no longer cover his malice, but did breake out in open fury and rage against the Emperour, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a sentence of proscription against him, depriving him of all his dignities, honours, titles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prerogatiues, kingdoms, and whole Empire. Also calling vnto him the Venetian and Genuan Legats, made a peace betweene them (for they had beene at variance for certaine causes about their Sea coasts) and covenanted with them vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that vpon their charges they should rigge and man 35. gallies, which should spoyle and burne all along the Sea coasts of the kingdomes and dominions of <hi>Fredericke.</hi> But when hee saw the good will and fidelity that the Duke of Venice bare vnto the Emperour, who notwithstanding the displeasure he tooke by the imprisonment of his sonne, yet would he not make warre against him. For which cause the Pope had recourse to his old practises, whereby his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors had trodden all Princes vnder their feet. And so hee put forth an edict at Rome, to the vniversall Church and people, the beginning whereof is, <hi>Ascendit de mari bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica bestia</hi>: wherein hee declareth the causes wherefore hee curseth the Emperour to the divell of Hell, and deiecteth him from his Princely dignity: charging him with treason, periury, cruelty, sacrilege, killing of his owne kindred, and all impiety, and accuseth him as an hereticke, schismaticke, and miscreant. And this edict of the Emperours cursing,<note place="margin">

                     </note> he commanded all Bishops, Prelats, and others of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that they should solemnly recite the same in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in stead of a Sermon. And furthermore, charged them and all other Christian men, vnder paine of cursing and damnation, that they neither helpe the Emperour, nor yet so much as wish him well.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, by meanes of <hi>Albertus Bebauus</hi> his Legat, hee stirred vp great rebellion against the Emperor in Germany. For hee drew <hi>Otto</hi> Duke of Boiaria from the Emperours o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and with him <hi>Venceslaus</hi> and <hi>Belus,</hi> Princes of the Hungarians, and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Polonia.

also <hi>Fredericus Austriacus</hi> the Emperours sonne (because he was proscript or out-lawed of his father) was easily adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Emperour was at Patavium, when these newes were brought to him. Therefore hee commanded <hi>Peter de Vineis</hi> his Secretarie, vpon Easter day to make a narration to the people of his great munificence to the Bishoppes of Rome, and againe of their iniuries towards him in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof: of his innocencie also, in all the heads whereof hee was accused by the Pope: and finally, of the vse of Ecclesiasticall censure, and of the errors and abuse of the Church of Rome.

At the same time the Emperour (as faith <hi>Albericus</hi>) writ to the Pope these veres.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Emperour moreover, by his Letters and Legats, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth intelligence to all Christian princes, as well of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned crimes wherewith he was charged, as also of the cruelty of the Bishop of Rome against him. In all this time it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to support the Emperor with some comfort, which many of his Predecessors lacked. For the Bishops of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many were faithfull subiects vnto him, and not onely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to execute the Popes edicts and mandats in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but also they accused and condemned <hi>Albertus Beba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> the Popes Legat, as a most impudent impostor and a wi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cked fellow, and a most pestiferous botch and sore of the Christian Common-wealth, and gaue him to the Diuell
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18150:80"/>
as a ruinous enemy as well of the Church, as of his naturall Countrey. This warre betweene the Emperour and the Pope waxed so hot, that vpon a time the Emperour came to Pisas and Viterbium, the Pope fearing hee would come to Rome, caused a supplication to be made, wherein the heads of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were carryed about, and with a sharpe and contumelious Oration hee fought to deface the Emperour, promising everlasting life, and giving the badge of the Crosse to so many as would arme themselues and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperour, as against the most wicked enemy of God and his Church. Now the Emperour marching some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what neere the gates of Rome, when hee saw souldiers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the badge of the Crosse comming out against him, gaue a sharpe charge vpon them, and put them soone to flight, and as many as he tooke (cutting off that badge from them) he caused to bee hanged. But the more hee prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the more he was enuyed of the Pope, who by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, called to a Councell at Rome, all such Prelats out of Italy, France, and England, as hee thought to favour him and his proceedings: that hereby as his last shift and onely refuge, hee by their helps might depriue <hi>Fredericke</hi> of the Empire, as an vtter enemy to God and his Church. Of all which the Emperour having intelligence, and knowing that these assemblies should be but to his destruction, hee determined to stop and let their passages to Rome, both by Sea and Land. And therefore sent out his sonne <hi>Henry</hi> with certaine Gallies, to keepe the coasts of Sardinia, and from thence to Pisas, and with the Pisans to rigge out a Navie to meete with such as should aide the Pope of Rome. The Popes associats on the other part, procured that the gallies and shippes of Genua (having <hi>Guilielmus Braccius</hi> for their chiefe Captaine) should bee sent out for defence of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats that were to repaire to the Councell. Thus the Pisan army launched forth to the Sea with forty ships and gallies, and betweene the Isles of Lilium and <hi>Mons Christs,</hi> which lie betweene Liburnium and Corsica, they met with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuan ships, and fiercely began to boord them. In which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18150:81"/>
fight at length were three of the Genuan shippes sunke and 22. taken and brought away, with all the riches and treasures in them. In those were taken three of the Popes Legats (whereof two were Cardinals) <hi>Iacobus Columna, Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho Marchio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Also besides the prey and booty, they found many writings and letters which very much helped the Emperour, in cleering his cause against his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Whilest this discord was between the Emperour and the Pope, <hi>Orthodarius</hi> the Emperour of the Tartarians, soone invaded the borders next adiacent to him, and conquered Ropolanium, Bodolium, Mudanium, with diverse other townes and villages: destroying, wasting, and burning the countries all about: killing and slaying, men, women, children, sparing none of any sex or age. At whose sudden invasion the people being affrighted and troubled, were glad to leaue all that they had, and disperse themselues into woods, and flie vnto marshes and mountaines: so that by this time the Tartarian Hoste was come as farre as Wratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavia, where <hi>Henricus</hi> of Polonia, and the Duke of Silesia met with them, but by reason of inequality both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and forces, they were easily defeated and slaine. From thence they came to Moravia, and from thence to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Bohemia and Hungary, at which time <hi>Belus</hi> King of Hungarie sent to the Emperour for support against the Tartarians, promising that Hungarie ever after should be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iurisdiction of the Emperour. The Emperour on the other part was most willing to helpe the Hungarians and other Christians, and sent to the Pope to perswade him that hee would take vp and conclude a peace, and mitigate somewhat his wrath, in regarde of the immiment danger like to ensue vpon the whole state of Christendome, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a civill dissention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:18150:81"/>But when hee saw that by no meanes the Pope would relent his furie, hee was compelled to write againe to the King of Hungarie, that hee could stand him in no stead at that time, because the Bishop of Rome refused all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace: notwithstanding hee sent <hi>Conradus Caesar</hi> king of Bohemia, and other Princes of Germame to resist and withstand the enemie so farre as in them lay. Thus may bee seene the louing zeale and affection that the Pope of Rome hath toward Christian people, that hee had rather bend his forces to revenge his malice vpon the Christian and good Emperour, then either by himselfe to withstand, or yet by concluding a profitable peace to permit others to withstand the most bloodie and cruell Tartarian. But euen in the midst of this spoyle and havock of Polonia, Bohemia, and Hungaria, was it determined that <hi>Libussa</hi> the Princes confederate with the Pope should bee assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about the deposing of the Emperour,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and creating of another. When <hi>Frederike</hi> saw there was none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie and that hee laboured in vaine to haue peace, hee prosecuted the warre to the vttermost, and when hee had gotten Tudetum and reconciled the same, hee destroyed the Townes of Geminium and Naruia and gaue the spoyle of them to his souldiers, hee gentlie receiued the yeelding vp of Siburnium and wasted all the countrey about Rome: wherewith the Pope being dismaied, and seeing that things prospered not so well with him against the Emperour as he looked for, being in dispaire of obtaining his purpose died in great anger and displeasure.</p>
                  <p>Thus when the author of all this conspiracie was gone, The Emperour with his armie marched forward against the Tartarians who hearing of his comming left the straigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After <hi>Gregorie Celestinus</hi> was created Pope who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 18. daies after, to whom succeeded <hi>Innocentius.</hi> In whose

time the Emperour hoped for peace but was disappointed; for albeit a day was appointed for their meeting together at Festennia, and the Pope had promised that hee would be there before the Emperour and expect his comming, yet hee mocked the Emperour, and secretly in the night tooke ship and first came to Genua, and from thence to Lyons in Fraunce where hee gathered a councell and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Emperour. Notwithstanding the Emperour was determinate to goe to Lyons himselfe, and to conferre with the Pope, both concerning this sentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as also about the conclusion of peace, if by any meanes it could be obtained. But as he was vpon his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney newes was brought to him that Parma was taken by his out lawes assisted by the Popes Legat, wherefore being out of hope of peace, he set himselfe againe to the warre, and besieged Parma planting ouer against it the forme of a towne, which he called Victoria, wherein his Souldiers cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. But the citizens of Parma getting knowledge vpon a time that the Emperour was gone to hunting and his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were stragling here and there without order, issued out of the towne, and slew a great number of them, and burnt his Campe <hi>Victoria.</hi> Soone after the Emperour being in Apulia in a certaine Castle called Florentinium, ended his life.</p>
                  <p>In this time it is to be noted that there was such dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the Emperour and the Pope that the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names of the Guelfes and Gibelins sprang vp in Italie,<note place="margin">

Hee had great warres with <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of Austrich, whom he trauelled to depriue of his Dukedome, But <hi>Albert</hi> led out his armie against him, in the fieldes of Spira, and discomfited his hoste and killed himselfe, and raigned in his steed as will be declared in the next Centurie, god willing.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18150:85"/>
to performe, and in the yeere of our Lord 1248. after he had receiued the Popes blessing at Lyons, set forward with a mightie armie hauing in companie with him the Earle Atrabacensis his brother the Duke of Burgundy, the Duke of Brabant, the Countesse of Flanders with her two sonnes, the Earle of Britanie with his sonne, the Earle of Barrensis, the Earle of Swesson, the Earle of S. Paul, the Earle of Druise, the Earle Retel, with many other noble Persons.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this enterprise they seemed to pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per well, for they tooke the Towne of Damiata at their first arriuall into Aegypt, which was the chiefe seat and hold of the Saracens in all Aegypt. At the losse whereof the Soldan of Aegypt with the Saracens in those parts were so astonished, that they offered the Christians the possession of Ierusalem, and the holy Land, which the Christians so much contended for, prouiding they would render vnto them againe the Towne of Damiata. But the Earle of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys, the kings brother puft vp with insolent pride would in no waies suffer the offers of the Saracens to be accepted, but required also Alexandria the chiefe Metropolitan towne of Aegypt to be deliuered vnto them. But soone after the Soldan of Aegypt beset them so stronglie, both by Sea and Land, that they were glad to craue againe the peace which was offered and could not obtaine it. In the ende they were purposed to leaue a Garrison to keepe Damiata, and to march out in battell themselues. The Earle of Artoys through his insolent pride (thinking all was his owne when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he gat any small aduantage of the enemie) brought himselfe and all the armie to confusion, for he passed ouer a shallow foord of Nilus which a certaine Saracen lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Christ had made knowne, and hauing in company with him the Master of the Temple, and <hi>William Longspath,</hi> with his companie of English souldiers and diuers others, euen the third part of the armie, set vpon the Saracens when they were not aware, and did them great harme. This victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie obtained he would needs goe forward, deuiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18150:85"/>
from the maine Hoast and besieged the Castle, and Village of Mansor. But the Saracens finding him separated from the rest of the army, compassed him about, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed him and all his company, in so much that scarce one man escaped aliue (except two Templars, one Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular, and one poore Souldier) to bring newes thereof to the King. After this the Souldan suddenly appeared with multitude of innumerable thousands, against the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. In this miserable conflict the King with his two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and a few that claue vnto him were taken captiues, all the residue were put to the sword, or else stood to the mercy of the Saracens, whether to bee slaine or remaine in wofull captivity.</p>
                  <p>The Souldan after the captivity of the King, fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suborned an army of Saracens to the number of the French army, with the armes and ensignes of them that were slaine, and sent them toward Damiata, where the Duke of Burgundie with the French Queene, and <hi>Odo</hi> the Popes Legat and other Bishops, and their garrisons were remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, supposing vnder the shew of Frenchmen to be let in. But the Captaines mistrusting their hasty comming, and misdoubting their visages not like to the French-mens, shut the gates against them, whereby they returned frustrate of their purpose. Yet afterward Damiata was rendered to the Saracens as a part of the Kings ransome, which citie being twice won, and twice lost by the Christians, the Souldan afterward caused vtterly to be razed downe to the ground. It is to bee noted in this Tragedy,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> that the Pope of Rome was the chiefe ground of all this lamentable calamity. For the King wisely considering what great helpe hee might haue gotten by the concurrance of the valiant and wife Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Fredericke,</hi> travailed for reconciliation between him and the Pope, before hee vndertooke his voyage, but all his travails were spent in vaine, and so the King of France went alone to this dangerous enterprise, taking with him the Popes blessing, as is sayd before.</p>
                  <p>But like as <hi>Fredericke</hi> before prospered not the worse thate
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18150:86"/>
he was cursed of the Pope, so it may be perceived that <hi>Lewis</hi> King of France prospered not the better, albeit the Pope blessed him. Before wee speake of the sixt voyage of his age it is to marked, that God raised vp <hi>Mango</hi> King of the Tartarians to make warre against the Saracens: he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and professed the name of Christ,<note place="margin">

                     </hi> to fight against the Saracens. Who overhailed Persia, Assyria, Mesopotamia, and in the end came to Syria, and conquered Damascus, appointing his sonne <hi>Abaga</hi> to bee Governour of the same, for hee returned himselfe to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of his brother <hi>Mango,</hi> whom hee heard to be dead. Also <hi>Abaga</hi> afterward hearing of the death of his father <hi>Halo,</hi> returned to gouerne his fathers kingdome, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving behinde him ten thousand horsemen to support the Christians, in the hands of <hi>Guirboca,</hi> who also favoured the Christians for a time, vntil they slew his Nephew, and then hee also became an enemie vnto them, and invaded the towne of Caesarea, and set it on fire.</p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Nelethinus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Turqueminius,</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of Egypt, fearing the dominion of the Tartarians in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, provoked <hi>Guirboca</hi> to fight, and destroyed him and his army: and they that escaped of the Tartarians fled to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia. Thus the small comfort which the Christians had by the Tartarians, was first turned into hatred, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was vtterly taken away by their destruction.</p>

In this voyage the one part of the army, to wit, French-men, arrived at Africa and besieged the towne of Carthage and tooke it: also they besieged Tuenetum sixe moneths, at which time the army was troubled with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pestilence,<note place="margin">A peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> whereof the King himselfe, and the Popes Legat both died. But <hi>Charles</hi> King of Sicile came with a fresh army: <hi>Mulet</hi> the Prince in those parts, entreated for peace, which was granted vpon these conditions. First, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18150:86"/>
if any in Africke would professe the Christian religion, they should bee permitted so to doe without molestation. Next, that the Christians who were detained in captivity should be set at liberty. And thirdly, that there should bee payd yeerely to the King of Sicile forty thousand crownes.</p>
                  <p>The other part of the army vnder the conduct of <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of England, came to Syria, where <hi>Edward</hi> was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented by a deceitfull Saracen, who came with letters to him from his master, and wounded him with an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed knife, whereby hee was in great danger of his life, but being cured by skilfull Physitians, he escaped death. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hee staied in Ptolemais vpon the arrivall of the rest of the army out of Africke, but when hee had long waited in vaine, hee was compelled to returne back againe to his owne countrey.</p>
                  <p>In this voyage it is to be noted, that the Pope of Rome miserably abused the Christian people: for the armies rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the Turkes and Infidels,<note place="margin">

burnt with fire the region round about Damascus. The Barbarians durst not encounter with him in open battell, but circumvened him, and vpon a time as hee was leading away a great prey, they lying in wait for him, arose and brought him to the Souldan: where hee was detained in captivitie 26. yeeres. After this the Christians in Asia were brought to vtter wracke,<note place="margin">The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in Asia.</note> for the Saracens invaded Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia and tooke it, and destroyed the Christians there.

Also Tyrus was rendered vpon condition that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there should safely depart with so much of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as they could transport with shippes, or drawe with beasts. And finally, all the townes and holds which the Christians had in Syria, were taken by the Saracens, onely Ptolemais excepted, which afterward was taken by <hi>Araphus</hi> the Souldan, the Christians therein being put to the sword, and the citie it selfe vtterly razed to the ground, in such sort that there was not so much as a monument of it left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroyed.</p>

                  <p>Here also is to be marked, that the Popes of Rome who were too prodigall of Christian mens blood, continually instigating them to lead armes to Asia, for the recovery of the Holy Land, yet did they esteeme so much of their owne

those bookes which were given out vnder his name to be his or no, shewing herewith an heape of <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes written in the Latin and Dutch tongues. Secondly, whether hee would revoke and recant them, or stand to all that hee had written.<note place="margin">Answered by <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </note> To the first point hee answered affirmatiuely, that hee would acknowledge his owne bookes.

For at the time of his next appearance hee divided his bookes into three sorts,<note place="margin">

Another sort contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned invectiues against the Papacie, and others of that retinue which had with their pestiferous doctrine and pernitious examples, corrupted the whole estate of Christianity, which bookes if hee should revoke, hee should adde more force to their tyranny, and his retraction should be a cloake and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to all their impiety and naughtinesse. The third sort of his bookes were written against certaine particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who with tooth and naile laboured to maintaine the Romane tyranny, and to deface his doctrine, and these like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hee could not recall, left by his recantation it should come to pasle, that tyranny and impiety supported by his meanes should rage more violently against the people, then ever it did before. When no recantation could be obtained, nor yet submission of his writings to the iudgement of the Emperour, and his Estates: <hi>Martin Luther</hi> departed from Wormes, being dismissed according to his promise of his safe conduct, and returned to his owne countrey.</p>

                  <p>After this another convention of the Estates of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was gathered at Norinberg for the suppressing of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi> to which Councell Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the sixt, sent his Ambassadour <hi>Cheregatus,</hi> to desire that the sentence of the Apostolick Sea, and the Emperours edict against <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> should bee put in execution.<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the convention of Norinberg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </note> The Princes of Germany on the other part, declared great vrgent causes wherefore they were compelled to forbeare the execution of those decrees for a time, and namely for this, that the greatest part of Germany haue alwayes had this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that great inconvenience hath come to this Nation by the Court of Rome: and now if they should proceede with rigour in executing the Popes sentence, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours edict, the people would suspect in their mindes, this to bee done for supporting and confirming the former abuses, whereupon great warres and tumults (no doubt) would ensue. For the avoyding whereof, they thought to vse more gentle remedies serving better for the time. Also seeing the Pope by his foresaid Ambassadour desired to be informed what way were best to take, in resisting those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lutherans: The Estates answered, that if the Popes holinesse with consent of the Emperours Maiestie, should gather a free Christian Councell in some conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place of Germanie,<note place="margin">The Princes of Germanies iudgement concerning the suppression of <hi>Luthers</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</note> and that with such speed as conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently might bee, it were in their iudgement the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest way to suppresse the attempts of <hi>Luther</hi>: and in the meane time vntill the Councell might bee set, they had provided wayes to stay the tumults of the Germaine people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, by dealing with the Noble Prince <hi>Fredericke</hi> Duke of Saxony, that <hi>Luther</hi> nor his followers shall not write, set foorth, or print any thing during the saide space.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Item,</hi> that the Princes shall labour so with the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Germany, that they shall not in their Sermons

                  <p n="3">3. And finally, as concerning Priests that contract Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and religious men leaving their Cloysters, for as much as in the civill law there is no penalty for them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, they shall bee referred to the Canonicall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be punished thereafter accordingly: that is by losse of their benefices and priviledges, or other condigne censures.</p>
                  <p>Amongst others things done at this assembly of Norin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,<note place="margin">An 100. grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Germaines, and exhibited to the Bishop of Rome.</note> certaine grievances were collected to the number of an hundreth, and exhibited to the Bishoppe of Rome, wherewith the countrey of Germanie was grieved, as namely, that many things were prohibited by mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, which are not prohibited by any Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and many things were exacted which are not commanded by any precept of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> that the Popes indulgences and pardons bee most importable, perswading simple people of a remission of sinnes, <hi>a poena &amp; culpa,</hi> and that not in this life onely, but after this life: through the hope and occasion whereof, true piety is almost extinct in all Germany, whilest every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill disposed person promiseth to himselfe for a little mony licence and impunity to doe what him listeth, whereupon followeth fornication, incest, adultery, periury, homicide, robbing and spoyling, rapine, vsurie, with a whole flood of mischiefes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> that whosoever hath received Ecclesiasticall orders, doth contend to bee free from all punishment of the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Magistrate, how great soever his offence be which hee committeth.</p>
                  <p>Also, that in many places the Bishoppes and their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialls doe not onely suffer Priests to haue concubines, so
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18150:97"/>
that they pay certaine summes of money, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell continent and chaste Priestes to pay tribute for concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, which being paid, it shall bee lawfull for them either to liue chaste or otherwise, as it shall please them.</p>
                  <p>These with many mo, to the number of an 100. the secular States of Germanie delivered to the Popes Legat, desiring him to present them to Pope <hi>Adrian.</hi> But Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> died about the same time, and Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the seventh succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his place, sent downe his Legat Cardinall <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> vnto the Councell of Germane Princes assembled againe at Norinberg the next Convention, with letters to Duke <hi>Fredericke</hi> full of many faire petitions and sharpe complaints. But as touching the grievances aboue menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, no word at all was sent.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Pope ever ready with all diligence to call vpon Princes to suppresse <hi>Luther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>

                  <p>In these Councels of Norinberg it is to bee noted, that the execution of the sentence of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours edict made at Wormes against <hi>Luther</hi> was suspended for a time; and many other things that were desired by the Popes Legate to bee enacted in a full Councell, and with consent of all the Empire, yet could not bee brought to passe, by reason that the mindes of divers were gone from the Pope. For this cause <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperours bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with <hi>Campeius</hi> and the Cardinall of Salisburg,<note place="margin">A conventicle at Ratisbone, wherein arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> doctrine.</note> the two Dukes of Bavaria, the Bishops of Trent and Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, also the Legates of the Bishops of Bamberg, Spires, Stransbrugh, Ausbrugh, Constance, Basile, Frising, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savie, and Brixine, assembled themselues together in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conventicle at Ratisbone, and there ratified all the articles which they had hatched amongst themselues for suppressing of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, that the edict of the Emperour made at Worms should be observed in all their precincts.</p>

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="7">7. That no Benefice or other office of teaching be giuen to any Student of that Vniversitie; with diverse other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles conteined at greater length in the commentaries of <hi>Iohn Slendan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this other two Conventions were kept at Spiers.<note place="margin">Two conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Spiers with a rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of those things which were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> In the first were exhibited to the Princes many billes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, that Monkes and Fryers might be no more in place of them that died, and that the priviledges of the Clergie might be taken away, as lets of ciuill administration, that certaine holy dayes might be abolished, that choice of meats and ceremonies might be free. And finally, seeing there was no hope of a generall Councell, that either the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would appoint a Provinciall Councell in Germany for matters of Religion, or els cause the decree of Wormes to cease. At this time the Bishops would not suffer any matter of Religion to be handled, and therefore the Duke of Saxonie, and the Landgraue would haue departed. At last it was decreed, that either a generall or provinciall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell should be had within the space of a yeare, and in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18150:98"/>
meane time the decree of Wormace Councell to cease. In the next Councell kept at Spire, where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour in the Emperours name was present, certaine Citties were greatly blamed for altering Religion, contrary to the Emperours commandement; and the Ambassadour for the Citie of Argentine was not suffered to sit in the Councell, because that Cittie had disanulled the Masse. Shortly after by the assent of a few Princes, these points were decreed.</p>
                  <p>That such Cities as had altered Religion should make no further change.</p>
                  <p>That other places should obey the decree of Wormes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a generall Councell.</p>
                  <p>That it should be lawfull to all men who would vse the masse, euen in those Citties where it was abolished.</p>
                  <p>That the Anabaptists should be punished by death. That the doctrine of the Lords supper shuld not be receiued.</p>
                  <p>That the Ministers should teach according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>That the Princes and Cities should not receiue foreiners comming for Religion into their dominions, if any man did otherwise, he should be proscript.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Saxonie, <hi>George</hi> Prince of Brandenburgh, <hi>Erneste</hi> and <hi>Francisse,</hi> Princes of Luneburg, and the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue of Hesse, and a Prince called <hi>Anhaldius,</hi> withstood this decree, and answered to euery point thereof, saying that the consent of a few could not vndoe that decree which before was made at Spire by the whole Empire,<note place="margin">A protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the decrees of the a conventions of Spire.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they all made protestation, that they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.

and to a generall or provinciall Councell. After the breaking vp of this Councell, the Protestants send Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the Emperour, to declare the causes of their appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from the Councell of Spire.<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This was the first ground that moued the Protestants in the conventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Smalcaldy,<note place="margin">A league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Protestants.</note> to bind vp a couenant amongst themselues of mutuall ayde, if any of them were pursued for Religions sake, as shall be declared afterward, God willing.

After the Emperours returning from Italie, where he was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Emperiall Diadem, and had sworne to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Roman Church, a solemne conuention of the Estates of the Empire was kept in the Towne of Angusta, or S.

The Romane Church had for their part Cardinall <hi>Campeius,</hi> the Popes Ambassadour, <hi>Eccius, Iohannes Faber Cochleus,</hi> and many others.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18150:99"/>
(according to his dutie) to carrie the Sword before him as he went to the Church. Then the Emperour vnder great perill commanded both the parties to silence, and he by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue appointed certaine to Preach that should touch no Controversie.</p>

But when the Protestants desired that they might answere to it, the Emperour would not grant it, saying, he would heare no more disputation, but willed them to returne to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church.</p>
                  <p>Also the Citizens of Argentine, Constance, Mening, and Lindan (who differed from the other Protestants in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Sacrament) did in like manner exhibite a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Doctrine: a confutation of this Booke also was made by <hi>Eccius</hi> and <hi>Faber,</hi> with very bitter and sharpe words; but the other partie could not haue licence to reply, nor any sight of the copie but as they heard it read.

                  <p>In this Emperours time, amongst other places, great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion fell out in the Countrey of England vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. King of England, had two sonnes, <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi>; Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> his eldest sonne
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18150:103"/>
married <hi>Katherine,</hi> daughter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Spaine, but he soone after his marriage died without children. King <hi>Henry</hi> with advise of his Nobles to the end her dowrie might remaine within the Realme, thought meete to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> brother to King <hi>Arthur.</hi> This marriage seemed very strange and hard for one brother to marry the wife of another; but yet by dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Pope <hi>Iulian</hi> the second, this marriage, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense of nature would admit, nor Gods law suffer, was concluded, approued, and ratified, and so continued as lawfull without any scruple or doubt the space of twentie yeares, till that a certaine doubt began to be moued by the Spaniards themselues of the Emperours Councell. Anno 1523. At which time <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour being in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, promised to marry Lady <hi>Mary</hi> daughter to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eyght, King of England, with the which promise the Spanyardes were not well contented; Obiecting, that the Ladie <hi>Mary</hi> was begotten of the King of England by his brothers wife. Whereupon, the Emperour forsaking the marriage, did couple himselfe with Ladie <hi>Isabell,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Emmanuel</hi> of Portugall, which marriage was done in the yeere of our Lord 1526. The King vpon this occasion casting many things in his minde, beganne to consider the matter more deeply, and finding that neither his conscience could be cleered in keeping his brothers wife, nor yet the estate of the Realme firme by the succession of a daughter begotten in such a marriage; he proposed the question to the chiefe Vniversities of all Christendome, whose censures all agreed in one, that the marriage was vnlawful. Yet would not the King proceed to the divorcement without the Popes consent. Who sent <hi>Campeius</hi> his Ambassadour with concurrance of the Cardinall of Yorke to be iudges in that cause. The Cardinall of Yorke, called <hi>Wolsey,</hi> at the first was verily bent to haue the divorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t set forward, but afterward finding that the Kings affection was bent towardes Ladie <hi>Anne Bulloigne,</hi> to take her in marriage, he changed his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, &amp; sent advertisment to Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> that in case King

                     <hi>Henry</hi> the eight were divorced from Ladie <hi>Katherine,</hi> then should another infected with <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine succeede in her place, to the great hurt of the Church of Rome. For this cause the Pope calleth backe his Ambassadour <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius,</hi> before the Kings cause was decided. Neuerthelesse, the King proceeded in his purpose, and was divorced from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Katherine</hi> by meanes of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pope and King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.</note> This was the ground of that great hatred that fell out betweene the Pope and King <hi>Henry</hi>; for on the one part, the Pope cursed King <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Realme of England for the divorcement. The King on the other part abolished in his Realme the Bishop of Romes vnlawfull tyrannie, with commandement, that he should be called no more Pope in his Country, but onely Bishop of Rome, and that the King should be taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as supreame head of the Church of England, &amp; haue full authoritie to reforme and redresse errours, heresies, and abuses in the same.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne againe to Germanie. The Emperour was so busied with Warres all this time, that he had no leisure to tarry in Germanie, and although many assemblies were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to suppresse the doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> he was onely present at two, to wit, at the first kept at Wormes, &amp; the last kept at Auspurg. For this cause it seemed good to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to declare his brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be King of the Romanes, and apparent successor to the Empire, to the end he might with greater authoritie gouerne the affaires of the Empire in his absence. He sent also letters to the Protestants, commanding them to acknowledge him King. Wherefore the Ambassadours of the Protestant Cities being gathered at Franckford, concluded with the Princes, that for their part they would not for this resist the Emperour, &amp; for denying a title and a name only to his brother, to make him more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against their Religion. But the Duke of Saxonie, &amp; other Princes, not agreeing thereto, writ to the Emperour, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was done against the manner and liberty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,<note place="margin">Warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> and the Protestant Princes.</note> they could not allow it. This seemeth to be the first ground of the warres that after followed. For <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18150:104"/>
of the Romanes expelled <hi>Vlrich</hi> of Wirtenberge from his Lordship, and when no redresse could be had at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours hands, the Landgraue of Hesse with his cousin <hi>Vlrich,</hi> gathered an Armie; at Lawferme by Wirtenberg ouercame their enemies, and put them to flight; recouered the townes of Asperge, Wrath, Tubinge, and Niphe, and tooke prisoner <hi>Philip,</hi> Prince Palatine and chiefe Captaine of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after, agreement was made on these conditions, that <hi>Vlrich</hi> should haue againe his Lordship of Wirtenberg,<note place="margin">Agreement made betwixt them.</note> but so that he should hold it by the benefit of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the house of Austrich; that if issue male did saile in the house of Wirtenberge, that Lordship should returne to the heire of the Emperours house of Austrich: that the Landgraue and <hi>Vlrich</hi> should come to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and submit themselues to him. The Emperour foreseeing that this diversitie of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that was in Germanie, would in the end burst forth into some bitter fruit, and great inconuenience, aduised with himselfe by what means reconciliation might be made, and all controversie might cease: and in the end appointed a Councell at Wormes, and communication of Religion, and for this cause sent <hi>Granuellanus</hi> thither. But the matter was so long delayed by the fautors of the Sea of Rome, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Letters came from the Emperour againe to deferre the whole matter to the Councell of Ratisbone. To which came all the Princes of the Empire, except the Duke of Saxonie, who came not himselfe,<note place="margin">A Councell held at Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone about the ending of controversies.</note> but sent thither a noble ambassage, together with <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> and other Preachers. Vnto the same Councell also came from the Pope <hi>Caspar Conterane,</hi> a Cardinall. In this disputation, <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Palsgraue, and <hi>Granuellane</hi> were appointed moderators: <hi>Melanchthon, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Pistorius,</hi> Disputers for the Protestants. <hi>Pflugius, Eccius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gropper</hi> for the Papists. Vnto these six was offered a booke conteining the definition of most Articles in Controversie, which they were willed to ouer-looke, and either to allow or disallow those things that they could agree vpon. This booke was deliuered againe after a time to the Emperour; in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18150:104"/>
many points they could not agree, in some they did. The Protestants deliuered together with the booke, their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning those controversies, and their arguments to proue the same. The Emperour deliuered the same to the Princes to be examined: but they being most part Popish, referred the whole matter to the Popes Ambassadour, who exhorting the Bishops to honestie of life, and suppressing of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, thought good it should be deferred to a generall Councell. This convention which began in Aprill Anno 1541. was dissolued in the end of Iulie; after that the Emperour had decreed, that the communication begun, and whole controversie of Religion,<note place="margin">The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councell.</note> should be deferred to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or Provinciall Councell of Germanie: That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants should teach no other points of Religion, then such as were agreed vpon: That Bishops should see amendment of life in their Diocesse: That there should be a Provinciall Councell within a yeare and an halfe, if they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a generall Councell of the Pope: That the Churches of Monasteries should not be pulled downe, but reformed: that the Church-goods should not be inverted: that the decree of Ausbrough, and all Proscriptions of the Protestants should be suspended: all those conventions of estates, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, promises of generall or provinciall Councels to be kept in Germanie, could not reconcile diuerse Religions, but at length lurking hatred behoued to breake out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hostilitie.</p>
                  <p>The first occasion whereof was offered by <hi>Henry,</hi>

In this warre they subdued all his dominions, and compelled him with his eldest sonne <hi>Charles</hi> to flie for their safetie into Bavarie. <hi>Henry</hi> to recouer his dominions againe, first pursued the Protestants in the Chamber-court of the Empire, but the Protestants appealed and refused the iudgement thereof.</p>

                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:18150:105"/>Next he made his complaint to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Emperours brother; and last went into Italie to the Emperour, &amp; there at Cremona grieuously accused the Protestants, to whom the Emperour sent an hard message, that if the Prince of Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick were not restored, he would take such order, whereby he should be restored whether they would or no. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, the Emperour at his returning into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, after he had heard the declaration of the Protestants against the Duke of Brunswick, albeit, the Emperour was loath to giue out any grieuous sentence against him, yet at length he determined that all the Dukes lands should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as sequestred in his hands, vntill that matter were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

There were slaine, partly in that towne, partly abroad, aboue 800. beside other places.

For his meaning was onely to pardon him perpetuall emprisonment. This matter after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward turned the Emp. to great trouble. In the meane time hauing the principall chiefe Princes of the Protestants in Captiuitie, the Emp. thought meete to gather a conuention of the estates at Ausbrough to finish that matter which hee had intended long before.<note place="margin">A convention at Ausbrough.</note> All the Electors with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were gathered together in great number, but about the citie and in diuers places of the countrie, neere thereto was companies of Spaniards and Italians, and other soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the terrour of them that were present. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matter purposed was concerning the Councell of Trident.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour required of the Princes, priuatlie of the <hi>Palsgraue</hi> &amp; <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of Saxonie, whether they would submit themselues to the Councell of Trident or no. At the first they refused it, but afterward fearing the Emp. displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to permit the matter to his will. The free cities also being demaunded if they would adde any thing to the answere of the Princes, answered it was not their part so to doe, and offered a writing to the Emperour, on what condition they would admit the Councell.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour as though they had fullie consented sent
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18150:107"/>
to the Cardinall of Trident and the Pope desiring that the Councell which was remoued from Trident to Bononia, might bee againe revoked to Trident which was nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to Germanie, vpon hope that the Germanes would come and submit themselues to the Councell. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Pope and Bishops assembled at Bononie, would not returne backe againe to Trident, but vpon such conditions as liked themselues best: the Emperour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by his Ambassadours that all such things that they should decree there to be vnlawfull and of no force, and that he himselfe would vndertake the care of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth of Christendome which the Bishops neglected. Thus the Emperour perceiuing that there was no hope of a generall councell in Germanie consulted with the Princes about the agreement of Religion, and appointed <hi>Iulius Pflugins</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Numburg, <hi>Michael Sidon</hi> and <hi>Iohn Islebie</hi> to draw out a booke for reformation of Religion,<note place="margin">The booke called <hi>Interim</hi> vrged by the Emperour.</note> which they called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim. This was the ground of a new trouble, for the Emperour strictly commaunded that the Princes would receiue and admit the manner of Religion set forth in the booke called Interim. The Duke of Saxonie that was kept prisoner, being earnestlie required to subscribe would not in any wise, and for that cause after was vsed more strictly, insomuch that his Preacher who was hitherto permitted, fled for feare of danger.</p>
                  <p>The Lantgraue hoping to obtaine fauour, and libertie receiued the Emperours booke, and submitted himselfe to it, but all would not helpe him. The Marques of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge not onely receiued it himselfe, but also sent for <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> whom partly with entreatie, partly with thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings he commaunded to subscribe the Emperours booke, but he constantlie refused, and with great danger of his life returned to Argentine.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mauricius</hi> Duke of Saxonie returning home from Ausbrough, Proclaimed the Emperours decree concerning Religion. Vpon that occasion the diuines and Preachers, of the vniuersities of Lipsia and Witenberg, diuers times assembled themselues, and at length concluded vpon these things (that they called indifferent) to receiue them as the Emperour had prescribed. This thing was by other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in Germanie sore impugned, saying that by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of their indifferencie they had opened a way to the whole doctrine, and superstition of the Church of Rome taking those things for indifferent in which was manifest errour.</p>

                  <p>In France the King with advice of the Guisians had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a nationall Councell to bee kept in Orleance,<note place="margin">A Councell kept at Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> for the quieting the tumults which were like to ensue for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in France: but all was done in hypocrisie and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull mindes as evidently appeared: so soone as the King of Navarre and Prince of Condie came to Orleance, and had saluted the King,<note place="margin">The Prince of Condie taken by the Kings guard is in danger.</note> the Captaine of the Kings guard layd hands on the Prince of Condie, and the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Prince of Condie had conspired against his honour and life.

But the Lord pitying the estate of his owne poore Church in France,<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Francis.</hi>
                     </note> shortned the life of <hi>Francis</hi> the second, who dyed of a putrefaction of his eares. And thus was the second high attempt of the Guisians against the Gospell marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously disappoynted by the sudden and vnexpected death of <hi>Francis</hi> the second. After whose death the innocency of the Prince of Condie, was declared by a decree of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at Paris: and the government of the young King, <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, was devolued in the hands of the Queen mother, and the King of Navarre. Those Gouernours with advice of the States of the Realme,<note place="margin">A disputation at Poyssie.</note> thought meet that a free disputation should be appointed at Poyssie a towne in France, neere to Saint Germane, wherein the controversies of religion should bee freely reasoned, in presence of the young King, the Queene mother, the King of Navarre, and other Princes of the royall blood.</p>
                  <p>This disputation began the ninth of September, <hi>anno</hi> 1561. For the Protestants part were appointed <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> Minister at Geneva, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> professor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Zuricke, <hi>Nicholas Gelasius, Augustinus Marloratus, Iohannes Merlinus, Franciscus Morellus, Iohannes Malo,</hi> and <hi>Espineus,</hi> a man of great learning, who had lately forsaken the Romane Church, and embraced the true reformed religion. On the other part the Cardinall of Loraine, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cardinalls, Archbishops, and Bishops, to the number of fifty Prelates, besides many other Divines and Doctors were ready to pleade the cause of the Romish Church. In this disputation, after that <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> had at length declared the summe of the Protestants faith, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Loraine had answered: In the end the Romane Prelats devised a pretty shift to cut off all further reasoning:<note place="margin">The Papists policy to cut off further reasoning.</note> for the Cardinall of Loraine produced the opinion of the Germans about the matter of the Sacrament, extracted out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of Ausbrugh, &amp; Jemanded of the Protestants whether they would subscribe to it or no, to the end that if they consented to subscribe, they might seem to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed themselues of errour in the matter of the Sacrament;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18150:112"/>
and if they refused to subscribe, then it might bee knowne to the Princes that were present, that the Protestants agreed not amongst themselues.</p>
                  <p>To this it was answered by <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> in the next meeting, that if the confession of Ausbrough should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, then it was good reason to require a subscription of the whole confession, and not of one line thereof onely: also if they vrged the Protestants to subscribe that confession of Ausbrough, then let themselues first begin to subscribe the same: and when they haue yeelded to the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Ausbrugh, it will be more easie to finde out any way of agreement in matters of religion. After this the forme of disputation was changed, and a few in number, to wit, fiue onely on either side, were chosen to conferre in quiet and peaceable manner, who beginning at the matter of the Sacrament, seemed all to agree in this forme: that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ by the operation of the holy Spirit, offereth and exhibiteth vnto vs the very substance of his body &amp; blood, and wee doe receiue and eate spiritually and by faith that same body which dyed for vs, to the end we may be flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, and that we may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, and receiue all things that are needfull to our salvation. And because faith leaning to the word of God maketh those things that are received to be present, by this faith indeed we receiue truely and effectually the very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body and blood of Iesus Christ, through the power of the holy Spirit. In this respect wee acknowledge the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the body and blood in the Supper. The article of the Sacrament being conceiued in this forme, was presented to both the parties, and many of the Romane Prelates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended to the article aboue specified: but when they had conferred with the Doctors of Sorbon, they all with one consent refused the same: and finding that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muners that were chosen for their part did persevere in their opinion, they cryed out against them, and would giue no further power to them to reason in that cause. Thus the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Poyssie broke vp the 25. of November, without
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18150:113"/>
any agreement of the controversies in religion, but rather leaving in the harts of men a seed of greater contention and cruell wars, which afterward ensued. But before we speak of the warres in France for religion: somewhat is to bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the cruell persecution that the faithfull suffered in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emont, in which countrey certaine townes had received the Gospell, and abolished the masse: namely, the townes of Angrona, Lucerne, Perose, Tallaret, with divers others in the convalles of Piemont: all which townes are subiect to the dominion of the Duke of Savoy, who hearing of the reformation that was made in the foresayd bounds of his dominion, sent out his Captaine <hi>Triniteus</hi> with an army of 500.<note place="margin">The Duke of Savoy warreth against the Protestants within his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</note> men, against them, to sack and vtterly destroy them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would receiue the masse againe, and put away from them their ministers. The towne of Angrona was first assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the people fled to the mountaines, but being strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued they turned themselues, and with slings &amp; stones defended their liues and put their enemies to the worse, in so much that <hi>Triniteus</hi> the Dukes Captaine was to deale with them by subtilty and craft,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Triniteus</hi> by policy spoileth those of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grona both their money and armour.</note> rather then by open force, and therefore promised vnto the Convallenses that if they layd downe their armour, and sent messengers to the Duke to cuane his pardon, and would pay to him the summe of sixteene thousand crownes, then vpon those conditions they should haue peace.</p>
                  <p>The poore people glad to accept conditions of peace, performed all that was required, but no peace could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Duke, except they would put away their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and receiue the masse againe. Therefore being spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both of money and armour, by the craft of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and a new army also sent against them, they were compelled in time of winter to flie with their wiues and children to the mountaines all over-layd and covered with snow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from thence to behold the pitifull specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the burning of their houses, and spoyling of their goods. But necessity compelling them to make some shift for their liues, they tooke the strict passage of the mountains
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18150:113"/>
and resisted their enemies, committing the successe to God, who so prospered this poore vnarmed people,<note place="margin">God prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the Protestants.</note> that in few skirmishes there were killed a thousand of their enemies, and scarce fortie persons of their owne. <hi>Triniteus</hi> the Captain by the counsell of <hi>Truchetus,</hi> an expert Warriour, thought meet to besiege the Castles of Convallenses, but God fought against them in all their enterprises, and the Convallenses came vpon them suddenly as they were besieging a certaine Castle,<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Truchetus.</hi>

After the disputation at Rossie the number of the Protestants daily increased, and rumours of sedition &amp; vprores were in the mouths of all the people. The Queene mother willing to prouide timely remedie for repressing of ciuill and intestine warre, assembled the estates of the land at S. Germane,<note place="margin">The edict of Ianuarie in behalfe of the Protestants.</note> where the edict of Ianuarie was made, bearing that the professours of the reformed Religion might assemble themselues together, to heare Preaching of the Word, provided those assemblies were kept without the towns &amp; without armour. This edict was published through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the land, and sore grieued the hearts of the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, namely, the Duke of Guise, the Constable <hi>Momme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,</hi> and the Marescall <hi>Santandreus,</hi> who consulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how they might haue this act vndone againe, but no way could be found out to bring this matter to passe, except first the King and Queene mother were in their hands, to the end that the force of the Lawes which they feared might be turned against their enemies, when as they had the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers in their owne hands. This was also thought to be an
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18150:114"/>
high attempt, and dangerous to be enterprised, so long as the King of Navarre was their enemie, and a fauourer of the reformed Religion; for this cause all meanes were sought out to divert the affection of the King of Navarre from his foresaid Religion. The Cardinall <hi>Ferrar</hi> being the Popes Ambassadour in France, put him in hope that by the Popes trauailes with <hi>Philip</hi> King of Spaine, the kingdome of Navarre should be restored to him againe, if he would turne to the Catholique Religion.<note place="margin">The King of Navarre tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Papist.</note> Thus was the heart of the King of Navarre stolen away from his Religion, to the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Duke of Guise and his complices, who without further delay put hand to worke.</p>
                  <p>The first fruits of his martiall deeds after he raised his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, was the cruell Massacre of poore vnarmed people, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to heare the Word of God at Vassiace, a towne in the borders of Champaigne, and neere vnto his dominion. Those poore people to the number of a thousand and fiue hundreth,<note place="margin">The Duke of Guise killeth 1500 people at a Sermon.</note> being occupied as is said vpon the Sabbath day, the Duke of Guise came vpon them suddenly, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Church wherein they were with armed souldiers, that none might escape; also the Duke himselfe stood in the entry with a drawne sword in his hand, and sent in his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who most cruelly without compassion of sex or age, martyred the poore members of Christ, for hearing of his Word. After this, the Duke of Guise addressed himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Paris, where he was receiued with ioyfull acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people: and from thence he marched forward to Fonteblew,<note place="margin">The Duke of Guise taketh the King, and the Queene mother, priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for whose deliuerie the Protestants binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The first ciuill warre.</note> where the King was, and seased himselfe of the King and the Queene mother, and for greater securitie transported them both to Paris. On the other part, the Prince of Condie went to Orleance, to whom resorted a great number of the Nobles of France, namely, the admirall <hi>Castilion, Andelot, Princeps Porcianus, Rupsfocald,</hi> with many others, who all bound themselues together, to set the King and the Queene mother at libertie from captivitie, wherein they were deteined by the Guisians; as also to defend the true professours of the Gospell of Christ, that according to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18150:114"/>
the act of Ianuarie they might without molestation assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues to heare the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of Condie was chosen to be their Chieftaine,<note place="margin">The Prince of Condie cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Generall for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> to whom the Queene mother sent many secret Letters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that she was deteined by the Guisians against her heart. And if the Prince of Condie could set the young King and her selfe at libertie, shee would neuer be vnmindfull of so great a benefit. Thus in the beginning of the Warres the Queene mother fauoured the Prince of Condie, and stirred him vp with many Letters and secret advertisements, to procure her and her sonnes libertie: for greater euidence whereof, the Letters themselues are inserted in the French Historie.</p>
                  <p>Many great townes in France were taken and fortified by the Protestants,<note place="margin">Many townes taken and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the Protestants, whereof Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp; Roane were recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.

Many of those townes were recouered againe by the Guisians, namely, Bourges, and Roane. At the siege of Roane, the Prince of Navarre was slaine, and receiued a iust reward of his inconstancie and leuitie. And <hi>Augustinus Marlorart,</hi> a faithfull seruant of Christ, and Preacher of the Gospell, was taken by the Guisians, and afterward hanged. Many great cruelties were designed against those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this first Warre, namely in Tullus, Aurange, Burges, Roan, Sens, and diverse other places.

But the Princesse answered him, that there was not any man in the realme, except the King alone, that had power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her. And if he would proceed to such boldnesse as to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18150:115"/>
batter her Castle with Canon shot, shee would first stand in the breach her selfe, to try if he durst be so bold as to kill the daughter of a King. Those words caused <hi>Malicorne,</hi> like a Snaile to pull in his hornes, and presently to depart.</p>
                  <p>Afeer this, the Prince of Condie perceiuing that great preparation was made against him, and the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affection was turned away to the Guisians, thought meete to send for ayde to the Queene of England; and the Prince of Condie willing to ioyne himselfe with the English armie, marched forward to Normandie, but the Duke of Guise followed after him with so great celeritie,<note place="margin">The battell of Dreux, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prince of Condie was taken by the Papists, and the Constable by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> that the Prince of Condie was compelled to ioyne Battell with the Guisians at Dreux in Normandie, before he was supported of the English armie.</p>

                  <p>In France the professours of the Gospell could not enioy the benefit of the Edict of pacification made in March,<note place="margin">The Prince of Orange war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth against the Spaniards.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1563. except in a few parts where the authoritie of some noble persons fauouring the Gospell procured obedience to the foresaid Edict, as namely, the presence of Condie in Picardie, <hi>Andelot</hi> in Britannie, and the Queene of Navarre in Gascoigne. In other parts of the country, little regard was had to the Edict. The Cardinall of Loraine also a capitall enemie to the Gospell, had consulted with the fathers of the

Councell of Trent,<note place="margin">The Cardinal of Loraine taketh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell how to suppresse the Gospell.</note> by what way the Gospell might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in France, and it was thought meetest that a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant should be made amongst them that fauoured the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion (which they called the holy league) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate and roote out them that professed the new Religion (for so they named it) and the two puissant Kings of Spaine and France in speciall should bee intreated to be of this league, and mutually to helpe one another to roote out the Gospellers. Now when King <hi>Charles</hi> the 9. was 14. yeares old, and declared to be Maior, it was thought meete that he should make a progresse through the bounds of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; pretending that it was expedient that the King should know the estate of his Country, and that he should heare the complaints of his people; but the cause indeed of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, was that the King of France might meete with the King of Spain in Bayon, for binding vp of the league afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. In this progresse was discharged all Preaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising of the reformed Religion in the Townes of France, wherein it should happen the King to be, during the time of his progresse. Also many new interpretations of the edict of March were invented and found out, whereby the libertie granted to the Protestants was vtterly infringed and impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie granted to them that should doe them wrong.

The report of this league was not kept so secret but it came to the eares of the Prince of Condie, and the rest of the nobilitie of France, that professed the Gospell, who all thought meete that the Prince of Condie should in proper person addresse himselfe to the King (being for the time at Moncellium) and should exhibite to the King the supplication of the Protestants in France, pittifully complaining, that contrarie to the edict of March they were iniuried and cruelly slaine,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18150:116"/>
desiring redresse of the aforesaid iniuries, and that they might haue libertie to enioy their Religion according to the act of pacification aboue mentioned. But the King hearing of the Prince of Condies comming to him, and (namely because he was well accompanied with foure hundred men all in armes) fearing the malignitie and obstinate malice of his adversaries, left they should hinder his iourney or doe wrong to himselfe. The King (I say) hearing tell of the Princes comming, made hast to depart, and with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Paris in great feare, and caused the Parisians to giue thankes to God, as though he had beene deliuered from a great perill and imminent danger.</p>

This great celeritie of the Duke (who transported all the armie ouer the riuer in one night) put the Prince of Condie and the Admirall in great feare, because their Forces were farre behinde them.

In which were reckoned to be seauen thousand and fiue hundred horsemen, and sixe thousand footemen, besides two thousand French horsemen, who came in their companie, and ten Ensignes of footemen.

                  <p>In the Countrey of Poictou, the Princes had taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Townes, and the most part of the Countrey was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie subiect vnto them.

                  <p>The Admirall although he had lost two thousand men at this Siege, and great sicknesse, and penurie of victuals was felt in the armie, yet was he very vnwilling to raise the Siege, till at length the Duke of Andum strictly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged Monsieur <hi>Loe</hi> in Castelleralt,<note place="margin">The admirall raiseth his siege from Poictiers.</note> whom the Admirall willing to relieue, left the siege of Poictiers.</p>
                  <p>Soone after this, the armie of the two Princes being at Moncontuire, in the Country of Poictou, was purposed to march toward Niort; and the armie of the Duke in like manner was purposed thither.<note place="margin">The battell of Moncontuire, wherein the Protestants were discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</note> Through this occasion the two armies ioyned in battell a little space from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contuire, and the Duke of Andium had the Victorie.

                  <p>The number of those that were slaine at this battell, are supposed by some to haue beene sixe or seauen thousand men; by others, twise as many.

                  <p>The Princes with the Admirall consulted in what part of the Realme it were meetest to sustaine the hazzard of the Warrefare;<note place="margin">By a new edict of pacification the third ciuill warre endeth.</note> and it was thought meetest in Languedok, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Towne of Nimes was lately surprised by the Protestants, and many townes in that Countrie fauoured their Religion.</p>

                  <p>Also the edict of pacification was better kept then it had beene at any other time before, except in a few places.

                  <p>The King himselfe passed to Bloyes, and sent for the Queene of Navarre, whom hee receiued so courteously, and conferred with so louingly, that the Queene was fully perswaded, that this marriage would be a sure pledge and bond of constant peace.</p>
                  <p>The Admirall also was sent for, and met the King at Bloyes, whom the King seemed to reuerence and honour out of measure; in so much that the Admiralls heart was betwitched with the Kings faire speeches, supposing that he meant vprightly, to bind vp indeed a bond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

                  <p>The forerunners of the lamentable Tragedie that after followed began soone to appeare, if the hearts of men had not beene setled in a deepe securitie. For the Queene of Navarre, as she was busied in making preparation for the marriage, died hastily being cut off by empoysoned Gloues, which shee receiued from an Italian the Kings Vnguentarie.</p>
                  <p>But the King seemed to be in such heauinesse for her death, and the matter was so finely conveyed, that all suspition was incontinently quenched and buried,<note place="margin">The King of Navarre mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Kings sister.</note> and the marriage was celebrated the eight-teenth day of August Anno 1572.

                  <p>Likewise, the King himselfe came to visit the Admirall, with pittifull words, lamenting the chance that was fallen out,

Also he desired that the Admirall would be content to be transported to the Loouer of Paris for his better securitie, in case any popular commotion should fall out, vntill he should be trying and punishing the authors of that fact. And when the King perceiued that the Admirall made excuse of his infirmitie, that he could not suffer to be transported, the King appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some of his owne Guard to attend vpon the Admiral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All this was done vnder deepe dissimulation, to put the Protestants in securitie, that they should not once imagine of the Tragedie that was to come.

                  <p>AFter the death of <hi>Maximilian, Rodulphus</hi> his sonne was made Emperour. In his time the warres in France, which seemed to be well quieted by the last edict of pacification, began to kindle vp againe with greater flame. For the adversaries of religion besought the Kings Maiestie to restraine the pernitious liberty of the edict of peace: but perceiving him not to bee sufficiently moved to breake the peace, and to take knife in hand, they began to assemble at Perone,<note place="margin">The league of Peron 1576. for the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protestants.</note>

There were two things that greatly animated the Leaguers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their association, to wit: First, that the Protestants yeelded not vp the townes which they had gotten for their assurance, for the space of sixe yeeres. The sixe yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, they complained to the King that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not kept vnto them, and that for the abolishing of warres, and setling of peace in France, it was needfull that they should haue those townes a longer time in their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, whereto the King condiscended.</p>
                  <p>This grieved the Leaguers: but another thing grieved them more, that <hi>Alauscon</hi> the Kings brother for griefe of the hard successe of his affaires in the Low Countries, died at Chasteau Thierry. And the King himselfe having no children, the feare that they conceived of the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varres succession to the Kingdome, caused the Leaguers rage. While the flame issued out of this furnace, the King of France easily perceived that the drift of all the Leaguers
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18150:127"/>
enterprises was against his life and crowne,<note place="margin">The drift of the Leaguers enterprise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the K. and crowne.</note> and to set vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother whom it pleased them in his place. For the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers pretended warre against the Hugonots, and yet they seazed vpon the best townes of the Catholikes, in all the Realme. The religion was preached in Guyen, and they went to driue it out of Picardie. The Hugonotes were in Rochell, and the Leaguers army marched straight to Paris. They are at Montpelliere, and the league set vpon Marseille. Likewise the pasquells and libells without names, dayly throwne downe in the towne of Paris, and the disdainfull speeches dayly vttered of the King, speaking of him as a <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and a Prince drowned in his pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and for his third crowne which hee looked for in heaven, promising him one made with a rasour in a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: all these things presented to the Kings minde a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient vnderstanding of the resolution and purpose of the Leaguers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notwithstanding feare so possessed his minde, that in stead of couragious resisting of the Leaguers in due time,<note place="margin">The King for lacke of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage maketh himself a slaue to the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of he Leaguers.</note> hee made himselfe a slaue to their appetites. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Duke of Guise (who was made Generall of the fellowship of the league) at the first rising, exceeded not the number of a thousand horsemen, and foure thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: which company might easily haue beene dispersed, if the valorous courage of the King had not beene vtterly abashed: who in stead of commanding with authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Queene mother to procure that the Duke of Guise might leaue off armes, and to assure him of his favour, and that he would giue him what part of his Realme hee would aske to let him liue in peace.</p>
                  <p>This their enterprise succeeding so well, farre aboue their owne expectation, mooved them to set forward, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the King that hee would make and sweare an irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable edict of extirpation of Heretikes: To take by force the townes holden by those of the new religion: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the protection of Geneva, to authorize their warres, to reconcile them vnto him, to bee of their league, and of a King to become a participant. Wherevpon followed an

                  <p>And not content with this, they asked of the King for their further surety, the townes of Chalon, Thoul, Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Saint Desier, Rhems, Soissons, the Castle of Dyon, the towne and castle of Beaume, Rue in Picardie, Dinan and Con<expan>

                  <p>The King of Navarre all this while kept himselfe quiet, being solicited by the King so to doe. But when hee saw the King had rendered himselfe to the appetite of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, hee set forth a declaration of the cause, why the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers had taken armes, of the vanity of their pretences, and of the fruits which the Estates in France might reape by the conclusions of Peronne,<note place="margin">The King of Navarre and the Prince of Condie with diverse others, oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Leaguers.</note> Nemours, and Nauty, (for in those places the Leaguers had bound vp their league) with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation that with him, the Prince of Condie his cousen, the Duke de Mommerencie, with Lords, Gentlemen, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and Townes, both of the one religion and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so many as would concurre with him, should oppose themselues to the authors of these troubles.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, while the King of Navarre is so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied with the King and the Leaguers, who were now as it were incorporate in one bodie: the third assault commeth on,<note place="margin">The Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth the King of France.</note> and Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, with his thunderbolts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication setteth vpon him, declaring him to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the crowne of France, abandoning his person, and his countrey for a prey to such as should obtaine them. At the same time also, the Electors of Germany, who in all the former warres had beene so helpfull to the Protestants
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18150:128"/>
of France, was not vnmindfull of them at so strait a pinch, but sent Ambassadours to the King,<note place="margin">The Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee thought strange that forrain Princes should meddle with his affaires: and that he would doe nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the honour of his conscience, nor the fatherly care he had vnto his people. With this answer the Ambassadours returned, not well pleased.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Guise being advertised of the dislike the Ambassadours of Germany had touching their answere,<note place="margin">The sixt civill war in France for religion.</note> counselled the King to set vpon the Protestants before the Rutters entred into France, so that in lesse then eighteene moneths the King of Navarre saw himselfe assayled by fiue Camps royall, vnder fiue severall Generals. Neverthelesse very few exploites worthy of remembrance were done by those armies, vntill the army of the Germanes entred into France,<note place="margin">An army of Germans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter France in behalfe of the Protestants.</note> vnder the conduct of the Baron of Othna, a man of greater courage then experience. The Duke of Bulloigne in the name of the King of Navarre, ioyned with the Baron of Othna, to leade this great army, wherein were moe then thirty thousand Switzers, Rutters, and French-men. They marched from Loraine to Cheaumont in Bassigny, and passed the river of Marne, also they crossed l' Anbe at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigny and Seine aboue Casklion, and Cure aboue Vermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone and Yome, hard by Crenaunt, and so made haste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the river of Loire. There began the complaints of the Switzers and the mutinies of the Rutters, because the King of Navarre came not to them, and the King of France was at the side of the river Loire, either to fight with them, or to stay their passage. At this time the King vsed a stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, which was the cause of his victory, and of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipation of the army of strangers. For hee considered that the onely meanes to breake their army, was to impeach their ioyning with the King of Navarre. Therefore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Duke Ioyense to keepe the King of Navarre in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18150:128"/>
Poictou, and rather to hazard battell, then suffer him to passe the river of Loire, as hee determined at the head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: to the which end the Duke de Ioyense that had an army fortified, both with men, munition, artillery, and meanes marched to Coutras, to passe la Drogne at Que, and vpon tuesday the twentith of October, <hi>Anno</hi> 1587. he stayd with all his forces betweene la Rotch,<note place="margin">The battell of Coutras be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kings army &amp; the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> Chalais, and Coutras. The King of Navarre made toward him, fully resolved to fight, and about eight of the clocke in the morning, the King of Navarres artillery began to play, and that of Duke de Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ense to answer them, but not very fortunately, for that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ignorance or malice of the Canoners had placed it so low, that the mouth of the canon, shot right vpon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hill of earth, wherein the bullets stayed without pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any further. The battell was so soone decided, that in ten houres this great army of the Kings (that had the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage both for place and number) began to retyre and was sooner broken then fought withall.</p>
                  <p>The King of Navarre, the Prince of Condie, and the Earle of Soissons behaved themselues most valiantly, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the offices both of Captaines and souldiers, and gaue thankes to God in open field.</p>
                  <p>In this battell Duke de Ioyense and Monsieur de S.

That done, the King of Navarre being eased of so many nets that were set vp to catch him, marched forward to ioyne with the forraine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to passe the river Loire. The King on the other part to impeach the meeting of the two armies of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, caused the ditches betweene Povilly and Dony to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Rutters being disappointed of their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18150:129"/>
passage were compelled to recoile, and having failed of their enterprise at la Charitie, they entred in the way of Beauce, drawing towards Montargis. From this time forth a great mutinie began in the army of the strangers, being mooved with impatience, because they could neither haue money nor sight of the King of Navarre: whereof the King being then at Bonevall had intelligence, and thereupon vsed all the meanes hee could to sound the hearts of the Switzers, and perswaded them to separate themselues from the rest of the army, and retyre home: whereunto the Switzers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended, and vpon agreement of 400000. crownes payed to them in ready money, they returned backe againe to their owne countrey. The Duke of Guise perceiving the army of the Rutters to be as a body dispersed, hauing nothing left but the armes and legges, tooke boldnesse to set vpon them as they camped at Aunew,<note place="margin">A skirmish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the D. of Guise and the Rutters.</note> and entred with his footmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the streets, about the time that the carts and baggage were ready in the morning to issue out, and so couragiously sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised the Rutters at their breakefast: when the trumpets began to sound a chivall, having no meanes to issue out, they were constrained to retyre into their lodgings, at the pleasure of the assaylants. The booty was great, being 800. chariots, iewels and chaines of gold, and two thousand horse, both for the field and waggons. The gates being seazed vpon, and the streets chained, there was no meanes to saue themselues but by the walles, which the Generall leaped ouer.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding of this surprise, the army of the Rutters was in such estate, that by reason of some small assurance they had of the King of Navarres arrivall, it was likely to haue overcome the Duke of Guise forces. And as it was at point to retyre backe againe, the Prince of Condie, the Duke of Bulloigne, and the Lords of Chastilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Cleruant, promised to pay them all their wages, if they would march forward. The hope of their pay made them to march in a time not very convenient, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Forrest of Orleance. The King perceived that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18150:129"/>
the longer the armie kept the fields, the greater would be the ruine of his Countrey, and that, being ioyned with the king of Navarre would doe great hurt, caused the Sienrs of the Isle of Cormont to certifie the Coronels that if they would yeeld vp their colours, and sweare to beare no armes in Fraunce without the expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Maiestie hee would giue them assurance to retire in safetie. They on the other part perceauing themselues to be farre from the king of Navarre, hardlie handled by the Frenchmen, beaten by the league, pursued by the king, and forsaken of the Switzers, assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together at Marsigni:<note place="margin">The Rutters retire out of France.</note> and accepted his Maiesties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers sent by Monsieur <hi>D' Esperno,</hi> and retired out of France toward Geneua.</p>
                  <p>The Marques <hi>Du pont,</hi> eldest sonne to the Duke of Loraine, and the Duke of Guise, against their faith giuen, followed the miserable troupe of the Rutters to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at Saint <hi>Clande,</hi> where they gaue thankes for the good successe of their companie: and from thence to please their hungrie troupes they trauersed the Countrie of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goundie, entering into the Countries of Mombeliard and Hericourt, where his men vsed diuers great cruelties and spared not the lands of the Bishop of Basile.</p>
                  <p>After the bloodie ceasing of so lamentable vengeance vpon a poore innocent people, which as yet doe feele the losse and destruction of two hundred villages, the violence vsed to a number of women and maids, the Massacre of so many old men, and the furious and beastlie inhumanitie of the League, they beare the signes of their spoyles into Loraine.</p>

                  <p>The Duke of Guise came to the King at Soissons to constraine the King either to bow or breake, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the articles drawne, and deuised at Nancie and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>

                  <p>But the Duke of Guises heart, as it were attainted with a

                  <p>This maner of arriuall together with the peoples fauour vttered by their ioyfull acclamations at the Duke of Guises lighting increased the distrust of the kings heart, so that hee resolued to preuent the enterprises intended against him, and commanded the Marescall <hi>Biron</hi> to cause foure thousand Switzers to enter into the Towne and to lodge them in diuers quarters thereof, who seased incontinent vpon the bridges of Nostredame and Saint <hi>Michael.</hi>

                  <p>The Switzers were set vpon and they yeelded, crying <hi>Viue</hi> Guise, and Monsieur de <hi>Brissac</hi> caused them to be disarmed: and Sienre de S. <hi>Paul</hi> caused the kings guarde to retire, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding down their armes with hatts in hand.

for the indignation hee had sustained in Paris, and being determined, one way or other, to be auenged on the Duke of Guise; the chiefe Captaine of the league, and the author of the Barricadoes.

                  <p>In the end hee resolued to ioyne with the league againe and by a new edict set forth in Iuly <hi>Anno,</hi> 1588.<note place="margin">An edict pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> he ratefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the decrees of the leaguers at Nemours which they had made, <hi>Anno</hi> 1585. containing in effect &amp; substance the same things that were afterward decreed in Nancy.</p>

end that nothing might be done in that assemblie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge them. But the Deputies of the Parliament, being for the most part, composed of men that were taken out from among the passionate aduancers of the League, not onely refused to agree to the foresaid petitions, but also ceased not, vntill both from the king himselfe and all the assemblie, they had procured a declaration of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall disabilitie, of the king of Nauarre to the succession of the Crowne.</p>
                  <p>But let vs see what successe followed vpon the death of the Duke of Guise. Two daies after the execution at Bloyes the sixteene Arch-leaguers of Paris, as Furies issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of hell, displaced the choler of their minds against the king, crying out murther, fire and vengeance. They presentlie made a collection of money to maintaine warres; the poorest artificer amongst them was content at least to import six crownes;<note place="margin">The rebellion of the league against the king.</note> gold ranne like a Riuer a long the streetes; they eleuated the Duke of Guise to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and with open mouth spoke euill of the king, detesting his actions, abhorring his life, and accounting the execution done at Bloyse as most cruell, barbarous and inhumane. Many other townes followed the example of Paris, namely Amiens, Dijon, Orleance, Tullose. The Doctors of Sorbon published their decree, importing that the people of Fraunce, were freed and absolued from the oath of fidelitie and obedience made to <hi>Henry</hi> the third; and that the same people might lawfullie and with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science arme and vnite themselues together for defence of the Roman Church against the king or his adherents whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                  <p>The report of those vprores, hastned the dissolution of the Parliament, which was dissolued in Ianuarie, 1589. and the king made for warre to suppresse the rebellious insurrection of the league: and immediatlie hee tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to the towne of Tours such exercises of Iustice, as were accustomed to bee performed in his Court of Parliament of Paris, and depriued Paris with the townes

Now the king was brought to that pinch by the insolencie of the league, that hee behoued to take truce with the king of Nauarre, and to fortifie himselfe with the assistance of his forces, and hee gaue to the king of Nauarre Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure for securitie of his passage ouer Loire, by meanes whereof the king of Nauarre caused all his troupes to passe ouer on this side of Loire, to ioyne with the forces of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, Maine, and other places which attended him with intention to approach the leaguers.</p>

                  <p>In Normandie Duke <hi>Monpensier</hi> with forces for the king, besieged Salaize a Towne that held for the league, and Count <hi>Brissac,</hi> accompanied with two or three hundreth, gentlemen leaguers, and with them fiue or six thousand men came to support the towne.

                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:18150:134"/>The Duke de Maine lay about Arques, from the end of August vntill the midst of September, gayning nothing but losse of his best approoved souldiers, and nine or ten of their Captaines.</p>
                  <p>This first enterprise against the King did truely presage vnto them what successe they were like to haue in all their attempts to come, wherof followed nothing else but shame and sorrow. This done, the King by easie iourneys drew nigh to Paris, and entred by force the suburbs of S. Iaques, and being advertised that the Duke de Maine was come forth of Picardie, and with all his forces had entered into Paris, hee stayed foure long houres in battell, to see if any of the Leaguers would issue out to fight. Afterward hee departed from Paris, and tooke the townes of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosme, and Mans, and Falaize, wherein Count <hi>Brissac</hi> was taken prisoner: also hee recovered Honfleur, a towne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea coast in Normandie, and compelled the Duke de Maine to raise his siege from the towne and fort of Meu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. In the beginning of March, the Duke de Maine with all his forces passed over the bridge of Maule, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight miles from Dreux: whereof the King being advertised, provided for his affaires, and the twelfth of the same moneth, set himselfe on the way to goe against his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.

The next day the battels ioyned neere to the towne of Dreux, wherein the King obtained a great victory, and overthrew all the footmen of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, which were counted to the number of twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men. Onely the Switzers who cast downe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and yeelded to the King, together with the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were mingled amongst them, had their liues spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: also fifteene hundred horsemen of the Leaguers were slaine and drowned, and foure hundred taken prisoners. The Duke de Maine fled towards Dreux, and when he was entred the towne, broke vp the bridge before his owne

people were all come, which was the cause of the death of a great number of his army, especially of the Rutters, of whom a great sort were drowned. In this battell the army had their ioy mixed with sorrow, at the first: for they saw not the King returne, but within a while after, they espyed him comming all stained with the blood of his enemies, not having shed one droppe of his owne (whom they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed onely by the great plume of white fethers, which hee had in his creast, and that which his palfrey had on his head) all the army gaue hearty thankes to God for his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, crying with one voyce, God saue the King.</p>
                  <p>The Duke de Maine and other Captaines of the league being frustrate of their hope, and seeing their army thus spoyled; betooke themselues to their ordinarie shifts, which was to feed the Parisians with fable and lyes: publishing that in the battell they had almost eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this companie the King followed the Duke of Parmaes army, and charged diverse times so roughly, that at one time they lost six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of their number, another time, two thousand and fiue hundred, and so fled shamefully towardes Paris, and from thence to Brie, and last they came to Artoys: where within few moneths the Duke of Parma with his troopes melted, like waxe in the Sunne.

                  <p>In rehearsing the names of the Romane Bishops, I thought meete to follow <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> rather then <hi>Platina.</hi> In the first Centurie after the martyrdome of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Linus, Anacletus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> were teachers of the Romane Church.

that is, to vnmarried men who are promoted to the clergie, we command that if they please they shall marrie, but onely readers and singers, to wit, shall haue this priuiledge. It is an vnsufferable thing to heare such leuitie and inconstancie imputed to the holy Apostles, that they debarred no man from the office of a Bishop, Elder or Deacon, because he was a married man. O but if any man enter vnmarried to be a Bishop, Elder, or Deacon, then hee must not marrie.

Secondly if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> any accusation be intended against Bishop, Elder, or Deacon,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it should be qualified by sufficient probation.

                  <p>The compiler of this supposititious decretal epistle had no consideration of the time wherein <hi>Caius</hi> liued.

They did nothing of intention to grieue the heart of <hi>Demetrius</hi> Bishop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, but onely being carefull of the advancement of the kingdome of God, they endeavoured to strengthen the hands of <hi>Origen,</hi> against the heretickes of Achaia, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring vnto him, the calling of a Presbyter. No man can iustly offend against me, if I cast in this sentence, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon admonition to all Preachers, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Let vs not bee ouer serious in ridiculous matters. The name of <hi>Origen</hi> was so famous, that not onely the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Achaia, sollicited him to come to their bounds for stopping the mouthes of Heretickes, but also hee was sent for at two diverse times to be present at the Councels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in Arabia, against heretickes. Some Heretickes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffirmed that the soules of men perish with their bodies, and are raised vp againe in the day of the resurrection,<note place="margin">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18150:150"/>
was present at the Councell in Arabia, gathered against <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> Bishop of Bostra, who denyed that Christ was existent before his manifestation in the flesh, and by the travelles of <hi>Origen, Berillus</hi> was reclaimed and reduced to the true faith: therefore I reckon him not in the roll of heretickes.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milianus</hi> Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, invited <hi>Origen</hi> to come to Cappadocia, where hee detained him a long time. Likewise <hi>Mammea</hi> the mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Emperour, sent for him, to come to Antiochia, and had him in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent regard. Likewise hee wrote to the Emperour <hi>Philip,</hi> and to his mother, who was the first Emperour that professed the name of Christ.<note place="margin">

No learned man hath commended this fact of <hi>Origen,</hi> so farre as my reading can extend, for if a man might lawfully dismember his own body, to the end hee might liue chastely, why might not a man in like manner cut off his owne hand, to the end he should not in hastie motion of anger kill his neighhour? But the obedience of the commandements of God is seated in the heart, and more commended for voluntary subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then for necessity of abstinence of committing evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is not an instument in the body able to commit transgression.</p>

For which opinions, long after his death he was excommunicate in the fift generall Councell, holden <hi>Anno,</hi> 551. Concerning his weakenesse in offering to Idols, rather then to suffer his chaste body to be abused, I haue spoken in the historie of the seventh persecution.

This was done in the Councell of Tyrus, to the perpetuall shame of the Arrians, who subborned an harlot to accuse the faithfull servant of Christ without a cause.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they accused him for this, that hee had cut off the hand of <hi>Arsenius,</hi> sometime his owne servant: and for greater evidence, they produced in the Councell of Tyrus before the Iudges, the hand of a man inclosed in a case: which hand they affirmed that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had cut off from <hi>Arsenius.</hi> This they spake the more confidently, because they supposed that <hi>Arsenius</hi> remayned still kept in their own custodie:<note place="margin">

                     </note> but by the providence of God hee escaped, came to Tyrus, and was presented before the Councell, having both his hands perfect, sound, and vnmutilated. After this the Councell was full of confusion, for the Arrians cryed, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> by magicke arts deluded the senses of men: and they were purposed, by violence and force to lay hands vpon him, and to teare him in pieces: but he fled by a ship, and came to Constantinople, where the Emperour was, as shall bee declared, God willing.

Hee is bold to affirme in a certaine Epistle written to <hi>Leo</hi> Bishop of Rome, that by his trauailes a thousand soules within his bounds were reclaimed from the heresie of <hi>Marcion.</hi> Hee fell into many lamentable troubles. The ground of all was the extraordinarie loue he carried toward his owne Patriarch <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of Antiochia. For like as hee accompanied him to the Councell of Ephesus, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hee concurred with him in the deposition of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Bishop of Alexandria, and <hi>Memnon</hi> Bishop of Ephesus: but the Councell gathered at Ephesus tooke triall in the cause of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and <hi>Memnon,</hi> and absolued them, and damned <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of Antiochia, and his complices. <hi>Theodoritus</hi> was one of the number. The second trouble followed vpon the necke of the first: for by instigation of patriarch <hi>Iohn,</hi> hee wrote against the twelue heades or twelue Theses of <hi>Cyril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> written against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> wherein he mistaketh the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Cyrillus, as if hee had fallen into the errour of <hi>Apollinaris</hi>: but after that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> wrote a declaration of his owne meaning, it was found that both <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and <hi>Theodoritus</hi> professed one faith, and they were reconciled.

And finally after his death in the fift general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, his writings against the twelue heades of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> were damned.

The Emperour troubled with the noueltie of the question, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with <hi>Sergius</hi> B. of Constantinople, who returned this answere to the Emperour, that one will and one operation was to be acknowledged in Christ. The Emperour <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi> being circumvented by false and deceitfull teachers, was ashamed to forsake that opinion, which he had once condiscended vnto. So this heresie of the Monothelites tooke deepe roote in the East, vntill the time that God, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the contempt of his truth, suffered the Saracenes, with their blasphemous <hi>Mahometan</hi> doctrine to be vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally ouer-spred in the East.</p>

                  <p>To him succeeded <hi>Anastatius,</hi> who albeit hee disliked Images, yet hee was vnthankfull to the Emperour, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the seditious attempts of the people of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, who advanced <hi>Artabasdus</hi> to the Imperiall dignity. Moreover, hee slandered the Emperour, as if hee had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against the divinity of Christ. Hee received a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his vnthankefulnesse: for he was deposed, and scourged, and set vpon an Asse, with his face towards the Asses tayle, and made a ridiculous spectacle to the people.</p>
                  <p>After him, <hi>Constantine</hi> a Monke, was made Patriarch, who at the first seemed to condemne Images: but afterward hee was found to bee a maintayner and allower of them. The Emperour banished him to Iberia, where hee spake contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliously both of the Emperour, and of the Councell holden at Constantinople: therefore he was brought back againe from banishment, and was beheaded, and his body was drawn through the town with a cord, and cast into a pit, where the bodies of malefactors were accustomed to be cast.</p>

In speciall, hee condemned the worshipping of the crosse: affirming, that if it should be worshipped, because Iesus died vpon it: then the Ship, in the which Christ sayled, the Asse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Christ did ride into Ierusalem, &amp; infinit things, which Christ touched, by the like reason, ought also to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.

                  <p>IN this age the armie of Christians which went to fight against the Turkes, conquered out of their hands, not onely Ierusalem, but also Antiochia, and the region round about it. Whereupon it followed that the Patriarchs were established of new againe after long intermission in Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia and Ierusalem. Not such as were accustomed to be of olde, hauing equall power with other Patriarchs within their owne bounds, but rather vassals and slaues to the Bishoppes of Rome, as may appeare by the Catalogue following.</p>
                  <p>The first of these Latine Patriarchs was <hi>Bernardus</hi> who ruled that church thirtie sixe yeeres.<note place="margin">

Notwithstanding of all this, hee was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Aduersaries to appeare before the Bishoppe of Rome: and to answere to the faults that should be obiected against him.

                     <hi>Arnulphus</hi> was an eloquent man, and a mighty preacher, who reprooved the Clergie of Rome, for the lewdnesse of their conversation. Wherefore the Clergie hated him, and drowned him secretly in the night time, as hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the historie of the life of <hi>Honorius</hi> the second. At this time was set forth a booke called <hi>Opus Tripartitum: Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus</hi> was supposed to bee the Author thereof. It contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an heavie complaint of the enormities and abuses of the Church, of the number of their holy-dayes, and all lusts of vncleannesse, according to the saying of whores and naughty women, who bragged that they gained more in one day, then in fifty other dayes. Likewise it complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the curious singing in Cathedrall Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

many are occasioned to spend much time in singing, which might bee better spent in more necessarie sciences. It also complained of the rabble and multitude of begging Fryers, shewing what idlenesse and vncomely behaviour, hath proceeded thereof. Also it toucheth the vnchaste and voluptuous behaviour of Church men, aggravating their faults by the similitude of storks, who are accustomed to beate those storkes out of their number, that having a mate ioyne themselues vnto another:<note place="margin">

This <hi>Vualdus</hi> being one of the company, and a rich man, beholding the matter more earnestly then the rest, was touched with a deepe and earnest repentance, whereupon followed a carefull study to reforme his former life: in so much that hee first begun to distribute large almes to the poore, and to instruct his familie in the knowledge of the Word of God, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all them who resorted vnto him to repentance, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.</p>

whom the Emperour <hi>Lotharius</hi> 2. sent to <hi>Calowannes</hi> Emp. of Constantinople. Hee disputed with <hi>Nichetes</hi> Bishop of Nicomedia,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anselmus</hi> his disputations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Nichetes.</hi>
                     </note> in the temple of Sophia, about the old error of the Grecians, who affirmed that the holy Spirit proceeded onely from the Father, and not from the Sonne. Hee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very learnedly, the obiections of <hi>Nichetes,</hi> who obiected that two fountaines and beginnings were set vp in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, if the holy Spirit proceeded both from the Father and the Sonne. Wherevnto <hi>Anselmus</hi> answered, that when the Councell of Nice sayd,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Deus de Deo, lumen de lumine</hi>: They established not two Gods, nor two lights in the Trinitie. Euen so, when it is sayd, <hi>Principium de principio,</hi> there is not brought in two beginnings, but one only. And whosoever (saith he) denyeth that the holy Spirit proceedeth from the Son,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.21.</note> denyeth also that he proceedeth from the Father. For the Scripture saith, I and the Father are one, I am in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Father in me: and againe, Hee that seeth mee seeth the Father.</p>
                  <p>From this argument they went to another, concerning the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome. <hi>Anselmus</hi> prooved the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome by three arguments. 1. Because the Councell of Nice had preferred the chaire of Rome, to all other chaires, 2. Because Christ assigned superiority to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.19</note> when hee sayd, Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Rocke will I build my Church: and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it. And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt binde on earth, is bound in heauen, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. 3. The chaire of Rome was free of heresies, when Constantinople and other Churches of the East were defiled with heresie.</p>
                  <p>To the first argument <hi>Nichetes</hi> answered, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice called the Bishop of Rome, the Bishop of the principall chaire, but not the principall Bishop, for that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie hee received from the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> but not from the Councell of Nice. To the second argument, he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the power of binding and loosing was not given
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:18150:225"/>
to <hi>Peter</hi> onely, but also to all the rest of the Apostles. And like as they were all partakers of that same heavenly grace,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was partaker in the day of Pentecost: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they all received that selfe same power of binding and loosing. And <hi>Peter</hi> alone received not the power, like as he received not the grace alone. Thirdly, whereas it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Romane Church remained vnspotted with heresie, when as other Churches were defiled with it, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetes</hi> answered, that it was true, that <hi>Arrius, Macedonius, Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutiches,</hi> did spring vp among the Grecians, and they likewise were chiefly refuted and suppressed by the the Grecians. And the fountaine of all heresies being hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Philosophie, it was no marvell that greatest heresies sprung vp, where men of greatest learning and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing were found, and it is likely that the fewer heresies sprung vp in the West, because they were men of lesse learning, and not of so deepe vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the people of the East.</p>

                  <p>Therefore hee to whom the whole definition of an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike doth agree, hee is a verie heretike.

                  <p>When this Bull of the Popes indulgences was come to Prague: <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> and his fellowes not able to abide the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie of those pardons began manifestly to speake against them. And albeit <hi>Winceslaus</hi> king of Bohemia who then fauoured the Pope gaue out strict commaundement that no man should speake against those indulgences, yet of <hi>Iohn Husses</hi> companie were found three Artificers, who hearing the Priest speaking of the forsaid indulgences did openly speake against them, calling the Pope the Antichrist; wherefore they were brought before the Senate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prison.</p>
                  <p>But the people ioyning themselues in armes required them to be let loose. The magistrates one the other part albeit they satisfied the people with gentle wordes and faire promises for a time, yet when the tumult was asswaged they sent to the prison, and secretlie beheaded the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said artificers: whose names were <hi>Iohn, Martine,</hi> and <hi>Staston.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people hearing of this, tooke their dead bodies and with great solemnitie buried them in the Church of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem, at whose funerall, diuers Priests fauouring that side did sing thus.</p>

                  <p>The Prelats and greatest part of the Clergie, and most of the Barons who had any thing to lose, did hold with the Pope, especially <hi>Steuen Pallats</hi> being chiefest doer of that side. On the contrarie part the communes with part of the clergie and students of the vniuersitie went with <hi>Iohn Husse. Winceslaus</hi> the king fearing lest this should grow to a tumult, being moued by the Doctors, and Prelats, and Counsell of his Barons, thought best to remoue <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> out of the citie, who had beene excommunicated before by the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The people on the other part began mightilie to grudge and to cry out against the Prelats and Priests, who were the workers hereof, accusing them to be Simonits, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, whoremasters, adulterers, proud, not sparing also to lay ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their vices to their great ignominie &amp; shame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it came to passe that the king seeing the inclination of the people, being also not ignorant of the wickednesse of the Clergie, vnder pretence to reforme the Church, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great exactions from such Priests &amp; men of the clergie as were accused, &amp; knowne to be wicked liuers. And thus the Popish clergie while they went about to persecute <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> were intrapped themselues in great tribulation, brought in contempt, and hated of all men.</p>
                  <p>At this time were three Popes raigning together, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof a generall Councell was ordained and holden at Constance in the yeere of our Lord 1413.

And when he was brought forth to the Councell there befell a strange and shamefull matter, for his aduersaries had scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly read one article, and brought forth a few witnesses of the same, against him, but as he was about to open his mouth to answere, all that were about him began so to cry out, that he had no leasure to speake a word.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> by reason of the noyse could not be heard.</note> The noise and trouble was so great and vehement, that a man might well haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it a noyse of wilde beastes &amp; not of men, much lesse was it like a congregation of men gathered together to iudge and determine so graue and weightie matters.

                        <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by the Emperour to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the Councell.

                  <p>The day after which was the eight of Iune, he was brought out againe to the same place, and in his presence there were read thirtie nine Articles, the which they said were drawne out of his bookes, which were iudged by the councell to be hereticall, and hee of new againe was required by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to submit himselfe to the councell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> answered that hee would not maintaine any opinion with obstinate minde, but if the Councell would instruct him clearlie that any of his Articles were repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the holy scriptures of God, he would renounce and forsake the same, affirming also most constantlie that the most part of all those thinges that were alledged against him were falsly forged, and neuer thought nor vttered by him: when they saw that by no exhortation <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> could be moued to acknowledge his doctrine to be erro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eous, &amp; to recant the same, vpon the sixt day of Iulie he was brought to the head church of the citie of Constance, &amp; there in presence of the Emperour and councell was degraded of all Priestly orders and dignities, and a definitiue sentence was giuen out against him wherein hee was condemned as an heretike, for that hee
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:18150:245"/>
preached and openly defended the articles of <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> which were condemned by the Church of Rome, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had appealed to the Lord Iesus Christ, as the most high Iudge, which appellation they counted a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Apostolique Sea, and the Ecclesiasticall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Keyes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burnt as an Heretique.</note> After this hee was put into the Secular Iudges hands to be burnt as an Heretique, having vpon his head a crowne of paper, with vgly pictures of divels pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereupon. Which rebuke, as also the torment of fire, hee most patiently sustained, with Psalmes and spirituall Songs, lauding God vntill the winde droue the fire vpon his face, and choaked his breath. And after his bodie was consumed with fire, they cast the ashes of the burnt body into the river of Rhene. Thus died <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> the faithfull Martyr of God, the sixt of Iuly, 1516. Now while as <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> had beene lying in prison, and so hardly handled, his faithfull companion <hi>Ierom</hi> of Prague, came to <hi>Constance</hi> the fourth day of Aprill <hi>anno</hi> 1415. who there perceiving that <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was denyed to be heard, and that watch was layed for him on every side, hee departed to Iberling a Citie of the Empire, a mile distant from Constance, and from thence caused a letter to be directed to the Councell,<note place="margin">

But when hee saw that through such intimations, being set vp, as is before sayd, hee could haue no safe conduct, hee thought meete to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe to Bohemia, taking with him the letters patents of the Lords of Bohemia that were at Constan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:18150:246"/>
almost to the death. But after he was recovered, and <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was already put to death, they brought forth Master <hi>Ierome,</hi> whom they had long kept in chaines in the Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and threatning him with death, being instant vpon him,<note place="margin">Recanteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compelled thereunto.</note> they forced him to abiure and recant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto the death of Master <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> that hee was iustly condemned and put to death by them. Neverthelesse, his enemies perceiving that this abiuration was not made sincerely from his heart, but onely for feare to escape their hands, they gaue in new accusations against him. And in the yeere of our Lord, 1416. the 25. day of May, the sayd Master <hi>Iereme</hi> was brought forth vnto open audience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole generall Councell, vnto the great cathedrall Church of Constance. Where many things were layd to his charge that day, as likewise the third day after (which was another Diet assigned to him for answering) where hee refuted his adversaries with such eloquence and wisdome, that the hearts of all the Fathers of the councell were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velously bent and mooved to mercy toward him. But in the end hee entered to the praise of <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and <hi>Hus.</hi>
                     </note> and affirmed that whatsoever <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> had holden and written specially against the pompe and pride of the Clergie, hee would affirme even to the death. And likewise hee added, that of all the sinnes that ever hee had committed, the sinne of his recantation did most grievously gnaw and trouble his conscience, especially in consenting to the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of that good and holy man, <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> which fault as hee did it through weakenesse of faith, and feare of death; so did hee vtterly deny and revoke that wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation.</p>
                  <p>After this, hee was led away againe to prison: and the Saturday before the ascention day, hee was brought to the Cathedral Church before the Congregation, where the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his condemnation was given out against him, and a paper with pictures of red divels was brought to bee put vpon his head, which hee himselfe receiving, put it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, saying; Our Lord Iesus Christ when hee suffered

                  <p>In all his teaching he desired to teach none other thing, but the onely pure and simple word of God: making often protestation, that all men should certifie him if they had heard him teach or preach any thing contrary thereunto. For in his owne conscience,<note place="margin">

                     </note> of whom some he banished, others hee caused to be impoysoned, and cruelly slaine.</p>
                  <p>In his time <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, King of France, clayming right to the Kingdome of Naples, entred into Italy with a mighty army, and without great resistance, came to the towne of Rome, and from thence to Naples. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of Naples, at this time finding himselfe to be hated of all men, had denuded himselfe of the Kingdome, and given it to his sonne <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and hee himselfe was fled into Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie.

                        <hi>Charles</hi> King of France con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth the Kingdome of Naples.</note> was likewise compelled to flie to the little Island of Istria, for safety of his life: and the whole kingdome of Naples was in short time ouer-run, and subdued to the King of France.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:18150:249"/>This victorious conquest so hastily atchieved, made the name of <hi>Charles</hi> to be terrible to other Princes, even to the Duke of Millan, and Estate of Venice, who had beene his confederate friends, &amp; assisters in this warfare. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, fearing lest his increasing power should in time be the overthrow of their Estates, they conspired with the Pope, and the Emperour, and the King of Spaine against him: and as hee returned backe againe to France, fought against him at Fornovo, not farre distant from the towne of Parma. The victory was vncertaine: notwithstanding <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Naples,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ferdinand</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth the kingdome of Naples.</note> was so encouraged with this encounter, that hee recovered againe all his kingdome which hee had lost.</p>
                  <p>Likewise in this Popes time, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, came into Italy, claiming right not onely to the kingdome of Naples, but also to the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Millan. He had before bound vp a covenant with the Pope, the King of Spaine, and the Venetians vpon these conditions that having possessed himselfe first in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Millan,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lewis</hi> King of France, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Millan.</note> hee should give Cremona a famous towne in the Dukedome of Millan, to the Venetians: and hee should assist <hi>Caesar Borgia</hi> Duke of Valentinois, and sonne to Pope Alexander the sixt, to eiect out of Romagna the Lords presently bearing sway in that Countrey; to the end, that all might come vnder the Soveraignty and commandement of this Duke of Valentinois only: and finally, that he should divide the Kingdome of Naples, betwixt himselfe and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> King of Spaine. Vpon these conditions, was King <hi>Lewis</hi> assisted by the Pope, the King of Spaine, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Venice; and so with little adoe obtained the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Millan, and carryed away <hi>Lodovick Sforce</hi> Duke of Millan, with his brother <hi>Askanius,</hi> captiues and prisoners to France.</p>
                  <p>This Pope as hee was fraughted with many great faults in his owne person,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, a favourer of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens vices.</note> so is he likewise noted to haue beene a fosterer of the wicked vices and villanous behaviour of his children: namely, of <hi>Caesar Borgia</hi> his sonne, who not only

cast off his Religious apparrell, and became of a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall a Duke and warriour, but also most vnnaturally slew his owne elder brother Duke of Gandia, and became cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and leader of his fathers armie in his brothers place.</p>
                  <p>Also the vilde conversation of <hi>Lucretia</hi> his Daughter, and her familiar conversation both with her father and brethren, maketh this Pope to be more famous for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse then many other.<note place="margin">The iust iudgement of God vpon the Pope in his death.</note> His end in the righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God answered well vnto his life, for as hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied the liues of many by poyson, so vpon a certaine time through the ouersight of the Butler the empoysoned wine, that was prepared for to destroy the liues of some Cardinals who were bidden to the banquet, was put in the hands of the Pope and his sonne Duke of Valentinois. The Pope immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie thereafter died, and the Duke although he vsed manie conterpoysons and other remedies, yet fell he into a sharpe and dangerous disease, and carried about all his time the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that nights banquet.</p>

                  <p>After him followed <hi>Iulius</hi> the second,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iulius</hi> 2.</note> and ruled nine yeeres, and a eleuen months: hee was a sharpe warriour and not onely recouered from the Venetians the townes of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minuim, Faventia,<note place="margin">He warreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny townes from them.</note> and Ravenna, which townes belonged to the Church, but also by cursing them &amp; making a couenant with <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour and the king of France and Spaine in Cambrey against the Venetians, he brought them so low that in short time they were spoyled of all the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they had by land in Italie. For Verona, Vicentia, and Padua, and the territories of Carinthia, were alloted to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, also Bergama, Brixia, Cremona, and Crema, were possessed by <hi>Lewis</hi> king of Fraunce, also the townes of Tranmu, Monopolis, and Barletta in Apulia, were giuen ouer to the king of Spaine.

                  <p>But the Pope on the other part to frustrate all the attempts of his adversaries, appointed a generall Councell to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Rome in the Church of Lateran, wherein all things that were done in the Councell of Pisa were disanulled and abrogated. Also he stirred vp the kings of Spaine and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to make warre against the king of France, and the Pope with the Venetians and Switzers ioyned their forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eiect him out of Italie.</p>

But when hee perceiued that his trauells availed nothing, and fearing the power of his aduersaries, hee fell sicke and died; in the verie time of the Councell of Lateran which was begunne vnder Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> and ended vnder <hi>Leo</hi> 10. his successour.

This errour <hi>Epiphanius</hi> abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for many great absurdities.

First, to finish the work they had begun, in the fift Councell of Carthage, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heresies of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Coelestius,</hi> by whom, as yet, many were deceiued, and perverted from the true faith. <hi>Augustine</hi> Bishop of Hippo, was not onely present, but also President.

               <p>The other cause of the meeting of this Councell, was to constitute canons concerning Ecclesiasticall discipline, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that no man should make appellation from his owne
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:18150:294"/>
Bishop to Bishops beyond Sea, but in case his owne Bishop did him wrong,<note place="margin">Canon 22.</note> then hee should appeale vnto an assembly of African Bishops, but hee who would needes appeare to Bishoppes beyond Sea (meaning chiefly of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome) let him be secluded from the communion of all African Bishops. The cause of <hi>Apiarius,</hi> and his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Vrbanus Siccensis</hi> seemed already to bee wakened, and the Fathers of this Councell fore-smelled that he was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the Bishop of Rome; like as he did indeed, to <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symus</hi> the successor of <hi>Innocentius</hi>: and therefore, like wise men in due time, they made this constitution. <hi>Innocentius</hi> received the Councels letter from a brother named <hi>Iulius,</hi> and approoved the condemnatory sentence, pronunced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Coelestius</hi>: but marke the words of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> letter, <hi>Frater, &amp; Coepiscopus noster Iulius dilectionis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straeliteras, quas ex Milevitano cura fide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Councell was assembled in Carthage: two hundred and seventeene bishops were present at this Councell,<note place="margin">

Three Bishops of Rome, to wit, <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>symus, Bonifacius</hi> the first, and <hi>Coelestinus,</hi> endevoured with all their might to perswade the African Bishops, that they were vnder the soueraignty and iurisdiction of the Bishops of Rome: but all in vaine, as the issue of this Councell will proue. The ground of the great controversie betwixt the Bishops of Rome, and the sixt Councell of Carthage, was <hi>Apiarius Presbyter Siccencis,</hi> a wicked man, and iustly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, not onely by his owne Bishoppe <hi>Vrbanus,</hi> but also by a Synode of other neere approaching Bishops. Hee appealed to <hi>Zosymus</hi> Bishop of Rome, a Citie of refuge to all villanous men, as appeared by the insolent forme of his cariage, toward his brethren in Africke: for before hee had heard the causes wherefore they had excommunicated this wicked man <hi>Apiarius,</hi> hee absolued him, and admitted him to his communion. Moreover, vnderstanding that a Councell was to be convened in Carthage, hee sent thither Ambassadours to plead the cause of <hi>Apiarius,</hi> to procure the excommunication of <hi>Vrbanus</hi>; and in case this succeeded not, to desire that this question might be remitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Romane Bishop, as vndoubted Iudge of appellations, according to an act of the Councell of Nice. The Fathers of the Councell of Carthage answered with great modesty that they knew no such act, to haue beene made in the Councell of Nice. Alwayes time is granted to the Bishop of Rome, to prooue that such right belongeth to him by an act, of the Councell of Nice. <hi>Zosymus</hi> the first alleadger of this false act,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Soc. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> continued short time in office: for hee ended his course within the space of one yeere, and few moneths. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the successor of <hi>Zosymus,</hi> seriously vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the same prerogatiue, to be iudges in all causes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, according to the act of the Councell of Nice. When all the acts were read, both in the Latine and Greeke exemplars, and no such act was found, the Ambassadors
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:18150:295"/>
of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> returned to him with this answer, that the principall Registers ought to bee searched, which were to bee found in Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antiochia: and in the meane time no man should bee challenged for appealing to the Bishoppe of Rome, vntill this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had an end, by viewing of the authentique Registers. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Bishop of Alexandria, and <hi>Atticus</hi> Bishop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, sent to the Councell of Carthage, the iust co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the acts of the Councell of Nice: but no such act was found,<note place="margin">

The principall causes of this meeting are expresly set downe by <hi>Euagrius</hi> lib. 4. cap. 38. First in respect of the controuersie betwixt <hi>Eustochius</hi> B. of Ierusalem, and <hi>Theodorus Ascidas</hi> B. of Caesarea Cappadocia: <hi>Eustochius</hi> cast out the Monkes of Nova Laura, who obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended the errours of <hi>Origen. Theodorus Ascidas</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted them, and said, that <hi>Eustochius</hi> Bishop of Ierusalem had dealt cruelly, and inhumanely with his brethren; to pacifie this controuersie was this Councell conueened: Also great disputation was in the Church about the bookes of <hi>Origen,</hi> of <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of Mopsuesta, and some writings of <hi>Theodoritus</hi> Bishop of Cyrus, and <hi>Ibas</hi> Bishop of Edessa: this was the second cause of this great conuention to put an ende vnto these contentious disputations. At this time <hi>Menas</hi> was Bishop of Constantinople, but he ended his life in the very time of the generall Councel. The first question mooued in the Councel was this: Whether or no, men who were dead, and had ended their course, might lawfully be cursed and
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:18150:301"/>
excommunicated. To this <hi>Eutychius</hi> (a man before this time of no great account) answered:<note place="margin">2. Reg. 23. vers. 16.</note> That like as <hi>Iosias</hi> not onely punished Idolatrous Priestes who were aliue, but also opened the graues of them who were dead, to dishonour them after their death, who had dishonoured God in their life-time: euen so the memorialls of men might be accursed after their death, who had harmed Christes Church in their life-time.<note place="margin">

The generall conuention tooke this effect, That the writings of <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of Mopsuesta were vtterly condemned, and the replyes of <hi>Theodoretus</hi> to the 12. heades of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> with the letter of <hi>Ibas</hi> written to <hi>Maris</hi> a Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were damned. Finally the errours of <hi>Origen</hi> were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; <hi>Theodorus Ascidas,</hi> together with the Monks of Nova Laura, who defended the errours of <hi>Origen,</hi> all were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and the 4. preceeding generall Councels were confirmed with full allowance. The Councell of Mopsuesta immediatly following, tended onely to this, to know when the name of <hi>Theodorus</hi> sometime B. of Mopsuesta a towne of Cilicia, was razed out of the roll called <hi>sacra diptycha.</hi> And the ancients both of Clergie and people, assured the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> that the name of <hi>Theodorus</hi> was razed out of the rol of holy Bishops before their time.</p>

                  </gap>, which was a branch of the heresie of <hi>Eutyches</hi>: secondly, for decision of questions, which arose amongst Bishops, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the marches &amp; bounds of their dioceses, with some other Ecclesiasticall causes.

               </p>
               <p>In the first action <hi>Theodulphus</hi> Bishop of Malaca, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that by iniury of warres an ancient parish Church was separated from his towne, and possessed by others. It was concluded, that he should be repossessed againe into his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient priviledges, and that prescription of time should haue no place, if it were knowne, that hostility and war-fare had hurt a man in his rights.</p>
               <p>In the 2. Session, the controversie betwixt <hi>Fulgentius</hi> B. of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Astigita, and <hi>Honorius</hi> B. of Corduba, concerning the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their dioceses, was debated: and men were chosen to visite the bounds, and to decide the controuersie.</p>

It was ordained, that whosoever fled from his owne Church vnto another, should be sent back againe, and be put into a Monastery, &amp; should be devested of his honor for a time, to the end, that the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of discipline might correct the licentious liberty of vagring and wandering.</p>
               <p>In the 4. Session, it was complained, that some were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to bee Levites in the Church of Astigita, who had

maried widowes: This ordination was annulled; and it was ordained, that none of these Leuites should be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the honor of a Deacon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> In the 5. Session, a Deacon of the Church of Agabra com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the ordination of three persons in that Church: one was ordained to bee Presbyter, and two to bee Levites. The Bishop being blind, laid his hands vpon them, but one of the Presbyters pronounced the blessing: Now the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter who had pronounced the blessing, was dead before the Councell of Hispalis, therefore they remitted him to his owne Iudge: but the three persons afore-said admitted to Church-offices, they deposed them from their offices, as persons vnlawfully admitted.</p>

For remedy, that the like mis-order should haue no place in time to come, it was statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; ordained, that a Bishop, without advice of his Synode, should not presume to depose a Presbyter.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The 8. Session intreated concerning <hi>Heliseus,</hi> a servant, whom the Bishop of Agabra had set at liberty, and hee on the other part abused his liberty, so farre, that he presumed by Magicall Art to cut off the Bshoppe who had beene so beneficiall vnto him: he was ordained to be redacted againe to his former servile estate, that hee might learne obedience to his superiours, by the heavie yoke of servile subiection.</p>

                  <pb n="599" facs="tcp:18150:307"/>In the ninth Session, it is forbidden, that Bishops should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> haue Leke-men to be masters of their house, but onely some of their owne Clergie, should be dispensators of their hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold affaires,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.10.</note> because it is written, <hi>Thou shalt not plow with an Oxe and an Asse together.</hi> By the way marke, that nothing was so miserably abused at this time, as testimonies of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>In the tenth Session, the Monasteries lately builded in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the Baetike Province, were allowed, and confirmed.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh Session, the Monasteries of Virgins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> to the over-sight of the Abbot governing the Monastery of Monkes, with caveats, that all appearance of evill should be providently eschewed.</p>
               <p>In the twelfth Session, one professing the heresie of <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phali</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> compeared, who denyed the distinction of two natures in Christ, and affirmed, that the divinity of Christ did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vpon the Crosse: but he was seriously dealt withall, and convicted by testimonies of holy Scripture, and Fathers: so that hee renounced his hereticall opinion, and embraced the true faith; and the whole Councell gaue thankes and praise vnto God, for conuersion.</p>
               <p>In the thirteenth Session, there is a prolix refutation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> the opinion of those who supposed, that the two natures of Christ were confounded, and that the divinity suffered. <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> seemeth to be the compiler of this Treatise, against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephali,</hi> given into the Councell of Hispalis: and many do thinke,<note place="margin">

In the end, prayers are made to God to giue a good successe to their meeting: and thankes are giuen to the King, by whose authoritie they were assembled.

                  <item>3. A Presbyter, when he sayeth masse, let him bee cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with his Orarium on both his shoulders, and be signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his brest, with the signe of the Crosse.</item>
                  <item>4. Let no person of the Clergy cohabit with women, no not with their owne sisters, without witnesses of their conversation.</item>
                  <item>5. Vpon Festivall dayes, reliques enclosed in an Arke, shal be borne vpon the shoulders of the Levites, as the Arke of God in the old Testament was accustomed to bee borne,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:18150:318"/>
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.15. and not about the necke of a Bishop: and in case the Bishop will needs carry them himselfe, then shall he walke on foot with the rest of the people, and not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in a coach by his Deacons. Here marke how mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are equalled to the commandements of God.</item>
                  <item>6. Presbyters, Abbots, and Levites, for the dignity of their calling, shall not bee punished with stripes by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe, lest in dispersoning the principall members of his owne body, hee bring himselfe into contempt of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.</item>

               <p>This Councell made no Canons and Constitutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Church-discipline, as other Councels had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: For this cause <hi>Iustinian</hi> the 2. the son of <hi>Pogenatus,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered these same Fathers, who had beene in the preceding Councel, to perfect the worke which they had begun.</p>
               <p>They made many Constitutions, but two in special, which displeased the Romane Church: First, they annulled the doctrine of the Church of Rome, concerning prohibition of marriage to men in spirituall offices. Secondly, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Patriarch of Constantinople, to bee in equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Pope of Rome.

               <p>In this Councell it was forbidden, that new Bishoprickes should be erected in villages: and the Bishop of Emerita beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged pardon for this, that he had ordayned a Bishop in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine village, being compelled so to doe, by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King <hi>Bambas.</hi> They who stand at the Altar, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth, are commanded to eate of the sacrifice, as often as they offer it.

The purposes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in this Councell were two; to wit, concerning the adoration of Images, and prohibition of marriage to men in spirituall offices. About worshipping of Images no dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was heard, whether that service did agree with the written word of God, or not. This was counted a sufficient wartant for bringing Images into places of adoration, and for worshipping them (especially the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) that <hi>Eguvinus,</hi> a superstitious Monke in England, of the order of Saint <hi>Benet,</hi> who afterwards was made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe: affirmed that the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> appeared vnto him in a dreame, and declared, that it was her will, that her Image should bee set vp in the Churches, and worshipped.

               <p>The other purpose entreated in this Councell, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of marriage, to men in spirituall offices.

Secondly, because the divine and humane nature being vnseparably vnited in Christ, and the divine nature cannot be presented by an Image: therefore it is not meete to represent his humane nature by an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, left we should seeme to separate the two natures in Christ.

The Epistle of <hi>Adrian</hi> Bishop of Rome, was openly read in the Councell, approuing the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of images.

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, King of France, assembled a great Councell at Frankford: partlie in regard of the heretike <hi>Foelix,</hi> who called Christ the adoptiue Sonne of God in his humane nature, and was condemned in a Councell assembled at Ratisbona, <hi>Anno.</hi> 742. but hee was returned to his vomite againe: and therefore was of new againe condemned, as a notable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, in the Councell of Frankford: partly also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the great disputation that arose euerie where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worshipping of images, disallowed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Constantinople, and allowed in the second Councell of Nice.</p>
               <p>Not onely the Bishops of France, but also of Germanie &amp; Lombardie, as Prouinces subdued to the King of France, were present at this Councell.

And <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe, King of France, was present in the Councel of Frankford.

<pb n="630" facs="tcp:18150:323"/>
and allowance vnto the same. But the Fathers of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell collationed the actes of the Councell of Constantinople, with the actes of the second Councell of Nice. And they disallowed in the Councell of Constantinople the strict prohibition to picture images, either in Temples of other places. And in the second Councell of Nice they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed the Act of worshipping of images, and of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with garments, incense, candles, and kneeling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: counting the afore-saide Act to be so impious, that the Councell in the which it was concluded, was neither worthy to be called Catholicke nor Oecumenicke. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whereby the second Councell of Nice endeuoured to approue the adoration of images, are all refuted in the Councell of Frankford, as I haue declared alreadie in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise concerning worshipping of Images.</p>
               <p>Concerning the argument taken from the authoritie of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who in his book called Panarium, reckoneth not the worshippers of images in the roll of Heretikes: it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by the Councel of Frankford, that in case <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had counted the haters of the worshippers of images, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes; hee had likewise inserted their names in the catalogue of Heretikes: but seeing he hath not so done, the Councell of Nice had no just cause to triumph so much in this friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous argument, which maketh more against them, than it maketh for them.</p>
               <p>More-ouer, in the Councell of Frankford, the Epistle of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> written to <hi>Ihonne</hi> Bishop of Ierusalem, was read; wherein hee disalloweth the verie bringing in of images into Churches: and this Epistle was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of the Greeke into Latine language, by <hi>Ierom.</hi> The Epistle is worthie to be read.

After three dayes abstinence and fasting, joyned with Litanies, publicke Prayers, and imploring the helpe of God, they diuided themselues into three companies: In the first company were the Bishops, with some Noters, reading the history of the Euangell, and the Epistles, and the Actes of the Apostles, together with the Canons and workes of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, and the Pastorals booke of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to the ende that by the Preceptes contained in these bookes, the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of mens liues might be corrected. In the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie were Abbots and Monkes, reading the rules of S. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> for the reformation of the liues of Monkes. In the third company were Lords and Iudges, pondering the causes of all men, who came to complaine, that wrong was done vnto them.</p>
               <p>The 1.2. and 3. Canons of this Councell, intreat concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Faith, Hope, and Charitie. 4. Concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be ministred chiefly at Easter and Whitsonday, except necessitie &amp; feare of death require preuening of these times. 5. That vnitie and concord should bee kept in the Church, because we haue one common Father in heauen: one Mother, to wit, the Church in earth: one Faith, one Baptisme, and one Celestiall inheritance prepared for vs: Yea, and God is not the God of dissention, but
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:18150:324"/>
of peace, according as it is said, <hi>Blessed be the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.</hi> The sixt and seuenth Canons, intreat of Orphanes, and poore people, whose weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to be supported: but no man should take vantage of their poore and desolate estate. The eight Canon recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnitie to be kept betwixt men in spirituall offices, and ciuill Iudges: a Canon indeede, if it had beene obserued, verie necessarie for the estate of this time. The ninth &amp; tenth Canon, prescribeth to the Clergie, Preceptes of a modest and sober life, with abstinence from the delicate pleasures of the world, and from Theatricall Spectacles, from pompes, and vnhonest banquets: and to bee more readie to goe to the house of mourning, to comfort them who are heauie hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than to the house of banquetting. Vsurie, auarice, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and taking of rewardes, for the benefites of God, such as vse to be taken for medicinall cures, is forbidden. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of deceit and conjurations: to flee hatred, emulation, backe-biting, and enuying, wandering eyes, and an vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled tongue: a petulant, and proude gesture are forbidden: filthie words, and workes, are altogether abhorred: chastitie is recommended: the frequent visitations of the houses of Widowes, and Virgines, is prohibited: due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to bee giuen to Seniors: to take heede to doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, reading, and spirituall songes; as it becommeth men, who haue addicted themselues vnto diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>Precepts, concerning the behauiour of Monkes &amp; Nunnes, and the fabricke of their dwelling places, I ouer-passe with silence, left I should ouercharge a short Compend with an heape of vnnecessarie thinges.</p>

The great Litanie or Rogations, to bee obserued three dayes, by all Christians, with fasting, fackecloath, ashes, walking barefooted, and all kinde of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage. 34.35. and 36.

Let no ancient Church be spoyled of tythes and possessions, for the building of new Oratories. 42. Concerning Church-rentes bestowed for reparation and vpholding of Churches. 43. and 44. That no Priest say Masse himselfe alone: for if hee haue no person present except himselfe, how can hee say, <hi>Dominus vobiscum,</hi> or <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum corda,</hi> or such other passages? Also frequent offering of the Sacrifice of the Masse, and presenting of the Paxe, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to Christian people. 45. That euery person bee acquainted with the Lords Prayer, and the Beliefe: and they who can no otherwise comprehend these things, let them learne them in their owne vulgar language. 46.

               <p>IN the yeere of our Lord 813. a Councell was assembled at Rhemes,<note place="margin">The eigth Councel of Rhemes.</note> by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of <hi>Charles</hi> the great: for it is to be remarked, that he not only asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled that famous Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Frankford, <hi>Anno.</hi> 794. in the which adoration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was condemned: but also, when he was now aged, &amp; saw many abuses in the Church, hee endeuoured by all meanes possible, to procure reformation of the lewd manners of Church-men. Therefore, he appointed, at one time, to wit. <hi>Anno,</hi> 813. fiue National Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, to be conueened in diuers places, for reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Clergie &amp; people: One was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueened at Mentz, as hath bin declared: Another at Rhemes: the third at Towrs: the fourth at Cabilone, or Chalons: &amp; the fift at Arles. In all these Councels no opposition is made to the Councell of Frankford: neither was the adoration of Images auowed in any of these Councels. So much auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the authority of a Prince for suppressing of false doctrin and heresie. In this Councell at Rhemes, <hi>Wulfarius,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop was president. 44. canons are rehearsed in the 2. Tome of Councels made in this Councell.</p>
               <p>In the 1. Can. it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, That euery man should dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly acquaint himself with the Articles of his faith. 2. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man shuld learn the Lords Praier, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. 3. That euery man, promoted to Ecclesiasticall orders, shal walke worthily, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme to his calling. 4. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of <hi>Paul</hi> were read, to giue instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to sub-deacons, how they shuld behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. Yet is there not one word in all the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> of a sub-deacon. 5. The Gospell was read to giue instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Deacons, to minister condingly in their office. 6. Ignorant Priests are instructed to celebrate the Seruice with great vnderstanding. 7. In like manner, they are instructed how to prepare <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Baptisme. 8. The holy Canons were read out of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretall of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> for ordering the life of Chanons. 9. The rule of Saint <hi>Benedict</hi> was read, to reduce Abbots, and their Conuents, to a remembrance of their order. 10. The
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:18150:326"/>
Pastorall booke of <hi>Gregorius</hi> was read, to admonish Pastors of their dutie. 11. Sentences of diuers ancient Fathers were read, to admonish men of all rankes, both Prelates and subiects, to bring forth the fruit of a good conversation. 12. These things being done, they set downe a forme of receiuing of confessions, and prescribing of penance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canonicall institutions. 13. They reasoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the eight principall vices, to the end, their diuersitie being distinguished, every man might know what vices he should eschew, and teach others to beware of the same. 14. That Bishops should take heed of the reading of the bookes of the Canonicke Scripture, and the bookes of Fathers: and should attend vpon the preaching of the Word of God. 15. That Bishops should preach the Sermons and Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of holy Fathers, in such sort as all the people might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them. The 16. Canon is coincident with the 12. 17. That Bishops, and Abbots, permit no man to solace the company with filthy gesting in their presence: but let poore and indigent people be refreshed at their tables with lectures of divine Scripture, and praising of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Precept of the Apostle, that <hi>whether wee eate or drinke, let all things be done to the glory of God.</hi> 18. Gluttony and Drunkennesse forbidden to Bishops, and the Ministers of God. 19. Let not Bishops bee rash to iudge in things secret, which are to bee referred to the iudgement of God, who can manifest things hid vp in darknesse, and discouer the secrets of the heart. 20. Presbyters shall not transport themselues from a low place to a greater. 21. Whosoever by paying money, procureth a preferment in the Church, shall be deposed. 22. No Church-man shall cohabite with a woman, except it be with his mother or sister, or such like persons, by whose company no suspition of vncleannesse can arise. Precepts given to Monkes, and Nunnes, I passe by, as I did in the former Councell.</p>
               <p>Canon 35. The Sabbath day shall be kept holy, and in it no servile worke shall bee done, according to the Lords commandement. 36. Let no man bestow vpon the Church
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:18150:327"/>
that thing which by vnlawfull meanes hee hath fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with-drawne from others. 37. Nor yet by lies and deceitfull meanes, with-draw any thing duly belonging to the Church. 38. Let tythes be precisely payed. 39. Let no man presume to receiue rewards for his decreet and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. 40. Let prayers and oblations be made for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and his noble race, that it would please God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them in all happines, in this present life, and vouchsafe vnto them celestiall ioyes in company of the Angels, in the life to come. In the 41. Canon, mention is made of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rent, left by King <hi>Pipinus</hi> of Good memory; which they wish the Emperour <hi>Charles, Pipinus</hi> sonne, should not alter, nor transferre into another summe, in respect, that by so doing, many periuries and false testimonies might ensue. 42. And that no man should be remoued from his mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to whom the Emperours almes is distributed. 43. And that the statute may bee confirmed by his Highnesse allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whereby all contentions and strifes are ordained to haue a decision, and end. 44. And that the statute made in Bononia, concerning false witnesses, may be ratified and confirmed: with augmentation, if neede require, for es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing of periuries, false testimonies, and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Councell of Towrs.</note>IN the yeere of our Lord, 813. and at the commandement of the Emperour <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> a Councell of many Bishops and Abbots, was assembled, about establishing of Ecclesiasticall discipline, in the towne of Towers.</p>
               <p>In the first Canon, all men are admonished to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and to keepe the oath of allegeance made vnto him, and to make prayers, and supplications for his prosperity and wel-fare. 2. All Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes shall diligently reade, and frequently peruse, the bookes of holy Scripture, the histories of the Euangels, and the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> together with the bookes of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers written thereupon. 3. It is not lawfull for any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to bee ignorant of the Canons of the Church, and of
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:18150:327"/>
the Pastorall booke of <hi>Gregorius,</hi> in the which every man, as in a liuely mirrour might see himselfe. 4. Let every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop feede the flocke committed vnto him, not onely with doctrine, but also with examples of good conversation. 5. A Bishop must not be giuen to sumptuous banquets, but be content with a moderate diet, lest hee should seeme to abuse the counsell of our Lord, saying; <hi>Take heed, that your hearts be not surfeited with gluttony, or drunkennesse</hi>: but let holy lecture be at his table, rather then the idle wordes of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fellowes. 6. Let strangers and indigent people bee at Bishops tables: whom they may refresh, both with corporall and spirituall repast. 7. The delicate pleasure of the eare and eyes, are to bee eschewed, left by such pleasures, the minde be effeminate, and inchanted. 8. Let not the Lords servants delight in vaine gesting, nor in hunting, nor haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. 9. Let Presbyters and Deacons follow the foot-steps of their Bishops, assuring themselues, that the good conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation enioyned vnto their Bishops, is also enioyned vnto them. 10. Let Bishops haue a great sollicitude and care towards the poore: and be faithfull dispensators of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall goods, as the Ministers of God, and not as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after filthy lucre. 11. It is lawfull for Bishops, with consent of Presbyters and Deacons, to bestow out of the Church treasure, to support indigent people of that same Church. 12. A Presbyter is not to be ordained vntill hee bee thirtie yeere old. 13. Let the Bishop make diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition in his owne parish Church, that no Presbyter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from any other parts, make seruice in his Church, without letters of recommendation. 14. Let a Presbyter, leaving a low place, and presuming to an higher, incurre that same punishment, which a Bishop, deprehended in the like fault, should incurre. 15. A Presbyter, who attaineth to a Church, by giving money for it, let him bee deposed. 16. Let tythes bestowed vpon Churches, by advice of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, be faithfully distributed to the poore, by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 17. The families of Bishops shall be instructed in the summe of the true faith. In the knowledge of the retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:18150:328"/>
to be given to good men, and the condemnation of people, and of the resurrection and last iudgement, and by what kinde of workes eternall life may be promerited: and that the Homilies, containing these instructions, shall bee translated into Rusticke-Latine-language: to the end that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very person may vnderstand them. Marke in what estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Latine language hath beene at this time: that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions in Rusticke and barbarous Latine, are counted better then instructions in good French language. 18. It is the dutie of the Bishop, to instruct his Presbyter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacrament of Baptisme, what it is that they should desire the people baptized to renounce: namely, that they should renounce the divell, and all his workes, and his pomps. Now the workes of the Diuell, are murther, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, adulterie, drunkennesse, and other such like faults. But the pompes of the Divell, are pride, ostentation, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conceits, vaine-glory, loftinesse, and such other faults, as spring vp from such grounds. 19. Presbyters are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely to be admonished, that when they say the masse, and do communicate, they doe not distribute the Lords bodie indiscreetly, to children, and to all persons, who happen to be present, who if they be entangled with great sinnes, they procure vnto themselues rather damnation, then any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to their soules, according to the saying of the Apostle, <hi>Whosoeuer eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup unworthily, hee shall be guilty of the bodie and blood of the Lord: Let a man therefore try himselfe, and so let him eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup.</hi>

                  </note> By this let the iudicious Reader marke, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the dayes of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> priuate masses had no place: but they who were duly prepared, did communicate with the Priest. 20. Presbyters shall not suffer the holy Chrisme to be touched by every man. 21. Presbyters shall not resort to Tavernes, to eate or drinke. 22. Bishops and Presbyters, shall prescribe to sinners, who haue confessed their sinnes, penance, discreetly, according to the waighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their fault. 23. Chanons, who dwell in Cities, let them eate in one Cloyster, and sleepe vnder one roofe, to
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:18150:328"/>
the end they may bee ready to celebrate their Canonicall houres. From the 24. Canon vnto the 32. are contained constitutions concerning Monkes and Nunnes, which I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-passe with silence, fearing to be prolix.</p>
               <p>Canon 32. All men should studie to peace and concord, but especially Christians: forsaking hatred, discord, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie. 33. Lords and Iudges should be obedient to the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some admonitions of their Bishops: and Bishops on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, should reverently regard them, to the end they may be mutually supported, every one with the consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one of another. 34. Lords and Iudges are to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, that they admit not vile and naughty persons to beare witnesse in their iudicatories, because there are many, who for a contemptible price, are ready to make shipwracke of a good conscience. 35. Let no man for his decreet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a reward: For divine Scripture in many places forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this, <hi>as a thing that blindeth the eyes of the blind.</hi> 36. Let euery man be carefull to support indigent persons of his owne family and kindred: for it is an impious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing in the sight of God, that men abounding in riches, should neglect their owne. 37. Christians when they make supplications to God, let them in humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bow downe their knees, following the example of the Martyr <hi>Steven,</hi> and of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>: Except vpon the Lords day, and other solemne dayes, on the which the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church keepeth a memoriall of the Lords resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and at such times they are accustomed to stand and pray. 38. Faithfull people must be admonished, not to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, with tumult and noyse: and in time of prayer, and celebration of the masse, not to be occupied in vaine confabulations, and idle speeches: but even to abstain from wicked cogitations. 39. Let not the Consistories and Iudgement-seates of secular Iudges be in the Church, or portches thereof, in any time to come: because the house of God should bee an house of Prayer, as our Lord Iesus Christ saith. 40. Let it be forbidden, that Merchandize be vsed vpon the Lords day, or Iustice-Courts, because all
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:18150:329"/>
men should abstaine from servile labours, to the end this day may be spent in praising and thanking God, from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till evening. 41. Incestuous persons, parracides, and murtherers, are found, who will not hearken to the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some admonitions of Church-men, but persevere in their vitious conversation, who must be reduced to order by the discipline of the secular power. 42. Let the people be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to abstaine from Magicall Arts, which can bring no support and helpe to the infirmities of men, and beasts: but they are the deceitfull snares of the Divell, whereby he deceiveth man-kinde. 43. A frequent custome of swearing is forbidden, wherein men, vpon euery light occasion wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to purchase credit to that which they speake, they take God to be witnesse of the verity of their speeches. 44. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny free subiects, by the oppression of their Masters, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacted to extreame pouerty; whose causes, if our element Soveraigne please to examine, hee shall finde, that they are vniustly redacted to extreame indigence. 45. A false mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and a false ballance, is an abomination vnto the Lord, as <hi>Salomon</hi> recordeth.</p>
               <p>The 46. Canon containeth a regrate, that tythes were not duly payed to the Church: notwithstanding, that the Church had giuen in, their complaint to the civil Magistrate: whereby it came to passe, that not only lights in the Church, and stipends to the Clergie, began to inlacke, but also the very parish Churches became ruinous. 47. When gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Fastings are appointed, for any impendent calamity, let man neglect the fellowship of the humble Church, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to feed his belly with delicate foode. 48. Drunkennes and surfeiting are forbidden, as offensiue both to soule and bodie, and the ground of many other sinnes. 49. Lords and Masters are to be admonished, not to deale cruelly and vnmercifully with their subiects: yea, and not to seeke that which is due vnto themselues, with excessiue rigour. 50. Let Laicke people communicate at least thrise in a yeere, vnlesse they be hindred by some grivous sinnes committed by them. 51. In the last Canon mention is made, that
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:18150:329"/>
they diligently examined the cause of them who complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Emperour, that they were dis-inherited by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> donation of lands, which their Fathers and friends had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon the Church: and in their bounds they found no man who did complaine. Alwaies, in that matter, if any thing was done amisse, they humbly submitted themselues to be corrected by their Soveraigne Lord and King.</p>
               <p>THe Councell of Chalons was the fourth Councell,<note place="margin">The Councell of Chalons.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in the yeere of our Lord, 813. by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, for the reformation of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Estate. Many of the Canons of this Councell are coincident with the Canons of the former: therefore I shall be the shorter in the commemoration thereof.</p>

The blame of filthy lucre, wherewith many Church-men were charged, for this, that they allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red secular men to renounce the world, and to bring their goods to the Church, they endeuour, with multiplyed number of words, to remoue. 7. Bishops, and Abbots, who with deceitfull speeches, haue circumvened simple men, and shauen their heads, and by such meanes doe pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse their goods, in respect of their covetous desire of filthy lucre, let them be subiect to Canonicall, or regular repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

But let those simple men, who have layd downe their haire, as men destitute of vnderstanding, who cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne their owne affaires, let them remaine in that estate, which they haue once vndertaken: but let the goods given by negligent Parents, and received, or rather reaved by ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious Church-men, be restored againe to their children &amp; heires. 8. If Church men lay vp provision of come in Victuall-houses, let it not be to keepe them to a dearth, but to support the poore in time of need, therewith. 9. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and hawking, and the insolency of foolish and filthy iests, are to bee forsaken of Church-men. 10. Gluttony and drunkennesse is forbidden. 11. The Bishop or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, must not resort to civill iudicators, to plead their owne cause, except it be to support the poore and oppressed. Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Deacons, and Monkes, having obtained licence from the Bishop, may compeare in Civill iudgement-seats, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with their Advocate. 12. Let not Presbyters, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, or Monkes, bee farmers or labourers of the ground. 13.

Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in visiting of their Parishioners, let them not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto them, but rather comfortable, by preaching the Word, and by correcting things that are disordered. 15. It is reported, that some Arch-deacons vse domination over the Presbyters, and take tribute from them, which smelleth rather of tyranny, then of due order. For if the Bishoppe should not vse domination over the Clergie, but by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars to the flocke, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth: much lesse should these presume to doe any such like thing. 16. Like as in dedication of Churches, and for receiving of orders, no money is received: even so, for buying of Balme to make Chrisme, Presbyters (keepers of Chrisme) shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:18150:330"/>
no money: but Bishops, of their owne rents, shall furnish Baulme for the making of Chrisme, and Lightes to the Church. 17. It hath beene found in some places, that Presbyters haue payed 12. or 14. pennies in yeerely tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Bishop: which custome wee haue ordained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to be abolished. 18. The receiuing of paunds from incestuous persons, and from men who pay not their Tythes, and from negligent Presbyters, is forbidden, as a thing which openeth a doore to auarice: but rather let Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall discipline strike vpon transgressours. 19. Let people giue their Tythes to those Churches wherein their children are baptized, &amp; whereunto they resort all the yeere long, to heare Church-seruice. 20. Let peace bee kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all men, but in speciall betwixt Bishops &amp; Countes; whereby euery one of them may mutually support another. 21. Ciuill Iudges ought to judge righteously, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of persons, and without receiuing of rewards: and let their Officiars, Vicars, and Centenaries, bee righteous men: least, by their auarice and greedinesse, the people bee grieued, and impouerished. And let the witnesses be of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspect credite: for by false witnesses the Countrey is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damnified. 22. The Abbots and Monkes, in this part of the Countrie, seeing they haue addicted themselues to the Order of Saint <hi>Benedict</hi>: let them endeuour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselues vnto his institution and rules. 23. The ordination of Presbyters, Deacons, and other inferiours, is to bee made at a certaine prescribed time. 24. Concerning Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Monkes, who shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be llaine, let the Emperour giue determination to whom the satisfacton of blood shall belong. 25. In many places, the auncient custome of publicke repentance hath ceased: neither is the auncient custome of excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and reconciliation in vse. Therefore, the Emperour is to be entreated, that the ancient discipline may be restored againe, and they who sinne publikely, may be brought to publike repentance: and euery man, according as hee deserueth, may either bee excommunicated, or reconciled. 26. It

is reported, that in some Churches there is contention and strife for diuidng of Church rents: It is ordained, therefore, That no Masse shall be said in those Churches, vntill they, who are at variance, be reconciled againe. 27. Neither the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptisme, nor the Sacrament of Confirmation, should be reiterated. 28. Concerning the decrees of affinitie, and in what degree Marriage may be bound vp, euery man is sent to the Canons of the Church to seeke resolution. 29. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the man and the woman are counted in Scripture as one flesh, their Parentage is to be reckoned by like degrees in the matter of Marriage. 30. The Marriage of seruants is not to bee dissolued which is bound vp with consent of both their masters, euerie seruant remaining obedient to his owne master.<note place="margin">

It is rumoured, that some women by negligence, and others fraudulently, doe present their owne children to the Sacrament of Confirmation, to the ende they may bee separated from the companie of their husbandes. Therefore, wee statute and ordaine, that such women as either negligently or fraudulently present their owne children to the Sacrament of Confirmation, they shall bee compelled to doe penance all the dayes of their life: neither shall they in any wise be separated from their husbandes. 32. Let a sinner confesse vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Confessor, all his sinnes which hee hath committed either in thought, word, or deede: because that hatred, enuye, and pride, are such pestilentious botches of the soule: and the more secretly that they are couched, the more periculously they hurt. 33.

Many in doing of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, are not so desirous of remission of sinnes, as of the accomplishment of the prescribed time of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and beeing forbidden to eate flesh, or drinke wine, they haue the greater desire of other delicate meates and drinkes: but spirituall abstinence, which should bee in peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent persons, excludeth all bodily delightes. 36. Let no man sinne of purpose, to the ende hee may abolishe his sinnes by Almes-deedes: for that is all one as if a man should hyre God to grant vnto him a libertie to sinne. 37. Seeing all Canons of Councels are to be diligently read, in speciall such as appertaine vnto faith, and reformation of manners, should bee most frequently perused. 38. Bookes, called <hi>Libelli Poenitentiales,</hi> are to abolished, because the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures of these Bookes are certaine, howbeit the authors of them be vncertaine: and they prepare pillowes to lay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heads of them, who are sleeping in sinne. 39. In the solemnities of the Masse, Prayers are to bee made for the soules of them who are departed, as well as for them who are aliue. 40. Presbyters, who are degraded, &amp; liue like se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare men, neglecting repentance, whereby they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure restitution to their office, let them be excommunicated. 41. A Presbyter, who transporteth himselfe from his owne place, shall not be receiued in any other Church, except hee prooue, both with witnesses and letters sealed with lead, &amp; containing the name of the Bishop, and of the Citie which he liued in, that he hath liued innocently in his own Church, and had a just cause of transportation. 42. Let no Church bee committed to a Presbyter, without consent of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. 43. In some places are found Scots-men, who call themselues Bishops, &amp; they ordaine Presbyters &amp; Deacons, whose ordination we altogether disallowe. 44. Presbyters must not drinke in Tavernes, wander in Markets, nor goe
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:18150:332"/>
to visite Cities, without aduise of their Bishop. 45. Many both of the Clergie &amp; Laickes, go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In receiuing the Sacrament of the bodie and blood of Christ, great discretion is to be vsed: Neither let the taking of it be long differred, because Christ saith, <hi>Except yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee haue no life in you</hi>: Neither let vs come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due preparation, because the Apostle saith, <hi>He who eateth and dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Sacrament of the body &amp; blood of Christ which in one day is accustomed to be receiued of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: let no man neglect to receiue it, except some grieuous crime doe hinder him from receiuing of it. 48. According to the precept of the Apostle <hi>Iames, Weake persons should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with oyle by the Elders,</hi> (<hi>which oyle is blessed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>) these words inclosed in a parenthesis are added to the Text: for he saith, <hi>Is any man sicke amongst you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint him with oyle, in the Name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shal saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him vp: And if he haue committed sin, it shal be forgiuen him, I am. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 14.15. Such a medicine as cureth both bodily &amp; spirituall maledies is not to be neglected. 49. In the Councell of Laodicea it was forbidden, that Masses should bee said, and Oblations offered by Bishops, or Presbyters, in priuate houses. This question also was disputed in this Councell. 50. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Emperour, is to be interponed for reuerent kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Lords day. 51. Because the Church is constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of persons of diuerse conditions, some are Noble, others are ignoble, some are seruants, vassalles, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp;c. It becommeth them who are in eminent rowmes, to deale mercifully with their inferiours, knowing that they are their brethren, because God is one common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to both, and the Church is one common mother to
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:18150:332"/>
both. From the 52. Canon vnto the 66. are contained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of chaste and honest liuing prescribed to Prioresses and Nunnes. which I ouer-passe, as I haue done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Councels. 66. It is ordained, that prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications shall be made for the Emperour and his children, and for their well-fare both in soule and bodie. 67. These things haue we touched shortly, to be exhibited to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord the Emperour.

                  <note place="margin">The Councell of Canterbury in England.</note>IN the yeere of our Lord, 975. a Councell was gathered in England, at Canterburie. The question debated in the Councell, was concerning the marriage of men in spirituall offices. <hi>Dunstanus</hi> at this time was Bishop of Canterburie, and he was an adversarie to the marriage of men in spirituall offices. But the question was so wel discussed by testimonies of Scripture, and the Fathers of the Primitiue Church, that <hi>Dunstanus</hi> had cause to be ashamed. For this cause hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the helpe of the Diuell: for he was knowne to be a Sorcerer. Satan compelled him to persist in his argument. And when they were convened againe, and in the heate of their disputation, a voyce sounded from the Image of the Crucifix (which was in the place of their convention) that <hi>Dunstanus</hi> his opinion was the best.</p>

This matter so displeased the Patriarch <hi>Polyeuchus,</hi> that hee debarred the Emperour <hi>Nicephorus</hi> from holy things, pretending these two causes: First, because the Emperour had celebrated the second marriage. Secondly, because <hi>Nicephorus</hi> had beene witnesse in Baptisme, to the children of <hi>Theophania.</hi> This
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:18150:337"/>
question being discussed in the Councell, in presence both of Prelats and Counsellers, the Emperours marriage was allowed, and the acts alledged by <hi>Polyeuchus</hi> was counted impious, &amp; made by <hi>Capronimus,</hi> and that they had no force to hinder the marriage. The proud Patriarch when he was overthrowne by reason, armed himselfe with obstinacie and stiffe neckednesse, vntill <hi>Bardas</hi> the Emperours father came to him, and affirmed by an oath, that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was not witnesse in Baptisme to the children of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phania.</hi> Thus were the Patriarches of the East, serious in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the traditions of men, but remisse and negligent in observing the ordinances of God. And this is a sure testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that defection from the faith had now prevayled, both in the west and East.</p>

The Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, was not onely cursed, but also denuded of his Imperiall dignity, as if the Bishop of Rome had power to conferre the kingdomes of the world to whom hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. The flattering words of the Pope to the Romane No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Senators, and People, are beyond all measure of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For hee called them the head of the world, having power to conferre all spirituall and civill dignities to whom they pleased. Like as 270. yeeres agoe, they transferred the Empire from the Grecians, to the Germanes. And like as the Emperour may displace an vnworthy souldier, even so a souldier may forsake an vnrighteous Captaine. After this, hee distributed to his followers, 15000. talents of siluer; and so by cursings, flattery, and prodigality, hee bewitched the Romans, and engaged them against the Emperour.</p>

Therefore hee besieged the towne of Rome and tooke it. <hi>Hildebrand</hi> with the rest of the Wolfes who had troubled the sheepfold of God, they fled. The Emperour with the advice of the Roman Senate, appointed a Councell to be assembled at Rome, wherein fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue <hi>Hildebrand</hi> should appeare, and render an account of his adminstration, but hee would not appeare.

               <p>Some Councels were assembled for prohibition of Priests marriages, others for excommunication of the Emperour; some for the question of investment of Bishops, being most willing to extort this priviledge out of the hands of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and to conferre it to the Bishops of Rome: Some were gathered for deciding the question which arose by plurality of Popes, contending hotly one against another, for the Popedome.

               <p>
                  <hi>ALexius</hi> Emperour of Constantinople,<note place="margin">A Councell at Paris.</note> sent letters to <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the second, wherein he declared the rage of the
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:18150:346"/>
Turkes, and implored support from the West. <hi>Vrbanus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled a Councell of all Nations, at Paris, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe at the Councell, incitating the hearts of all men, to driue out the barbarous Turkes from the place wherein the redeemer of the world did suffer.

               <p>IN the yeere of our Lord, 1110. the Bishop of Florence openly preached,<note place="margin">A Councell at Florence.</note> that Antichrist was already come, which hee cleerely perceived by that horrible change of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Kingdome of Christ, into an earthly Monarchie: for the Bishops of Rome were rather Warriours, then Preachers of the Word of God. They opposed themselues to Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and most contemptuously abused them; they depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the articles of Faith, prophaned the Sacraments institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ. Idolatry dayly increased, hypocriticall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline through propagation of Monastique orders, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane constitutions, were out of measure extolled. Moe were advanced to the Popedome by deceit, weapons, and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then by free election. Matrimoniall chastitie was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from the order of Clergie-men, who count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues holy. And finally, the Bishop of Rome was like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gulfe, devouring and exhausting the substance of the world, and administrating his turnes rather by force, then reason. These abuses, and others like to these, presented to the Bishop of Florence, a notice that Antichrist was come alreadie, and openly domineered in the Church. <hi>Pascalis</hi> the second, who was Pope at this time, thought it was no time to slumber or sleepe, in such a matter. Therefore hee convened a Councell at Florence, and called the Bishop of Florence to his accounts. The arguments by which hee prooued, that Antichrist was already come, are buried in silence. Onely hee was sharply rebuked, and commanded,
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:18150:346"/>
that in time to come he should vtter no such doctrine.</p>
               <p>IN the yeere of our Lord,<note place="margin">A Councel at London.</note> 1102. and in the third yeere of the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, King of England: <hi>Anselmus</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie, a man much addicted to Pope <hi>Paschalis,</hi> assembled a Councell at London, for prohibition of the marriages of Priests. This was an vncouth thing in England, and some counted it an holy designe, others, a matter perilous (as it was indeed) lest men attempting things that were aboue their strength, should fall into the snare of the Deuill, and into horrible Lusts of vncleannesse, which thing came to passe. For horrible Sodomie had place among the Clergie, and the yeere following, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmus</hi> was compelled to conuene another Councell at S. <hi>Pauls</hi> in London, and to make constitutions for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those who were found to bee polluted with that vild lust of vncleannesse. Neuerthelesse <hi>Anselmus</hi> was one of the number of the Antichristian Clergie, who would be wiser than God, and finde out better remedies than marriage to stay the intemperat lust of men, who had not the gift of Continencie.</p>
               <p>IN the yeere of our Lord,<note place="margin">The Councell of Mentz.</note> 1106. a great Councell was assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Mentz, against the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who attended at Ingelheme; looking to haue beene sent for to the Councell. But the Ambassadours of Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> and the Bishops who were present at the Councell could not delay, vntill the Emperour was sent for. But the venemous vlcer of their cankered hearts being ripe, behoued presently to break forth, before the Emp. was heard to speake for himselfe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they proceed against the noble Emp. being absent, and condemned him of heresie, &amp; exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated him.

And not content with this, they for the Bishops of Mentz, Cosen, &amp; Worms, to Iugelheime, where the E.H. 4. was, &amp; deuested him of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. The E. could not resist the violence of those
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:18150:347"/>
headstrong Prelats, because his armie and friends were not about him. But he demaunded the three Bishops in the sight of the eternall God, to declare if hee had taken any reward for admitting them to their Bishopriks. The Bishops of Mentz, Colen, and Wormes, all affirmed; that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no reward from their hands. How then (sayth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) am I condemned of Simonie? I pray you fathers doe not so wickedly (sayth he) violate your oath of alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Dishonour not mine estate and horehead. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case I should resigne mine Emperiall Ornaments to my son; let all the estates of Germanie bee assembled, that I may doe it willingly in a lawfull assembly. But the Prelats forementioned, stirring vp one another, put hands to worke and pulled the Crowne from his head, and denuded him of the rest of his Imperiall Ornaments. The Emperour with sighes and sobbs committed his cause to God who hateth iniquitie, and in his own time can render a condigne recompence vnto it. Moreouer the Noble Emperour humblie craued at the Popes Ambassadours, and the rest of the Bishops; to bee absolued from excommunication, with promise to satisfie them, whom hee should bee found after due triall to haue offended. But these Romane Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs answered him proudly that matter pertained to the Pope, he must dresse himselfe to Rome to bee absolued by the Pope, after sight of his condigne satisfaction. Now let the iudicious reader marke, if these Councels had bin like vnto the starre,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.</note> which led the wise men of the East to Christ; then it were good reason that we should follow them.

and perfit in France the worke begun in Germanie. And to throw out of the hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestment of Bishops, as hee had done out of his fathers hands. The Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, approched neere to the place wherein the Councell was gathered, but was not present thereat.</p>
               <p>The subiect intreated in the Councell was about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestment of Bishops, by all meanes possible they endevored to spoile all Laicke persons of this priuiledge; affirming that the election of Pastors should be free, and that the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laicke persons, in conferring of Ecclesiasticall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must be cut off. Therefore hee promulgated the like mandars, as his Predecessours had done before him, adding also against the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traveners of his mandats the like cursings, as his Predecessours had done before him. The Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, with aduise of the Nobles and Bishops, who were about him, sent Ambassadours to the Pope, and the Councell calling to their remembrance that the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestment of the Bishops was conferred to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and that his successors had continued in possession of that right vntill his time. Therefore he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that the Pope and Councell would doe nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to his right. This Message perturbed the cogitations of the Pope, and the fathers of the Councell, but this means was found out, that this question should rest for the space of a yeere, after the issue whereof it should be reasoned at Rome. And in the meane time, no investment should bee receiued from any Laicke person. This interim, together with the place appointed for determination of the question, are manifest presages of the euent: to wit, that the Pope would not be at rest vntil hee had trampled vnder foote all ciuill domination, &amp; vntill he had remoued out of the way that authoritie, which was a let to his vsurped prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, as the Apostle speaketh:<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.7.</note> when the yeere was exspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Emperour addressed himselfe to Rome with an army and tooke the Pope and his Cardinals prisoners. And albeit the Pope at that time condiscended that the right of invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:18150:348"/>
should consist in the Emperours hand, yet afterward hee revoked the same, and in the Councell of Rome assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Anno,</hi> 1112. yeeres, hee vtterly renounced that priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conferred to the Emperour, as hath beene declared in the Historie of his life.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Historie of this Councell was written by <hi>Aeneas Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> who was present at the same, and liked well of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and determinations thereof, as may appeare by his owne writings; and namely by a certaine Epistle of his written to the Rector of the vniuersitie of Colen, wherein he reioyceth for a certaine treatise of the said rectors which came into his hands: reprouing the rudenesse and rashnesse of such as deny the Bishop of Rome and his consistory, to be subiect to the Generall Councell, and that the supreme tribunall seat of iudgement standeth in the Church, and not in one Bishop. Notwithstanding the same <hi>Syluius</hi> who by his learned writings advanced the decrees of the Councell of Basil, yet afterward being promoted to that papall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie himselfe, turned his coat; and returned againe to the old filthy pride of the Chaire of Rome, which magnifieth it selfe not onely aboue the Church, but also maketh it selfe companion to God himselfe.</p>
               <p>IN the yeere of our Lord,<note place="margin">The Councell of Florence.</note> 1439. while as the Councell of Basil was yet sitting vndissolued; <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that matters went against him in Basil, he held a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Councell at Florence, where he brought to passe that the Emperour and Patriarch of Constantinople with the rest of the Grecians there present, were perswaded to receiue the sentence of the Church of Rome concerning the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Ghost, also to receiue the communion in vnleauened bread, to admit Purgatorie, and to yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the authoritie of the Romish Bishop, wherevnto notwithstanding the other Churches of Grecia would in no wise assent at their comming home; in so much that with a publict execration, they did condemne afterward all those Legats which had consented to those Articles, that none of them should be buried in Christian buriall.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted in this Councell, that the Grecians who agreed to other opinions of the Roman Church, yet could
