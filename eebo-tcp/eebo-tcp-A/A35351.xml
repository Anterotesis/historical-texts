            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WISE Men do justly suspect, and are hardly brought to believe, the Accounts of extraordinary Stories; especially about Witchcraft: Because the frequent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures which the Romanists have obtruded on the World in their Miracles and Legends; the many Relations of odd things as done by Daemons or Wizards, which yet, were either false, or meerly the product of Natural Causes; the Ignorance of several Judges and Juries, who have condemned silly Creatures meerly upon their own Ridiculous Confessions, or other slender proof; and the difficulty of conceiving the Manner or Philosophy, of some Operations and Appearances, tho undoubtedly true in Fact; are good prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Sudden belief, and may serve as precautions to make an Exact Inquiry into those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before we believe them.</p>
            <p>But they are Men of weak Souls, and destitute of cleer thoughts; who deny all, because they have discovered Error in some; or condemn all Facts, as false, because they know not how they came to exist: By the same rule of reasoning they may argue that there are no <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> because the best Men have been sometimes mistaken for such, and that there are no Criminals, because several have been punished that were not truly such: Because many Historys are fabulous, that there are none to be trusted: And that all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature, whose invisible causes they cannot comprehend, are meer Delusions.</p>
            <p>The following Narrative, as to the truth of the matter of Fact, is the best attested piece of History of this kind, that has occurr'd in many Ages: the most of the matters therein repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented having gained the assent of private Scepticks; and been prov'd before publick Judges. So that its more surprising than Witchcraft it self, that any Man should seriously deny the Beeing of any such thing, and from thence doubt the falling out of such strange Providences at a distance, when the certainty of the matter of Fact has dispell'd all Objections in the places where they happened.</p>
            <p>Many Authors have proved, at large, that there are Witches and Witchcrafts, from Reason, Scripture, Antiquity and the Experience of all Nations and Ages: And they have solved the difficultys which might obstruct the belief of this positive proof, by <hi>Hypoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ses</hi> of Philosophy: Where it's to be observed, that tho such explications of the natural manner of Phenomena are subject to cavil, yet the existence of a thing which has so certain an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> positive Evidence cannot be denyed in sound Reasoning; because Angels and Men not being made for civil converse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this World, and all Communion with Devils being forbidden us, the Scripture needed to unfold little of their way of acting; and still the next Age, may discover what this could not, as there have been those things explain'd already in this Age which were thought unexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the last.</p>
            <p>Therefore such a short hint, as may somewhat Illustrate the Events in the subsequent discourse, is sufficient in the present Case: Especially since Providence designs those eminent occurrences, rather for our Practical Instruction, then for a Subject of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>otional Speculation.</p>
            <p>The Devil can assume a bodily Shape, and speak to Man out of it: As he did to <hi>Eve,</hi> to our Saviour, and in some Heathen Oracles; to make Men capable of entring into Contract with him, for Satan is willing thus to ensure Mortalls of being Enemies to Heaven, to other Men, and to their own Salvation. The Insatiable Itch that prying Wits have after hidden and curious Knowledge, the desire of Honour, Revenge and of the knowledge of Secrets, in some who are Great in the World, the desire of Riches, and many times likewise of Revenge in Worldlings and the poorer sort of people, and the eager pursuit after the Enjoyment of Sensual
<pb facs="tcp:31747:3"/>
Pleasures by those that are Voluptuous, do by the just Judgment of God render all those sorts of Persons liable to his Tentations and easie to be prevail'd upon by his proposals to gratify them in those things which they seek after as their chief good. We see daily, how the Lusts of Criminals inflamed by Satan, divert their Horrour not only of Eternal and distant, but also of Temporal and imminent Torments; and Pervert those instincts of Nature which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise frighten them from a surrender. But further, he commonly facilitates his Conquest over Witches, by decoying them gradually to his Lure, through the mediation of Others that are already embarrr'd with him, till they be sufficiently prepar'd for making an Explicite Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action to obey him.</p>
            <p>That accordingly he has <hi>de facto</hi> prevailed in making Sorcerers and Witches, appears from the Testimony of the Wisest and Best of Men in all Ages and Nations.</p>
            <p>The Heathens, by Nature and Practice, discovering this truth, made Laws against <hi>Malefico's</hi> and <hi>Mathematico's,</hi> and some of the last (tho they assumed the name of an Art much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Legislators; being known, under the pretext of that, to consult the Devil, as to the distinies of Men and States) were punish'd by the Senate and People of <hi>Rome.</hi> And even the <hi>Persians,</hi> in some good Reigns, did the like. In the Old Testament we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> who were baffled by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the Witch of <hi>Endor;</hi> and that <hi>Iesabel, Manasseth,</hi> and the ten Tribes were punished by just Judgments for their Sorceries and Witchcrafts amongst other Crimes; and there also we have an account of the Laws made against such, as distinct from those against other Criminals. The New Testament gives us an account of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> who bewitched the People of <hi>Samaria;</hi> of <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer that was struck blind at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rebuke; of the <hi>Pythonisse</hi> who seems to have been possest by consent, because she was not Tormented, but got profit thereby; and of such as confessed, shewed their Deeds, and burnt their Books in <hi>Ephesus;</hi> which are all of'em undeniable Instances of Witches and Witchcraft. There are also Prophesies of False Christs with signes and wonders, able to deceive, if posible, the very Elect: General Councils have made Canons against those Wretches; and the experimental Knowledge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Mortalls in all Ages, with the publick Sentences of Courts of Judicature thereupon, are delivered down to us by all Historians.</p>
            <p>

                  </gap>ius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Lamiis,</hi> gives us an account, that <hi>Gulielmus Linensis,</hi> a Popish Doctor was justly put to Death tho he dyed Penitent, he having confessed Witchcraft, had the written Covenant with Satan in his Pocket, and own'd that his share of the Devils Service was to Preach and perswade people that Witches were only silly deluded Melancholians, and therefore their Confessions were no proof. His success in this work of Darkness was such, that the People and Judges did Slacken their procedure against those Miscreants, by which means the Witches were vastly multiply'd in a few Years, as we are told by the same Author, who gives an account of the whole Process, from authentick Records.</p>
            <p>It is observ'd, that Satan has ofttimes chang'd his Scene in the different periods of time, and turned himself into such Shapes as he found most convenient for his purpose. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the darkness of Popery he was transformed into a more innocent sort of Spirit called <hi>Brounie</hi> or <hi>Fairie,</hi> (that pretended to fortell Deaths, to reveal the Deceaseds will, discover hidden Murders, and do other friendly Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which were subtile means of inducing people to rely on him) Those Spirits were then very frequent, he having the impudence thus to appear openly proportiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31747:3"/>But though what he does of himself, or by the Watch-word of Sorcerers or Witches, may, by collection, and an artful disposal of Matter and Form; appear very surprising: Yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work against Nature; or overturn the Course of it; since that is only in the Power of its Author who alone can do true Miracles, or know immediatly the thoughts of Men. It is probable moreover that since the Fall Satans natural Power is below that of good Angels; and it is certain, that he is often baffled in his Designs by Providence: yet beyond all doubt he retains so much poweras (being permitted by God) is sufficient to bring about, by unseen natural Means, most of the extraordinary Appearances, that the Generality of the Learned, have ascribed to him: And particularly those in the subsequent Narrative: Many of which, tho they are beyond the Efficiency of Disease, Deceit, or any visible Cause; yet may be the Effects of some such unperceived Means, as follow.</p>
            <p>There is no difficulty in Satan's transmiting in a short time an Account of Things which are past; since its known he goes to and fro in the Earth: Yea, he may have certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told some future Events, as that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Success against <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp;c. seeing he understands and may steal, the great Revolutions of the World out of the Prophets; wherein they are so graphically described: Or he may discover his own Resolutions whenever he is commissioned or permitted to execute a Judgment; as in the case of those who, for seeking their Horoscops, are given over to him by God; and thus he gave <hi>Saul</hi> an exact account of his own End by the <hi>Philistines.</hi> But without some such aids Satan can only guess like a Phisician by the Symptoms, or a Politician by the Crisis of States: which is the Cause that most of his Oracles are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous.</p>
            <p>His transporting of Witches is elsewhere explained. He can raise <hi>Hurricanes</hi> (as appears in <hi>Iob</hi>) which are known to carry very ponderous Bodies over great Tracts of Sea and Land. Its easy for him to Condense a part of the Vehicle; which may protect the Breathing and yet cut the Air, like the Fence of Dyvers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the beak of a Sloop: In which also he affects the magnifying of his own natural Power, and to make his followers believe that it is no less then that of the good Angels, who transported <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> through the Air. His covering of the Witches from sight, at some times, is also cleared, from the difficulties which seem to attend it, in another place of this Book: Where it appears very possible that his skill in <hi>Opticks,</hi> Reflection and Refraction of Light <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which his Power and Agility as a Spirit Subministrats Materials; may effect all that can be prov'd to be matter of Fact in that Case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glanvil, More,</hi> and others lay down another Hypothesis in both, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Body in some Cases, without Death: When by God's Permission, Satan with the parties Consent, gets power over both Soul and Body; whereby he may carry away the one from the Helm of the other, and bring it back again into its Seat; provided the vital Spirits which make the Body a fit Receptacle, be well preserved by Ointments, that constrict the Pores, till the return of its Guest: But Death ensues from a Separation when the Organs of the Body are rendred altogether unapt to obey the Soul's Commands in its Functions. If such an opinion could be true, Satan might imploy this captivated Spirit to actuat any shape he thinks fit. But there needs not so much Metaphysicks to unridle the Appearances of Witches in the shape of Beasts, and the like: Since their real Persons may be covered with a Vehicle; which by disposal of the Rays comming from it, may deceive the Eyes by the same Impressions that come from the true sight of such things. His power of representing another thing in lieu of that which is truly present; is so certain that it's found he may make up the Image or Resemblance of Persons who are not present at all: For it is not doubted but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Devils may sometimes be permitted to represent by Phantoms the most innocent and praise-worthy Men, aswell as Incarnate Devils, are suffered to tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>There are several other things of less difficult Explication. Particularly, the Devil, or Witches might have been heard in converse by the Maid and not by Others; the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

dispersing it self towards those that are not in a streight line betwixt 'em. The confederate Devil may, upon the Witches desire, infuse poisonous Humors, extracted from Herbs, of the same invisible Operation with the Steem of Mad-dogs, or the Pestilence; which being joyned to the rapid course of the Patient's own Spirits, Humors, and Blood, and Satan, by ingyring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into them, may, through the natural Means of Pulsion, set 'em in such a Career as may very well produce those extraordinary Motions which are mentioned in the following Account. The Devils delight much in the Torture, or destruction, of young Children, out of Envy to Christ, who is tender of such Little Ones; and because the Crime is the greater the less the Patient has offended, or can resist. They use, or make others to repeat, Scripture-words for gaining Credit, or alleviating the Terror, or to disgrace the Word, by such a Mock-use; as they did in the time of our Saviour, and therefore their Testimony was by him rejected. It's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable from many passages; that he hastens, sometimes, and effects the Discovery of Witches by his Malice against their present temporal Enjoyments, the uncertainty of their Continuance in his Service, and unsatiable Desire for their full Ruine: Yet some of them, who are most maliciously bent, he thinks fit to keep here, as useful Instruments; and Providence permits o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Live, that by a wilful filling up the measure of their Wickedness, under the means of the Gospel, they may be rendered finally inexcusable.</p>
            <p>As for those, whom, in Secret Judgment, the Devil is permitted to Torment; but, in Mercy, not to overcome: He may be influenced thereunto by a design of Perverting them with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, whereof he is at last disappointed: And it is likewise certain, that the Defacing of God's Image in Man, especially in Despite of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who honoured that Nature by Assuming it, is his chief Delight: or he may be constrained to make such stupendious Appearances against his Will (because he's most successful when he is least known) for a visible Testimony super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the greater Gospel proofs, in gross times, that there are Spirits, and a Devil to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Sinners, as it's observable that this was denied by Mr. <hi>Aikenhead,</hi> yet he died in full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of it) by the Passages contain'd in the Ensuing <hi>Narrative:</hi> Or Providence may suffer things to fall out, that, though they be Intended by the Devil for an Instance of Malice; they may, by their Notoriety, be a Means of Promoting the Discovery, and bringing to Justice those Miscreants, whom he made use of as his Instruments; and who, perhaps, may have liv'd long in Rebellion against Heaven, and Destroying Mankind by Services of the same Nature, as fell out in the Case now in hand.</p>
            <p>In the last place, God may permit such things for the Magnifying of his own Grace, which was so Conspicuous in Enabling this Young Girl to resist the Fierce and Cunning Assaults of the Wicked One; and there is no doubt but the Devil himself hath the greatest Malice against those Countries or Persons, over whom he perceives his Reign to be nearest at an end.</p>
            <p>There are many other Profitable Instructions that may be learnt from this Wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for such Dispensations have their own <hi>Language,</hi> and the Man of Wisdom shall see God's Name.</p>
            <p>The use of Charmes for Men or Beasts, certain Characters, Words, Verses, and Spells: The observation of Times and Seasons as Lucky, or Unlucky: The belief of having Success by care rying about one some Herbs, Plants, or Branches of Trees: And many the like Superst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tions; which can have no natural Causality on the effects desired, are the very Rudiments of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and an Implicite Application to the Devil for Vertues which God has deny'd to those things: Whence they are to be abhorred as sinful in themselves, and Introductory to an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Engagement with the Devil. So, gross Ignorance, prophane Loosness, stupid Forgetfulness of God, and neglect of his Worship in Closets and Families; Malice, Envy, Revenge, Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, oppressive fear of Want, and distrustful anxiety of Spirit: And Lastly, a Libidinous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Curses, Imprecations, and sinful Curiosity, are to be avoided, as paving the way to the same Mischief.</p>
            <p>Let none enveigh against a Profession of Religion, because some, under that specious covert, have been found in League with the Devil. It's because of the glorious Lustre and Excellency of our Holy Faith that these Miscreants paint themselves with it; that they may be the less su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, and the more able subtilly to gain others, and do their Masters Work: It was no stain on the Apostles that One of their Number had a Devil, was a Traitor and Cheat: Nor that Satan transformed himself into an Angel of Light, on Design that the good ways of the Lord may be evil spoken of. Neither let us be under a Slavish Fear and Terror of that Hellish Tribe, in truckling to their Humor, least they should do Harm, which savours of Worshiping and Paying

            <p>There is no just ground to reflect on particular Persons or Families, upon account of such Troubles. For no Man knoweth either Love or Hatred by all that's before them: All things happen alike to all: We must not suppose, that these were Sinners above all the <hi>Galileans,</hi> or above all that dwelt in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> The infinite wise God may thus Try our Faith, Patience, and Christian Fortitude. <hi>Iob</hi> and our Saviour were Assaulted; and Seven Devils cast out of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a Chosen Vessel.

            <p>The <hi>Deaf Adder</hi> that stops her Ears at the Charming Voice of a Sun-shine Gospel, will, one way or other, fall into the Charms of Satan, or his Instruments: When Men will have none of Christ, he gives them up to their own Lusts, and the power of their Spiritual Adversary; as, when <hi>Israel</hi> had forsaken their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he gave them up to Worship the Host of Heaven. What holy Caution, and pious Use of our Baptismal Covenant, ought we to make, as the best <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets</hi> against being either Enticed by the attempts of his Instruments. But how much ought we to be humbled? And how great diligence ought to be used in the discovery of so many hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Achans</hi> that are in the Camp of <hi>Israel?</hi> Yet <hi>Poverty, Age,</hi> the <hi>Features,</hi> yea, Ill <hi>Fame,</hi> or the like slender grounds, which could not be worthy of being represented to a Magistrate; ought not to move us to Suspition, much less to defame: Since Charity hopes all things, and we ought to do to others, as we would be done by.</p>
            <p>These things we doubt not will meet with a very different Reception, especially in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Age and place of the world, where <hi>Britain</hi> may be termed the Unfortunate Island; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> never having been more fertile in the production of <hi>Monsters:</hi> since its observ'd, that through all the Successions of Men, there was never before any Society, or Collective Body of <hi>Atheists</hi> till these dreggs of time; though there might have been here and there some mishapen Births. But Wisdom is Justify'd of her Children, and it's the Season for <hi>Sampson</hi> to awake when <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> gives the Alarum, that the <hi>Philistines</hi> are upon him. What <hi>Peace,</hi> so long as the <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> of <hi>Iezebel</hi> and her Witchcrafts are so many. But good things are hoped of our <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> who have already so happily begun.</p>
            <p>The Apostle said of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Tryals, ye have heard of the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> and have seen the <hi>End of the Lord.</hi> So, in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> you have a Deplorable Account of this <hi>Maids</hi> Dreadful Fits, and of the Powers of Darkness that combind together, not only for the ruining of her Body; but also for murdering her Soul. In the mean time the hearts of many were bleeding for her, and much Application was made to God in her behalf: Divers <hi>Solemn Facts</hi> were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, both in her Fathers Family, in the Parish, and throughout the Bounds of the Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and else-were; her Case was expresly minded in Publick addresses to the Throne of Grace, till at length there was a General Fast Religiously kept in most parts of the <hi>Synod,</hi> that God might give an effectual Check to <hi>Satan</hi>'s Rage and Dominion in the Countrey. Boasting of Prayers is to be abhorred; yet it is our Duty, with all Gratitude, to Acknowledge God to be the hearer of Prayer, and to Proclaim to the World the Excellency of them upon this very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: For he hath not turned away his Ear from us; it being the comfortable result of this History, that the Girl hath been perfectly well for many months: so that we may well say, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Devil could not enter the Herd of <hi>Swine,</hi> nor touch one Hair of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Head, without Permission from him whose Kingdom Ruleth over all: Whence it appears, that tho our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be Indefatigable and Invisible, yet we are under the Conduct of a Watchman who neither slumbers nor sleeps; to whom Darkness and Light are both alike; and Greater is he that is in us, than he taht is in the World: So that unless we wilfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It will not be a natural sturdiness of temper, nor a formal mentioning of the Name of God or Christ, that can shelter us from those Devourers, as appears by the Seven Sons of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>If <hi>Satan,</hi> as a Spirit, can Insinuate himself into our Humours, it is no wonder, if, by having such an advantage of our Temper, he influence the Flegmatick Person to Sloth, the Cholerick to Anger, the Sanguine to Lust and sinful Pleasure, the Melancholick to Despair, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>Let this not only rouze our Diligence, and stir up our Gratitude, for not being afflicted in the same manner; but let it also raise up our Admiration and Love of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who hath freed our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> from the power and slavery of <hi>Satan:</hi> And finding our selves too weak to resist those deluding Pleasures which occasion our being deserted by God, and given up to this fearful Thraldom; let us run to the <hi>Rock of Ages</hi> for protection and support, our sufficiency being only in God.</p>
            <p>Seeing Devils take so much pains to contract for the Souls of Witches; the Saducee's the judicially blinded in their Reason, are hereby rendred inexcusable by very sense; ill Books, which corrupt and ensnare curious Fancies, who are seldom endow'd with accurate Judgments, ought to be restrain'd: As also such ridiculous Pamphlets, as no doubt by the Instigation of Satan, have lately been sent abroad, designedly to frustrat any good use which might be made of such extraordinary Providences as these contained in the ensueing Narrative.

            <p>ABout the end of <hi>August</hi> One Thousand Six Hundred Ninety Six, <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Iohn Shaw</hi> of <hi>Bargarran</hi> Gent. in the Parish of <hi>Erskine</hi> and County of <hi>Renfrew;</hi> a smart lively and well inclin'd Girl, of about Eleven Years of Age, perceiving one of the Maids of the House, named <hi>Catharine Campbel,</hi> to steal some Milk, she told her Mother of it; whereupon the said Maid (being a young Woman of a <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> Temper, and much addicted to <hi>Cursing, Swearing</hi> and <hi>Purloining</hi>) did, in a mighty Rage, imprecate the <hi>Curse of GOD</hi> three times upon the Child; and at the same time did thrice utter these horrid words, <hi>The Devil harle</hi> (that is <hi>Drag</hi>) <hi>your Soul thro' Hell.</hi> This past on <hi>Munday, August</hi> 17. in presence of several Witnesses, who afterwards gave Evidence of it.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Friday</hi> following, being <hi>August</hi> 21. about Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising, one <hi>Agnes Naismith,</hi> an old ignorant Woman, of a <hi>Malicious</hi> Disposition, addicted to <hi>Threatnings,</hi> (which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were observed to be followed with fatal Events) came to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s House; where finding the said <hi>Christian Shaw</hi> in the Court with her younger Sister, she ask'd <hi>How the Lady and young Child did,</hi> and how old the young sucking Child was? to which <hi>Christian</hi> replied, <hi>What do I know?</hi> Then <hi>Agnes</hi> ask'd, <hi>How she her self did, and how old she was?</hi> to which she answered, that <hi>she was well, and in the eleventh Year of her Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:31747:6"/>On the <hi>Saturday</hi>-night after, being <hi>August</hi> the 22. The said <hi>Christian Shaw</hi> went to Bed in good health; but assoon as she fell asleep, began to struggle and cry, <hi>Help, Help:</hi> And then suddenly got up, and did fly over the top of a bed where she lay, to the great Astonishment of her Parents and others in the Room, with such violence, that probably her Brains had been dasht out, if a Woman, providentially standing by, had not broke the force of the Childs motion; she was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards laid in another Bed, and remained stiff and insensible as if she had been dead, for the space of half an Hour; and for Forty eight Hours after could not sleep, crying out of violent Pains thorow her whole Body, and no sooner began to sleep or turn drowsie but seemed greatly affrighted, crying still <hi>Help, Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this a pain fixt in her left Side, and her Body was often so bent and stiff, that she stood like a Bow on her Feet and Neck at once, and continued without power of Speech, except in some very short intervals, for eight days; during which time, she had scarce half an hours intermission together, the Fits taking her suddenly, and coming on and going off by a Swoon, or short Deliquium, but she appeared perfectly well and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble betwixt whiles.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>September</hi> her Fits returned, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>differing</hi> from the former, wherein she seemed to fight and struggle with something that was invisible to the Spectators; and her Actions appear'd as if she had been defending her self from some who were Assaulting, or Attempting to hurt her, and this with such Force, that Four strong Men were scarcely able to hold her; and when any of the People present touch't any part of her Body, she Cry'd out with such vehemence, as if they had been killing her, but could not speak.</p>
            <p>When she was seized with those Fits, her Parents sent to <hi>Pasley,</hi> for <hi>Iohn Whyte</hi> an Apothecary, their near Relation, and afterwards for Dr. <hi>Iohnston;</hi> who order'd her to be let Blood, and Apply'd several Things to her, without any discernable Effect: All the while of these later Fits she was afflicted with extraordinary Risings and Fallings in her Belly, like the Motion of a pair of Bellows; and with such strange Movings of her Body, as made the Bed she lay on to shake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31747:6"/>Some days after she was able to Speak during her Fits, and Cried, that <hi>Katharine Campbel and Agnes Nasmith were cutting her side, and other parts of her Body;</hi> Which were at that time Violently Tormented: And when the Fit was over she still Asserted, <hi>That she had seen those Persons doing the things which she complained of in her Fit;</hi> (it being observable, that in the Intervals, she was still as well and sensible as ever) and could not believe but that other Persons present saw them as well as she: In this condition she continued with no considerable varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either as to the Fits or Intervals, for the space of a Month.</p>
            <p>After which she was carried to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where Doctor <hi>Brisbane,</hi> an able Physician, order'd Mr. <hi>Henry Marshall,</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, to prepare Medicines for her; So that having stayed in <hi>Glasgow</hi> about Ten days, she was brought home to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had near a Fortnights Intermission. But then her Fits returned, with this difference, that she knew when they were coming, by a Pain in her Left-Side: And in these Fits her Throat was prodigiously drawn down toward her Breast, and her Tongue back into her Throat; her whole Body becoming stiff, and extended as a Dead Corpse, without sense or motion: and sometimes her Tongue was drawn out of her mouth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Chin, to a wonderful length, her Teeth closing so fast upon it, that those about her were forced to thrust some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing betwixt, for saving her Tongue. And it was often observed, that her Tongue was thus Tortured when she attempted to <hi>Pray.</hi> In this condition she was for some time, with sensible Intervals, wherein she had perfect health, and could give a full account of what she was heard to utter while in her Fits. Her Parents resolved to carry her again to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> for the greater conveniency of being under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Inspection and Care, and for the further discovering the Nature of her Distemper, and making use of the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Natural Remedies. But being on her way thither, in her Grand-mothers House at <hi>Northbar,</hi> she thrust, or spit out of her mouth parcels of Hair, some curled, some plaited, some knotted, of different Colours, and in large quantities: And thus she continued to do, with several fainting Fits every quarter of an hour, both in her passage to <hi>Glasgow, Nov.</hi> 12. And after she arrived there, for the space of Three dayes;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31747:7"/>
then from <hi>Munday</hi> to <hi>Thursday</hi> following, she put out of her mouth Coal-finders about the bigness of <hi>Chesnuts,</hi> some of 'em so hot, that they could scarely be handled, as Dr. <hi>Birsbane</hi> Witnesses in his Atttestation. Then for the space of Two days, in her Swooning-sits, there came out of her mouth great Numbers of Straws, by one at a time, folded up, but when out return'd to their Natural Shape; and it was observable, that in one of them there was a Pin: After this there issued out of her mouth Bones of various sorts and sizes, and then some small Sticks of Candle-firr (a sort of Firr in this Countrey that burns like a Candle) one of 'em about Three or four Inches long; which, when any attempted to pull out, they found them either held by her Teeth, fix'd upon them, or forcibly drawn back into her Throat; particularly <hi>Archibald Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natine</hi> of <hi>Kellie,</hi> Junior; observing a bone in her mouth, like that of a Duck's Leg, and essaying to pull it out, he declared he found something drawing it back into her Throat; so that it required a deal of strength to pull it out. It is to be observ'd, that hitherto she knew not how these things were brought into her mouth, and when they were pulled out, she immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately recover'd of her fit for that time. After this there came out of her mouth some quantity of Hay, intermix'd with Dung, as if it bad been taken out of a Dunghil; which stunck so, that the Damsel could not endure the Tast and Smell of it, but was forc'd to wash her mouth with Water. Then for a days space she put out of her mouth a Great number of Feathers of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl; after that a Stone, which, in the Judgment of Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had been passed by some Person in a Fit of the Stone; with some small white Stones, and a whole Nut-gall (with which they use to Dye Cloath and make Ink) also lumps of Candle grease, and Egg-shells: Of all which there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Witnesses.</p>
            <p>When the Sticks above-mention'd came out of her mouth, she foretold that she was to be grievously Tormented with sore Fits that Night, which accordingly fell out: For a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, she fell into a Swoon, wherein she had no use of her Senses: and though the Spectators called to her aloud, and moved her Body, and Mr. <hi>Bannatin</hi> above-named, gave her a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sore Pinch in the Arm, she was not sensible of it. After
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31747:7"/>
she recover'd from the Swoon, but continuing in her Fit, she fell a reasoning with <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <q>Thou sit'st there with a Stick in thy Hand to put in my Mouth; but thorow God's strength thou shalt not get leave: Thou art permitted to Torment me; but I trust in God, thou shalt never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>or a Bible and Candle, said,</hi> come near me <hi>Kate,</hi> and I'll let thee see where a godly Man was given up to Satan to be Tormented: But God kept his Life in His own hand: And so I trust in God, thou shalt never get my Life, and all that thou shalt be permitted to do unto me, I hope thorow God's mercy, shall turn to my Advantage. This Man was Rob'd of All, and Tormented in Body, and had nothing left him but an ill Wife. Come near me <hi>Kate,</hi> and I'll read it to thee. <hi>And reading that Passage of</hi> Job, <hi>when she came to the place where his Wife said to him</hi> Curse God and Dy, <hi>the Damsel considering these words alittle, said;</hi> O! what a Wife was this, that bid her Husband <hi>Curse God and Dy?</hi> she who should have been a comfort to him in his Trouble, turned a Cross to him?</q> 
               <hi>Then after reading of the Chapter to the end, she lookt towards the foot of the Bed and said.</hi> 
               <q>Now <hi>Kate,</hi> what think'st thou of that? Thou seest, for all the power the Devil got over <hi>Iob</hi> he gain'd no Ground on him; and I hope he shall gain as little on me. Thy Master the Devil deceives thee, he is a bad Master whom thou serv'st, and thou shalt find it to thy Sorrow, except thou Repentest; there is no Repentance to be had after Death: I'll let thee see <hi>Kate,</hi> there is no Repentance in Hell,</q> 
               <hi>And turning over the Book citeing</hi> Luke, Chap. 16. <hi>near the latter end, and reading the same said,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Kate</hi> thou seest, there is no Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Hell, for this Rich Man besought <hi>Abraham</hi> to testify to his five Brethren, that they come not to the place of Torment, where he was; but Repent and turn to the Lord, for there is no getting out if once they come there; now <hi>Kate,</hi> thou hear'st this, what think'st thou of it? I'll let thee hear another place, which should pierce thy very Heart, <hi>And turning over the Book said. she would read about</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve, thou know'st <hi>Kate,</hi> the Serpent (the Devil

thy Master) thought to have ruined Mankind at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, his Malice was so great at that blessed State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were, seeing himself cast down from all hopes of Mercy, he used all means possible to subvert their happiness, by suggesting to them fair Promises, and a prospect of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in causing them to Eat of that forbidden Fruit; and were made Subject to God's Curse for ever: But God did not suffer them to remain in this Condition, but of his infinit Mercy shewed to them a better way whereby they might have Life Eternal by revealing to them that blessed Promise, <hi>the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Head of the Serpent.</hi> Now <hi>Kate</hi> what think'st thou of that Promise? But observe this, thou'lt get no Advantage by it, it's not made to thee, who hast renounced God's Service, and Listed thy self under the Devil; thou art his Slave, thou deny'st this; but I know thou art a Hypocrite; for I remember, when thou wast in my Mothers House, thou boughtest a Catechism upon a pretence to learn to Read, to cloak thy Sin: Wilt thou hear me? know'st thou the reward of the Hypocrit? I'll let thee hear it; I remember Mr. <hi>William Gillies</hi> was Lecturing the other day upon the 23 of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where many a wo is pronounced against the Hypocrit, Eight dreadful Wo's here <hi>Kate,</hi> and some of them belongs to thee: But I'll tell thee more, know'st thou the reward of the Hypocrit they shall be cast into the Lake that burns for ever, that's their Portion; do'st thou hear this now? Thou turn'st thy Back to me, when I am telling thee truth; if I were reading a Story-Book, or telling a Tale to thee, thou would'st hear that. Remember it will be thy Portion too, if thou do not Repent, and Confess, and seek Mercy.</q> 
               <hi>Again turning over the Book, she read about</hi> Pilat, <hi>saying;</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Pilat</hi> he made a shew of cleansing himself of Christ's Blood, he wash'd his Hands and declar'd himself Innocent; but for all his washing he had a foul Heart, he would not loose his Office for the saving of Christ's Life: He knew well enough that Christ was an innocent Person; but he perferred his Honour before Christ; Therefore to please the <hi>Iews,</hi> and to quench the strugling in his Conscience, he washt his hands, and then delivered
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31747:8"/>
Christ to be Crucified by them.</q> Thus she continued for more then two Houns space; reasoning at this Rate, and exhorting her to Repent, quoting many places of Scripture, in the Revelations and Evangelists. And when any one offered to take her Bible from her, she uttered dreadful Schreeks and Out-crys, saying, <hi>She would never part with her Bible as long as she liv'd, she would keep it in spight of all the Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we pass from this it will be needful to give the Reader notice of some few things. 1. That while she call'd for her Bible and a Candle, she neither heard nor saw any of those Persons who were then actually and discernably present in the Room with her, and that <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> to whom she directed her speech was not discernably present to any Body but her self. And the pinch Mr. <hi>Bannatine</hi> gave her in her insensible fit, she complain'd of afterward, but knew not how she came by it, nor did she blame any of her tormentors for it. 2. That these words set down as spoke by her, were the very same both for words and order as nearly as they could be gathered and remembred by the hearers, without any addition of their own. 3. That altho she was a Girl of a pregnant Spirit above her age, knew much of the Scriptures, and had a pretty good understanding, above what might be expected of one of her years, of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of Religion; yet we doubt not but in so strong a Combat, the Lord did by His good Spirit graciously afford her a more then ordinary measure of Assistance.</p>
            <p>Sometime after the trash above-mentioned issued out of her mouth she fell into extream violent fits, with lamentable out-crys, four Persons being hardly able to hinder her from Climbing up the Walls of the Chamber, or from doing her self hurt, in the mean time she had no power to speak, her back and the rest of her Body was grievously pained, and in this condition she continued four or five days with the usual intervals: During which she declared, that four men, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Iames Anderson,</hi> and other two (of whom she gave particular and exact marks, but knew not their names) were tormenting her. It was observ'd, that many of those she named were known to be Persons of ill fame, as were these
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31747:9"/>
two Persons last mention'd: It is also remarkable, that for some time she knew not the name of the said <hi>Alexander Anderson,</hi> till one day that he came a begging to the door of the house, where she was, then she immediatly cryed out, <hi>that was he whom she had seen among the Crew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this she fell into other Fits, wherein she saw the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before-named, with some others, and heard and saw several things that past among them. Particularly, she sometimes foretold when she was to have the sits, and how often she should have them, (which fell out accordingly.)</p>
            <p>About the Eighth of <hi>December,</hi> being brought home again from <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and having had six or seven days respite from her Fits, she fell into a frightful and terrible Relapse: The occasion whereof she declar'd to be, her seeing the Devil in Prodigious and Horrid Shapes, threatning to devour her; she would fall down dead, and became stiff, with all the parts of her Body stretcht out, like a Corpse, without sense or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; those Fits came suddenly, without her knowledge, and she did as suddenly recover and grow perfectly well; and they usually came on her when she offer'd to Pray: Sometimes she knew when the other Fits were a coming, how long they would continue, and when they would return: In which Fits her eyes alter'd strangely, and turned in her head, to the Admiration of the Spectators, with a continual Pain about her Heart; sometimes her Joynts were contracted together, and her Forehead drawn forcibly about toward her Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; these Fits she took by falling into a Swoon, and would instantly recover in the same manner. During this time her Fits alter'd again, as to their Times of Coming, and Continuance, in which she sometimes endeavour'd to bite her own fingers, or any thing else that came in her way; she did the like when she saw the Persons before-mentioned, or any one of them about her, she would Point out where they were to the People with her, but they could not see them; and sometimes she declared, that she had hold of them by their Cloaths. Particularly, <hi>December</hi> 17. being in a sore Fit, she cry'd out of several Persons that were Tormenting her; and being in the Bed, grasped with her hands towards the Foot of it, and cry'd out, that she had catched hold of the sleeves
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31747:9"/>
of one <hi>I. P's.</hi> Jerkin (or Jacket) which was, as she said, ragged at the Elbows: And, at that very time, the Damsels Mother and Aunt heard the sound of the rending or tearing of a Cloth, but saw nothing, only they found in each of the Girles hands a bit of Red Cloth, which lookt as if it had been torn off of a Garment; of which kind of Cloth there was none in the Room, nor in any part of the House: At the same time she told them, there was such an one among the Crew going to Pinch her Tongue, which was thereupon instantly pull'd back into her Throat, and she lay Dumb for a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable space. Sometimes after her Recovery from her Fits, she told that she heard several things spoken by her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, but durst not make them known, because they threatned to Torment her more if she did; and accordingly when her Mother or others prevailed with her to tell them any thing, she was instantly tormented. She added that her Tormentors appear'd to her usually with Lights and strange sorts of Candles, which were frightful to look on.</p>
            <p>Thus she continued till the first of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1697. in such fits as before-mention'd with some alterations, and had likewise other swooning Fits, wherein she continued for two or three hours together, sometimes more, sometimes less, with very short Intervals, in which Fits she did not complain much of pain; but had a great palpitation in her breast, and sometimes strange and unaccountable motions in other parts of her Body, which continued in a greater or lesser degree during the whole time of the Fit, wherein she was somewhat light-headed, and not so solid in her mind as at other times; tho in the Intervals of these, as of all other fits she was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed enough, and these Fits, as all the rest, came suddenly on and went as suddenly off by a Swoon.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed any further it is fit to observe, 1. That <hi>Agnes Naismith</hi> before-mentioned, being brought by the Parents a second time to see the Girl, did (without being desired) pray <hi>that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth might send the Damsel her health and discover the truth:</hi> After which, the Child declared that tho the said <hi>Agnes</hi> had formerly been very troublesome to her; yet, from that time forward she did no more appear to her, as her Tormentor; but as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31747:10"/>
she thought defended her from the fury of the rest. 2. That <hi>Katharine Campbel,</hi> before-mentioned, could by no means be prevailed with to pray for the Damsel, but on the contrary cursed them and all the Family of <hi>Bargarren,</hi> and in particular the Damsel and all that belonged to her, with this grievous Imprecation; <hi>The Devil let her never grow better, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in her be in a better condition then she was in, for what they had done to her.</hi> Which words she spoke before diverse credible Witnesses. 3. That <hi>Bargarren</hi> having prevailed with the under Sheriff to imprison the said <hi>Katharine Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> she never after appear'd to the Damsel, (tho formerly she was one of her most violent Tormentors) except once or twice, when it was found upon enquiry, that she was not in the Prison, but either in the Jaylors house, or when she had liberty to go to Church. 4. That at the time when the Damsel voided at her mouth the hair and other trash as above related, <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> being taken into custody, there was found in her pocket a ball of hair of several colours, which being thrown into the Fire the Child from that time forward vomited no more hair, she declared that she heard her Tormentors say that <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> made the Ball, of the hair cut off of <hi>Christians</hi> head when her trouble began.</p>
            <p>Upon the first day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> about ten a clock at night, she swoon'd and fell into Fits differing from the former, in that, after her swooning was over she lay still as if she had been dead, yet at the same time she was heard talking mournfully with a low Voice, and repeating several Storys in meeter, which they thought to be an account of the Rise and Progress of her own trouble; and thus she continued (naming some of the forementioned Persons at times) till her Parents and others offered to Rouze her, by Touching and Moving her Body, whereupon she uttered horrid Shreeks, and cry'd as if she had been pierced thorow with Swords, and assaulted for her Life. After this she fell a Singing, Leaping and Dancing for a long time, laughing with a loud Voice, in an unusual manner, tearing down the Hangings of the Bed, and pulling off her Head-cloaths; in which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances she was acted with such Force and Strength that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31747:10"/>
her Father and the Minister tho joyning their whole Strength, could not hinder her from Dancing and Leaping. But after Prayer, the Minister finding her Composed, enquired if she remembered what she had done in the time of the Fit; to which she reply'd, That she distinctly remembered her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages, and in particular her Singing and Dancing, adding, that the Witches enclosed her in a Ring (or Circle) and Dancing and Singing about her, was the occasion of her Dancing, which she then gladly performed with the rest. For some days after she had Fits much after the same manner, with some small variation: In one of 'em she tore off her Head-cloaths, and would have stript her self of all her Cloaths if she had been permitted.</p>
            <p>About the Eleventh of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> she fell into Fits different from the former, in which she was carried away from her Parents and others that were about her, with a sudden flight, and the first time (to their great amazement) thorow the Chamber and Hall down a long winding Stair towards the Tower-gate, with such a swift and unaccountable motion, that it was not in the power of any to prevent her, her Feet did not touch the Ground, so far as any of the Beholders could discern; and as she went she was heard to laugh in an unusual manner: But by Divine Providence the Gate being shut, her motion was stopt till such time as some of the Family could overtake her, who endeavouring to carry her back, she immediately fell down and became stiff like a dead Corps, and being brought back to her Chamber, lay so for a considerable space: upon her recovery she declar'd, that there were about Nine or Ten Persons who carried her away as if she had been in a Swing, wherein she then took pleasure, her Feet not at all touching the Ground, to her apprehension.</p>
            <p>The Night following she was suddenly carried away, as before, from her Parents and others thro the Chamber and Hall, and sixteen large steps of a winding Stair towards the top of the House, where she met with Apparitions of strange and unaccountable things, but was carried down again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> she thought in a swing by six Women and four Men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> up as formerly with all the parts of her Body distended and stiff
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31747:11"/>
like one dead; she lay so for some time, and when recover'd, declared, that both then and before, she had endeavoured to open the Gate, and that those she saw about her helped her, with a design to get her to the Court to drown her in the Well, which she heard them say they intended to do, and that then the World would believe she had destroyed her self. It is observable that in one of these fits afterwards, she was stopt at the Gate, tho it was not bolted nor lock'd, yet the Providence of God order'd it so that neither she nor her Tormentors could open it so that they left her there as usual.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed further, it is fit to take notice that as soon as the Damsels affliction was observ'd to be extraordinary and preternatural there was (besides former private Prayers and Fasts by the Family) at the desire of the Parents and Minister of the Parish, and by the Presbytries special order, a Minister or two appointed to meet one day every Week to joyn with the Family, the Minister of the Parish and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Christians of the Neighbourhood, in Fasting and Praying. And on the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> it being the turn of Mr. <hi>Patrick Simpson</hi> a Neighbouring Minister to be there; when he came he found the Minister of the Parish, and the other who was to joyn with him absent upon Necessary Occasions, yet resolved to carry on the Work with the assistance of three Elders and some other good People that were present. When he first saw the Damsel he found her under some lesser Fits which came and went off quickly: she was quiet and sober during Prayer, but in time of singing the 93 <hi>Psalm</hi> she fell into a sore Fit, of greater continuance, first Laughing, then making a sound like Singing, after that pulling her head-Cloathes over her Face, and lastly turning so outragious in her Motions that her Father could scarce hold her till the Fit abated: After her Recovery she was quiet and composed all the time of Prayer, and while the Minister Lectur'd on <hi>Mark</hi> 9. from 14. <hi>verse</hi> to the 30. was very Attentive, carefully looking for the Scriptures quoted, and so continued till the Religious exercise was ended, and sometime after, when she acquainted the Company that she had something to tell which she heard some among her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31747:11"/>
say; but durst not reveal it; upon which the Minister and her Mother urg'd her to be free and not to obey the Devil, but before she got a Sentence fully pronunced in her Mothers Ear, she fell into a violent Fit, so as her Mother and others could scarcely hold her till the Violence thereof began to abate, and then her Mother told the Company that she was speaking of a Meeting and a Feast her Tormentors had spoken of in the Orchard of <hi>Bargarran,</hi> but was able to say no more. After her Recovery, her Mother desir'd her to tell the rest of it, and she began again to Wisper in her Ear, but could not get one word uttered till she was seiz'd again with a Fit, as violent as the former, whereupon the Minister desired them to forbear troubling her any further. But it was observed afterwards that <hi>Elizabeth Anderson, Iames Lindsay</hi> and <hi>Thomas Lindsay,</hi> three of those that tormented her confessed that they and others had a meeting in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard at that time, tho neither of 'em knew what the Girl had said, or what the others had confessed concerning it.</p>
            <p>A little after this, she was again suddenly carried from them down a Stair, which goes off from a Corner of the Chamber to a Celler just below it, whether her Brother and Sister were providentially gone a little before, to bring some drink with a lighted Candle, which she soon put out: But they crying and holding her by the Head-Cloaths, quickly discovered to the rest where she was. Upon which Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander King</hi> Minister of <hi>Bonnil</hi> made hast down Stairs where her Brother and Sister had lost their hold of her; but Mr. <hi>King</hi> having caught hold of her again, keept her in his Arms till another Candle was brought, and endeavoring to bring her up Stairs, declared that he found something forcibly draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her downwards, but still keeping his hold, she fell as one Dead upon the Stairs, and being carried up and laid in Bed, she lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so for a considerable space. When recovered from her Fit, she declar'd that the Occasion of her going down Stairs with such Force, was, that the Crew had suggested to her while she was light-headed, that the Devil was in the Meal Chist in the Celler, and that if she would go down and put out the Candle, she might force him out of it. When some Fits of this kind were ready to seize her, she now and then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31747:12"/>
gave notice thereof to those that were present and earnestly desired their help to prevent her Motion, which usually proved to be of good effect, wherein the Divine Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her is much to be observed. When she was in these flying Fits, she used to utter horrid Shreeks and crys not like those of Rational Creatures: and there were heard for three nights together, when the Damsel was asleep in Bed, Shreeks and crys of the same kind in the Court, when none of the Family was without Doors, to the great afrightment of those that heard them, because they exactly resembled the Crys and Shreeks the Girl used to utter in her Fits; and in one of her Intervals hearing the Family talking of those Crys and Shreeks, and alledging they had been uttered by some wild beast or other, she told them they were mistaken, for it was <hi>Margaret</hi> and two others of the name of <hi>Margaret</hi> call'd by the Crew their <hi>Maggi's,</hi> that uttered those Shreeks, the Devil having promised to them at that time to carry her out of the House that they might drown her in the Well, where there were eighteen more waiting for her.</p>
            <p>After this she fell into freting and angry fits, in which she was cross to all those about her, nothing they did or said proving to her satisfaction; but when restored to a right composure of mind, she declar'd that her Tormentors did still suggest to her and advise her to go to such and such remote places of the house alone, and bring with her a String or Cravat or some such thing, promising her Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and other sweet-meats, and bid her bring her apron with her to hold them in, and accordingly when she was seiz'd again with fits of this nature she did resolutly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to repair to those places with a String, Cravat and Apron, and would suffer none to be in her Company, which put her Parents and others under a necessity of detaining her by force, and being thus prevented she would utter hideous Shreeks and crys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thursday Ianuary 14th.</hi> at night a young Girl appear'd to her with a scabbed face amongst the rest of her Tormentors, telling her she was to come to the house to morrow about ten a clock, and forbidding her to reveal it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:31747:12"/>The next day in the afternoon the Damsel earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at her Mother and the rest of the Family what Beggars had come to the gate that day, and of what Countenance and visage they were? But not knowing her design in such a question, they gave no heed to it; yet she still insisting on it, and being in Company with her Mother and another Gentlewoman, about four a clock at night she said to them, she thought she might tell them somewhat (the time being now past) that she was forbidden to reveal; but as she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to tell it, she presently fell a crying that she was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pricked thorow her whole Body, however recovering from her fit, she went on and told 'em that a scabbed-fac'd Lass appear'd to her yester-night and was to be at the gate this day at ten a Clock. Whereupon the Servants being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at what sort of Beggers had been there that day, they declar'd that among others, there had been a begger Woman at the door and a young Lass with her who had Scabs on her Face, and receiv'd their Alms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary, 16th</hi> and <hi>17th,</hi> When recovered of her swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits, she voided at her Mouth a great number of Pins, which she declared <hi>I— P.—</hi> and a Gentlewoman, who had been always one of her most violent Tormentors, had forc'd into her Mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary</hi> 21, Her Fits altered again, after this manner, she would fall into them with heavy Sighs and Groans and hideous Out-crys, telling those about her that Cats, Ravens, Owles and Horses were destroying and pressing her down in the Bed: And at the same time her Mother and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlewoman being in the Room with her, did declare that immediatly after they had taken the Girl out of her Bed in this condition, they did see something moving under the Bed-cloaths as big as a Cat.</p>
            <p>The same Morning in the interval of her Fits, she said, she heard her Tormentors Whisper amongst themselves, and suggest to one another, (naming <hi>I— P.—</hi> the <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and others) that the Devil had promised and engaged to them, to carry her out at the Hall Window, to the end they might Drown her in the Well which was in the court; and then they said the World would believe she had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31747:13"/>
her self; and the same day and several days after, when seiz'd with her Grievous Fits, she did attempt with such force to get out at that Window, that the Spectators could scarcely with their whole strength prevent her.</p>
            <p>About this time, nothing in the World would so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose her as Religious Exercises, if there were any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of God or Christ, or any of the things which are not seen and are Eternal, she would be cast into grievous Agonies; and when she assayed in her milder Fits to read any portion of the Scriptures, repeat any of the Psalms, or answer any Questions of the Catechisms (which she could do exactly well at other times) she was suddenly struck Dumb and lay as Dead, her Mouth opened to such a Wideness that her Jaws seem'd to be out of joynt, and anon they would clap together again with incredible Force. The same happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Shoulder blade, her Elbow, and wrists. She would at other times ly in a benum'd Condition, and drawn together as if she had been ty'd Neck and Heels with Ropes; and on a sudden would with such Force and Violence be pull'd up, and Tear all about her, that it was as much as one or two could do to hold her in their Arms: But when Ministers and other good Christians (seeing her in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Anguish) made serious Application by Prayer to God on her behalf, she had respite from her greivous Fits of this kind, and was ordinarly free of them during most of the time of Prayer, tho seiz'd by them before; usually when Ministers began to Pray she made great disturbance by idle lowd talk, Whistling, Singing, and Roaring, to drown the Voice of the person praying. Particularly <hi>Ianuary</hi> 22. She was more Turbulent then at other times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued some space after the Minister began to Pray, Singing and making a hideous Noise, fetching furious Blows with her Fist, and Kicks with her Feet at the Minister, uttering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Talk to him, and calling him Dog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Compos'd, and her Fits over before Prayer was ended, the Minister, when he had done, finding her Sober and in a right Composure of Mind, enquired why she made such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance? She reply'd, she was forc't to do it by the Hellish Crue about her, and that she thought they were none of her own words that she uttered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:31747:13"/>
               <hi>Ianuary 24th.</hi> She said that some things relating both to her self and to others had been suggested to her by her Troublers; but that they had threatned to Torment her if she should offer to make them known. And accordingly as she Essay'd to express her Mind, she was cast into two grievous Fits, in which she cry'd out of violent pains; all the parts of her Body becoming stiff and extended like a Corps, her Head was twisted round, and if any Person offered by force to obstruct such dangerous Motions, she would roar out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; sometimes her Neck-bone seem'd to be dislocated, and yet on a sudden became so stiff that there was no moving of it; and when those grevious Agonys were over, she again Essay'd to express her Mind in Writing, but to no purpose; for she was cast instantly into other two very grievous Fits, wherein she was struck Dumb, Deaf and Blind, and her Tongue drawn to a prodigeous length over her Chin. And when the Fits were over she declar'd, that the <hi>Andersons I. P.</hi> the Gentlewoman, and <hi>I. D.</hi> with the rest of the Hellish Crew, some of whom she could not name, had been Tormenting her in her Fits, and that there had been fifteen of them about the House all last Night; but were now all gone save one who was to stay about the House till her Fits were over. And accordingly her Brother and Sister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they saw in the Morning a Woman in the Garden with a red Coat about her Head, sitting at the Root of an Apple-Tree; but <hi>Bargarren</hi> with most of the Servants being abroad, that Matter was not further search't into.</p>
            <p>That same day about Six at Night, she was seiz'd with variety of greivous Fits, in which sometimes she lay wholly Senseless and Breathless, with her Belly swel'd like a Drum, her Eyes were pul'd into her Head so far that the Spectators thought she should never have us'd them more, sometimes when she was tying her own Neck-cloaths, her enchanted Hands would tye them so strait that she had certainly strangled her self if the Spectators had not prevented her; sometimes she offered with violence to throw her self into the Fire, and divers times she struck furiously at her near Relations. In her Fits she'd maintain Discourse with her Tormentors, ask Questions concerning her self and others and receive
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31747:14"/>
answers from them; which none but her self could hear: She Reasoned particularly with one of them after this manner; <q>O what ail'd thee to be a Witch! thou say'st it is but three Nights since thou wast a Witch, O if thou would'd Repent, it may be God might give thee Repentance, if thou would'st seek it, and Confess; if thou would desire me I would do what I could; for the Devil is an ill Master to serve, he is a Lyer from the beginning, he promises but he cannot perform. Then calling for her Bible, she said, I'll let thee see where he promised to our first Parents, that they should not Dye, <hi>And reading the passage, said,</hi> now thou seest he is a Lier; for by breaking of the Commandment, they were made liable to Death here and Death everlasting. O that's an Uncouth word; long Eternity never to have an end, never never to have an end: Had not God of his infinite Mercy, ordain'd some to Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. The Devil makes thee believe thou wilt get great Riches by serving him;</q> but come near, and having uttered this word she lost the power of her Speech, her Tongue being drawn back into her Throat; yet beckning with her Hand to the Spectre to come near her, and turning over the Book, kep't her Eye upon that passage of Holy Scripture, <hi>Iob.</hi> 27. 18. And pointing with her Finger at the place, and shaking her Head, turn'd over the Book again. <q>And recovering Speech, said, I'll let thee see where God bids us seek and we shall find, and reading over the place said, it is God that gives us every good Gift, we have nothing of our own, I submit to his will tho I never be better; for God can make all my trouble turn to my Advantage, according to his Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</q> which place she then read, and thus continued Reasoning, for the space of an Hour.</p>
            <p>Sometimes she cry'd out of violent pain, by reason of furious Blows and Strokes she had received from the Hands of her Tormentors, the Noise of which those that stood by heard distinctly, tho they perceiv'd not the Hands that gave them. One Night sitting with her Parents and others, she cry'd out <hi>something was wounding her Thigh;</hi> upon which, instantly her Mother putting her Hand in the Damsels Pocket, found her folding Knife open'd, which had been folded when put into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31747:14"/>
her Pocket, but her Uncle not believing the thing; did again put up the Knife and leaving it folded in her Pocket on a sudden she cry'd out as before, <hi>that the Knife was cutting her Thigh, being unfolded by the means of</hi> I. P. <hi>and others:</hi> Upon which her Uncle searching her Pocket, found the Knife open'd as formerly. This happened twice or thrice to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the Beholders, who took special Notice that neither she her self nor any other visible Hand opened it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary 25th.</hi> She was again seiz'd with her Swooning Fits, with this remarkable Variation; her Throat was sometimes most prodigiously extended, and sometimes as strangely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, so that she appear'd in palpable danger of being Choak't, and through the violence of pain in her Throat and difficulty of Breathing struggled with her Feet and Hands, as if some body had been actually Strangling her, and she could neither speak nor cry out to any; with these kind of Fits she was frequently seiz'd for several days; and in the intervals declar'd that the fore-mention'd persons, and others (whom she could not then name) were strangling her, and that the occasion of her not having power to speak or cry in the Fit, was a Ball in her Throat, which also was visible to the Spectators; for they did clearly discern a Bunch in her Throat (while in the Fit) as big as a <hi>Pullets</hi> Egg which had almost Choak't her.</p>
            <p>Sometimes she was kep't from eating her Meat; having her Teeth close together when she carried any food to her Mouth. Also she was diverse times kept from Drinking when at Meat; no sooner tasting the Drink, but she was in hazard to be Choak't; sometimes she held the Cup so hard betwixt her Teeth, that it was not in the power of those that were with her to unloose it. And when any thing had fallen out amiss in the place where she was, as the falling and breaking of a Cup, any Body's receiving harm or the like; she would fall a laughing and rejoyce extremely; which was far from her temper at other times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February 1st.</hi> She attempted to tell some things that she had been forbidden by her Tormentors, upon which she was grievously Tormented; at the beginning of her Fits she would look odly; sometimes towards the Chimney, sometimes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31747:15"/>
towards other places of the Room, but could not always tell what she saw; yet ordinarily she'd Name such and such Persons, who, she said were then come to cast her into Fits. And when any desired her to cry to the Lord Jesus for help, her Teeth were instantly set closs, her Eyes twisted almost round, and she was thrown upon the Floor in the posture of one that had been some days laid out for Dead: And on a sudden she would recover again, and weep bitterly to think what had befal'n her. That same day, when her Fits were over, she said, she perceiv'd it was by means of a Charm, that such Restraints were laid upon her as she could not tell what the Witches had forbidden her to make known, but the Charm might be found out (as she said) by searching beneath the Bed where she lay; and having quickly done it her self, she found (to the apprehension of the Spectators) an Egg-shell open in the end, which being thrown into the Fire, did melt after the manner of Wax, without any such Noise as Egg-shells use to make when thrown into the Fire. After this she said, she should not now be handled so severely, upon Essaying to make known what the Witches had forbidden her, only her Tongue would be drawn back into her Throat, which accordingly happened. She did likewise inform her Friends of many things she had not liberty to do before the Charm was found out, particularly that her Tormentors had frequently solicited her to become a Witch her self, and promised her great Riches, and perfect Health to induce her thereunto. Which Tentation, she through the infinit Mercy of God still resisted, reasoning with them after this manner: <q>The Devil promises what he cannot perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and granting he could fulfill his promises; yet I am sure from the Scriptures, Hell and the Wrath of God will be the final reward of all such as yeild to this Wickedness.</q> 
               <hi>To which she receiv'd this reply (which indeed none but her self could hear) that</hi> 
               <q>Hell and the Wrath of God so much talk't of, was not so formidable as represented.</q> She also said, the Witches had Importunatly urged her to give her Consent to the taking away the Life of her young Sister, who was at that time upon her Mothers breast; which Tentation also she was enabled throw the Grace of God to resist. She told
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31747:15"/>
her Parents likeways, there had been a Charm laid upon the top of the House where her young Sister was (the Child having been sent out to nursing by reason of the continued Affliction of the Family) and that the Charm had been plac'd there by <hi>pinch'd Maggi,</hi> who thereby did design the taking away of her Sisters Life; and that this was the Cause why she had so often for some Weeks before desired her Mother to bring home her Sister, constantly affirming, that the Child would daily decay as long as she stayed there: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon her Parents observing the decay of the Infant; even to Skin and Bone, they brought her home, where she recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the Girl being asked how she came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these things? Reply'd, that something speaking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly as it were over her Head, had suggested these and other things of that Nature to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February 2d.</hi> Being in the Chamber with her Mother and others, she was on a sudden struck with great Fear and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation; and fell a trembling, upon the sight of one <hi>Iohn Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Barcloch,</hi> talking with her Father in the Hall. She told her Mother, the foresaid <hi>Lindsay</hi> had been always one of her most Violent Tormentors, and that she had been threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with extreame Tortures, if she should offer to Name him; whereupon she was desired to go toward the place where he was, and touch some part of his Body, unknown to him, which having done, with some Aversation, she was instantly seiz'd with extreame Tortures in all the parts of her Body. After which <hi>Lindsay</hi> was Examin'd thereupon; but giving no satisfying Answer, was desir'd to take the Damsel by the Hand, which being unwillingly prevail'd with to do, she was immediately, upon his Touch, cast into Intolerable Anguish, her Eyes almost twisted round, and all the parts of her Body becoming stiff, she fell down in the posture of one that for some days had been Dead, and afterwards got up on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and tearing her Cloaths, threw her self with violence upon him, and when her Fits were over, the Spectators did also take the Damsel by the Hanud, but no such effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>About Six at Night there came an Old Highland Fellow to <hi>Bagarren,</hi> who calling himself a Weary Traveller, said, He
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31747:16"/>
behooved to Lodge there that Night; but the Servants refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him Lodging, gave him something by way of Almes. At this time the Damsel being in the Chamber with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and another Gentlewoman, said, To her best apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there was one of the Wicked Crew in or about the House at that time; whereupon her Mother made hast with her Daughter down Stairs toward the Kitchen. And finding there unexpectedly the Highland Fellow, whom the Girle then Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, as one of her Tormentors, she desir'd him to take her Daughter by the Hand, which he being urg'd to do, the Girle immediately, upon his Touch, was grievously Tormented in all the parts of her Body. Whereupon <hi>Bargarran</hi> gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to secure him. The next Morning the Minister being come to visit the Damsel, called for the Highland Fellow, and having Examin'd him about this matter, without any satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Answer, he brought the Child out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he Chamber, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her Face, and almost her whole Body with his Cloak; and giving Signs to the Highland Fellow to touch her in this Posture, as he had Order'd him before, without the Damsels knowledge, he did it with great Aversion; and the Girle not knowing of his Touch, was instantly cast into Intollerable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies; yet others afterwards touching her, no such event followed. And when her Fits were over, she besought the Highfand Fellow to allow her the Liberty to Discover the Persons that Haunted and Molested her, whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden her to make known: Upon which the Old Fellow looking at her with an Angry Countenance, her mouth was instantly stop't, and her Teeth sett: But being desired by those present to speak her mind freely; whether he would or not, at length she Reply'd, That she was Affraid to do it. And when by the Importunity of the Lairds of <hi>Darga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> and <hi>Porterfield</hi> of <hi>Fulwood,</hi> and some other Gentlemen there present, she Essay'd to declare her mind, she was seiz'd with her Fits again.</p>
            <p>Before this time, the lamentable Case of the Afflicted Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Family had been Represented to His Majesty's most Honourably Privy-Council, who, upon serious Application made to them, granted a Commission to a Noble Lord, and some worthy Gentlemen, to make Enquiry into the matter.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31747:16"/>
By vertue of this Commission some suspected Persons were seiz'd; particularly on <hi>February</hi> 4. <hi>Alexander Anderson</hi> (an Ignorant, Irreligious Fellow, who had been always of evil Fame, and accused by the afflicted Damsel) was by a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Order from the Commissioners for Enquiry, apprehended and committed to Prison; as was also <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> his Daughter, upon strong Presumptions of Witchcraft; for the other Year <hi>Iean Fulton</hi> her Grand-mother, an Old scandalous Woman, being Cited before the Kirk Session, and accus'd for Cursing, and Imprecating mischief upon several Persons, which had been followed with fatal Events; the fore mentioned <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> her Grand child, who liv'd in the House with her, did declare before the Session, she had frequently seen the Devil in company with her Grand mother, in the likeness of a small black Man, and that he usually vanished on a sudden, when any Body came to the Door. Upon this Presumption was the said <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> seiz'd with her Father, and committed to Custody; but at first most obstinatly denied any manner of accession to the Sin of Witchcraft, until afterwards, that being seriously importun'd in Prison by two Gentlemen, she did, before she came to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s House, confess her Guilt. And that she had been at several Meetings with the Devil and Witches, and, amongst others, she Accus'd her own Father, and the fore-mention'd High-land Fellow, to have been Active Instruments in the Girl's Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and before she was Confronted with him, gave exact Marks of this Highland Man, tho' she knew not his Name; yet when she saw him did Accuse him, and Affirm'd he was the Person she spoke of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February 5th.</hi> A Quorum of the Commissioners being met at <hi>Bargarran,</hi> and the Persons then Accused by <hi>Elizabeth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> to have been at <hi>Meetings</hi> with the Devil, and Active Instruments of the Damsels Trouble, Viz. <hi>Alexander Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> her Father, <hi>Agnes Nasmith, Margaret Fulton, Iames Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> alias Curat, <hi>Katharine Campbel,</hi> were all of them Confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> before the Lord <hi>Blantyre,</hi> and the rest of the Commissioners, and several other Gentlemen of Note and <hi>Ministers;</hi> and Accused by her as her Tormentors. And they having all severally Touched her in the Presence of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31747:17"/>
Commissioners, she was, at each of their Touches, seiz'd with Grievous Fits, and cast into Intollerable Agonies; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then present did also Touch her, in the same manner, but no such effect followed. And it is Remarkable, that when <hi>Katharine Cambel</hi> touched the Girle, she was immediately seiz'd with more grievous Fits, and cast into more Intollerable Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than upon the Touch of the other Accused Persons; whereat <hi>Cambel</hi> her self being Daunted and Confounded, tho' she had formerly declined to Bless her, uttered these Words; <hi>The Lord God of Heaven and Earth Bless thee, and save thee both Soul and Body;</hi> after which, the Damsel, when the Fits were over, in which she had lain a most pitiful Spectacle, did declare she was now loos'd, and that she might freely Touch any of the Accus'd Persons, or they her after this, without Trouble, which accordingly, upon Trial, fell out: And being enquired how she came to the knowledge of that, answered as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the like Case; That something Speaking distinctly as it were over Head, suggested this to her; And likewise, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually gave her the Knowledge of the Names of her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, and Places in which they Liv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 6. The Girle being seiz'd with sore Fits, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was seen in her mouth like pieces of Orange-Pills, which were Invisibly convey'd thither; she seem'd; in her Agonies to Chew them; and having got them down her Throat, she fell down as if she had been Choak't, strugling with her Feet and Hands, and at the last Gasp, and her Throat swelling in a Prodigious manner, to the Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spectators; when she recover'd she was Light-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for some time, and would say, O it was a very sweet Orange-Pill which I got from the Gentlewoman; declaring also, that there had been others there, particularly <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet L.</hi> or Pinch't <hi>Maggi,</hi> whose Sirname she had neither Power nor Liberty to express, neither durst she of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>er to do it, least she should be Tormented as was Threatned, and alwayes came to pass when she Essay'd to do it, either by speaking or writing, as had appear'd the day before in presence of the Commissioners.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Thomas Lindsay,</hi> a young Boy, not yet Twelve Years of Age, was seiz'd, upon strong Presumptions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31747:17"/>
of Witchcraft; he had said before several credible Persons, that the Devil was his Father, and if he pleas'd he could fly in the likeness of a Crow, up to the mast of a Ship; he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caus'd a Plough to stand, and the Horses to break their Yokes upon the pronouncing of some words, and turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about from the right-hand to the left, contrary to the Natural course of the Sun. This he would do upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of any Body for a half-penny. Upon these and the like Presumptions he was Apprehended, and at first continu'd most obstinate in denyal; yet afterwards confess'd to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> in his own House, before Credible Witnesses, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the Devil, and that he had receiv'd the Insensible mark from him, which is visible upon his Body: As also, that he had been at several meetings with the Devil and Witches, where he said were present his Brother <hi>Iames,</hi> with others, and particularly those who had been Accus'd by <hi>Anderson.</hi> This he Confest, with some others of the like kind, before he was Committed to Custody.</p>

               <hi>February</hi> 11. There was by the Presbitry's Appointment a Publick Fast kept on the Damsels account in the Church of <hi>Erskine,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> Minister of the Place, begun with Prayer, Expounding <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. from <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. to <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. Mr. <hi>Iames Hutchison</hi> Minister at <hi>Killellan</hi> took the next turn of Prayer, and Preach'd on 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Work, Preaching on <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20, 21. The Girl was present all Day; and before she came to Church that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, told, That while she was in one of her Fits the Night before, she heard the Devil speaking of that Publick Fast, and what Ministers were to be there; and that the Old Man Mr. <hi>Iames Hutchison,</hi> should stumble, and his Peruick fall off as he went up to the Pulpit, and all the People should Laugh at him; and he should break his Neck in going home. And when she came out of the Church, she said, The Devil was a Liar, for no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uch thing fell out as he had threatned. She was all Day very quiet in Church; though troubled with some of her light Fits, during which some Spectres appear'd, as she told afterwards.</p>
            <p>About Six at Night there were present in the Chamber with the Damsel, Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> with his Wife, the Lady <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr;</hi> and others, discoursing and conferring about her Case; and while they were thus conferring together, she told them, she would gladly make some things known, if she durst, for her Tormenters; and afterwards attempting to do it, was instantly seiz'd with a violent Fit; in which she leapt strait up, and appear'd as if she had been choak'd, so that it was as much as one or two could do, to hold her fast in their Armes: And when the Fit was over, Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Family Worship, did Expound <hi>Psalm</hi> 110. and speaking of the limitted power of the Adversaries of our Lord JESUS CHIST, from the latter part of <hi>Verse</hi> 1. she was on a sudden seiz'd with another grievous Fit, and some Blood issued from her mouth, which rais'd Grounds of Fear and Jealousy in the minds of the Spectators, as to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it; yet they could not get her mouth open'd, her Teeth being close set. And in the Interval of the Fit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ask'd, If she found any thing in her mouth that had been the occasion of that Blood; she reply'd, She found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31747:18"/>
nor knew not the Cause of it; but opening her mouth, they found one of her Double-Teeth newly drawn; yet tho' search was made for the same, it could not be found: After which the Minister proceeded upon the same Subject, but was again interrupted by her renewed Fits, yet closed the Exercise with Prayer; after which she was taken to Bed, without any farther Trouble that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 12. <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Martha Semple,</hi> being accused by the three that had Confessed, and accused by the Girl to have been active Instruments in her Trouble, came of their own accord to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s House, and before they came up Stairs the Girl said, she was now bound up, and could not accuse <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> to her Face: And accordingly the Girl's Mother having desired some of those who were sitting by her to feel her Body, they found her so stiff and inflexible, that there was no moving of it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly again found some parts of her Body contracted and drawn hard, as if by Cords; after this <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> and her Daughter, having gone to the Chamber to the Girl; did in presence of the Ministers and others, desire the Damsel to come to her; for she<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would do her no Harm, and laying her Arms about her, spake very fairly to her, and question'd her if ever she had seen her or her Daughter amongst her Tormentors, to which the Girl did positively reply, she had frequently seen her Daughter; but declined throw fear to accuse her self, saying faintly <hi>No;</hi> after which <hi>Margaret</hi> and her Daughter returning into the Hall, and the Minister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring at her why she said <hi>No,</hi> seeing she had accus'd her before, she answered, you must take my meaning to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, upon which she was seiz'd with a grievous Fit; and after her recovery being urg'd again to tell her Mind freely, whether or not <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> was one of her Tormentors, the Child thereupon Essaying to say <hi>Yes,</hi> and having half pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Word, was cast into unexpressible Anguish; and again in the interval of the Fit, she Essay'd to express the same thing, and saying only the word <hi>Tint</hi> (that is lost) was on a sudden struck with another fit, and when the fit was over, and the Child returned to the Chamber, <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> who was sitting near the Hall door, spoke these words
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31747:19"/>
               <hi>The Lord bless thee, and ding</hi> (<hi>that is beat, or drive</hi>) <hi>the Devil out of thee.</hi> A little after which, <hi>Margaret</hi> going down stairs, the Damsel came to the Hall and said, her Bonds were now loos'd, and that she could accuse <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> to her Face, and declar'd the occasion of her being so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd while <hi>Margaret</hi> was present, was her letting fall a parcel of Hair at the Hall door as she came in; being a Charm made by her for that end, which also had been the occasion of her uttering the word <hi>Tint</hi> in the former fit: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly a parcel of Hair had been found at the Hall-door, after <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> had gone straight from the Hall to the Chamber, which immediatly was cast into the Fire and burnt. And its remarkable, that it could be attested that there was no Hair, or any other thing else in that place before <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> came in, and the Girl being enquired, what way she knew <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> had laid the fore-mentioned Charm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, replyed, that something speaking distinctly to her as it were over her Head, inform'd her so.</p>
            <p>About Eight at Night she was severely handled in her Fits, much after the former manner, and while she was in her swooning Fits, there was seen in her Mouth a Pin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she seem'd almost Choak't; but by Divine Providence it was got out, tho with great difficulty. After this she was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what composed, and did not much complain of pain; but was distinctly heard to entertain discourse with some invisible Creatures about her, and the Reply's given by her, and heard by those who took care of her, gave them ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude she was tempted to set her Hand to a Paper then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to her, with Promises that upon her yielding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>she should never be troubled any more; as also that she should have sweet meats, a Glass of Sack, and a handsome Coat with silver Lace:</hi> She was also distinctly heard to say, resisting the Tempter, <hi>Thou art a filthy Sow, should I obey thee; this was not the end of my Creation, but to Glorify God and enjoy him for ever; and thou promisest what thou canst not perform: Art thou angry at me for saying thou Sow, What should I call thee but thou filthy Sow? Art thou not the filthy Devil, for as brave as thou art with thy Silver and Gold Lace? Wouldst thou have me Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my Baptism? Dost thou promise to give me brave Men</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:31747:19"/>
               <hi>in Marriage, and fine Cloaths, and perfect Health, if I should consent thereunto? Dost thou say my Baptism will do me no good, because thou alledgest he was not a sufficient Minister that baptized me? thou art a Liar, I'll be content to dye ere I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my Baptism. O thorow the Grace of God I'll never do it.</hi> And thus she continued Reasoning, being both Blind and Deaf, for the space of two Hours; and when she came to her self did declare it was the Devil, who first presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tempting her in the shape of a Sow, to Renounce her Baptism, as is hinted; and that he did chide her when she call'd him, <hi>thou Sow,</hi> and immediatly appear'd to her again in the shape of a brave Gentleman, having Gold and Silver Lace on his Cloaths, still urging her to renounce her Baptism, which Temptation through the special assistance of the Grace of God she effectually resisted: she also said, that it had been suggested to her by the Spirit, speaking to her as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over her Head, after the Combat with the Tempter was past, that one of her Tormentors would be at the House to Morrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 13. She was seiz'd with a sore fit about Twelve a Clock of the day, in which she continued for more than two Hours, both Deaf and Blind. Those in the Room with her cry'd to her aloud, and pinch'd her Hands and other parts of her Body; but all to no purpose. And in this posture she was hurried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o and Fro with violence thorow the Room: And when any Body offer'd to hinder the dangerous and violent Motion she seem'd to be in, she'd Roar exceedingly, sometimes she'd desire her Father and Mother and others to come and take her Home (supposing her self not to be in her Fathers House) when she was in this deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Margaret Roger</hi> who liv'd in the Neighbour-hood, came to the House of <hi>Bargarren</hi> enquiring for the Lady; and having come up stairs, the Parents of the Damsel remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Girl had said the Night before, that one of her Tormentors was to come that day to the House, brought <hi>Margaret Roger</hi> to the Chamber where she was, and so soon as she entered the Door; the Damsel tho she could discern none of those who were present with her, nor answer them when they cry'd to her; yet presently saw her and ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31747:20"/>
her, crying, <hi>Maggi, Maggi, where hast thou been? wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t thou take me with thee, for my Father and Mother have left me.</hi> Whereupon the Spectators being Astonish'd, caus'd <hi>Morgaret</hi> to speak to the Child; which she having done, the Girle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly heard and answered her every word. After this, the Three that had Confessed, were also brought up to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the Damsel was; and as soon as they entered the Door, she ran also to them, Laughing, as if she had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd, Answering them when they spoke to her: and <hi>Margaret Roger</hi> being Confronted with them, They declared that she had been at Meetings with the Devil and Witches in <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Orchard, Consulting and Contriving the Childes ruine.</p>
            <p>The LORD's Day following, being <hi>February</hi> 14. After some short Intervals, she was again seiz'd with her Fits, in which she said, <hi>Margaret Laing, and her Daughter Martha Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were Tormenting her, and cutting her Throat;</hi> which words, through violence of Pain, and difficulty of Breathing, she ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with a low, and scarcely, audible Voice; and upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> and her Daughter, she was Tossed and dreadfully Tormented in all the parts of her Body, being made sometimes to stand upon her Head and Feet at once, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times her Belly swelling like a Drum, and falling again on a sudden; and sometimes her Head, and other parts of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were like to be shaken in pieces, so that the Spectators fear'd she would never speak more. And when the Fit was over, she declar'd, <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> said to her, while in the Fit, <hi>That she would give her a Tosty</hi> (which imports hot and severe handling) for Naming her.</p>
            <p>At this time she was seldom free of her Light-headed-fits, which, for the most part, were all the respite and ease she had from the unexpressible Agonies she endur'd in her more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fits; unless when asleep: And while she was in these Fits, no Body could perswade her to Pray; yet, when in a right composure of Mind, she'd Weep Bitterly at the Remembrance of this, expressing her Fears, least it might be an Evidence that God would for sake her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 18. About Two in the Afternoon, she being in a Light-headed-fit, said, <hi>The Devil now appear'd to her in the</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:31747:20"/>
               <hi>Shape of a man;</hi> Whereupon being struck with great Fear and Consternation, she was desir'd to Pray with an Audible Voice, <hi>The Lord Rebuke thee Satan:</hi> which Essaying to do, she instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost her power of Speech, her Teeth being sett, and her Tongue drawn back into her Throat; and attempting it again, she was immediately seiz'd with another grievous Fit; in which her Eyes being twisted almost round, she fell down as one Dead, struggling with Feet and Hands, and getting up again on a sudden, was hurried with Violence too and fro, thorow the Room, Deaf and Blind; yet was speaking with some Invisible Creature about her saying, <hi>With the Lord's strength thou shal't neither put Straw nor Sticks into my mouth.</hi> After this she cry'd in a pitiful manner, <hi>The Bee hath sting'd me:</hi> then presently sitting down, and untying her Stocking, put her Hand to that part which had been Nip't or Pinch't; Whereupon the Spectators did visibly discern the lively marks of Nails of Fingers deeply imprinted on that same part of her Leg. And when she came to her self, she did declare, <hi>That something speaking to her, as it were over her Head, told her it was</hi> M. M. <hi>in a Neighbouring Parish</hi> (naming the place) <hi>that had appear'd to her, and pinch't her Leg in the likeness of a Bee.</hi> She likewise declared, That the forementioned M. M. <hi>instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this had been suggested to her, appeared in her own shape and likeness, as she us'd to be at other times.</hi> Shortly after this, being still seiz'd with her light Fit, she whisper'd in her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ear, <hi>The Devil was now appearing to her again in the shape of a Gentleman:</hi> And being instantly seiz'd with her light Fits, in which she was both Blind and Deaf, was distinctly heard, Arguing after this manner. <hi>Thou think'st to tempt me to be a Witch; but through God's strength thou shalt never be the better: I charge thee, in the Name of GOD to be gone, and thy Papers too; in the LORD's strength I'll not fear thee: I'll stand here and see, if thou can come one step nearer me; I think thou fearest me more then I fear thee.</hi> Then turning her self again, she was hurried To and Fro with violence thorow the Room as formerly, saying, <hi>She was bitten or pinch't very sore in the Hands with Teeth, and Nip't with Fingers above Twenty four times;</hi> which occasion'd her to utter horrid Shreeks, and Out-crys at every time she receiv'd them, shewing and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31747:21"/>
with her Finger to those parts of her Arm and Leg which had been Pinch't and Bitten, but neither saw nor heard any about her. And accordingly the Spectators did visibly discern the evident marks of the Teeth and Nails of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon her Arms and Legs. In this postute the Girle continued from Two to Five in the Afternoon; and when her miseries were over, she sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d, <hi>M. M. told her in the Fit, that</hi> Margaret Laing, <hi>then in custody, had ordered her to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle her after that manner. And that</hi> Margaret Laing <hi>had a Commanding Power over her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday, February</hi> 19 and 20. she was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently seiz'd with the foremention'd Fits, and violently Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Pincht and Nipt in her Hands, Neck, and other parts of her Body, so that the marks of the Nails of Fingers and Teeth, with the Spittle and Slaber of a mouth thereupon were evidently seen by Spectators. When she was seiz'd with her Blind and Deaf Fits, a Crooked Fellow appear'd to her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his two Feet deform'd, his two heels turning inwards toward one another, and the fore-parts of his Feet outward, so that the broad side of his Feet mov'd foremost; and upon the appearing of this Fellow, her Feet were put in the very same posture during the time he Tormented her. It is to be observed that there is a Fellow in one of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Parishes, whose Feet are exactly Deform'd in that manner, who has been of a long time of Evil Fame, and Accused by those that Confessed, to have been at Meatings with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the rest of the Crew in <hi>Bargarren</hi>'s Orchard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, February</hi> 20. The whole Family being gone to Bed, they had left a great quantity of Peets (or Turff) by the Hall Chimney, which, the next morning, they saw burnt to Ashes, though there had been no Fire in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, nor near them, so that the Plaister and Stones of the Wall, where the Peets or Turff lay, were, in a great part, turn'd to Rubbish by the violence of the Fire, but no other Damage followed, the Hall-floor being laid with Stones, and the Peets lying within the Brace of a large Chimney.</p>

               </gap> none in the family had been there after the fire was covered.</p>
            <p>In fits of this kind she continued for several days after, naming the foremention'd crooked fellow, <hi>I. R.</hi> and <hi>M. A.</hi> two Women that lived in the neighbouring Parishes, which two latter were accus'd (by the three that had confessed) to be amongst her Tormenters, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon the Lords day <hi>February</hi> 12. and the Munday following, the said <hi>I. R.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to her grievously vexed her, telling her she was commissioned so to do, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman <hi>M. M.</hi> having a pain in her head at that time, and so not being able to come forth. Concerning which it is worthy of remark, that the Damsel declar'd <hi>M. M.</hi> to have appeared to her about two days after, with her head bound up with a handker-chief, in which posture she did not formerly appear.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Thursday February</hi> 25. She continued in the former fits, weeping bitterly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a pain in both her sides, she also told in the interval of her fits, that she was that night to be in very grievous and sore fits, her Tormenters being resolved to choak her, by putting pins in her mouth, which (tho she emptied her self of all that were in her Cloaths) yet accordingly came to pass: In those fits she was both Blind and Deaf, leaping up and down in an extraordinary manner, and thus continued for some days voiding out of her Mouth a great quantity of small broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ins, which she declar'd <hi>I. R.</hi> had forc'd into the same.</p>
            <p>Upon the Lords day being the last of <hi>February,</hi> about five a Clock in the Afternoon she fell into grievous fits, accompained with loud Laughing, Leaping, and runing with violence to and fro, and thereafter wept sore, crying out of Pain, and that a little Highland Man (whom she knew to be such by his habit and speech) was now breaking her Leg; which (because of Pain) she scarce could get told in the fit, and putting her Hand to the part of her Leg affected, the Spectators untying her stocking, distinctly observed a sore bruise in her Shin bone; which when touched did so pain her, that she uttered horrid Shreeks and Crys; and when recovered did declare, that the little Highland fellow had given her that bruise. After this, she voided at her Mouth a crooked Pin, which she said the Highland fellow had forc't into her Mouth, and design'd to Choak her.</p>
            <p>The first eight days of <hi>March</hi> she continued in her former fits; with little Variation, voiding at her Mouth a great number of small Pins and often fainted and fell as Dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground on a sudden, strugling with Feet and Hands; by all which her Natural Spirits were much Weakned and Exhausted; sometimes also she attempted to go into the Fire. About this time when Ministers and other Christians met in the Family for Prayer, she us'd at the beginning of the work to make great disturbance, particularly <hi>March</hi> 2. which day being set apart for Fasting and Praying, she was for some time very composed, until of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, a strong blast of Wind forced open the Windows of the Room; upon which she was instantly seiz'd with a violent fit, whilst the Minister was supplicating God that she might be delivered from Satans Bonds: In this fit she was both Blind and Deaf as to All, except her Tormentors, was hurried with violence to and fro in the Room, sometimes falling down as one Dead, sometimes Singing and making a Hideous Noise, sometimes naming <hi>M. M.</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who she said, were there present Afflicting and Tormenting her, and named the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places of the Room where she saw them standing and sitting. And when recovered from the fit, she told that a Gentlewoman and a little Highland fellow came in with the blast of Wind, which forc'd open the Windows. This falling out upon the <hi>Tuesday,</hi> she continued in the light fit without any Intermission, till the Sabbath after, not being seiz'd with any of her sore fits: And having gone to Church the Lords day following, was perfectly well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Tuesday</hi> being <hi>March</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> Her Mother and <hi>Margaret Campbel</hi> her Cousin took the Damsel to walk with them in the Orchard; and returning back to the house, her Mother entered the Tower gate first, with the Damsel at her back and <hi>Margaret Campbel</hi> tarrying a little while at the gate, her Mother went into the Kitchen, supposing they had both been with her, whereas the Damsel was of a sudden carried away in a flight up Stairs with so swift and unaccountable a motion, that her absence was not in the least suspected, but her Mother turning about and missing her, cry'd, where is <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Margaret Campbel?</hi> And instantly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Stairs to look for the Damsel heard a noise and following the same, found her Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Dancing upon one of the Stairs being seiz'd with fits, out of which being recovered

               </gap> never heard by any but her self.</p>
            <p>The same day betwixt Sermons, she foretold that she was to be violently Tormented in the Afternoon; which accordingly came to pass, and in her fits she named one <hi>I. K.</hi> a Woman living in the Neighbourhood, of whom she said, that she had seen her in the Church. As also, that she was Master of these kind of fits she was now afflicted with; withal asserting, that it the said <hi>I. K.</hi> were not sent for, she would grow worse and worse; which her Parents finding to be true, sent in the Evening for the said <hi>I. K.</hi> threatning her, if the Damsel was any further troubled with her, that she should be apprehended as others had been; after which the Damsel being in the mean time in a very sore fit, the forementioned <hi>I. K.</hi> prayed (tho not desired) that God might send the Damsel her Health; whereupon the Damsel was no more troubled with these kind of fits; but did instantly recover, by falling into a swoon as she us'd to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her recovery out of any of her fits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tuesday March</hi> 16, she was again seiz'd with her other fits, all the parts of her body being Stiff; and sometimes she was heard conversing with the Gentlewoman (as She call'd her) vindicating her self of what the Gentlewoman alledged against her, <hi>Viz. That she had accused some innocent persons as her Tormentors,</hi> To which the Damsel distinctly Reply'd, <hi>That she was a Lyar, saying, it was you your self, and no other ever mentioned any such thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus she continued until the <hi>Friday</hi> after, being never free of the light Fits, and now and then also falling into Swoons, and appear'd to be almost choaked by the means of some Charms and Inchantments, invisibly convey'd into her Mouth; which, to the Apprehension of Spectators, were like pieces of Chestnuts, Orange-Pills, Whites of Eggs, or such like, all which were distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed; when occasionally in the Fit she opened her mouth, and when the Spectators Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say'd to get them out, she kept her Mouth and Teeth so closs, that no Man could open the same. And when recover'd out of the Fit, she told, that <hi>L. M.</hi> a Woman living in the Neighbourhood, had put them in her mouth.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Friday, March</hi> 19. She was violently Tormented with sore Fits, in which her Neck was distorted, and bended back, like a Bow, towards her Heels, she strugling with her Feet and Hands, and was sometimes stiff, blind and deaf, and voided at her mouth a great number of small Pins, which she said the foremention'd <hi>L.

distinctly, as over her Head, suggested them to her. It is very observable, that the Persons aforesaid had that same Afternoon got an Order from the Commissioners of Justiciary to Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the same Gentlewoman, and were so far on their way to put it in Execution against next morning; but being Witnesses to the Damsels Trouble, and hearing what she had told, <hi>viz.</hi> That a delay in that matter would prove exceeding dangerous to her, they went straight on in their Journey to the Gentlewomans Habitation, and put their Warrant in Execution that same Night; The Damsel continued to be Violently Tormented, sometimes lying with her Neck, and other parts of her Body upon the Ground, as if they had been disjoynted, and sometimes Essay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to throw her self into the Fire. About Ten a Clock, her Father (who had not gone with the <hi>Sheriff</hi>) began to Read in the Bible, and she repeated the Words after him, though Blind and Deaf, which made the Spectators to apprehend, that she had the sense of Hearing in those Fits, at least when the Word of GOD was read: To find out the truth of which, her Father ceas'd from Reading; yet she continued to repeat the following Verses of the Chapter, though none in the Room were Reading, and her self had no Book, but was heard to say to some Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Being, <hi>Wilt thou teach me a part of the Old Testament as well as the New.</hi> She continued in her Fits, and said unto the People that were present, <hi>Now it is Twelve of the Clock; Oh it is now past Twelve:</hi> sometimes lying as one dead through the violence of Pain, and decay of her natural spirits; sometimes again recovering, she Essayed to express somewhat, but could not; a great quantity of Crooked Pins issued out of her mouth, and her body being prodigiously distorted, she complain'd of great Pain. Thus she continu'd until half an hour after Twelve at Night; when, on a sudden, she recover'd, to the admiration of the Beholders, telling them, <hi>She might now go to Bed,</hi> being told by some Invisible Informer, That the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, to wit the Macer, had now entred the Gentlewomans House; and accordingly going to Bed, she was no further troubled that Night. It is worthy of remark here, that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> and Macer, at their return, declared, that it was just about that time they entered the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans House, which the Damsel mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, March</hi> 20. About Ten a Clock in the Forenoon, she was, of a sudden, seiz'd with Fits, falling down as dead, with her eyes closed, and sometimes again opening and turning in her head, she saw nor heard none about her, but was hurried with violence to and fro through the Room, crying with a loud Voice when any one offered to hinder her motion. Being in this posture, and deprived of her senses, <hi>Iames Lindsay,</hi> one of the Three that had Confessed, was brought into the Room, and no sooner entered the Door but was perceived by her, and she ran towards him smiling, saying, Jamie, <hi>Where hast thou been this long time? How is it with thee?</hi> And answered him distinctly to every word he spake, though, at the same time, she neither heard nor saw any other in the Room, nor could she Converse with them, which was tryed by several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments for that purpose, particularly a Tobacco-box, being held before her Eyes by one of the Company, she did not see it; but assoon as it was put in the hand of <hi>Iames Lindsay,</hi> she enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at him, Where he had got that Box? She continuing in this condition, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> and her Father being present, thought it fit to Confront <hi>M.

M.</hi> entered the Door, the Damsel (though still in the Fit) presently smiled and said, <hi>I see the Gentlewoman now:</hi> though she had never seen her Personally before, but only by her <hi>Spectre</hi> in the Fits. She likewise heard when she spoke to her, and Answered distinctly to some Questions proposed by her, such as, <hi>When it was she had seen her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> uttered, then the Damsel fell down as Dead; and being carried to another Room forthwith recovered of her Blind, Deaf, and Light-headed Fit, became perfectly well, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so for some time: Being thus recovered, and <hi>M.

            <p>That same day the Commissioners of Justiciary being come to <hi>Bargarren, M. M.</hi> and the Damsel were again confronted, on which the Child (being in her light Fit) upon the first
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31747:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
look of <hi>M. M.</hi> was suddenly seiz'd with sore Fits, and when recovered, accused her as being one of her most violent Tormentors, particularly mentioning such and such times in which She had in an extraordinary manner afflicted her, as also what words She spoke in her hearing while in the Fit, and which is yet more remarkable, did question the Gentlewoman if She did not sometime in <hi>December</hi> last when She was Tormenting her, remember how She went away from her in great hast, saying She could stay no longer being obliged to attend a Childs burial at home. In confirmation of which it is very credibly informed that <hi>W. R.</hi> a near neighbour of hers had a Child burried that same day, and that the Gentlewoman came not in due time to attend the Corpse to the burial place, but the Corpse being near to the Church-yeard ere She reached the House from whence they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ame, She returned again to her own lodging, and so did not accompany the burial at all.</p>
            <p>The Lords day following being <hi>March</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She fell into Swooning Fits, complained of a pain near her heart, and fell down as dead, not only when the Fits seiz'd her, but also during the Intervals, sometimes Singing after an unusual manner, and informing the Spectators that <hi>I. G.</hi> constrained her to that kind of Musick, her own Lips not at all moving in the time, which the beholders saw to be true, but her Tongue mov'd, for preventing of which She frequently put her hand in her Mouth. At this time when either She her self, or those about her, offered to read any part of the Scripture, She was violently Tormented, declaring if She did but so much as hear the word of God read that day, She would certainly be extremly Tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in Confirmation of which when some essay'd to read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 2, 4. 6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. She uttered horrid Shreeks and Out-crys, Complaining that <hi>She was Pinched,</hi> in evidence of which, the Prints or Marks of the Nails of Fingers were distinctly seen on her Arms, and being thus pinched or bitten four several times with great violence and pain, the Skin it self was torn off those parts of her Arms and Fingers where the Prints of the Teeth and Nails were observed; so that the parts affected fell a Bleeding, and her Blood was both seen and handled by the Spectators. While She was in this sad and lamentable condition She seem'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly affected and oppressed with sore Sickness, as one in a Fever, crying sometimes to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move those Dead Children out of her Sight;</hi> which She frequently repeated from six to nine in the Morning, She continued thus the rest of the day, and it was observed that some Charm, and Inchantments were put in her Mouth as formerly, of which being very sensible, She fell down on a sudden to the Ground putting her hand to some Spittle which came out of her Mouth, and lifted up some Trash which She again cast down to the Ground, so as it made a Noise, yet nothing could be seen in her Spittle, nor elsewhere by Spectators, tho in her Mouth they could distinctly observe something like Orange Pils, Whites of Eggs, and peeces of Chesnuts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Munday,</hi> Being <hi>March</hi> 21. the before mentioned <hi>L. M.</hi> or <hi>I. G.</hi> came to <hi>Bargarrans</hi> house, and being confronted with the Damsel, questioned her if ever she had seen her in any of her Fits, alledging that she withal could be none of her Tormentors, because she was not now seiz'd with a Fit, tho looking upon her, as she us'd to be, when she look'd upon any of her other Tormentors; upon which the Damsel being for sometime silent, <hi>I. M.</hi> or <hi>I. G.</hi> did again propose the same question, to which the Damsel distinctly reply'd <hi>Yes,</hi> upon which <hi>L. M.</hi> reply'd, perhaps you have seen the the Devil in my Shape.</p>
            <p>As to this Conference there are several things exceeding remarkable, as first, that the Damsel upon her Answering, <hi>Yes,</hi> was immediatly seiz'd with a Fit. <hi>2dly.</hi> That tho after <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> had touch'd the Damsel in presence of the Commissioners, upon the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> last, She had ever since that time freedom to touch any of her Tormentors without being seiz'd with her Fits, as has been hinted, yet true it is, that in the room of that Charm a new one took place, <hi>viz.</hi> When any time She looked upon her Tormentors in the Face, at the very first look She was seiz'd with her Fits; which Charm She declar'd was laid on her by the said <hi>L. M.</hi> or <hi>I. G.</hi> And taken off again by her that very Morning before She came to visit the Damsel, and this She said was suggested to her by some invisible beeing, speaking distinctly over her head; and that therefore the Damsel now had freedom to look <hi>L. M.</hi> in the Face without being seiz'd with Fits, which for a considerable time before She could not do when confronted with any of her Tormentors. <hi>3ly.</hi> It is yet more observable, that the same Morning before ever <hi>L. M.</hi> came to visit her, it was told by the Damsel to several Persons in the Family, that <hi>L. M.</hi> had taken off that Charm, of her being seiz'd with Fits when looking any of her Tormentors in the Face, but withal that She had laid on another it is room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31747:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that as soon as the Damsel should by words confer with any of her Tormentors, so soon should She be seiz'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Fit, which accordingly w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> verified when She spoke to <hi>L. M.</hi> or <hi>I. G.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Tuesday March 23d,</hi> The Damsel being asleep in the Bed with her Mother about three a clock in the Morning was on a sudden awakned (having for sometime Struggled in her Sleep) in great fear and consternation, and being seiz'd with her Blind and Deaf Fits, took fast hold of her Mother, declaring to her Father and her, that the Devil was standing near the Bed assaulting her, upon which She try'd out suddenly: <hi>God Almighty keep me from thy meetings. I'll die rather then go to them, I'll never thorow the Grace of God Renounce my Baptism; for I'll certainly go to Hell if I do it: Thou sayest I'll go to Hell however, because I am a great Sinner; but I believe what the word of God sayeth, tho I have many Sins; yet the Blood of Christ cleanseth from all Sin, and I will not add that great wickedness to my other Sins, which thou art tempting me too. Its no wonder thou lie to me seeing thou wast bold to lie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Gods Face. I know thou art a Liar from the beginning; and the red Coat thou promisest me, I know thou canst not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. And altho I should never Recover, I'm resolv'd never to renounce my Baptism, It is God who hath kept me all this time from being a Witch, and I trust he will yet by his Grace keep me, not because of any thing in me, but of his own great Mercy, and that he who hath kept me hitherto from being devoured by thee, I hope will yet keep me.</hi> This Conference continued near the space of an hour, her Father, Mother and others being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ar Witnesses to the same. And after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery the Damsel declared that it was the Devil, who (in the ape of a naked Man in a Shirt, having much hair upon his hands and his Face, like Swines Bristles) had appear'd to her tempting her as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Until Sabbath following She continued in the light Fit, but withal every Morning and Evening was still seiz'd with her sore Fits, and continued still to name <hi>M. M.</hi> (who was at this time set at liberty) the forementioned <hi>L. M. E. T.</hi> an Highland Woman, and others as being her Tormentors. It is fit to be observed here, that <hi>M. M.</hi> being set at Liberty upon Bail, the very day after She went home, She again appear'd to the Damsel tormenting her in her fits, and continued so to do several days, particularly on the <hi>Saturday March</hi> 27 after She was set at liberty: on which day the Damsel was heard name her in her fits, and saying to her, wilt thou say <hi>God help me poor mad or foolish child as thou saidst the other day before the Iudges? art thou wishing the Devil to take me? where is the Habit thou wast cloathed with the other day?</hi>

            <p>If it be questioned, how the Truth of all these strange Things is attested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is none of those Particulars, but had the Witnesses Names inserted at the end of every particular Paragraph, and were attested before the Commissioners for Enquiry at <hi>Renfrew,</hi> by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of the respective Witnesses. But seeing the placing of them so now, would have occasioned the repetition of several persons Names and made the Narrative swell too much; Therefore we judg'd it fittest to set down the Names of the Chief Witnesses altogether at the end of the Narrative; and the rather because those things fell not out in a private Corner; but Thousands in this Countery have been Eye and Ear Witnesses of 'em, and been fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of a Diabolical hand in the Affliction of the Damsel: We shall only here make mention of a few, <hi>Viz,</hi> besides the Father, Mother, Grand-mother, and nearest Relations of the Damsel, and servants of the Family, who were always present with her in her Fits: such of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for Inquiry, and of Justiciary as had occasion to be on the place of the Events, were as follow, the Lord <hi>Bantyre,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Giffen,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Maxwell</hi> of <hi>Pollock,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Houston</hi> of <hi>Houston, Alexander Porterfield</hi> of <hi>Porterfield,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Black-hall</hi> younger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Laird of <hi>Glandeertone,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Craigens, Porterfield</hi> of <hi>

                        <p>That about Seven years ago the stayed with <hi>Iean Fultoun</hi> her Grand-mother, and Playing about the Door, she saw a Black Grim Man go into her Grand-mothers House: After which, her Grand-mother came to the Door, called her in, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her to take the Gentleman (as she Nam'd him) by the hand; which she did, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it very Cold, became Affraid; and immediately he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>e saying, That she needed not seek her Meat, seeing she might have Work; her Father pressed her to go along with him, and took her to a Heath in <hi>Kilmacome,</hi> where were gathered together, at that and other subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meetings, <hi>Katharine Campbel, Margaret Fulton</hi> (her Grand Aunt) <hi>Margaret Lang, Iohn Reid,</hi> Smith; <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Ianet Rodgers,</hi> the three <hi>Lindsays</hi> (besides the two Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ones,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and several others whom she did not know, and the foresaid Gentleman with them; he came to her the said <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> bidding her Renounce her Baptism, promising that if she would consent thereunto, she should have better Meat and Clothes, and not need to Beg. But (as she declared) she would not consent. Then he enquired what brought her thither? she answered, That she came with her Father: Whereupon the Devil and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went and talked together apart, but she knew not what. She declares, that in that Meeting was conserted the Tormenting of Mr. <hi>William Fleeming</hi> Minister of <hi>Innerkipp</hi>'s Childe.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31747:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Confesses she was at another Meeting with that Crew above the Town of <hi>Kilpatrick,</hi> with the foresaid Gentleman, whom they called their Lord: And that she went with her Father to the Ferrie-boat of <hi>Erskin;</hi> where the Devil, with the rest of the Band, Overturn'd the Boat, and Drowned the Laird of <hi>Bridghouse,</hi> and the Ferriman of <hi>Erskine,</hi> with several particular Circumstances concerning that affair, as that some of the Crew would have saved the Ferriman, but one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> His Mother-in-Law gainstood it, because he had expelled her out of his House a little while before the Meeting. She acknowledges she was present with them at the destroying of <hi>William Montgomeries</hi> Child, by strangling it with a Sea Handkerch; that having entered the house, they lighted a Candle which was somewhat Blewish, and <hi>Agnes Naismith</hi> saying, what if the People awake, <hi>Margaret Fulton</hi> replyed, ye need not fear: She also declares, that about five Weeks before the date, her Father brought her on foot to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Orchard, into which they entred by a breach in the Wall, and there were present the Persons before-named, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Devil, who told them, that no Body would seem them, at which they Laugh'd. At this Meeting, they, with their Lord, contriv'd the Destruction of <hi>Christian Shaw:</hi> Some being for stobbing her with a a Rappier, others for Hanging her with a Cord, a third sort for Choaking her, and some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have her out of the House to Destroy her; but fearing they might be taken before the next Meeting, their Lord (as they call'd him) gave them a piece of an Unchristened Child's Liver to eat; (but the Deponent, and the other two Confessers avoided the Eating of it) telling them, That though they were Apprehended, they should never Confess, which would prevent an effectual Discovery: And further, several of them being affraid that the Deponent would Confess, and Discover them, as she had formerly done her Grand-mother, they threatned to Tear her in Pieces if she did so; and particularly <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> Threatned her most. After two hours, or thereabouts, they disappeared and flew away, except the Deponent, who went home on her Foot. She Confesses likewise, That one Night her Father raised her out of her Bed, and going to the River side, took her on his Back, and flew with her over; from whence they went on foot to <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> and in Mr. <hi>Iohn Hardy,</hi> the Ministers Yard the Crew and their Lord being met, they formed the Picture of Mr. <hi>Hardy,</hi> and dabbed it full of Pins, and having put it amongst Water and Ale mixed together, Roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it on a Spit at a Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which her Father and she returned in the same manner as they went.</p>

About three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being a Begging in the Countrey, he met his Grand-mother with a Black Grim man, whom she desired him to take by the Hand, which he did, but found it exceeding Cold, and his own Hand mightily squeezed; whereupon the said Gentleman (as she termed him) ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Deponent if he would serve him, and he should have a Coat, Hat, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; to which <hi>Iames</hi> answer'd, <hi>Yes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is to be observed, that as the three Confessers were apprehended seperatly upon several occasions, so (after their obstinacy to discover was abated) they made these Confessions in several distinct places without Communication, without knowledge of one anothers Confessions. The Commissioners Examined them by other trying Questions that were new, on purpose to make Experiment of their Agreement, or Disagreement: But still found them to agree in, the matters of Fact (declared by them,) particularly in Strangling of the Children, the Death of the <hi>Minister,</hi> the Drowning of those in the Boat, and the Tormenting of <hi>Bargarrans</hi> Daughter. The Commissioners did also Confront them both with <hi>Christian Shaw</hi> the afflicted Girl, and the other persons accused (whom they had caused to be apprehended) and both the Girl and the Confessers did accuse them to their Faces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them by Circumstances with great steddiness and agreement, tho separatly brought in. The Commissioners did also try some Experiments about the Girls falling in Fits on the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Accused, as is exprest in the Narrative; and Examined her, with those who were commonly about her, as to the particulars of her Sufferings: They tryed to cause her to Write (since she could not speak) the Name of a Person, whom she first called <hi>Margaret,</hi> or <hi>pinch Maggie,</hi> and asserted to be one of her Chief Tormenters. But, upon Writing <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> and the Letter <hi>L.</hi> of her Sirname, the Girl was presently taken with a fearful Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Pen was struck out of her hand, and she fell Dead, with heavier Groans than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: After her Recovery, some <hi>Ministers</hi> shew'd her a Passage of the <hi>Bible,</hi> but assoon as she attempted to cast her eyes on it, she fell into vehement pangs; but one of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners ordering the <hi>Book</hi> to be closed, she immediately came to her self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the last place, the Commissioners called before them those Persons who had <hi>signed</hi> the Passages of the several days in the Written Journal of the Girles sufferings; and, having Examined them upon it, transmitted the same, with the Declarations of the Three Confessers, and several of the Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that occurred in the Precognition, to His Majestys Privy Council, by whom they were appointed to Enquire into the matter.</p>
            <p>Besides all this, the signed Attestations of Dr. <hi>Mathew Brisbane,</hi> Physician, and Mr. <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> Apothecary in <hi>Glasgow,</hi> did very much Influence them to the belief of an Extraordinary Cause of those things that befel <hi>Katharine Shaw.</hi>

               <p>ABOUT the <hi>24th</hi> or <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> last, the Lady <hi>Bargarran</hi> brought a Daughter of hers, a Child of Eleven years old, or thereabouts, to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> to take Advice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians concerning her. When I was first brought to her, I could hardly be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there was any need of me, or any man else of my Profession; the Child appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so brisk, and vigorous in motion, so cheerful, and of so florid and good a Colour, and, in a word, to outward appearance, every way healthful; but, it was not long, till I found my self obliged to alter my Thoughts of her; for, I had not been above Eight or Ten minutes in the Room by her, till she arose from her seat, and acquainted the Company, that she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to be seized with a Fit; and so being straightway carryed to bed, I observed a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable stiffness and distention in her left Hypocondre, which falling in a tryce, she was taken with horrid Convulsive motions in most parts of her body, but her back and neck especially; this was accompany'd with heavy Groans at first, which, so soon as she was able to frame Words, were converted into a kind of Expostulatory murmuring against some Women, two whereof she always Named; one of them she called <hi>Nasmith,</hi> (as I remember,) and the other <hi>Campbel:</hi> All these Symptoms, I thought, were very reduceable to the effects of Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick melancholy; and therefore putting her in such a Course, as I thought proper, against that kind of Malady, I was in absolute Security, as to her Case; The Child having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued free from all the above-mentioned symptoms, for the space, I think, of a Week in this Town, and some Eight or Ten days more in the Countrey. And I was perfectly surprized, when a Friend of the Lady <hi>Bargarrans</hi> told me, That the Child was returned to Town again, and worse than ever; for now she was in great hazard of being Choaked with mouthfulls of Hair, which she apprehended the Women above-named to be pressing down her Throat, had not she her self pulled it out.</p>
               <p>Having read many such Stories in <hi>Authours,</hi> and heard the like from other hands too, but never seen any such thing, I was the more earnest to see the Child again; and, for some Weeks that she stayed in this place, I was frequently with her, observed her narrowly, and was confident she had no Humane Correspondent to Subminister the Straw, Wool, Sinders, Hay, Feathers, and such like Trash to her; all which, upon several occasions, I have seen her pull out of her mouth in considerable quantities, sometimes after several Fits, and at other times, without any Fit at all, while she was Discoursing with us; and, for the most part, she pulled out all these things, without being wet in the least; nay, rather, as if they had been dryed with care and art: for one time, as I remember, when I was Discoursing with her, and she with me, she gave me a Sinder out of her mouth, not only dry, but actually hot, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the degree of the Natural Warmth of a Humane Body. During the time she was thus Exercis'd, though she had daily, not only light Convulsive motioos, but Two strange Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, such as we call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to a high degree and rigidity of the whole Body; yet she fancyed, as at other times, she saw many such People, as have been already named, about her; but the Voiding, or rather Pulling out of the things above named, did no sooner cease, but, as in all her Fits, when she was able to speak, she constanstantly cry'd out, That they were Pinching, or Pricking her: Those Fits were both more severe, and more frequent than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and followed with an Alienation of mind for some time. I have seen her too when otherwise, free of all Fits, suddenly seiz'd with Dumbness, her Tongue, being strangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that it appeared, to her self, as she expressed it, as if People were drawing it down her Throat. This I Declare on <hi>Conscience,</hi> and in most Solemn manner, is what I have seen and handled; and, were it not for the Haires, Hay, Straw, and other things, <hi>toto genere,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Humane Nature, I should not Despair to reduce all the other symptomes to their proper Classes in the Catalogue of Humane Diseases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </argument>
               <p>ABOUT the latter end of <hi>October</hi> last, she was brought hither to have Dr. <hi>Brisbens</hi> Advice about her Health, and I was Imployed as Apothecary. The Child was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eleven years of Age, of a good habit of Body, as far as I could judge; but now and then fell into Convulsions, Swoons, and a little Lightness of Head; and when recovered, out of those Fits, she would be perfectly well again; and, by the Use of the means the Dr. Prescribed, she seemed to be free of her Distemper: whereupon she was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken back to the Country; but, had not been long there, till she became worse then before, and was sent hither again to be under the Doctors Care; and after her Fits she took out of her mouth, without any Pressure, or Vomiting, Tufts of Hair, Straw long, and folded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, burnt Coals, pieces of Bones, Leather, Chips of Timber, and several other things, divers of which she hath taken out of her mouth and given to me, while we were conversing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> last, when I went to see her, I found her in a Swoon, whereinto she had fallen just as I came to the House: when she had lain so for some time, she arose in a great Rage, beat all about her, Frowning with her Countenance, and uttering a great deal of unknown Language in an Angry manner: Then she put the Tuft of a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land belt, with which she was Girt, into her mouth, and pulled, with her hand, so hard, that if we had not cut the belt with a Knife, she had, in all probability, drawn out her Teeth; whereupon she tore the Tuft all to pieces with her Teeth, and afterward fell a Tearing her Cloathes, and her shooes which she pulled off, and every thing she could get into her hands; then she fell into a Dumb Fit, as she termed it, wherein all her Body was so Convelled and Distorted, that I endeavoured to put her Armes into a better posture, but found them so stiff, that I could not bring them to their Natural Posture without breaking them: Then she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose out of that Fit, and went up and down the Room, and would have gone through the Wall, muttering the former unknown Language; after this she fell headlong upon the ground, as if she had been thrown down with Violence, where she lay for some time as Dead, but afterward arose, as if she had been somewhat Recovered, and fell a Reasoning, very distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thus; Ketie, <hi>What a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And after she had been thus Tortured for more then half an hour, without any intermission, she Recovered, and became perfectly well: Whereupon I Asked her, How she was? To which she Reply'd; She had just now a very bad Fit, for, during the Fit, she knew no body, neither took any notice of me, though I moved her Body, and spoke often to her: I asked her again, What she saw in her Fits? she replyed, <hi>I saw</hi> Katherine Cambel, Agnes Nasmith, Alexander Anderson, <hi>and others that she did not know.</hi> I enquired again, What <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine Cambel</hi> was doing?

               <p>Upon the <hi>21th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1697. After Trial of the Seven Witches, there is an Attestation Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by M. <hi>Patrick Simson</hi> Minister of <hi>Renfrew, Walter Scot</hi> Baily there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this import, <hi>Iohn Reid</hi> Smith at <hi>Inchennan</hi> prisoner, did in presence of the said persons and some others, declare, that about a Year ago the Devil (whom he knew to be such thereafter) appeared to him when he was travelling in the Night time, but spoke none to him at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. At the second appearance he gave him a Bite or Nipp in his Loyn; which he found painful for a Fortnight. That the third time he appeared to him as a Black Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Desired him to engage in his Service upon assurance of getting Riches and Comfort in the World; and that he should not want any thing that he would ask in the Devils Name: And then he renounced his Baptism, putting the one Hand to the Crown of his Head, and the other to the Sole of his Foot; thereby giving himself up to Satans Service: After which the pain of the Bite or Nipp ceased. He told that hitherto there was none others present with them; but afterwards he was at several Mettings, particularly that in <hi>Bargarrans</hi> Yard, about the time when there was a Fast for <hi>Christian Skaw,</hi> where the Devil appeared in the same kind of Garb as he first appeared to him, and they consulted <hi>Christians</hi> Death either by Worrieing or Drowning her in the Well; and the Devil said, he should warrand them, that they should neither be Heard, Seen, nor Confess, to which end he gave every one of them a bit of Flesh, that the Deponent got one of them, but let it fall, and did not Eat it. He afterwards own'd this Confession in presence of the Laird of <hi>Iordanhill,</hi> the Minister, Mr. <hi>Andrew Cochran</hi> Town Clark, and Baily <hi>Paterson;</hi> And being enquired at by <hi>Iordanhill</hi> how they were advertised of their Meetings, he said that ordinarly at their Meetings the time of the next was appointed; but for particular warning there appeared a Black Dog with a Chain about his Neck, who tinkling it, they were to follow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And being enquired at by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster if he did now wholly renounce the Devil (for he had formerly told how Satan had not performed his promise) and give himself to Jesus Christ, and desire to find mercy of God through Him: he assented thereunto. It is to be observed that <hi>John Reid</hi> after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession had called out of the prison Window, desiring Baily <hi>Scott</hi> to keep that old Body <hi>Angus Forrester,</hi> who had been his fellow prisoner, closs and secure; whereupon the company asked <hi>John</hi> when they were leaving him on <hi>Friday</hi> night the <hi>21th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> whether he desired com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or would be afraid alone, he said he had no fear of any thing: So being left till <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Forenoon, he was found in this posture, <hi>viz.</hi> sitting upon a stool which was on the Hearth of the Chimney, with his feet on the floor and his Body straight upward, his shoulders touching the lintel of the Chimney, but his Neck tyed with his own neck-cloath (whereof the knot was behind) to a small stick thrust into a hole above the lintel of the Chimney, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Company, and especially <hi>Iohn Campbel</hi> a Chyrurgeon who was called, thought at first in respect of his being in an ordinary posture of sitting, and the neck-cloath not having any drawn knot, but an ordinary one which was not very strait, and the sticks not having the
<pb facs="tcp:31747:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
strength to bear the weight of his Body or the struggle; that he had not been quite dead; but finding it otherways, and that he was in such a Situation that he could not have been the Actor thereof himself, concluded that some extraordinary Agent had done it, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the Door of the Room was secured, and that there was a board set over the Window which was not there the night before when they left him.</p>
               <p>We shall add but little as to what past at the Execution of the Seven Witches, because there is no Subscribed Attestation concerning it: And the Design of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Publisher is, to Advance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what stands Warranted by Testimonies of known Credit beyond Contradiction. Yet this is well known, that when they were going to the Stake, <q>One of the <hi>Lindsays</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to say to the other, <hi>Now, Brother, it is high time that we should Confess, since our keeping it up will serve us to no purpose,</hi> or the like Expression; To which the other Answered, <hi>That they should never do that,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And <hi>Margaret Lang,</hi> before Execution, own'd, <q>That when the Devil first appeared, she knew him not to be such till afterwards; That he gave her the Insensible Marks found upon her Body: She yielded to engage her self in his Service by a Covenant; And besides Publick Meetings, she had been above 80 times in private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with him. Being asked by a near Relation of her own, as to her being in <hi>Bargarrans</hi> House, Tormenting <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> she Answered in these Words; <hi>The Devil having an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power and Dominion over me, carryed my Shape whither he would:</hi>
                  </q> And it is known how she Confessed Unnatural Lust, and Profound Hypocrisy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though truely it did appear from her Mein, and other Circumstances, that these things dropped from her at Seasons, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ingenuity, and the Vigour of Truth got the Ascendant over the Devil. So <hi>Agnes Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mith,</hi> &amp;c. frequently told the Minister, <hi>That their Hearts and Tongues were bound up in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they could not express what they would:</hi> And sometimes it appear'd by Ocular Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Visage, that Convulsive-Damps did seize their Heads, when they attempted to make any such Discovery.</p>
               <p>There are Two Remarkable Instances in the Case of <hi>Katharine Campbel,</hi> who was the Chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument and Author of the Girles Trouble, <hi>viz.</hi> An Eminent <hi>Minister</hi> Discoursing, before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Witnesses, to the said <hi>Katharine,</hi> and Enquiring, if she did not distinctly remember the Godly Counsels, and Gracious Admonitions, which <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> while in a Fit, (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the <hi>Narrative,</hi>) gave her at a certain time? And Instancing some particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; She Answer'd, with heavy Groans, <hi>Yes, I Remember.</hi> But being Asked, Why she would not Confess the rest, as well as that Passage? And finding her self thereby to be caught, she began to Retract, and seemed to be Confounded. This happen'd while she was in Prison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tryal: And after it, in presence of several Witnesses, she spoke these words, <hi>That the Doom pronounced on her was most just, and that she could not free her self of Witchcraft:</hi> But, upon such Attempts, she fell down Dead, strangely distended, and that six or seven times Successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a Suddenness, that was both surprising and convincing to the spectators: On which occasion it was observed, that immediately before her falling into those Fits, and upon her Essaying to speak, when things were Charged home to her Conscience; her mouth seemed to be Contracted, and she uttered heavy Moans; whereupon Convulsions followed; and after rising out of them, she turned more Obstinate and Inflexible: And whenever there was any appearance of her being more Plyant, the foresaid Fits did overtake her.</p>
               <p>I shall only add some Passages which were omitted in the <hi>Narrative,</hi> but are Attested by some of the same Persons that were Witnesses to the other matters mentioned therein.</p>
               <p>Particularly, the Girle Declares, That in one of her Conflicts with the Devil, he told her, how a certain <hi>Minister</hi> (for whom she had a special respect) did Compile his Sermons throughout the Week; what Books he chiefly made use of; and several other matters, as to his method of study in his Closet, that no <hi>Mortal</hi> could know by ordinary means: By which, no doubt, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> did partly design (though by a very false Argument) to raise the esteem of <hi>Books</hi> above <hi>Sermons</hi> Collected out of them: Cencealing, in the mean time, both the Gift of improving Helps, and the blessing promised to the Hearer of the Word Preacht. When the Lady <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garran</hi> received the two pieces of Red Cloath, that the Girl had torn from one of the Witches sleeves, as is before-mentioned; she locked 'em up, and kept the Key: Notwithstanding which Caution some Friends having come to Visit the Girle, and being destrous to see the said Pieces of Cloath; she being in one of her Fits, Laughed, and said. That her <hi>Mother</hi> needed not to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ek for them in the place where they were Locked up; the Witches having taken them away, and laid them in a Corner of the Cellar; and accordingly being searched for, they were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31747:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found in the particular place she mentioned. Another such Passage happened to a Friend of <hi>Bargarrans,</hi> who went with him to sollicit a Commission from the Council: For he having brought along with him those pieces of Cloth, buttoned up in his Pocket, and secured them, as he thought, they were missing in the morning; but, after search, found at a good distance from his Pocket, though no visible thing had been in the Room to open it, or carry them off.</p>
               <p>In the last place it is to be observed, that the young Girl, <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> discovers a great sagacity in her Discourse and Observationss, but accompanyed with extraordinary modesty: she observed, among other things, that the Doors and Windows did open and shut upon the Entry of the Witches, and that there was, at no time, such a number of them about her, as the Room might not very well contain, with the visible Persons that were present therein: she observed them to shift their Place with a great Agility, when any other came into it, or offer'd to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque them, upon her Pointing where they were: And she often Averred from the Instance of the Spirit that Spoke to her above her Head, told their Names, and gave her other Means of discovering of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Satan does often Contrive their Ruine, by the most Undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible Methods he can; because, if he did it openly, it would scare others from Engaging with so Faithless a Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>Two <hi>LETTERS,</hi> Giving an Account of what appeared most <hi>Material</hi> or <hi>Curious</hi> in the TRYAL of the <hi>Seven WITCHES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Truth of the strange Things mentioned in the preceeding Narrative was at first carefully searched into only by private Persons: But at last became so notorious, that, upon Application founded on a Journal of those extraordinary Events, and attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many of the Gentry in the Country; the Privy Council gave a Commission for enquiring into it.</p>
               <p>The Honourable Persons to whom this was recommended, did, with great Impartiality and Exactness, make a Report: which influenc'd the Government to order the Execution of Justice on some of those Witches, who otherways, might have lurked without being discovered.</p>
               <p>For, hereupon, the Council directed a second Commission, for Trial of those who appeared to them to be most Charged by the Evidence of the Witnesses, produc'd on the First Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Several of the Judges were not only persons of Honour, but also of singular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience, and accordingly proceeded with extraordinary Caution, and were so far from Precipitancy in the Affair, that, after several Diets of Court they adjourned to a long Term, that, in the mean time, the Prisoners might be provided of Advocates.</p>
               <p>Accordingly an Advocate appeared for them, and managed their Defence with all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy that could be expected. There were above Twenty Hours imployed, at one Diet, in Examination of Witnesses: And the Jury being shut up spent about six Hours in comparing the Evidence: Whereupon Seven of the most notorious Criminals were Convicted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>The Crimes charg'd and proven against them, were not meer spectral Imaginations; but obvious and plain matter of Fact: <hi>viz.</hi> The Murders of some Children, and Persons of Age; and the Torturing of several Parsons, particularly <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Daughter: And both these, not at a distance, but contiguously by natural Means of Cords, Pins, and the like. Besides the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Works of Witchcraft, such as Renouncing Baptism, entering in Contract with, and Adoring the Devil in a Corporal shape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could not but be sustained as sufficient ground for a Trial in <hi>Scotland,</hi> since there is an express Statute <hi>Parl.</hi> 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 73. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ordering such persons to be put to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:31747:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>To make the Probation the more convincing, it was adduced orderly in three Periods. The First consisted of unsuspected Witnesses, who proved Facts: From whence it was necessarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, That there was Witchcraft in the Case. The Second did include, also unexceptionable Witnesses, who Deponed upon Facts; which made it Probable, if not necessary, that the Persons indited were the Witches. The Third did comprehend six Positive Testimonies, of those who did See and Hear the Witches committing the Crimes charged in the Inditement.</p>
               <p>The only valuable Subject of Debate, was as to the Import of these last Testimonies; five whereof were by Confessants, who had been at the Meetings in which the Crimes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the sixth of <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Daughter, who was one of the Persons afflicted. The antecedent part of the Probation was by Witnesses beyond Exception; And the Judges upon a long Debate did fustain Four of these Six only <hi>Cum Nota,</hi> and Two of them to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined without Oath. So nice were they in favour of the Criminals Lives, since some of these Witnesses might have been admitted in such a Crime without any Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the most scrupulous Judicatory in Europe. But all things were carried on in this Procedures with Tenderness and Moderation: For even the Advocates, who were sent to prosecute the Endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by His Majesty's Council and Advocate, did not act with the Byass of Partys; but on the contrary, shewed an equal Concern to have the accused Persons absolved, if it could be found compatible with Justice.</p>
               <p>This is the Reason for which the Publisher doubts not, but the two following Letters (one whereof gives an abridgment of the Advocates Speech to the Jury, and the other, of their Answers to the Objections against the Confessant Witnesses) will afford a satisfying view of the chiefest part, of the Trial: since the Objections which were, or might have been made are therein Stated and Answered, or Anticipated and Prevented; and the intended Brevity would not premit to print at this time the whole Process, which being extant upon Record, any who are Cautious may have easy access thereunto.</p>
               <p>There is scarce any need to take notice of a late Scurrilous Pamphlet, that has been Printed in <hi>England,</hi> pretending to give an account of those proceedings: For any who reads it may easily find, that the Author has been either Fool or Knave, or both, there being neither good Language, Sense nor Truth in the most part of it.</p>

                     <p>As to the Probation it self; you see, that it is divided into Three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinariness of the Crimes: The Probability of the concurring Circumstances: And the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the positive Probation.</p>
                     <p>As to the First part, The Crimes, or <hi>Corpora delicti,</hi> are proven by Unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, to have fallen out in such an odd and extraordinary manner, that it points out some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cause, than the ordinary course of Nature, to have produced those Effects.</p>
                     <p>For clearing of this, particularly in relation to the Torments of <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Daughter, you may consider not only the extraordinary Things that could not proceed from a Natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, which ly proven before you; but also several other Matters of Fact, which is Notorious; have been seen by some of your selves, and ly here in a Journal of her Sufferings: Every Article whereof is attested by the Subscriptions of Persons of entire Credit, before the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Commissioners appointed by His Majesty's Privy Council, for making Enquiry into the Matter.</p>
                     <p>This Girl's throwing out of Hair, Pins, and Coals of greater heat than that of her Body or Blood; as also so dry, that they appeared not to have come out of her Stomack; nor had she any press of Vomiting at the time, that she declared the same to have been put in her Mouth by her Tormenters: Is deponed by Doctor <hi>Brisban,</hi> in his Opinion not to proceed from a Natural Cause.</p>
                     <p>She was not Tormented by any of the Criminals after their Imprisonment: Except two Nights by <hi>Katharine Campbell;</hi> which being a Surprise, it was thereafter discovered, that these two Nights the Jaylor's Wife had let out <hi>Katharine Campbell</hi> to Spin in her House.</p>
                     <p>She having been speaking to one of her Tormenters as present (tho' Invisible to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers) and asking how her Tormenter had got those clouted Red Sleeves; she suddenly gets up, takes hold of them, the Company heard the Noise of the cloaths tearing, and she pulls away two pieces of red Cloth, which all the By-standers beheld with amazement in her Hands: Nor was there any other piece of this kind of Cloth to be found in the Room at that time.</p>
                     <p>She told, that her Tormentors were giving her a Glass of Sack, an Orange pile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ensnaring her to accept of a Favour from them) and accordingly she was seen to move her Lips, and to have the Orange-pile betwixt her Teeth; tho' there was no visible Hand that could have done it.</p>
                     <p>She advertised before-hand, that one of her Tormentors was to be at the Door at a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hour: And that another of them was in the Kitchin; before any did tell her thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which accordingly fell out: And these being brought to her presence, became obnoxious to the ordinary Means of Discovery.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:31747:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>When she complained, that her Tormenters had bitten and scratched her; the marks of the Nails and Teeth were seen upon her Skin, with Blood and Spittle: about the wounds, which were above Twenty four; while neither her own, or any others Teeth that were visible, could have done it.</p>
                     <p>She was most vehemently distorted, upon attempting to Tell, or even to Write the Names of her Tormenters: yet that ceased as to any of them, how soon that person was accused by any other, and particularly she had liberty, after many painful Attempts, to Accuse <hi>Margaret Laing,</hi> so soon as the Charm of Hair to restrain her (which <hi>Margaret</hi> had left behind the Door) was found and burnt; the Girl having told it to have been lost, as mentioned in the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
                     <p>She did throw out no more Hair after the finding and burning of a Ball of Hair, of the same Colour and Kind with that thrown out by the Girle (in <hi>Katharine Campbell</hi>'s Pocket) with Pins in it.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Agnes Nasmith</hi> had Prayed for her, she did appear to her, but not Torment her.</p>
                     <p>She foretold, That her Tormenters had Conserted to throw her, at a certain Hour, in a fit, (whereof they did forewarn her, on Design to Fright her, to Renounce her Baptism by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) and had left one of their Number to execute it: And accordingly there was a Woman with a Red-Coat seen under a Tree in the Orchard, and the Torment was brought on at the time appointed.</p>
                     <p>When she told, That there was something Tormenting her under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cloaths; the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors saw the Bed-cloaths move in an extraordinary manner, after the Girle had been raised out of them.</p>
                     <p>When she complained that she was Beaten: the By-standers heard the Noise of the strokes.</p>
                     <p>She Cried out at a time, That her Thigh was hurt: And one of the Company having search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Pocket, found a Knife; but unfolded: However, having folded up the same, and put it in a second time, she Cries out a-new: And, upon the second search, (though secured by the spring) it is found open, to the great wonder of the beholders; since they did watch, that no visible thing could have possibly opened it.</p>
                     <p>She told of a Charm under the Bed: And accordingly it was found in the shape of an Egg, which melted away being put into the Fire: She told also, That her Sister that was Boarded abroad, had Charms put above her in the House, and would not recover of the decaying sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness till she were brought out of it: And accordingly, the Child being brought home, straightway recovered.</p>
                     <p>She told of their Meeting in the Yeard of <hi>Bargarran,</hi> for Consulting about the destroying of her: And accordingly the Confessants have Deponed, That they did meet and Consult her Ruine in that place.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Story</hi> about her telling, That the Commissioners, though at Three Miles distance, had granted a Warrant to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> to Apprehend one of her Tormenters: Her giving so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an account of the Sheriff, and of Mr. <hi>Guthrie</hi> who was with him, while her Eyes were cieled and fast: Her being in excessive Torments (as she fore-told till that Person was apprehended, and immediatly thereupon, tho' at many Miles distance, her telling that her Tormenters were now taken, betwixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Twelve and One a clock in the Morning; and the Sheriff when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, did declare the Seisure to have been about that time: Is so notorious and so well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested that we need only to put you in mind of it.</p>
                     <p>Her falling in Fits upon the sight, or Touch of her Tormenters, was no effect of Imagination: For she was fully hood-winked with a Cloak, so as she saw no body whatsoever; yet upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her Tormenter, she immediately fell down dead: whereas she no ways startled upon the Touch of any other: Which Experiment was tried for ascertaining this Mean of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                     <p>In the Last place, She is naturally <hi>Sagacious</hi> and <hi>Observing:</hi> And discovered her Integrity in the face of the Court. For when the President asked, Whether or not she knew one of the Prisoners Names that was to be pricked? she answered, That though she knew her well enough of her self; yet one had told her the Name of this Prisoner when she was sent for to be confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her: So far did this Girle discover her Aversion from any thing that might seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to aid the Natural Evidence of Truth Unfairly: and her Firmness to the utmost against Temptations of becoming a With; particularly against the last Assault of Satan, wherein he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31747:29"/>
perswaded her at least to go to their Meetings; and she answered, That she would not follow such a base fallen Creature: And he rejoyning, That she would go to Hell however for her other Sins; and she Answering, That he was a Liar from the beginning, and the Blood of <hi>Iesus</hi> would cleanse her from all Iniquity: Whereupon he disappeared, and she perfectly recovered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath thereafter, was an happy end put to this fearful Tragedy of Witchcraft, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, to Conviction, the Reality of it.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Murdering of the Children,</hi> and the <hi>Minister,</hi> charged in the Inditement; you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve several Extraordinary things appearing in them; particularly, the Witnesses Depone, the Minister to have been in Excessive Torments, and of an unusual Colour, to have been of Sound Judgment; and yet he did tell of several Women about him, and that he heard the noise of the Door opening, when none else did hear it. The Children were well at Night, and found Dead in the Morning, with a little Blood on their Noses, and Blewness at the Root of their Ears; which were obvious Symptoms of Strangling: Besides, that the Mother of one of them cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Matthew, Mathew, the Child is dead.</hi> And the House of the other was Whitened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with sifting of Meal the Night before. Both which Particulars were told and discovered by the Confessants, before the Witnesses, which now concur with them in it, were Examined.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Second part of the Probation consists of several <hi>Adminicles,</hi> or Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Evidence proven by Unsuspected Witnesses, which lead us to suspect those Prisoners to be <hi>Witches,</hi> as so many Lines drawn from a Circumference to a Center, and as an Avenue to the positive Probation thereafter adduced: And these either strike at the whole Prisoners in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or some of them in Particular. In General<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we need not enumerate all these Adminicles, but remit you to the Probation, which is so full concerning it; only you will be pleased to take notice, that it is clearly proven, that all the Accus'd have insensible <hi>Marks,</hi> and some of them in an extraordinary manner; That most of them have been long reputed Witches, and some of them in 1687. by a Confessing Witch, whose subscribed Confession has been produced. You see that none of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them do shed Tears, nor were they ever discovered to do it since their Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, notwithstanding their frequent Howlings: So that it is not a sudden Grief or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. And Finally, That the Girle fell in Fits of Torment upon the Prisoners approach to her, and that she did name them all frequently, either in, or out of her Fits.</p>
                     <p>In particular, you see how <hi>Katharine Cambell</hi> was provoked by this Girles discovering her Theft; whereupon she has brought in the rest of her Confederats to act the following Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs: How thereupon <hi>Cambell</hi> did Curse and Imprecate in a terrible manner: How she stayed out of her Bed at Night, and was frequently Drousie in the Morning: How she was named by the Girle, particularly the Two Nights she was out of Prison: The Ball of Hair was taken out of her Pocket and Burnt; whereupon the Girle's voiding of Hair at her Mouth did cease: She could not express one word, even when on her Knees, of Prayer for the Girles Recovery: And the Insensible Marks on her were very remarkable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agnes Nasmith</hi> did not Torment the Girl, after she had Prayed for her: She was reputed a Witch, and hath the Marks. She came early in the Morning to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Yard, when, by her refusing to go in, it appeared she had no Business: Yea, it is plain, that she had a Resentment, because she got not a greater Alms the last time she was there. The Girl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>ex incontinenti,</hi> that <hi>Nasmith</hi> asked her Health and Age; which, in these Circumstances, was a shrewd Presumption of her Evil Design: And she acknowledged her self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have done this, when she asked the Age of another Child; wherein, by Providence, she was befooled; since that which she thought would have been an Excuse, tended to discover her Guilt. And Lastly, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ter this appearance of <hi>Agnes Nasmith,</hi> the Girl did take her first Fit, and nominate her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the first Tormentors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Margaret Lang,</hi> that Great Impostor, has been a Master-piece of the Devil; she has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Unnatural Lust, which is known to some of your Number. She sat near the Door, where the Charm of Hair was found, which the Girle declared did keep up her Tongue; and, upon burning thereof, it was loosed. The Girle fell in Fits upon her approach: She has notable Marks; particularly one, which the Confessants declare she lately received; and, by Inspection, it appears to be New. When she came from her private Conversation (no doubt with the Devil) she Raged as if she had been Possest, and could not but declare, that she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Violent Death. She looked in the Face of <hi>Iames Miller</hi>'s Child, and asked her Age, whereupon that Child Sickned the same Night, and Named <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> on her Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bed; It appears she was ready to show to <hi>Ianet Laird</hi> a sight of her Mother, who had been Three years dead. And finally, she has been taken in several Lyes, and Gross Prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31747:30"/>
particularly, you may remember, how six hours ago, when the Witnesses were examined on the Ball of Hair found with <hi>Katharin Campbell,</hi> a Gentleman (Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> of) heard her say to <hi>Katharin</hi> in the Ear; <hi>This is well bestow'd on you, because ye would not put it away when I desired you,</hi> &amp;c. VVhich the said Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> did openly testifie in Court upon Oath; Notwithstanding which this Impudent VVretch had the Confidence to deny it, tho <hi>Katharin Cambell</hi> also Confest, That she had pulled her, and had Spoke somewhat to her, to which she did not advert, which was no wonder, the VVitnesses Deponing, at the time being close upon <hi>Katharin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Margaret Fulton</hi> was reputed a VVitch, has the Mark of it; and acknowledged, in presence of her Husband, that she made use of a Charm; which appeared full of small Stones and Blood. That her Husband had brought her back from the <hi>Faries;</hi> and her Repute of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a VVitch is of an Old Date; besides her being named often by the Bewitched Girl.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Lindsays,</hi> they all have the Mark; and were all of a long time Reputed to be VVitches. <hi>Iohn Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Barloch</hi> was accidentally discovered by the Girles taking a Fit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his coming to the House. <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames Lindsays</hi> were Accused by a Confessing VVitch in <hi>Anno</hi> 1687, VVhich Confession is Publickly Read before you; And there was Money given to the Sheriff-depute for the delaying of the Pursute. <hi>Iames Lindsay</hi> appeared to <hi>William Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> suddenly, and Flew about like a Fowl, for an opportunity to strike him, in Revenge of the Quarrel mention'd in the Deposition, and at last prevailed to strike him dead over a VVall. And Finally, which is a Remarkable Indication, both of Truth and Providence, the very VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses adduced in Defence of the <hi>Lindsays,</hi> Deponed so clearly against them, even beyond the Pursuers VVitnesses, that their Advocate was daunted at it; and thereupon desisted from cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any more VVitnesses to be Examined in their Defence.</p>
                     <p>It is true, some of these Indications may be in One, and others of them in Another, either from Nature or Accident; and yet that Person not be a VVitch: But it was never heard or read, that all these Indications, which are so many Discoveries by Providence, of a crime that might otherways have remain'd in the dark, did ever concur in one and the same <hi>Individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> that was Innocent: Yea, on the contrary, they, by the VVisdom and Experience of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do as convincingly discover a VVitch, as the symptoms of a Leprosie concerted by all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians argue the Person affected with the same to be Leprous. But grant they are not sufficient of themselves: yet their <hi>Tendency</hi> and <hi>Meaning,</hi> being cleared and applyed to their proper cause, by a plain and positive Probation; There wants no more to determine you as to the Prisoners Guilt. And therefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly.</hi> As to the <hi>Third</hi> Part of the Probation, VVe remit the <hi>Positive Depositions</hi> of the Confessants, and against whom they do concurr, wholly to your own Perusal and Examination: Only be pleased to take notice. <hi>First,</hi> Some things which very much Add to the Credibility of their Testimonies, arise from their Examination in Court. <hi>Secondly.</hi> We shall Explain to you the Import of the Word <hi>Nota,</hi> which is added to the Decree of the Judges, admitting these last Witnesses.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>First.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> is of sufficient age, being Seventeen; yet so young and punctual, that her Deposition appears no effect of <hi>Melancholly:</hi> She accused her Father to his face when he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> dying in the prison, as now there are two of her Aunts in the Inditment, which certainly must proceed from the strength of Truth, since even <hi>Dives</hi> retain'd a natural affection to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. She went on foot to the Meetings with her Father, except only that the Devil trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them over the Water of <hi>Clyde,</hi> which was easy to the Prince of the Air who does far greater things by his <hi>Hurri-canes;</hi> she tells that <hi>Montgomeries</hi> House was <hi>Meallie</hi> when his Child was strangled: And she declares that she never renounced her Baptism; but was carried along by the compulsion of a Parent: So that nothing can be objected against her Testimony in any Judgement, much less in an <hi>Excepted Crime.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iames Lindsay</hi> it is true, is of less import: yet by his Weeping when he came in and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished of the greatness of his guilt, it appears that he had a Sense of it: he hath a natural Precipitancy in what he speaks, yet that is commonly the concomitant of Ingenuity, as import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Expressions not to be fore-thought. He concurrs in most things with the others, and yet he has declared, that he saw not <hi>Margaret Fulton</hi> at <hi>Dumbartoun,</hi> &amp;c. Which implys that he does not file the Prisoners all at Randome, but tells what occurred to his Senses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ianet</hi> and <hi>Margaret Rodgers</hi> are instances of a singular Providence, for they did confess the
<pb facs="tcp:31747:30"/>
same Morning that the Court did last sit, of their own proper motion, there being neither Ministers nor Judges by them at the time. <hi>Agnes Naismith</hi> is <hi>Ianets</hi> Relation, and she tells that she never saw <hi>Katharine Campbel,</hi> as <hi>Margaret</hi> declares that she did not see <hi>Iohn Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Barloch:</hi> which plainly demonstrats that they tell only the dictats of their Natural Conscience arising from discretion and knowledge of the true matters of Fact: They both professed their Repentance last Sabbath in the Church: And do persist with a great Firmness, and you see their Deportment in deponing to be Congruous and Exact.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thomas Lindsay</hi> and <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> being under age, we did not press their being put to an Oath; yet you saw that they did declare in Court against these Criminals in such an Harmony with the rest of the Deponents, and gave such a cause of their knowledge, That it is certain their youngness in years Adds extreamly to the Credit of their Testimony: Because thereby it is incredible, that they could have contrived or executed the acting so by Concert.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Second.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since these Witnesses are admitted by the Judges; it necessarily inplyes, that they meant them to be probative; only they added the words <hi>Cum nota:</hi> That is, you must take notice, or <hi>Notandum est.</hi> That there must something else concurr to prove the Guilt of the Prisoners, besides the Depositions of any two such Witnesses: But so it is, that all the Circumstantial Evidence, on which you have seen Probation led, for more then Sixteen Hours of your time, are strenghtening Evidences, of those Witnesses Credibility, and cannot but have been taken notice of by you as inferring the same things which they Depone. Whereby the <hi>Nota</hi> is fully taken off by the concurrence of four other positive Testimonys, agreeing with that of two of these Witnesses: by the <hi>Extraordinariness</hi> of the <hi>corpora delicti:</hi> by the <hi>Probability</hi> of <hi>Circumstances:</hi> And finally by the whole <hi>Chain</hi> of this Affair, and the Sparkles of an Infernal Fire, which in every place have broke out of it.</p>
                     <p>It is true there are some few of the Circumstances that are proven only by one Witness. But as to this, you may consider, <hi>1st.</hi> That a Witness Deponing <hi>de facto proprio,</hi> is in Law more credited than any other single Witness: And this is the present Case as to some of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent, Concomitant,</hi> and <hi>Subsequent,</hi> Circumstances of Fact, do sustain the Testimony and makes the <hi>Semi-plenary</hi> Probations to become full. But, <hi>3dly.</hi> The other Circumstances, undoubtedly proven by concurring Witnesses, are <hi>per se, sufficient:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you saw us, at the desire of the Judges, forbear to call the far greatest part of our Witnesses; because the time had already run to so great a length, and it was thought that there was already enough proven of presumptions: For it may as reasonably be imagined, that the most Regular and Curious Scheme had emerged from the fortuitous concourse of Atoms roving without Rule, as that so many Indications should <hi>Concenter</hi> against each of these Prisoners, and yet they remain Innocent of Witchcraft.</p>
                     <p>Now upon the whole, you will take notice, that Presumptions being vehement, make a more certain Probation then Witnesses: Because Presumptions are Natural Emanations of the thing it self, which cannot be bribed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas Witnesses are obnoxious: So in our Law there was one condemned for Theft, another for falshood, and a third for Murdering of a Child, meerly upon Presumptions, as is related by Mc. <hi>Keinzie</hi> in his Criminal Treatise: much more may Presumptions, add to the credit of, and take off the <hi>Nota</hi> from, positive Witnesses, For it is a gross mistake, that several proofs, which have each of them some Import, may not be joyned to make a full Evidence, the same way as two small Candles in a Dark room, will not suffice; yet several others being added to them, will make a sufficient light, to discover the Murderer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Two Boys will be able to carry a Weight which one of them would not be able to sustain; as two units make a full number: One Witness of whatsoever dignity proves nothing; yet out of the Mouth of two or three Witnesses every Truth shall be established. And finally, Tho one Coal make not a Fire that can do the work; yet several Coals added to it encrease the Flame; which is hoped will be sufficient for the operation.</p>
                     <p>We shall therefore leave you with this Conclusion, That as you ought to beware to condemn the Innocent, and ought to incline to the safest side: so if these Prisoners be proven legally guilty; Then, <hi>as to what is past,</hi> your Eye ought not to spare them, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:31747:31"/>
swear, That the Prisoners, notwithstanding all that is proven against them, are not guilty of Witchcraft? In the Determination whereof we pray God may direct you to the right course.</p>
                     <p>The Jury being inclosed near six Hours, brought in their Verdict to Court, that they found the Inditement.</p>

                  <p>I have Collected according to my Promise, what appeared to me most <hi>Specious</hi> in the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, either in Court, or private Conversation about receiving of the Confessants as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. You are not to imagine, that the Prisoners were Condemned on the Credit of these: For I do believe the Probation by unexceptionable witnesses, led antecedent to this last, was so pregnant, that the Prisoners might have been Condemned on it, tho' these last had not been adduced.</p>
                  <p>I may have missed the Energy of the Argument sometimes, in a Case which in it self is so abstruse: However, you have it in such manner as I was able to comprehend it; as follows.</p>
                  <p>IN order to the more satisfactory Answering of the Objections made against these last Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, we shall first, lay before you the <hi>State</hi> of the Case: And, then, clear up the <hi>

                  <p>As to the First, The Question is not, whether Partners in the Crime, or others mentioned in the Objections, can be a Concluding Proof of themselves, tho' two of them should concurr as to the same Act of Witchcraft: But whether the <hi>Corpora delicti</hi> appearing already to imply Witchcraft, and the extrinsick Presumptions being so pregnant, to infer that these Prisoners are the Witches: there concurring such Characters, as by the observation of all Nations and Ages, are the Symptoms of a Witch; particularly the Marks, Fame, not shedding of Tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Providencial Discoveries of so dark a Crime, that like Avenues lead us to the Secret of it. And finally, when six persons of different Ages and Stations, fiye Confessants, and the Girl, do, when separatly examined, agree in their Answers to every material Question that is put to them, even tho' it be New; so that it could not be concerted: We say, whether or not in such a Case may Witnesses be received to compleat the Evidence by a Positive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, of a Matter of Fact which is the Object of Sense, tho' otherways they be liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if such Extraordinariness of the <hi>Corpora delicti,</hi> Clearness of the Circumstances, and of the Diagnosticks of the Witches; did not preceed them; as you have seen it proven they do?</p>
                  <p>The Case is not, whether these Witnesses would be good in an Ordinary Crime, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens to be exposed to other Witnesses, then those concerned in it: But whether they can be received in this <hi>Extraordinary, Occult,</hi> and <hi>Excepted Crime</hi> of Witchcraft; wherein there are two special Cases to be consider'd; <hi>viz.</hi> Sometimes the Acts thereof are open and admit the choise of Witnesses; such as Charms used in the Day-time, when the Actor is visible. But that part of Witchcraft, whereby Witches meet in the Night-time, Adore their Lord, contrive their mischievous designs, and accordingly afterwards put them in Execution, when other Witnesses are asleep, or the Witches themselves are covered from sight: We say, that this can be no otherways proven than by these that are privy to it, joyned to the Positive Proof and Presumptions before-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>We do not alledge, that Persons altogether destitute of Knowledge and Natural Conscience are to be admitted in any Case, such as Infants, Mad, Foolish Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither do we contend, That <hi>Thomas Lindsay</hi> and <hi>Christian Shaw,</hi> who are under Age, should be put to their Oath; for they are only to be examined separatly before the Court, upon Queries, by which it may appear, whether or not they agree with the four other Confessants, that are to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
<pb facs="tcp:31747:31"/>
before them; and this is the Prisoners Advantage in case of Disagreement: But we insist, that any Person above Nonage, giving Evidences of considerable Knowledge and natural Conscience (which is a sufficient Fond for all the Credit that we need in this Case, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready almost fully proven) is to be received as a Witness.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>2d.</hi> We shall make this as clear as Noon-day. <hi>1st.</hi> From Reason and the Nature of the thing. <hi>2dly.</hi> The unanimous Judgment of Lawyers in all Nations and Ages. <hi>3dly.</hi> Our own Customs and Decisions. And <hi>4thly.</hi> The Singularity of this Circumstantiat Case.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>First.</hi> The going to, and coming from Meetings, especially on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oot; the falling down, and worshiping the Devil there, untler a Corporal shape (which he had when he tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour to do it) The actual Murdering of Children by a Cord and Napkin; and the Tormenting of Others by Pins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are plain Objects of Sense: And therefore he Senses are to be believed concerning them. For as Reason hath Things Intelligible, and Faith Things Supernatural; so the Senses have Things C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rporeal to their Object, as to which they are to be trusted, until it be Proven, that the Appearance is Impossible, or that the Witness of it, is an Impostor. It is part of the Witches Purchase from the Devil, that they cannot be seen on some occasions: So that the Abominations committed then would remain unpunished, if such Witnesses were not admitted. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> cannot be thought that Witches (who of all Criminals are the most backward to Confess) would venture the loss of their own Lives, by Deponing against others, against whom they have no special Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>que; yea, for whom they have particular Affection, as several of the Prisoners are some of the Witnesses Relations. Nor has the Devil any peculiar Interest to Instigat them thereunto: For several of the Prisoners have confessed other execrable Crimes: Whereby it cannot be supposed, That Satan would be divided against himself. God in his ordinary Providence has taken such care of publick Judgments, that the Enemy of Justices special Power ceases as to that, as appears by the Witches not being able either to do more Harm, or to escape, after God's Ministers begin to counteract Satan's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments by Imprisonment. And finally, the oddness of the Crimes, the Concurrence of the Presumptions; and the existence of Matters of Fact, wherein these Consessants (tho' not knowing the same otherways) do agree with other unexceptionable Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently add to their Credibility: For as Falshood being a Crime, is never presumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>For Illustrating of which, it is further to be considered, that for the most part and ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Witches are Personally existent in the places where they appear; because it's more easie for the Prince of the Air to transport them in his Hurricanes which he can raise, as is plain in the instance of <hi>Iob</hi> (who was put in his power, <hi>i. e.</hi> his <hi>natural Power</hi> without Delegation) forming a <hi>Fence</hi> upon their Face, whereby the violence of the Air may be diverted from cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them: Than to form the curious <hi>Miniature</hi> of such various Transactions on their Brain: The Difficulty whereof is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> are not disposed at all times the same way; and they have not the Seeds of this Work, unless they had once acted it in reality. It is both the greater Crime and Pleasure to act in reality, which therefore the Devil and Witches do rather chuse (unless the Place be far distant, or the Party indisposed) and this <hi>de facto</hi> is attested to be so, by the Writers and Witches in all Nations and Ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:31747:33"/>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> Notwithstanding that the Rule must hold, till an Exception of Exculpation be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, as to a particular Person, by Evidencing, that the real Appearance was in that special Case a true Mistake; yet this Exception is sufficient for safety of the Misrepresented; since the same Providence which permitted the Affliction, will order the Out-gate and Exculpation; either by the Aerial Bodies not abyding the Touch, or some other distinction, as Providence commonly allowes the Devil to Personate only with Cloven Feet, or that the Apparition was solely to one Single Witness, who cannot be a Proof; or that the Innocent can prove <hi>alibi;</hi> or Finally, the known Character of a <hi>Samuel,</hi> will purge and dispel the Aspersions of Satan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived on purpose to discredit the Evidence of Sense, by which alone his Instruments can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Especially this Character being joyned to the other Circumstances of the Providence; such as when Good Men are Disguised, they are mostly passive in the Scene and Presumptions. Whereas Witches are Personally active in their common Life by such Words and Deeds, as (in conjunction with these Appearances) conspire to make us know, and distinguish them from the truely Good; since these Witches open <hi>Profanity, Naughtiness,</hi> or <hi>Unvailed Hypocrisy,</hi> being clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fame, sealed by the Mark, and confirmed by the other discoveries of the Presumptions that ly proven before you, do still make a Land-mark betwixt the Children of Darkness and Light. So <hi>Delrio, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <hi>N.</hi> 5. tells of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and St. <hi>Germanus,</hi> against whom Probation was adduced for <hi>Sorcery,</hi> but Providence did disprove it. It's a famous instance of <hi>Susanna,</hi> represented by the Elders; which, though not in the Case of <hi>Spectre,</hi> yet agrees in the <hi>Rationale.</hi> The Representation by <hi>Pharo</hi>'s Magicians had <hi>Concomitants,</hi> by which they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and confounded. But Lastly, suppose that GOD, in the Depth of his Wisdom (to Convince the Error of too much Self Confidence) should permit all necessary Probation to concur against an Innocent Person; yet the Judge, following the Faith of Proofs, Established by Divine and Humane Laws, is altogether Innocent: And since this Case is very Rare, the Evil is less than the Establishing a Principle, by which most of all these Monsters could not be cut off.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, It is certain, That tho' oft-times False Witnesses set on by the Devil, have taken away an harmless Life, by accusing it of Crimes; yet the Testimony of Witnesses must still be credited, till they be made Evident: so these Appearances of Witches, with the other Specialties before exprest, being Proven, ought to be esteemed Real, till the Fallacy be made Evident. Especially seeing there are Examples in ancient and Modern History of Satan's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the best of Men, as committing <hi>Murther, Buggrie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in effigie;</hi> so <hi>Delrio, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <hi>N.</hi> 5. relates, That St. <hi>Silvanus</hi> was represented by the Devil, as committing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Capital Crime: And the like of a Monk: Whereof there are several Modern Paralel Instances; yet this cannot enervate the Rule and Faith of Publick Judicatures, founded on no more but upon the sight of the like Appearances; and any Argument against the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Witchcraft, will equally hold against the Probation of any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Finally, the Certainty is noways diminished by the Extraordinariness of the Appearance to the Senses: For in Law and Nature Reality and not Simulation is presumed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> what is at its back.</p>
                  <p>For to this it would be answered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st. Proven facts</hi> must not be denyed, tho' Philosophers have not yet certainy reached the
<pb facs="tcp:31747:33"/>
Invisible manner of their Existence: So in Nature, the Load-stone draws the Iron, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass turns always to the Poles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Scripture the Angel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> (and the Devil was once such, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining as yet his <hi>Natural Powers</hi>) smote the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that they could not <hi>see the Poor;</hi> tho' they saw the <hi>House. Balaam</hi>'s Ass perceived the Angel that stood undiscover'd to himself; and the <hi>Rod</hi> thrown down by the Magicians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was no doubt, seen by themselves, tho' Invisible to the By standers. VVhich <hi>holding of their eyes,</hi> Interpreters explain to have been done by Natural Means; and yet the Manner thereof is certainly difficult.</p>
                  <p>However, it is also certain, that if a possible way can be proposed, the Reality of a proved Fact is not to be Contradicted: And this can be done in the present Case: For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> Satan's <hi>Natural</hi> Knowledge, and <hi>Acquired</hi> Experience, makes him perfect in the <hi>Opticks</hi> and <hi>Limning:</hi> Besides that, as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> he excels in Strength and Agility; whereby he may easily Bewitch the Eyes of others, to whom he intends that his Instruments should not be seen, in this manner, as was formerly hinted, <hi>viz.</hi> He constricts the Pores of the VVitches Vehicle, which intercepts a part of the Rayes reflecting from her Body; he Condenses the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjacent Air, with grosser Meteors blown into it, or otherwayes does violently move it, which drowns another part of the Rayes: And Lastly, He obstructs the Optick Nerves with Humors stirred toward them: All which joyned together, may easily intercept the whole Rayes reflecting from these Bodies, so as to make no Impression upon the common Sense; and yet at the same time, by Refraction of the Rayes, glyding along the Fitted sides of the Volatile Couch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Satan transports them, and thereby meeting and coming to the Eye, as if there were nothing interjacent, the VVall, or Chair, behind the same Bodies, may be seen; as a piece of Money ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of sight in a Cup, becomes visible, so soon as the Medium is altered by pouring some VVater on it. Several of your number do know, that the Girle declared, That she saw and heard the Doors and VVindows open at the VVitches entry, when, no doubt, the Devil had precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed a soft stoppage on the Eyes and Ears of others, to whom that was unperceiv'd.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Apolinus</hi> escaped <hi>Domitian</hi>'s <hi>sight;</hi> and <hi>Giges</hi> became invisible by his Magical Ring. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Sali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some <hi>Italian</hi> VVitches of greater then ordinary wit confessed to <hi>Grillandus,</hi> the <hi>Devils</hi> opening Doors and Windows for them, tho the more Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, by a Fascination, think themselves actors of this. Whence it ought not to be doubted, by any reasonable Man, what in all Times and Places is so uncontestible Fact.</p>
                  <p>Finally, The Prisoners could not insist, that those Confessants are to Depone only on their <hi>imagination.</hi> which can prove no more against themselves, or others, than a <hi>Dream.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For still its to be minded, that there are other Proofs to which this is only necessary, as a Consonant Circumstance. But further, <hi>Arg. causa,</hi> It is answered, That the Allegation is a mistake; seeing they declare plain Matters of Fact, obvious not only to one, but to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their Senses, <hi>viz.</hi> Some of them went the greatest part of the way to these Meetings on Foot: they there Saw and Touched their Confederates; they heard their Combinations to Destroy and Torture the Infants, the Girle and the Ministers: They returned on Foot again: and even when they were carried thither, or back again, they knew, on the next day that it was no Dream, by the same way as all other Mortals discover the difference. But moreover, this is Confirmed by some real effects of a Personal Presence, as you have seen in the Probation: And it is yet further cleared by the Journal of <hi>Bargarrens</hi> Daughters Sufferings; which was At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested before the former Commissioners, and is known in the Country; particularly the Glas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Girle, the Hood-wink'd, her falling in Fits at their approach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And others, which shall be pointed at to the Jury, conjoyned together, can be ascribed to no other cause then the Real ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>stence of the Witches Persons in the place: Unless it be said, That Satan might possibly have foisted and suborned all those; and thence it be concluded, that the Devil did actually so, in which case the Objecters are the Persons that found their Opinion on Imagination, without any positive ground of the reality of what they fancy; yea, against positive grounds, of belief in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; which arguing from Possibility to Existence, is already sufficient exploded.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, for strengthning the Objection it is alledged, That the Confessants having been in the Devils Service, and Renounced Christ, they are not capable o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> the Religion of an Oath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:31747:34"/>It is Answered,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First.</hi> In the Rules of Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Confessants, tho once Witches, have now, at least the Majority of them, ceased to be such, having had the use of Means, by the Ministers and Word, and actually declared their Repentance, and the Devils ceasing to molest them; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> was only carried along violently by her Father, and stood out, to the last, Renouncing of her Batism, or consenting to those Crimes which were contrived in their Meetings. <hi>Ianet</hi> and <hi>Margaret Rodgers</hi> do testifie a great Remorse, and Avowed the same last Sabbath in the Face of the Congregation. So those three are sufficient, whatever might be said against the other two, especially if we joyn the Improbability, either of hazarding their own Lives, or the Devils sending them out against these Prisoners, or their destroying their own Relations; as was remarked before. But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> Whether they remain Witches or not; It is certain, by Reason and Experience, that the Devils Peculiar Influence ceaseth when they are brought to Judgment: by the common course of Providence: And therefore the Authors before cited admit Witches whether Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> All the supposed defects of their Evidence is supplied, and the Intireness thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, by their Testimonies being so wonderfully Confirmed; particularly the Confessants are constant from the first discovery; Uniform in such various Circumstances, not only with themselves, but with the Girle: They declare nothing but what is probable, most of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners having been reputed Witches, all of them having the Mark; and one or other of them, (to whom their Associates who delighted in Mischief, never failed to joyn) having had particular Provocations to take revenge by the Torture and Deaths mentioned: Besides, the other Presumptions of Guilt already proven before you. The Confessants were threatned to Retract by the Prisoners Themselves and their Friends: Besides the bad Usage from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Countrey. They concurr with the Bewitched Girles Testimony, and amongst themselves, even when examin'd singly: and upon new things: as several of your number have tryed the Experiment: on this head <hi>Delrio, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <hi>N.</hi> 5. wisely observes, <hi>Quamvis tam facile foret demoni plures decipere quam unum tamen non est censendus Deus hoc aeque p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ntiae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae.</hi> The Reiteration of the Acts which they declare, as to some Persons that they never saw, except in these Congresses, and yet whom they knew now on the first sight, is unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if they were Cheats: And that they are not such is further confirm'd by some of the Prisoners being Accused, by a Confessing Witch in <hi>Anno</hi> 1687. And you know that others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd by these Confessants, were lately brought in Guilty by the <hi>Verdict</hi> of a former Inquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are so many joynt proofs of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Integrity, and make a Chain of Evidence and Moral Demonstration both against Error in themselves, and Delusion, in Relation to others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were some things objected from the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which also I shall give you a touch.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it was alledged, That <hi>Irretiti Criminibus Capitalibus,</hi> those who are Indicted for Capital Crimes, and so under the Pursuers Power, cannot be admitted to be <hi>Witnesses;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to a Statute in <hi>Regiam Majestatem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this it was answered, That we need not say, that these statutes have not the force of Law, except in so far as they are received by Custom; and are conformable to Law. A Laick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Witness against a Clerk, or <hi>e contra,</hi> &amp;c. Nor need we make use of that which is Obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> That these Statutes are only common Rules in ordinary Crimes; which have their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in all Occult and excepted Crimes, such as Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c. Nam omnis regula subverti potest,</hi> and particularly this Rule is actually so restricted in the Case of Witchcraft, by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Lawyers and the Customes before-mentioned, which are the best <hi>interpreters</hi> of Laws: For if this Application should hold, a <hi>socius criminis</hi> could never be admitted: But we positively deny, that those Confessants are under our Power or Influence; seeing <hi>Elizabeth Anderson</hi> is not Guilty of Witchcraft, for any thing that does appear: The <hi>Lindsays</hi> were never indicted for it; and the Inditement against <hi>Ianet</hi> and <hi>Margaret Rogers</hi> was drop'd; as the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is to Expire against the first of <hi>Iune,</hi> betwixt and which time, they are to proceed no further then this particular Trial. So that this Objection vanishes into smoak.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the <hi>Rogers</hi>'s cannot be received, because not given out in the List of Witnesses; conform to the Regulation, whereby the Prisoners might have proven their Objection by their Exculpation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:31747:34"/>It was answered, <hi>1st.</hi> This Objection ought to be rejected; because, besides that the Act speaks only of Criminal Libells, and not Indictments, which with the List of the Witnesses may be given in far shorter time than the Additional List has been given to the Prisoners indited, being Prisoners: This Act is interpreted by the common Custom of the Justice Court; of giving additional Lists after the first, upon shorter time then this has been given: As is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attested by <hi>Iames Guthry</hi> Macer, who gave them, and being a Person <hi>in Officio,</hi> his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is to be Credited in what relates to his Office: so that the old Custom confirmed by a Decision, <hi>August 3d.</hi> 1661<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where <hi>Alexander Forrester</hi> was cited <hi>apud acta</hi> against a VVitch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues as to this point, as is related by <hi>McKenzie, pag.</hi> 529. But <hi>2dly.</hi> Any Objection that the Prisoners pretend against these Witnesses, is <hi>in jure,</hi> or may instantly appear. <hi>3dly.</hi> The Case is altogether extraordinary and Circumstantiat: For these Witnesses had not Confessed: And so were not existent under that Reduplication when the principal List was given out: whereby the Act of Parliament can only be understood of Witnesses, that were then existent. And finally the Prisoners got a general warrand of Exculpation for citing of any Witnesses they pleased, and they have had several Days since they got this additional List, so that they might have cited Witnesses to prove their Objections, were it not the truth is, they have none, besides these that are common and before Answered.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you hints that your own Reason (which I know to be refin'd) may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and apply, so as to dissolve the quibles which the <hi>petty witts,</hi> who have not Soul enough of themselves to penetrate into the depth of that which is abstruse may raise against it: It being their common Talent either to Skipp over things Superficially, or else to Attaque some of the slightest outworks, and then to Triumph as if they had obtain'd the Victory.</p>
                  <p>I must confess that none could be more sceptical as to the Truth of such odd things as I had heard; nor inquisitive for canvassing the Reality, and Explications of them, then I was before my attendance at <hi>Bargarrans</hi> House, and the several dyets of Court; and my Conversation with some of those concerned in the matter. But now, after all that I have seen, reasoned, and heard; I do acknowledge may self entirely captivated by the dictats of Natural understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and common Sense, into a firm belief and perswasion, that, as there is such a thing as Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, so it was eminent in its forementioned Effects; and that the seven Prisoners were some of the Witches.</p>
                  <p>I have troubled you little with my own Observations; yet lest you should think me too Lazy I shall make one, and that is, that I do not think the greater part of the condemned Prisoners will ever fully Confess: For which Conjecture I have two grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are neither Ignorant nor Melancholick; but on the contrary, some of them would seem to have been once enlightned before they fell away, so that if this be a Sin unto Death, there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that they will glorify God by Confession.</p>
                  <p>Several of them are persons of singular Knowledge and Acuteness beyond the common level of their Station: Particularly <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> did make Harangues in her own defence, which neither Divine nor Lawyer could well out-do: Yet I thought that when they sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> of any concern, their Eyes stood Squint and Fixed, as if they had been turning their Ears and attending to some invisible Dictator. Their answers to the trying Questions put to them, were Surprisingly subtile and Cautious: Tho indeed, by the Indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ry of some of the Judges and Lawyers, they were sometimes catch'd in Lyes, Prevarications, and Contradictions; which might have proceeded either from Natural or perternatural Causes. Some of them were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed in the Country to be very Sagacious and Exact in their Bussiness: <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> having been a noted Midwife, and one of the <hi>Lindsays</hi> having acquired a considerable Fortune by his Tillage and Trade: Yet it was observed, that there did commonly break out in their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical way of Living, something Odd either of Iniquity or Affectation; and <hi>Lindsay</hi> did cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly enough get off from the Sheriff when he was formerly accused in 1687.</p>
                  <p>Melancholy persons are lovers of Solitude; Witches of Society, and Feasts: Those are commonly Pale and Heavy; many of these Corpulent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>oluptuous Witches are Hard to Confess as knowing their Guilt; The Melancholy delight to discover their horridest Damps, because they think them no Crime: The Contessions of the One are every where Uniform; the others Phantasms are as various as their Humours. Finally, Witches teach their Trade; whereas Conceits would Dye with the Melancholy; and can no more be conveyed by them to others then the Humour which is the Specifick cause thereof. As these distinguishing Characters do

hold in the General, so in this particular Case there are several others: Such as, most of the Prisoners were of Middle-age, one of them not much above Twenty; and the first Confessants are known to be Young: So that Dotage or Melancholly are the less to be suspected; yea was morally impossible in many of their Cases. For the Facts which the Confessants had formerly declared before the Commissioners for Enquiry, were sworn to by other unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses before the Commissioners for the Trial; and their Circumstances were such, that one of 'em could not know what was to be deponded by the other: As it's already manifest, that the real Effects in several passages of <hi>Bargarrans</hi> Daughter were not possibly producible by any Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination or Humour; and it is special in this Case, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> neither the Prisoners nor Confessants were Distempered by being kept from Sleep, Tortured, or the like, which were too usual in former times; but all the Measures were strictly observed, that are requisits to a truly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judgment.</p>
                  <p>I needed not insert the Copies of the Depositions themselves: Because it is not deny'd that they are such as represented in the Pleadings; the chief question being about the Legality of the last Deponents. Nor is there any need to insert the Defendants part of the Debate, sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately by it self; in respect that it is faithfully repeated or implied in what you have here sent you.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole I do believe; that there is scarcely a more remarkable Providence of this Nature to be found in any true History; nor was there ever a more exact Caution in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry or Trial of this kind: A more clear Probation, without Confession of the Prisoners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or, a more just Sentence, putting together all Circumstances, upon Record.</p>
