            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF there be any Man, Woman, or Child in City, Town, or Countrey, that can tell Tale or Tidings of a <hi>Salamanca</hi> Doctor, stolen, stray'd, banish'd or kidnapp'd out of <hi>White-hall</hi> on <hi>Tuesday</hi> last. His marks are as followeth; The off Leg behind something shorter than the other, and cloven Foot on the nether side; His Face Rain-bow-colour, and the rest of his Body black: Two slouching Ears, ready to be cropp'd the next Spring, if they do not drop off before; His Mouth is in the middle of his Face, exactly between the upper part of his Forehead and the lower part of his Chin; He hath a short Neck, which makes him defie the Pillory; A thin Chin, and somewhat sharp, bending up almost to his Nose; He hath few or no Teeth on the upper Jaw, but bites with his <hi>Tongue;</hi> His voice something resembles that of the <hi>Guinney</hi>-Pigs; His Habit is covered with a black Gown, which was made at <hi>Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> both at once, because he took his Degrees at both places at one time; His eyes are very small, and sunk, and is suppos'd to be either thick-ey'd, or Moon-blind, by reason he did not know <hi>C—m</hi> by Candle-light, tho' he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sworn <hi>Treason</hi> against him; He has a natural Bob-tail, because he never was dock'd nor gelded; He seldom frequents the Company of Women, but keeps private Communication with four <hi>Bums,</hi> to make good the old Proverb, <hi>Lying together makes Swine to love;</hi> His Food is the Intrals and Bloud of <hi>Loyalists;</hi> His Drink the Tears of Widows and Orphans; He is one that hath endeavoured to make the King Great, by taking away the Lives of his Friends by <hi>Perjury;</hi> which by consequence must expose His Sacred Majesty to the Fury of the <hi>Mobile;</hi> He is one that brought 40 Commissions from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and distributed them all for old Hats and old Shoes to the <hi>Papists,</hi> tho' no body ever saw one of them but himself; He hath 40000 <hi>Black Bills</hi> under his Gown, which he hath concealed these 3 years, and no body ever saw them but himself; His usual haunts are <hi>Dick's Coffee-House. Aldersgate-street, B—'s</hi> Conventicle, and St. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s Convent in <hi>Swallow-street;</hi> He is one that preached <hi>B—y</hi> before the Weavers, in respect to his Father being one of the same Trade and Tribe; He is one that swears quite thorow <hi>B—l</hi>'s Conscience, or the thick Basis of the <hi>Monument;</hi> He is one whose ingratitude to his Benefactors calls them <hi>Rogues</hi> and <hi>Rascals,</hi> and endeavours to swear their Lives and Estates away by <hi>Perjury;</hi> He is one that brought nothing but Rags and Lice into <hi>White-hall,</hi> but carried away Cart-loads of Goods, whereof part was his Famous Library, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That Famous <hi>History of Tom Thumb, Guzman, The Spanish-Rogue, French-Rogue, Don Thomazo Dangerfieldo, English-Rogue, All the Famous Histories of Robin Hood and Little-Iohn, The History of</hi> Wat Tyler <hi>and</hi> Jack Straw, <hi>All the Infamous Works of</hi> Smith, Janeway, Curtis, <hi>and</hi> Care; <hi>As also the great Works of that Unreverend Divine</hi> R. B—r, <hi>and another brave Book, much admired by the Doctor, called,</hi> Hobbs's Leviathan; <hi>also two brace of</hi> Bums, <hi>with a Masculine Chamber-maid, which he keeps to scour his</hi> Yard: All which, and a great deal more, he hath purchased by <hi>the price of Bloud and Damnation,</hi> since he creep'd into <hi>White-hall,</hi> and created himself <hi>Saviour of the Nation;</hi> He is one that has sworn it to be his duty to the Devil to make the K—to prosecute the Qu—, and to dis-inherit his Royal Brother, and to make the Son rebel against the Father.—'Tis suppos'd he herds somewhere in the C—.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These are some part of the Marks of the Beast; Whoever can give any a count of him, let them repair to</hi> Dick'<hi>s</hi> Coffee-House, Lying Curtis, Elephant Smith, <hi>or Mrs.</hi> Richard, <hi>and they shall have the Doctor's Wheel of Fortune for their pains, and perhaps be called as many Rascals to boot as the Doctor used to call the King's Life-Guards.</hi>
