         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>No body knowes, when the Great Judge will come; but the Prodigies advertiſe us to keep our ſelves ready, that ſo we may not be found as in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> Eating, and drinking, without care. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> under the government of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Nephew to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Rodolph</hi> his ſon (both meek Princes) no more remembred the calamities, which they had ſuffored through the difference about matter of Religion: Nor knew they now, what belonged to war, but by hear-ſay and report: for if by accident they ſaw any ſouldiers liſted, they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>France,</hi> or the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The Forces of the <hi>Dubos des deux Ponts,</hi> of Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> of <hi>Caſimir,</hi> and of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brunsmick,</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101836:11"/>of <hi>Colein,</hi> to interrupt the marriage of their Electour, proved not deſpiſable,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and had almoſt kindled a great fire: but it paſſed not over the <hi>Liſiere,</hi> and was quenched in the waters of the <hi>Rheyn,</hi> by the valour of the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> And ſo, by a good underſtanding of the Members with their Head, there returned a Calme: I mean, of the Electours, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with their Emperour. Fear was taken away; but diſtruſt, (which caſts her roots every where amongſt pleaſures cauſed by abundance) was not rooted out. This hath ſmothered the good Corn (as we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew) and dried up the fat of theſe rich Provinces; and <hi>that Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which was ſo formidable to the whole world would not have ſince been ſeen ſo miſerably torne in pieces, if ſhe had known how to keep her ſelf in unity, and concord.</p>
                  <p>Now, this deſirable <hi>Aurora</hi> had chaſed away the darkneſſe of the night; this Peace had lulled aſleep the better part of Europe, and the War was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired towards the extremities, or uttermoſt ends thereof; as that at Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Wars.</note> the <hi>Poles,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes;</hi> the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the <hi>Turks.</hi> But it was principally in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where it had fixed its Seate and Schoole. It was (I ſay) in this little corner near the Sea, amongſt great Rivers, and inacceſſible Fennes and Mariſhes, where it ſet up its Academy, ſo to render the Diſcipline thereof immortall. In effect, great ſpirits not being able to live at home in ſloth and idleneſſe, and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a laudable deſire of making themſelves famous in Arms, for the acquiſition of glory, haſtened thither from all parts, there to make their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſage; and ſome following the humour of their Prince, and others the intereſt of Religion, ranged themſelves on that ſide, to which their zeal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them.</p>
                  <p>How, becauſe from the knowledge of the Revolutions of the precedent Age, are drawne the trueſt cauſes and motives of the bloody and terrible Tiagedies, which are yet a playing in this of ours; we will reprize our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from the head, and having reached the ſource, follow the brooks, and rivers, till we come into that Sea of calamities and miſeries, wherein we ſee poor Chriſtians ingulfed at this day; who cannot truly call themſelves any more the Diſciples of their Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, ſince they have extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Peace, and brought confuſion, diſſentions and diſorders upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore this abominable Age, whereof the Scripture ſo clearely ſpeaks: This is that Kingdome of Iron, which ſhivers and ſubdues all things. <hi>The ſeven Angels have powred down their</hi> Vials upon the earth, which is filled with blaſphemy, maſſacres, injuſtices, diſloyalties, and infinite other evills, almoſt able to draw even the very <hi>Elect</hi> to murmuration. We have ſeen, and yet ſee, Kingdome againſt Kingdome, Nation againſt Nation, Plagues, Famines, Earthquakes, horrible Inundations; ſignes in the Sun, Moon, and Starres: anguiſhes, afflictions of whole Nations, through the tempeſts, and noiſe of the Sea. And whereas the Trees, by thruſting forth their buds, give us aſſurance of the approach of Summer; in like manner, will I be bold to ſay, that ſince thoſe things are come to paſſe, which have been foretold us, we ought not to make any difficulty to believe, that the End is at hand, and that the Son of man is coming in a Cloud, with Power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. O Great God! Inexhauſtible ſource of goodneſſe, and mercy! guide thou my pen, to the end that it ſay nothing but what is modeſtly true; to the confuſion of <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and the conſolation of the <hi>Elect.</hi> Let us therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at that miſerable Kingdome, the better part whereof, which makes the extremity and bound (as it were) to <hi>Europe,</hi> groanes at this time under the tyranny of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>

                  <p>This Kingdom being tormented by the Arms of the great Turk, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Emperour <hi>Rodolph,</hi> and he to the Princes and States of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> but they blinded by the proſperity of peace, and plunged in the delights which the fruits thereof produces; ſlighting the danger which moſt neerly concerned the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from abroad, ſlackly promiſed relief; which yet was retarded by the jealouſie of ſuch, as could not by any meanes brook the glory of that <hi>Family,</hi> and paſſionately wiſhed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, or rather the utter ruine thereof. <hi>Rodolph</hi> in the Diet, or Aſſembly at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſbone,</hi> made a remonſtrance, how <hi>Amurat</hi> the <hi>Sultan</hi> had broken the Peace of the year 1991. and taken many Towns, and Places of ſtrength,<note place="margin">Peace of the year 1591. broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Amurat.</hi>
                     </note> but he reaped nothing but winde; for it is in vain to preach to ſuch as will not hear. He dyed in the year 1595 and his Son <hi>Mahomer</hi> ſucceeded him; againſt whom the Chriſtians had neither good luck, nor bleſſing. For <hi>Agria</hi> was loſt becauſe the ſuccour came too late, as being delayed by the raines; and the Army appeared not till ſome dayes after it was taken; howſoever there firſt grew ſome skermiſhes, and afterwards a Battail, wherein the <hi>Turks</hi> were roured, and their Canon taken. But the Conquerors caſting themſelves too ſoone and too inconſiderately upon pillage, made them who fled regain their courage; in ſuch ſort as that they rallyed, and defeated an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſixty thouſand men, however they durſt not purſue them. By means of this memorable enterprize, the lot ſell upon the impregnable Town of <hi>Raab,</hi> which iſſued very happily for the good of Chriſtendome to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Count <hi>de Swartsbourgh,</hi> and <hi>Monſ. de Vanbecour,</hi> (a Lorraine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman) together with the <hi>French, Lorrains, Low-burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Walloons.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> having taken leave of the moſt Chriſtian King,<note place="margin">Mutiny of the <hi>French.</hi>

                  <p>The Place was inveſted, and the <hi>Turks</hi> could not ſuccour it; and the brave Earle of <hi>Swartſbourgh</hi> killed. Theſe deteſtable Mutiners, after having made many deſperate ſallyes, and fought long againſt Famine, (the gate of favour, and pardon being ſhut to them, who had ſo wickedly betrayed the Chriſtian
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101836:12"/>Party,) were at length almoſt all caught and puniſhed, according to the greatneſſe of their treaſon. <hi>Caniſia</hi> was taken by the <hi>Turk,</hi> and <hi>Stoul-Veſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> where he atchieved ſo much glory, that the <hi>great Turk</hi> intreated <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth to call him away. This war was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed about the end of the year 1606. The Emperours Souldiers muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of pay, and committed a thouſand robberies, which cauſed rebellious and great famine.

                     <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> is a part of the aforeſaid Kingdome of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and is much peopled, and moſt fortill: The Inhabitants ſpeak a language much like to that of <hi>Low-Saxony;</hi> and it is alſo very credible, that they ſprang from thence: but when or how is very uncertain.

But the ſtepping in of theſe latter created a great deale of diſtruſt; the inſeparable companion of contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinions: The Soveraign authority hath loſt part of her vigour; and her power is ſo much diminiſhed, that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> could not ſubſiſt but by the <hi>Majeſty of the Eagle.</hi> Let us ſummarily, and without deviating from our path, ſpeak of the glory of the ancient <hi>Hungarians;</hi> of the vertues, and ill habits which are found now amongſt them; and of the troubles which they ſuffer, or ſtill apprehend amongſt themſelves by the neerneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of the ſworne enemy of Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hungary,</hi> (anciently called <hi>Pannonia</hi>) is a Kingdome moſt abundant in all which Nature covets for her contentment. She is watered with moſt fair and great Rivers; which would make her moſt flouriſhing, if ſhe had not the Turk in her bowels: But ſhe hath an ayer a little too rough for ſtrangers. She hath produced a huge number of great Emperours; moſt Religious Kings; moſt holy Perſons, and men moſt learned in all kinds of faculties. <hi>Atilas,</hi> that ſcourge of God, came from them with his <hi>Huns,</hi> for the affliction of <hi>Europe;</hi> and many other Tyrants, who have often rended <hi>Germany,</hi> and made the Emperours pay them tribute a long time, to ſave their Country from the fury of their arms.</p>
                  <p>But vice reigns there now with ſo abſolute an Empire, as it renders the <hi>Hungarians</hi> very odious, and deſpicable. Ambition made them looſe a King, a ſaire Army, and <hi>Buda,</hi> the capitall City of the Kingdome. Avarice hurries them blindfold upon all wickedneſſe; and makes them ſometimes ſell the Chriſtians priſoners to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars;</hi> without ſparing ſo much as their own neer kindred, when the inſatiable hunger of mony hath vayled the eyes of their underſtanding.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101836:12"/>
                  <p>Their Kings have had frequent experiments of their perfidie; the <hi>Turks</hi> of their looſeneſſe; and the <hi>Germanes</hi> of their cruelty, treachery, and hatred; dangerous both to the one and the other, as having made many Fields un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, and brought much profit to their enemies. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> (ſaith an old Biſhop, writing to the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt) <hi>have ugly faces, hollow eyes, low of ſtature, and barbarous both in manners and ſpeech.</hi> And yet it muſt be avowed, that there alſo dwells vertue amongſt them, as well as amongſt other Chriſtians; that they defend Chriſtendome; and that their bodies are ſuch Bulwarks, as the <hi>Ottomans</hi> have not hitherto been able to leap, and which they muſt firſt caſt to the ground, if they intend to aſſayle <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> They are almoſt alwayes on horſe-back, and upon prey with them, and they ſerve themſelves of calamity for an aliment to their vertue. And indeed that of the valiant <hi>Count de Serin</hi> amongſt ſo many others, ſhined with ſo much glory, and conſtancy at the ſiege of <hi>Sigot,</hi> that it purchaſed him everlaſting praiſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hungarians</hi> with their Light Horſe do more hurt to the <hi>Turks,</hi> then to the <hi>Germanes;</hi> and in this laſt Warre of <hi>Bohemia</hi> they offended more by ſurpriſes, then by ſtanding Fights. In the Battel of <hi>Prague</hi> not being able to ſupport the rough onſet of the <hi>Walloons,</hi> and <hi>Germanes,</hi> they quickly gave ground, and ſo were partly the cauſe of that remarkable Defeat.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Province, which ſtretches it ſelf to the <hi>Icie Sea,</hi> is of a very large extent, governed by an <hi>Emperour,</hi> or <hi>Great Duke,</hi> with moſt abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (after the manner of the Eaſtern Countries) however it lye very near the North. The <hi>Muſcovits</hi> follow the <hi>Greek Religion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Greek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> under a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch; though yet it be mingled with very many ſuperſtitions, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be corrected, becauſe the Great Duke ſuffers none of his ſubjects to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and ſee other Countries. This people is much tormented by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> They have likewiſe waged great warres with the <hi>Polas</hi> and <hi>Swedes;</hi> but with many loſſes. They were very tyrannically governed by their Prince <hi>John Baſil,</hi> who was ſucceeded by his ſon <hi>Theodore,</hi> a Prince of ſmall ſenſe, for he let both himſelf and his Country be ruled by his wives brother called <hi>Borits Fedorits.</hi> He died without children, and his Brother-in-law was Great Duke after him. He had a brother named <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who (as many Authors worthy of credit have written,<note place="margin">The Hiſtory of <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
                     </note> with great apparences of truth) was ſtolne away in his infancy, ſo to be ſaved from the evident danger wherewith he ſeemed to be threatened by the authority of the ſaid <hi>Borits;</hi> and another very like him put in his place, was expoſed dead to the view of the people.</p>
                  <p>Now, this <hi>Demetrius</hi> being brought up in <hi>Poland,</hi> with the <hi>Palatine Sando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> after he had travelled in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> for the ſpace of twenty yeares, gave himſelf to be known for the ſon of <hi>Baſil,</hi> Brother to <hi>Theodore;</hi> and by the aſſiſtance of the ſaid <hi>Palatime,</hi> the <hi>Jeſnits,</hi> and the favour of the King himſelf, he entered the ſecond time into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> well accompanied by <hi>Germanes, Poles,</hi> and <hi>Coſacks. Borits</hi> raiſes a moſt puiſſant Army to oppoſe him, but the infidelity of his people, together with ſome loſſes, deprived him both of courage, and deſire of life: And ſo he died the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1605, not without ſuſpicion of having voluntarily prevented his misfortune by deſpaire. His ſon was received by ſuch as were of his faction:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101836:13"/>But the City of <hi>Moſco,</hi> together with all the Country, having admitted <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> for their Prince, he was forthwith caſt in priſon.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Demetrius</hi> had no ſooner made his entry into the ſaid City, but they began to murmure and ſay, that he was not the true <hi>Demetrius.</hi> The Lord <hi>Baſil Chimouskie,</hi> for having ſaid that he had cauſed the right <hi>Demetrius</hi> to be buried, brought his head upon a ſcaffold, which yet, by ſpecial favour, he brought back again to weare the Crown, and ſucceed the unfortunate <hi>Demetrius.</hi> O ſtrange effect of Fate!</p>
                  <p>The averſion of the people from poor <hi>Demetrius</hi> appeared yet more, when they underſtood that he had acknowledged the <hi>Pope,</hi> and introduced the Jeſuits, to work-about a Reformation. He married the daughter of his Foſter-Father, who made her entry into the head City the 26 of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1606.</p>
                  <p>The perſidy of this treacherous people was clearly diſcovered a moneth after; namely, the 27 of <hi>May,</hi> and their rage began its firſt effect upon the <hi>Poles</hi> and other ſtrangers, (who yet ſold their skins dear enough) and others paſſed on to the Court, there to finiſh the laſt Act of the Tragedy. The Prince hearing of the tumult, left the company of his wife (wish whom he then was) got away, and leapt down from the top of a Tower, through a window, at the foot whereof (being found yet alive) he was forthwith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched. This was done under the pretext of Religion.</p>
                  <p>He was a Prince of a great wit; a lover of hunting and warre, he had read much, was very ambitious, and went much in queſt of the allyances of the Kings of Europe; and nominatively of that of the <hi>Great Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Thus unhappily ended <hi>Demetrius</hi> his dayes, in the very <hi>April</hi> of his age, and the cruelty of the barbarous multitude continued even upon his dead body, which they tore in pieces: ſo violent is hatred ſtirred up by Religion, againſt ſuch as endeavour to change it, when fury has gotten the upper hand.</p>
                  <p>He was accuſed by a Declaration, to have been a Monk, an Heretick, and a Witch; and to have endeavoured to change the Religion of <hi>Ruſsia;</hi> ſupplant the Nobility of the Country, and introduce that of <hi>Poland;</hi> to have layen with his wife in the preſence of an image of our Lady, and many other things, which are tedious to rehearſe. A memorable example of the inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Fortune, who when ſhe moſt ſmiles is then moſt ready to ſhoot her inevitable ſhots of her irradicable hatred againſt ſuch as love vertue and conſtance. It was neceſſary to recount this for the greater knowledge of what we are to publiſh concerning <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which hath ſelt the tragical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Bellona,</hi> as well as the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> whereof ſhe is a good part.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Kingdome was governed by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and had no other enemy at that time then the <hi>Swedes,</hi> for the intereſt of their Prince. But before we give an account thereof, we will ſpeak of the manners, and Origin of the Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poland</hi> is of very vaſt diſtent, and takes her name from the great Fields which produce a huge quantity of Corn. The great Dukedome of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> is a part of this Kingdome; which is bounded on the one ſide by <hi>Muſcovy;</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101836:13"/>and on the other, <hi>Hungary, Germany, Livonia,</hi> and <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> or <hi>Boruſsia,</hi> to the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> there are many Fennes, Lakes, and huge Forreſts;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Poland</hi> full of Forreſts and Fennes.</note> as there likewiſe are through all the <hi>North,</hi> where, in the Trunks of Trees, is often found great ſtore of hony, whereof they make a certain Drink (chiefly in <hi>Lithuania</hi>) which is moſt delicate, and yeelds not awhit in goodneſs to <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wine. Now here well deſerves to be inſerted, the ſtory of a certain Peaſant or Countriman, who being fallen by accident into one of the Trunks, which was full of hony, ran great hazard to be drowned,<note place="margin">The ſtory of is Peaſant ſaved by a ſtrange accident.</note> without an almoſt miraculous ſuccour, which came to him by chance: And it was, a Bear approaching the ſaid place, to lick the hony (whereof theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are very lickoriſh) the poor man layd hold of his tayle; and the beaſt violently endeavouring to run away, drew the man out of this ſweet, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall precipice. The winter is there very long and ſharp; againſt the rigour whereof, the Inhabitants (who have no want of wood) ſerve themſelves of ſtoves, and good furred gownes, as all the Northern people do.</p>
                  <p>The Nobility is very ſtudious of Warre, and deſirous of Travell, and in ſhort, of an humour much like that of the <hi>French.</hi> They expreſs their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in the beauty of their Cloathes, Weapons, and Horſes; in the ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of Feaſts, Weddings, Funeralls, Chriſtenings; and in numerous Trains of ſervants too, when they go a woing. They are very ſtout, and decide their quarrels for the moſt part by encounters: ſo that there are more Fights, then Duels. They are very good ſouldiers, whereof they have given frequent teſtimonies againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> whom they oppoſe not with Fortifications and Bulwarks, for the defence of their Kingdome, and all Chriſtendome; but with their Bodies, in the Field. The <hi>Tartars</hi> do them much hurt by ſurprizes; who as ſoon as they have done their feat, and find the <hi>Poles</hi> advancing, betake themſelves to their heels with their pray, and fell their priſoners to the <hi>Turks,</hi> by whom they are made ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Polanders,</hi> (anciently called <hi>Sarmass</hi>) were very redoubtable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and contemned their power, they embraced the doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſince learning and ſciences have been in Vogue amongſt them, they are extremely civilized; as all other nations like wife are, which have changed the darkneſs of ignorance into light, and their brutiſh manners into amiable ſociety. The <hi>Latin</hi> tongue is ſo common amongſt them, that there are very few Gentlemen who do not ſpeak it. The cuſtome of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſword, when the Prieſt recited the Goſpel in the Maſs, is now aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ſome misfortunes which happened thereby: however by this zealous action, they ſignified themſelves to be willing to looſe their lives for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Goſpel, and for the ingrandizement and propagation whereof they have often tought againſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and do protect Chriſtendome to this day againſt the puiſſance of the Infidels: Though yet, they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this very zeal, both inconſiderately and perfidiouſly to break the ſworne Peace with the Great <hi>Turk;</hi> and were conſequently all cut off, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their King <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlans,</hi> near <hi>Varne.</hi> They are very ſtrong and tall, and have faces able to imprint the figure of feare in the countenance of the moſt confident. They ſlight the rigour of the cold, and all other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, which may hinder them from a glorious death. Yet is it alſo very true on the other ſide, that vice hath placed its dwelling there, as well as elſewhere; and that the contempt of the Lawes is not leſſe amongſt them, then in any other part of <hi>Europe.</hi> They who travell through <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> carry their beds with them yea, and ſometimes their victuals too, to ſhunne the hazard of an ill ſupper, and a hard lodging. Theſe two Nations have a faſhion of cloathing almoſt alike, which doth differ very little, and they both weare furred Bonnets. The Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion is the chief; however there be other alſo permitted, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101836:14"/>freely exerciſed amongſt them; as namely, the <hi>Arrian,</hi> and many other old <hi>Hereſies</hi> which are ſtill croaking there: beſides, the <hi>Greck Church</hi> hath alſo a great number of adherents there.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Poland</hi> is <hi>Elective;</hi> and when the King is dead, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Gsſue</hi> takes the Government of the State, and aſsembles the Senate and the Nobility for the election of another. During the Interreign, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, there is committed great ſtore of murthers and inſolencies, which moves ſuch as love the publick Quiet, to ſpeed the Election. The Nobility hath moſt high priviledges, whereby the Kings authority is much bridled and retained within the Lawes of the Kingdom whereof in a word they are ſo jealous, that they alwayes miſtruſt their Prince, and imagine every moment, that he will either take their lawes from them, or at leaſt diminiſh them, to make himſelf more abſolute.</p>
                  <p>Murthers are not ſo rigorouſly puniſhed here as in other parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlendome. For a Gentleman ſhall be quit for killing of another with one years impriſonment, and if the perſon murthered be of a mean condition, for a ſmall forfeit.</p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſticks have huge Revenues, for which they are much envied. The moſt eminent dignities amongſt them are to be Senatours, whom they call <hi>Waiwodes, Chatellans,</hi> and <hi>Staroſts,</hi> which are charges of Captains.

                  <p>
                     <hi>SIgiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> endeavouring to put two Crowns upon his head, loſt the <hi>Hereditary</hi> one. See how all paſſed, This young Prince had been brought up in the Roman Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though yet he were the ſonne of King <hi>Erick</hi> who embraced the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion</hi> of <hi>Ausbourgh,</hi> and introduced it into his Kingdome. This <hi>Erick</hi> was ſonne to King <hi>John,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sudermanic,</hi> whom he left in <hi>Sweden</hi> to govern that Kingdome in his abſence, in the quality of Vice-Roy.</p>
                  <p>Now it often chances, that Princes who have more then one kingdom, grow by little and little to looſe the affections of their remote ſubjects, and their authority comes alſo by degrees to be eclipſed; in regard that their ſaid ſubjects are not warmed by the heat of their favour, and prudence; and ſo others grow inſenſibly to take place, as well becauſe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence winnes the affections of the ſaid ſubjects; as alſo for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are never wanting to ſuch as have no will to obey: And beſides, every one ſtands in fear of forraine Rule. But the moſt powerfull argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the coldneſs of ſubjects towards their Soveraigne, is diverſity of Religions; which cauſes a change in State, and alters and ſhakes it ſo, as that many Princes for the ſtrengthening and fixing of theirs, have believed that they neither could, nor ought to permit any more then one.</p>

                     <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> inſtead of going to the Aſſembly of States at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> went ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly out of the kingdom, which he thereby loſt,<note place="margin">He retires our of the kingdom.</note> and regained <hi>Dantſick</hi> Some Authors have written, that he had been advertiſed of ſome ill deſign of his Uncle <hi>Charles</hi> againſt him: and a certain perſon who was then at <hi>Stockholm</hi> affirms, that he ſighed for his having let ſlip the bird which he had in his hand. However, thoſe Lords were beheaded, and their heads ſet upon ſtakes, which were ſince taken away upon the requeſt of a great Wanyer.</p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> quickly recovered thoſe places of ſtrength, which were in the Kings poſſeſſion; chaſtiſed the Citizens of <hi>Lubeck</hi> who had favoured him, cauſed the States to approve of all his actions, and ranged the <hi>Finlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (who held the Kings party) under obedience to himſelf. Some months
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101836:16"/>after, the States depoſed the King by a publick Decree, declaring him fallen from the Rights he had in the kingdom, and renouncing all fidelity to him; though yet ſtill they were ready to receive his ſonne <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlans</hi> for King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in caſe he would forthwith ſend him thither to be bred in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and cuſtomes of the Country.</p>
                  <p>But theſe conditions not ſeeming receivable, were not accepted by the King, and the proceedings of the States of <hi>Sweden</hi> cryed down by the <hi>Poles,</hi> who reſolved to take an account of them with the ſword.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſumme of what is known of that difference, which is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining between the Heires of theſe two Princes, and which is debated by very contrary reaſons, according to the predominancy either of Paſſion or Religion, and according to the knowledge alſo of the Right of the Parties concerned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> reproach the <hi>Swedes,</hi> for that without any available reaſon, and upon ſome ill grounded ſuſpicions only; yea, even againſt all Right both Divine and Humane, they took the kingdom from <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> to give it to <hi>Charles.</hi> To which the <hi>Swede;</hi> anſwer, that the King againſt his promiſe had endeavoured under hand to bring in the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> ſo to replant the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Religion, and ſtrangers to check and curb them; and many other arguments there are both upon the one ſide, and the other, which I let paſſe in ſilence, and which are found at large elſewhere.

                  <p>Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> after the reduction of <hi>Finlande,</hi> went into <hi>Livoma,</hi> where he gained ſome advantage upon <hi>Samonskie;</hi> beſieged <hi>Riga,</hi> but in vain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Sweden</hi> in great danger to be drowned.

                     <hi>Sweden</hi> is the biggeſt of all the Northern kingdoms, the Head City where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is <hi>Stockholm,</hi> a Town (the Suburbs and Sea-thore, or ſtrand compriſed) of great diſtent. There are many huge Mountains, Rocks, and Forreſts, where are ſometimes heard great illuſions, and phancies, as there likewiſe are in the water, which are very troubleſome and terrible both to men and horſes, which paſſe that way. The country is not much inhabited, and the chief Provinces are <hi>Weſt-Gothland, Eaſt-gothland,</hi> from whence (as alſo from the reſt of <hi>Sweden</hi>) according to the opinion of ſome Authours) came the <hi>Goths,</hi> who ſo much vexed the Romane Empyre.

                     <hi>DEnmark</hi> is a kingdom, the beſt part whereof conſiſts of Iſlands, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Zeland</hi> and <hi>Fionia.</hi> The Province of <hi>Scania</hi> reaches up to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Jutland</hi> to <hi>Holſtein.</hi> It was peacefully gouerned by the prudent conduct of King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the fourth, ſucceſſour to <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond his Father, and Duke of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> During his minority he had four Counſellours, to help him to bear the charge of the Government. He was crowned the 29<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year 1596.</p>
                  <p>The principal ſtrength of this Kingdom conſiſts of good and ſtately ſhips, whereof the King hath a conſiderable number, as well for the defence of his ſaid Iſlands, as for that moſt important paſſage of the <hi>Sownd,</hi> which is the ſtreight that ſeparates <hi>Scania</hi> from <hi>Zeland,</hi> and which is of huge advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by reaſon of the infinity of ſhips which muſt paſſe over it to go into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea: in the ſame manner, that thoſe of all the Havens of the ſaid Sea, and bound for the Ocean, are forced to paſſe that way.</p>
                  <p>The Nobility of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as alſo that of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> is much more inclined to warres then learning; zealous for their liberty and Rights, and makes no allyance by marriage with the common people; a maxime much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved through all the <hi>North, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> They rufuſe Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Honours as below their condition, defend their priviledges, and make no eſteem of others, though by their experience and knowledge, they may merit the beſt Offices and Employments in the Country.</p>
                  <p>The Government is not much unlike that of <hi>Poland,</hi> in both which <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Kingdomes</hi> the Kings undertake nothing of importance, without the conſent of the States and Nobility. The Gentlemen are all equall, and as it were of one Family; there being neither Earl nor Baron. The Officers of the Crown, and Counſellours of the kingdome, have the preheminency, and aſſiſt the King in the moſt weighty affaires of the Countrey.</p>

                  <p>Theſe three kingdomes were heretofore under the government of the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> But the <hi>Swedes</hi> not being able to ſuffer the tyranny of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the ſecond, divided themſelves from his obedience.</p>
                  <p>They all follow the <hi>Lutheran Religion;</hi> and the Capitall City of <hi>Denmark</hi> is <hi>Coppenhaghen;</hi> a very fair town, ſituated upon the ſtreight of the <hi>Sownd</hi> near the <hi>Baltick Sea;</hi> a paſſage of about four leagues, moſt pleaſant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative, by means of a Forreſt which borders upon the Sea from <hi>Coppen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haghen</hi> to <hi>Elſener:</hi> of which paſſage, becauſe it is ſo much envyed, we will hereafter ſpeak more at large.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low-countries.</hi> She was a ſworne enemy to the Roman Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeemed to have made it her task to deſtroy that, as well as ſhe had the King, who bears the ſurname of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> is a kingdom which makes a part (but not the better part) of this Iſland. There reigned as King, <hi>Lames Stewart;</hi> a Prince eſteemed very wiſe, who reſented not at all the death of his Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> who was beheaded in <hi>England,</hi> preferring the hope of ſucceſſion to the ſaid kingdom before revenge, courting the favour of the Queen, and treading all other conſiderations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. But heaven left nothing unpuniſhed, which often revenges inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence upon the Innocent themſelves, to chaſtiſe them who have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged it.</p>
                  <p>He married <hi>Anne</hi> Siſter to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and lived in peace: which yet was diſturbed by dreadful conſpiracy of a certain Earle called <hi>Gore,</hi> whoſe Father was beheaded in the end of the ſaid Kings mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now this <hi>Gore</hi> returning from travel, ſent his brother to the King as he was hunting, whom when he had made believe, that there was a certain man who had found a great pot full of gold, he led him into his ſaid bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Cabinet, or Cloſet, where, had he not been ſuccoured by his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he had been unhappily murthered. The Tragedy was afterwards acted upon them, who intended themſelves to have been the actors thereof, and the murtherers were juſtly murthered. In this tragedy, they who were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, found ſuch myſteries, as their modeſty kept in ſilence.

                     <hi>Ireland</hi> is an Iſland both big and fruitfull, between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have exerciſed great power and authority, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Religion, as for the Rebellion of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt Queen <hi>El'zabeth,</hi> &amp; calling the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to help them. But they grew at length to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and have long been governed ſince by Deputies, or Vice-Kings, under a moſt auſtere Diſciplipe, which hath conſtrained ſome of them to flye to the main Land, and others to retire themſelves into the Woods and Forreſts, amongſt the wild beaſts, to ſeek their liberty, after their own faſhion.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland was heretofore conquered by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the <hi>Norman</hi> under <hi>William the Conquerour.</hi> Their lawes have ſome

                  <p>The Popes, as well by donation as other practiſes, have not onely augmented the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but drawn alſo all the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to themſelves, by removing the Emperours from the knowledge of the Affaires of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Faction of the <hi>Guelphes</hi> for the Popes, the <hi>Gibelms</hi> for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101836:18"/>reigned there long, and was not conſopited or quieted, but by eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing almoſt the whole Majeſty of Emperours by endeavouring to conſtrain them to receive the Crown from their hands: A difference not quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed yet. Beſides, that they have ever been unhappy enough in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their Right by Arms, the <hi>Italians</hi> cutting them out work enough amongſt themſelves, and often hindring their coming out of <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo that all the ſplendour of the Empyre remaines there, and is no otherwiſe known throughout almoſt all <hi>Italy,</hi> then only by name.</p>
                  <p>Under the Reign of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the Weſtern Empire was much tottered by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which forced moſt of the principall Families near the Sea, to retire into the Iſlands of the <hi>Adriatick Streights,</hi> and there lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that moſt puiſsant City of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of that moſt <hi>Serene Republick,</hi> which hath encreaſed, maintained, and conſerved herſelf theſe twelve ages, by an unparallelled bleſſing; by the moſt perfect obſervance of the Lawes, and by a policy worthy of admiration. This gives juſt cauſe to judge, that they who began her, were of the moſt elevated and prime of all <hi>Italy;</hi> and not ſlaves, as they were who laid the firſt ſtone to the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Peace which was made between the <hi>Emperour Charlemayne,</hi> and the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it was concluded, than that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth which had already ſtood more then three ages and a halfe, ſhould ſerve for a bound and gate to the two Empyres. They had for a long time in their poſſeſſion the kingdom of <hi>Gypres,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> have now taken from them. They have had many enemies, and have often by their great prudence diverted the ſtorms which have been ready to fall upon them, and by the dexterity of their mannagements, regained that which they had loſt by the fate of Arms. That mad League of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> would have invaded any other State but theirs: ſo much amazement did it ſtrike into thoſe <hi>Areopages;</hi> who yet, by their rare induſtry were able to untangle this fatal conjuncture, and ſave their Common-wealth from the ſhipwrack wherewith ſhe was much threatned. In fine, after that peace which they had made with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and which followed cloſe upon the glorious Battel (but with ſmall fruit) of <hi>Lepante,</hi> they finiſhed that Age and began this preſent, in good intelligence with their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King of Spain</hi> enjoyes in <hi>Italy</hi> the kingdomes of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Duchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> upon which States the <hi>French</hi> have alſo their pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which often cauſe frequent warres between the two Crownes, whereof we ſhall ſpeak towards the end of this Treatiſe, in the revolution of thoſe laſt tumults.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuskany,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> keep their Seates in peace, and the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> hers, tyed faſt (for her profit) to the intereſts of <hi>Spain. Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> a Prince as ſubtle as inconſtant (but yet unlucky enough) for having ſeized upon the Marquiſat of <hi>Salluces,</hi> found himſelf forced to put on his harneſſe, and to leave his reſt in the firſt year of this age, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew; neither his journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> nor all the politick craft he could uſe, being able to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him from this check. The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> are very potent, and often ſeen to make the skale hang towards that Crown, to which they leane. <hi>France</hi> ſeeks their friendſhip to have the gate open into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the intrigues whereof ſhe finds her ſelf paſſionately concerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lorraine</hi> was governed by <hi>Duke Charles,</hi> a milde Prince, who ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the wrong which the enemies of the League (whereof the Princes of that houſe were the chief) had made him ſuffer. This Province (which divides <hi>Germany</hi> from <hi>France</hi>) is very fruitfull, and takes her name
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101836:18"/>from the Emperour <hi>Lotarius</hi> and her Princes, their Deſcent from <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne.</hi> They have alwayes been great Warriers, and <hi>Godfree</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> through zeal of piety, went and conquered the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dukes of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> for intereſt of State, keep good correſpondence with their Neighbours; and the laſt misfortune which happened in this Duchy, was cauſed rather by the decline of the Emperours Affayres, and the ambition of him who thought all lawfull to him, then by the fault of the Prince, who could not ſhelter himſelf from that ſtorme, which had already ſhivered both Maſts, Sayles, and Helme.</p>
                  <p>Theſe States aforeſaid, in regard they never knew any Religion but that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuffer not any other ſo much as to bud, or ſpring there, and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure there be any one found in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> who hath embraced the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> he retires himſelf to <hi>Metz,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> and they of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Luxenbourgh</hi> to <hi>Sedan. Diverſity of Religions parts humours, gives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of motion to ſuch as are ambitious, and makes a Prince very little loved by them who are not of the ſame opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have already gone round about <hi>Europe,</hi> therefore let us now enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle, and ſpeak of thoſe great Monarchies, which by their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ſhaken all other States, as being governed according to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof, and accommodating their intereſts to the ballance of their greatneſſe. For ſince Warre hath been declared between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> very few Princes have ſtood Neutrall; ſome having joyned their forces to the party moſt neceſſary for them, and ſome others (though but ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) have not yet forborne to poiſe more to the one ſide then the other. But none have been willing to have either of theſe Crowns ſuppreſſed by the other, for the apprehenſion and fear wherein they all are of a Generall Monarchy.</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, having broken the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> in a great Battail, eaſily made himſel Maſter of the Duke dome of <hi>Milan</hi> and conſequently of the kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> But Fortune ſmiled upon the <hi>French</hi> only to betray them: For ſhe ſuddenly turned to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who took King <hi>Francis</hi> priſoner, and eſtabliſhed themſelves in the ſaid kingdome, and in the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> Now from hence proceeded the hatred between the two Nations, which hath ſince been augmented according to occurrences of State-jealouſies, and other conſiderable accidents, whereof we will here give a ſhort hint.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> But there is a ſecond and a more pregnant reaſon, for which not only <hi>France,</hi> but the neighbouring States alſo have conceived apprehenſions of jealouſies, which is that of the Union of <hi>Spain</hi> by marriage with the houſes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the latter of theſe began thus. <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> (none to <hi>John the ſixth</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> for having well defended his Father in a Battail againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was by marriage made Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Prince of the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded him not onely in all the Provinces of his Parents, but in the hatred alſo which he bore to the Houſe of <hi>Orleans.</hi> Now, this young Prince going with a great force of the Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Low-countries</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who would have cauſed him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, as well as the reſt of the priſoners, had he not been adviſed to put him to a Ranſom, and ſend him home; and this becauſe it was diſcovered in his phyſiognomy, that he ſhould one day become the Author of much diſturbance to Chriſtendome: which afterwards proved true. For he cauſed the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to be maſsacred, which raiſed a huge warre between theſe two illuſtrious Houſes, to the great advancement of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> affaires in <hi>France.</hi> But now, for the remedy of all thoſe evills, a Peace was made, and Duke <hi>John</hi> aſsaſſinated in a Conference in the preſence of the <hi>Dolphin.</hi> Now this diſmal chance, this unſeaſonable revenge, and this mad Counſell was the cauſe why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Flemmings,</hi> made themſelves maſters of almoſt all the kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Good,</hi> joyned with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to revenge the death of his Father againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh.</p>

                  <p>THe King <hi>of Spain</hi> was in no leſſe trouble about the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> for the conſervation whereof, he ſpared not his Treaſures brought him from the Indies; nor followed leſſe the Counſell of <hi>Cardinal Granvel,</hi> then the Roman Catholicks of <hi>France</hi> did that of the <hi>Cardinal of Lorraine.</hi> But the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> eluded their care, in ſuch ſort, as that neither the wiſe conduct of the <hi>Ducheſſe</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> nor the rough proceedings of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> nor the very preſence of King <hi>Philips</hi> Brother himſelf, no nor the inimitable valour of that <hi>Great Italian Alexander,</hi> was able to prevaile ſo farre, but that ſeven Provinces untied themſelves from obedience to the King, and formed a potent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth amongſt themſelves, by the change of Religion; without which, it is very probable, that neither the ſituation, nor the Rivers, not all that which could hurt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would have been able to ſecure or defend them againſt the potency of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now from whence came all theſe diſorders? Who laid the firſt ſtone, and fixed the foundation of ſo diſmal and fatall a Warre? There are many cauſes, and divers pretexts thereof to be noted. We will therefore go to the fountain, ſince the ſtreams are ſufficiently known. Under the General Title of <hi>Low-countries,</hi> are compriſed <hi>ſeventeen Provinces;</hi> ſo rich, ſo well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, ſo full of fair Towns, and big Villages, together with the ſituation and ſtrength of the Inhabitants, that if they were united together, I know not who would preſume to attach them, how powerful ſo ever he were, either by <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Land.</hi> But plenty doth not more diſunite people then want, and the winde of ambition raiſes not leſſe ſtorm, then ill-taken zeal in Religion.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101836:20"/>Theſe Countries have been almoſt a whole Age the Theater of a moſt ſad, and dreadful Warre, cauſed by the two aforementioned Paſſions, which have brought them to this ſtate, wherein they are ſeen at preſent. They had every one their Prince or Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ernour apart; but by little and little, as well by Marriages, and Succeſſions, as other means, they grew to be devolved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and afterwards under that of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as we have noted already. For, during the Warres of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the ſift, and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, they were governed by the Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Siſter to the aforeſaid <hi>Charles.</hi> In fine, this good Prince having with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled example of reſolution, transferred all his States upon his ſonne <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Empyre upon his Brother <hi>Fordinand,</hi> ſo to retire himſelf into a private condition; the ſaid King <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne before his departure, gave the government of the aforeſaid Provinces in generall to his Siſter, and in particular, to ſome certain Knights of the Golden Fleece, who had faithfully ſerved both his Father and himſelf in the Warres againſt <hi>France.</hi> Now the Order given to pluck up the tender plants of new opinions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was by ſuch as hunted after a Change in State, interpreted for the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> and the retardment of the forraine Militia for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereof. The introduction of new Biſhops made a double operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by giving an Alarme as well to the Clergy, as to them who had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the profeſſion of a Religion, which excluded both Old and New. The Governeſſe (notwithſtanding the coldneſſe of ſome prime Miniſters) ſtopped the diſeaſe with agreeable nutriment, and a ſleight bleeding; and ſo rendered a ſuperficial kind of health to this Body, ſo much ſtuffed with ill humours. But King <hi>Philip</hi> irritated by the contemp of his authority, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, had recourſe to the arms of Juſtice; which by violent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, applies both Sword and Fire; amazes the Good, repreſſes the audacity of others; inexorably puniſhes the bad, and by demanding the tenth pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reverſed or overthrew all that, which was no more then ſhaken before.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you the ſeeds of the Evills, which gave birth to thoſe long warres, which have had divers qualifications and various ſucceſſes under many Governours; who like unskilfull Phyſitians either performed not their care, or elſe preſcribed all things contrary, becauſe the Diſeaſe was incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Some make <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Authour of all thoſe troubles; and others impute it to the cruelty of the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> But be it what it will, this People (being very intenſe upon the conſervation of their priviledges, and moſt prone to jealouſie, motion, and ſurpriſe) was more agitated by the paſſion of others, then by their own, ſo that Ambition urging them to act under the pretence of priviledges and liberty of conſcience; and rigour fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon them, to make them unſeaſonably ſtoop to the commandments of their Maſter, urged them to fly to the Sword. Inſomuch, as ſometimes, neither naked Juſtice, nor Treaties of Reconciliation, were able to ſoften their exaſperated and irritated Hearts: And ſuch of theſe Provinces as are neareſt the Sea, ſhewed then another kind of countenance both to the Church and Government; and being ſuccoured by their jealous Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, continued this warre with much advantage.</p>

And this was the ſtate of things in the Low-countries, towards the end of the Age.</p>
                  <p>Now Cardinal <hi>Albert</hi> was ſent from <hi>Spain</hi> to govern the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, who brought the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with him, and falling in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe

Wherefore, he ſent <hi>Monſieur de Roſne,</hi> to beſiege <hi>Calis,</hi> which he quickly took, together with the Town of <hi>Ardre,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſuccour from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland. La Fere</hi> rendred it ſelf at the end of ſeven months ſiege; and that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened afterwards of moſt importance for the good of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> was the Reconciliation of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and the reſt of the League with King <hi>Henry.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Albert</hi> reſolved to make the united Provinces alſo feel the ſtroake of his Arms: And ſo he preſented himſelf before <hi>Oſtend</hi> (an Apple not yet ripe) and afterwards before <hi>Hulet,</hi> which after many Aſſaults, he at length carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the <hi>Marſhall de Roſue</hi> had his Head taken off by a Canon Bullet, and more then three thouſand ſouldiers were alſo ſlaine. The year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had his revenge near <hi>Turnhawt,</hi> where he cut off the Troops of the Count <hi>de Varax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the month of <hi>March</hi> of the ſame year, <hi>Hernantello</hi> Governour of <hi>Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> like a Fox ſurpriſed <hi>Amiens</hi> by a ſtratagem, to the great aſtoniſhment of all <hi>France,</hi> and the King retook it like a Lion, after ſix moneths ſiege. He paſſed thither with ſtrong forces, and thought to have given a juſt retaliation to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by ſurpriſing <hi>Arras;</hi> but he was repulſed by the young Count of <hi>Buquoy,</hi> who after wards rendred great and remarkable ſervices to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as we ſhall ſhortly ſhew.</p>
                  <p>During the time of theſe changes, the Pope forbore not to repreſent to the King the misfortunes and miſchiefes which this long Warre brought upon Chriſtendome; and beſeeched him to hearken to a good and firm Peace with the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> eſpecially, being invited thereto by the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his own kingdome, and the fear of a new Revolt, more dangerous then the former. There was none but the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated</hi> States who endeavoured by advantageous offers to divert him, and keep him on horſe-back: Though yet he diſſembled their reproaches, and anſwered, that the Queen was a gainer by this warre; but for his part, that his people was exhauſted, and that he received many and great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who promiſed by this Peace, to render all they had gotten in <hi>France:</hi> That he was obliged as a good King, and a good Father, to ſolace and refreſh his poor ſubjects. So that all their offers, and many more,<note place="margin">the Peace of <hi>Vervin.</hi> 2598.</note> were not able to hinder this holy work, which was concluded and eſtabliſhed at <hi>Vervin</hi> in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> 1598.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo for his part was urged to make Peace, as ſeeing himſelf crazed with age, and having a young Prince, and a Princeſſe (his children) to marry, and Fortune very often againſt him: Beſides three ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies upon his back; as <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Confederated Provinces,</hi> which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him with the utter loſſe of the <hi>Low-countries;</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which either deſtroyed or ſpoyled his Fleets upon the <hi>Ocean,</hi> endangered thereof the <hi>Indies,</hi> and put him to great charges to ſecure it; and laſtly, their taking of <hi>Cales,</hi> the prime key of the kingdom, and other Places.</p>
                  <p>Now by vertue of this Peace, the places were reſtored: But the pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which each of theſe Kings hath to ſome certain Demaynes of the other, were not taken away: From whence ſprang the ſeed of new Warres, which were one day to ſmoother the promiſes of arming no more, even though there ſhould be occaſion for it. The Peace was received by the poor people with ſuch ſhowes of joy, and teares of tenderneſſe, as cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended

                  <p>The States in the mean while, let not theſe occaſions ſlip, by the great diſtance of the Cardinals forces. For Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> marched into the Field, took <hi>Bergh, Grol, Oldenſeel, Lingen,</hi> and ſome other places; which progreſs purchaſed him the reputation of a very great Captain, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the profeſſion of the Militia, as well as any man of his time.</p>
                  <p>After the publication of the Peace, <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond by his <hi>Letters Patents</hi> dated at <hi>Madrid</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1598. conferred all the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Duchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> upon the <hi>Infanta Iſabell</hi> his Daughter; to which the Prince her Brother conſented, and confirmed it both by oath and writing; upon condition, that if the ſaid Princeſſe came to die without children, the ſaid Provinces ſhould return to the Dominion of <hi>Spain;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other Clauſes, too long to recite.</p>
                  <p>Now, foraſmuch as the actions of great perſons are examined, and either approved or diſapproved, according to every ones paſſion; this which I here note, was not forgotten by the contrary party. <hi>All things are profitable; yea, Lyes themſelves (provided they laſt four and twenty hours) are of utility and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi>

O brave proceeding! O true forms of Juſtice! The Count asks the reaſon of this novelty, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they diſowned their obedience to the Emperour, the Empyre, and himſelf? They anſwered, that they had taken arms for Religion, and their own defence, againſt many falfe accuſations: That they made no difficulty to acknowledge the Emperour and him as their Lords, and whatever elſe ſhould be reaſonable. In theſe Conteſts they ruſh upon his Houſe, making themſelves Maſters thereof by force, and diſpatch their Embaſſadours to the <hi>Haghe,</hi> as the Count alſo did his; he to complain of the inſolency of his ſubjects, and they to juſtify their actions. The effect of theſe Embaſies was, that they put themſelves under the protection of the States,<note place="margin">A Garriſon of the States in the Town.</note> and took a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of a thouſand men into the Town, to the diſadvantage of the ſaid <hi>Count;</hi> who at laſt was fain to ſuffer his Houſe to be ſhut up, and ſome other extremities, which have much weakned and skattered his authority-The Towneſmen embraced the Reformed Religion, yea, and they threw the Bowle yet farther: For, by a more ancient priviledge they had a grant of a Religion, conform with that of <hi>Ausbourgh.</hi> See <hi>Emmanuel de Merten.</hi>

                  <p>But this agreement being made in haſt, could not laſt long, and ſo there happened ſome diſturbance; which is an ordinary thing, when any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gets too much intereſt.

For the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Prieſts was great; the deſire of their poſſeſſions greater; and the curioſity to check a Religion full of ceremonies, which few could ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend, greateſt of all. It was repreſented to the People both here and elſewhere, that the doctrine was falſified, and in no wiſe congruous with that of the four Primitive ages: that Lay men were forbidden to read the holy Scriptures, that ſo they might remaine in darkneſſe, and not ſee the light of evangelicall truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>IT was expedient for me to make mention in this Treatiſe of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which exiſted in the precedent Age, and of the Changes they cauſed; the fatal effects whereof are reſented even in this of ours. We have alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereto the ambition of many, who endeavoured to throw all things topſy-turvy, thereby to aſcend to the greatnes which they propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and which it was moſt facil to acquire by theſe Religions Pretexts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O God! How are the hearts of poor mortals overwhelmed in darkneſs, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of Religion? And how many are there in the world, who whileſt they are plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting miſchief, hide themſelves under the maske of devotion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Religion indeed was, wont to reign in the ſoules of many, as Miſtreſſe of the State, and was a juſt cauſe of taking arms; but at preſent, ſhe is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſervant thereof. True it is, that ſome years ſince, ſhe hath done wonders both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> But the concluſion hath manifeſted, that this pretext hath ſerved for the moſt part,<note place="margin">Religion ſerves for a pretext.</note> but for intereſt of State, and to cover the martial humour of Princes; who incited by the inſatiable hunger of honour, for the ingrandiſement of their power, have very craftily made uſe of the cloak of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is that, which cauſes jeaulouſie, diſtruſt, averſion, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and chieſly amongſt the people,<note place="margin">Cauſes hatred, and divides humours.</note> who cannot penetrate into the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Potentates. This I ſay it is, which cauſes violent ſuſpicions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides humours in the ſame nation, in the ſame Parentage; yea, and in the very ſelf-ſame Family too. For if it have had force enough to arm particular perſons a gainſt their own Parents, no marvail if it make all that, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon humane ſtrength and ſcience, contribute to the ſuppreſſion of any Party, of a different opinion; and if Princes have occaſion to make uſe of it, to cover their irregular appetites. But this hatred, which proceeds from the diverſity of opinions, is repugnant to the word of God, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to pray for our Brethren, and not to perſecute and vex them. We muſt let the tares grow till the time of Harveſt, for fear of plucking up the good corn with them. Now let us briefly turn back, to ſeek out the motives, which ſeem to have cauſed theſe diverſities, which have proved ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable and pernicious to chriſtian charity; as fore-runners to the wrath of God, and moſt undoubted marks of the latter day.</p>

The difference (unworthy of ſuch a diviſion) was, and even yet is, about ambition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, contrary to the advertiſements of our common Maſter; and becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> maintained that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds but only from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>The ſaid Town was ever very carefully conſerved and kept, as well by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as by the confederated States; ſo to draw great contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from it. It was before the troubles, but a very ſmall paltry place, a Retreat for Fiſhers; but very well known ſince by the moſt famous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable ſiege that ever was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſiege of <hi>Oſtend</hi> begun thes. of <hi>July</hi> 1601.</note> It was inveſted, as much as poſſibly it could be, in the year 1601 upon the 5. of <hi>July;</hi> and firſt revictualled afterwards by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight, called <hi>Veer,</hi> and above three thouſand freſh ſouldiers of his country, ſent by the Queen. In the month of <hi>September, Admiral de Varniont,</hi> came with a hundred and ſeventy Sayl of Ships, loaden with all kinds of Munition, both for wat and mouth, for the winter; ſo that all was better cheap there, then even in <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf. This made the Prince reſolve about <hi>All-hallown-tide,</hi> to go and attack <hi>Bois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-Due:</hi> And the Arch-Duke well knowing the importance of the place, ſent an Armythither, and put ſome colours into the Town. But the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101836:30"/>of the weather proved the ſtrongeſt enemy, and forced him to pack up his Baggage, and march another way.</p>
                  <p>In the monoth of <hi>September</hi> aforeſaid, the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> was delivered of a Daughter, and the Queen of <hi>France</hi> of a<note n="*" place="margin">The title of the eldeſt ſon of the <hi>Crown.</hi>

                  <p>Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> finding his enterpriſe upon <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> croſſed, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued their ſiege, raiſed more ſouldiers the year following, and towards the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> with a terrible train, he marched down into Brabant. The Arch-Duke, informed of his great preparation, enabled by ſome money from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the reaſons for the continuation of the ſiege, in which the Honour of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was engaged, and all difficulties well ballanced by that moſt cautelous and adviſed nation, reſolved for his part, to make a great defence. <hi>It is in trouble, that vertue ſhines with moſt luſter.</hi> He ſent the <hi>Admirall</hi> into <hi>Brabant</hi> to ſtop the progreſſe of the Princes, who having ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Regiments with him, intrenched himſelf near <hi>Tirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> a Town grown famous ſince by her deplorable misfortune, and buried in her own aſhes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> not being able to draw the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (who were yet mindful of their loſſe received before <hi>Newport</hi>) to a generall deciſion, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their courſe, and incamped themſelves before <hi>Grave;</hi> which Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fortified, was two moneths after ſurrendred upon conditions:<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Arch-Duke haſtens thither; and the <hi>Admiral</hi> drawes his ſtake out of play, and retires himſelf into <hi>Spain,</hi> But <hi>Albert</hi> inſtead of water, caſt oyle into the ſire; and, contrary to the advice of the States under his obedience, proſcribes them, and declares them Rebels, Traitors, attainted,<note place="margin">Mecauban.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of High Treaſon in a ſuperlative degree, &amp;c. <hi>But it is in vain to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry without ſtrength; and the weak Lawes, yeeld to the unjuſt violence of Armes.</hi> The Squadron of Mutiners remained not mute, and the interceſſion of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> proved fruitleſſe: the Arch-Duke being reſolute, and they re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelves with men and mony, by the near neighbourhood of the conſederated Provinces.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Revolts gave advantage to the States, and meanes to go in execution through all the Country of <hi>Luxembergh;</hi> and ſuch as refuſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, had the grief of ſeeing their houſe ſet on fire. This <hi>Cavelcada,</hi> or <hi>Inroade</hi> was finiſhed in leſſe then a moneth, and without any reſiſtance at all.

This Age, which was to be all Iron, fire, blood, and ſlaughter: This Age (I ſay) which was to be the totall ruine of Chriſtendome, together with that of Faith and Charity; could not begin better, then by ſuch a ſiege. This was the moſt famous Schoole of warre, that ever was before, as where all the Martial Spirits reſorted, to learn Diſcipline, and to put it in practice (as they have done ſince) in their own Countries.

Yea, even the Great <hi>Turk</hi> himſelf, raviſhed with joy by the ruine of the Chriſtians, was not a little glad, to ſee ſuch an obſtinate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>Let us here take notice of the Divine Providence, which (like another <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>) laughs at the folly of Mortalls; who like other <hi>Gyants,</hi> will needs make themſelves maſters of all, and endeavour to outbrave the very Elements themſelves. The fierceſt enemies to mankind are <hi>War, Plague,</hi> and other <hi>Infirmities:</hi> The Reward of victory a morſell of earth, and houſes buried under their own foundations.

                  </argument>
                  <p>VVHiles the war was thus hot in the Low-Countries, there happened a ſpark of diviſion in Italy, between the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which if neglected, might have cauſed an emboraſment no leſſe perilous then that; the one, (namely the Romane Catholicks) miniſtring all kindes of means, and reaſons to quench it; and the <hi>Reformates,</hi> all ſorts of invention, to kindle it. The knot of the controverſie was, that the ſaid Republick had made a Law, prohibiting all the Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to buy, or receive by Will, or Teſtament, any immovable goods, or other inheritances. This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being ill taken at <hi>Rome,</hi> cauſed a <hi>Bull,</hi> which was publiſhed againſt the ſaid Republick, with the thunderbolt of excommunication, in caſe it were not revoked within the tearm of four and twenty dayes; interdicting the Prieſts to ſay Maſſe,<note place="margin">The difference between the Pope and the <hi>Venetians.</hi>

This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the information which he had, that the King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (enemies to the holy See) had preſented all kind of help to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and being alſo moved by his own prudent goodneſſe, and the evident danger, to which the Catholick States would be expoſed) cauſed him to hearken to the perſwations of the two Kings, and take off the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, whereby the buſineſſe was appeaſed,<note place="margin">Taken away by the interceſſion of the two Kings.</note> and all the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, who were gone out of the City during this fogg, had leave to return, except onely the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who carried the whole burthen, and were banith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>The Proteſtants (their capitall enemies) have not failed to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this occaſion, as alſo of many other, to cry them down every where by accuſing them of ſome conſpiracies againſt the ſaid Common-wealth, whereof yet there is no clear mention made at all.

                     </note> was at laſt, forced to render; and ſo the Garriſon, to the number of three thouſand diſlodged, the ſecond of <hi>October.</hi> Now the taking of ſo important a place, juſt at the noſe of ſo ſtrong an Army, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch diſcourſes, as blinde paſſion dictated, to men of blinde judgement; and the Marquis, as victorious as he was, was not yet able to divert ſome mutinies in his Army for want of pay: and therefore, conſidering the huge inconveniencies they ſuffered, by ſo many marches, ſieges, enterprizes, and the harſhueſſe of the ſeaſon, he thought fit to refreſh them, in the County of <hi>Gulick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the Prince, who deſired to put nothing to hazard, but be ever pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon occaſions, met at length with this. He cauſed <hi>Lochom</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, which quickly ſubmitted,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Never was there ſo much trouble to decide a buſineſſe of importance, as there was to bring the confederated States, to hear of any overanes of Peaces,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101836:33"/>or Truce. It ſeemed more eaſie, to make an agreement betwixt fire and water, and all the mettals together, then to reconcile theſe two parties. But indeed, the diſtruſt was too great, the hatred too much rooted, and fortune too favourable. And whereas other Countries, grow poor by war; this, moſt rich, moſt potent, and moſt flouriſhing. For on the one ſide, the enemies army could not enter, in regard of the frequencie of great rivers, and on the other, they are guarded by the ſea, in ſuch ſort, as that by trafique, they are riſen to ſuch a height, that every body courts their friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Many aſſemblies, and mediations for Peace, and accommodation were made, but all vaniſhed into ſmoak, and ſerved rather for a ſpur to war, then a balſom, to mollifie the ulcerated wounds, of ſuch as make their profit by <hi>Alarms.</hi> For this was the common talk; <hi>There is no truſt to be given to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>or the Papiſts; for they teach, that they are not to keep their faith with Hereticks: The fowler ſings ſweetly to draw the birds into his Nets:</hi> and many other ſuch reaſons, which ſerved onely to deſtroy all propoſitions of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Nay, even the Embaſſies of the Emperours, ſo often reiterated, were able to reap nothing but ceremonies, and thoſe of other Princes, yet leſſe. The complaints of the neighbours endammadged and oppreſſed by the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were not heard, or at leaſt requited, with excuſing the neceſſity of times, and affaires. For the ſea was too much agitated by the windes, and hatred of them, who would have this potent houſe, in obedience to the feeble commands of this<note n="*" place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the windes and waters.</note> 
                     <hi>Aeolus.</hi> In brief, they who ſpake to the States of peace, were as welcome at the <hi>Haghe,</hi> as they were at <hi>Venice,</hi> who ſpake for the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> notwithſtanding their propoſitions were juſt, and equitable, and could not be rejected, but upon meer diſtruſt. <hi>But what is impoſſible to man, is facil to God; and all fruit growes ripe in time.</hi> Let us now ſee the reaſons of this reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The States could not imagine, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> would ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Soverainty, of ſo many, and ſo illuſtrious Provinces; and again, they who were become Maſters, had loſt the will of returning to obedience. They were grown powerfull, by the allyances of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> by the trafique of the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the picoryes, or ſpoiles which they had made upon <hi>Spain,</hi> and the obedient Provinces, with which they offered to make an agreement, and allyance, by excluding the King, and his heirs, but by no means, with his Majeſty; whereto the other could not liſten, as to a thing impoſſible and ſhamefull, and which checked the oath of fidelity, which they had taken. The ſummons, which the <hi>Infanta</hi> gave them of her arrivall at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> moved them not at all, either to acknowledge her for Lady, or induce them to peace, or truce. In fine, in the yeer 1607.<note place="margin">Great ſtorms at Eſter. <hi>1607.</hi>
                     </note> (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable for the great ſtorms, which happened throughout all the Low-Countries towards <hi>Eaſter</hi>) this reſiſtance began by little and little, to grow warm, and this ice to thaw.

                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being advertiſed by two ſouldiers of the State of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, of the Gates, and of the Wall of the aforeſaid Town, ſent three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred men, with that renowned <hi>French</hi> Gentleman <hi>Du Terrail,</hi> who was ſince beheaded at <hi>Geneva,</hi> for having but ſo much as thought of an Enterpriſe upon the City. Now this valiant Cavallier had promiſed the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> either to deliver him the place, or die in the Attempt. And ſo he marched with his Troops through the <hi>Drowned Lands,</hi> without being diſcovered; approached the Town, ſet three<note n="*" place="margin">An Engine to force Gares.</note> Petards on work about the Gate, the laſt whereof got it open; but the hearts of the ſouldiers grew ſo cold, that they durſt not venter in. Never was there an Enterpriſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance more eaſie to be effected, without either danger or reſiſtance; and never was there any which more looſely fayled for want of courage, and good command: ſo that it proves moſt true, that <hi>a Coward can never do a good action.

                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> having crowned himſelf, and renewed the War in <hi>Livonie,</hi> made uſe of this inteſtine ſedition: <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> made a brisk oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as well to him, as to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> alſo, whoſe Empire was then full of factions.<note place="margin">The ſiege of <hi>Smolensko.</hi>

But this Warr, which we are now going to deſcribe, involved all <hi>Europ;</hi> and there is not ſo much as one Province, which doth not reſent it; yea, that which is more deploreable, is, that we ſee not the end of it yet; for, for my part, I am of opinion, in this wicked age, Men will ſooner be wanting, then Will, to ſuch as are ambitious, to continue this bloody exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>The Prodigies, which both went before it, and happened during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, like waves of the ſea, have two much informed us, that it would ingulf all the Provinces of Chriſtendome, one after another, and ſuch as thought to be exempted from it, as well for the advantages they had upon their enemies, as for the impoſſibility of introducing the Babes of <hi>Mars</hi> amongſt them, by reaſon of their ſituation; feel, at preſent, the ſcourge, with as much ſharpneſſe, as the former.</p>
                  <p>That facall Torch, which appeared towards the end of the year 1618, with a long, and formidable tayle, ſeemed to announce to us the wrath of

The Emperour <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was Crowned in the year, 1612, made not his Authority in the Empire, ſhine a whit brighter then his Predeceſſours had done; in ſuch ſort, as that the State wasfallen (as it were) into a Palſie, and languiſhment.</p>
                  <p>Not withſtanding all theſe voluptuouſneſſes, and debauches, diſtruſts were grown ſo high, that it was impoſſible, for the Banks or Damns, to ſtop theſe Torrents, without letting ſome part of them looſe.

                     <hi>Bohemia,</hi> is a little Kingdom, but very fertill, in Corn, Wine, Mines of Gold, Silver, Tinne, and all which is neceſſary for the life of man. The King is ranged in the number of the Electours; and his Vote, or ſuffrage, is ſo neceſſary, that when the Parties are equall, he who receives it, is elevated to the Imperiall Throne. This ſaid Kingdome, is almoſt quite invironed by <hi>Germany;</hi> and it ſtretches, on the one ſide, to <hi>Moravia.</hi> The Inhabitants ſpeak the language of <hi>Slavonia,</hi> though yet the <hi>High-Dutch</hi> be as common there, as the <hi>French</hi> is, in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The Metropolitan City is <hi>Prague,</hi> which is watered by the ſtream of <hi>Moldaw.</hi> The Country is very great, moſt populous, and adorned with a moſt famous, and moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Univerſity, wherein, for a time, were numbered above thirty thouſand Scholars. Now, becauſe the firſt controverſies about Religion, which cauſed the ſeparations, and hatreds amongſt Chriſtians, proceeded from thence; it will not be out of our way, and much for the contentment of the Reader, to take notice of the ſource, and Origin thereof.

And from thence came the Axiome, ſo often and ſo juſtly chanted, and iterated, by the Proteſtants, and whereof they ſerve themſelves to quicken their diſtruſts. <hi>Faith muſt not be kept with Hereticks.</hi>

And this was the firſt motive of this war; and this the leaven, which hidden, for two years together, under the Paſt of ambition, of the chief of that Kingdom, made it riſe, and ſharpen ſo much, as that there was nothing expected, but onely the hour to put it in the oven.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Hugenots,</hi> not being able to digeſt the reduction of <hi>Bearne,</hi> which was performed more by the venerable luſter of the Kings Majeſty, then by that of the ſword, which remained unſheathed; and fearing to be one day overwhelmed, by his good ſucceſſes, through the inſtigation of their good friends the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> diſcovered their diſtruſt,<note place="margin">A ſecond warre againſt the <hi>Hugenots.</hi>
                     </note> by Aſſemblies in divers parts of the kingdom; and laſt of all at <hi>Rochell,</hi> where all the Churches met, to conſult, and provide for their Buſineſſe. The King being informed, that this Generall Convocation of theirs without his knowledge, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, too viſibly checked his Authority; that that which he had granted them at <hi>Londun,</hi> proved prejudicial to him, and that it was to his Grace, and not to Arms, that they were to have recourſe; gave them to underſtand his Royall Will; which was, that they ſhould ſeparate themſelves within a few dayes, under pain of the crime of High Treaſon: But in vain; <hi>They whoſe courages are ſo inflamed, by the clattering of Arms, as to hold it for pleaſant muſick, are not to be terrified by threats.</hi> They ſend their Deputies to <hi>Paris,</hi> to make proteſtation of their fidelity, and excuſe the neceſſity of their affaires. But, the King required nothing but obedience, and ſo he advanced his Troops towards <hi>Saumur,</hi> which was delivered him up by <hi>Monſieur de Pleſſis. Saint Iohn d' Angeli,</hi> after having ſuffered ſome Attacks, implores the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>Benjamin Duke of Soubiſe</hi> comes, and caſts himſelf at his Royall feet, and promiſes him, to wear his ſword no more, againſt his ſervice, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he quickly forget that promiſe. The Walls were demoliſhed, upon which the choler of <hi>Lewis</hi> the juſt was ſtopped; and his elemencie extended, upon the Inhabitants. This good ſucceſſe made him reſolve, to march into <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> nor did a whit diſanimate the <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> who had determined on the other ſide, to ſell their liberty at as dear a rate as they could. Many Townes were conſtrained, to humble themſelves, to the victorious Arms of their Prince. The women were often ſeen, moſt deſperately fighting upon the Breach of the Walls; and really, if the chief of the Party had ſhewed as much ſtability, as the Common people did zeal; the prize had not been got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo good cheap, nor their Republick (the foundations whereof they were ſuſpected to have already laid) ſo eaſily deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>The proſperity of this vertuous Prince, together with the promptitude he uſed to ſurpriſe the <hi>Hugenots,</hi> before they could have meanes to put any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable forces into the Field, facilitated to him, that which could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to his juſtice; and ſince hath declared that his will was, to command his Townes, and not the conſciences of his People; for the <hi>Hugenots</hi> who put all their confidence, and ſecurity, in the fortifications of theirs, were at length conſtrained, to rely only upon his Royall Word.</p>
                  <p>His exploits, againſt his Subjects of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, are amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by many Authours, and therefore it ſuffices me, to take notice only, of the courſe, or Current of them, inſert the misfortunes; briefly follow my way, and return with him to <hi>Paris;</hi> there to hear his victories ſung by the one, and ſee the diſpleaſure done, to the other.</p>

For it was a ſtrange thing, to ſet a Lady, upon a baſe and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousſcaffold, who had been but a little before, with ſo much power and greatneſſe, at the Court. Ah falſe, and treacherous Fortune! How much gall doſt thou hide, under thy honey? and how many treacheries, under thy favours? No marvel, if thou deſtroy, what thou haſt made, ſince thou overturneſt even Kings, and Kingdomes themſelves, which had taken their foundations, from the hands of the Almighty himſelf. This tragical Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being brought to his deſired iſſue, <hi>Luynes</hi> counſelled the King, to baniſh his Mother from the Court, whom he knew to be in implacable indignation againſt him.

From the quality of an ordinary Gentleman, he rid Poſt (as it were) to honours, and was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Earl, and <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Picardy, Duke, and Peer of France;</hi> and within a very ſhort time after, <hi>Conſtable.</hi> In fine, all ſmiled upon him; every one adored this Golden Calfe; yea, even they, who if they could have gotten him in their power, would have cruſhed, and ſhivered him to pieces. To ſecure himſelf from the Queen-Mother, he procured the deliverance of the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> but common neceſſity, obſtructed the courſe of his greatneſs, though it hardly extinguiſhed the hatred, which all the <hi>French</hi> bore him, and left him but two friends, who cauſed his miſerable Body to be ſecretly interred, for fear, leſt be ſhould receive the ſame treatment of him, whoſe place he had taken.

                  <p>Whileſt the Emperour was detained by the reception of theſe honours, they of his Party were in daily action with their enemies, and that often with advantage; But this war was terminated the year following, 1620, by the Battel of <hi>Pragne.

                     <hi>Auſtria</hi> was alſo exerciſed, by a revolt no leſſe dangerous, then that of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> chiefly, becauſe it chanced at the ſame time, and for that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of all ſafe retreat.</p>
                  <p>The leagued Mutincers took arms upon this captious pretext; That the <hi>Archduke Albert</hi> was their Lord, and not the ſaid <hi>Ferdinand. How bad ſoever the Cauſe be which the Lawyer pleades, he forbeares not yet to ſpeak alond.</hi> He on the other ſide alledged the donation made him by <hi>Albert,</hi> inviting them to renounce the League, and pay him the Oath of fidelity; which they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he proclaimed them out-laws, and gave the execution of the Proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who reduced them to reaſon, time enough to come to ſuccour the <hi>Count of Bucquoy.</hi>

This exploit made the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> very odious, to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party; but, the Emperour, for recompence of his ſervices, and to keep him faſt in his friendſhip, made him a preſent of both the <hi>Luſatia's.

                  <p>But <hi>Tilly</hi> was not long, before he found meanes to revenge himſelf of this affront. <hi>It is good to lend to ſuch, as are alwayes read to render.</hi> For, having joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Troops with <hi>Don Cordocia,</hi> and being informed, that the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> was ſeparated from <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> he followed him ſo cloſe, that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him neer <hi>Wimpfen;</hi> where, after a ſtubborn fight of ſome hours, he put the Cavalry to flight. But the Infantry, or Foot, finding themſelves aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned with a maſculine reſolution, mingled with deſpair, and deſire of an honourable death, fought very valiantly, and made <hi>Tilly</hi> know, that he ſhould not have their lives at ſo cheap a rate,<note place="margin">They have their revenge.</note> as not to wrangle ſtoutly for them; howbeit, by an unlucky chance, they were deprived of the meanes, though not of the will,<note place="margin">Victory of the Imperialiſts near Wimpſon.</note> to continue it. For, by the perpetual playing of the Ordnance, the fire got into the powder, which ſprung the Waggons with ſo unfortunate hurt, that all the Foot fell into diſorder, and was cut in pieces:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101836:53"/>And eight and thirty Pieces of Canon; a great deal of Baggage, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with ſix ſcore Coulors falling into the hands of the Conquerours, made the Conquered confeſſe, that they received a huge, and moſt ſenſible loſſe. The Field was ſtrewed with dead Bodies, and the periſhing of ſix thouſand men upon the place, gave cauſe to count this, for one of the greateſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails of this Age.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Halberſtadt</hi> in the interim was not aſleep; but having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted great forces,<note place="margin">The cruelties of the Biſhop of <hi>Halberſtadt</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi>

Indeed, the ſcandall he gave, was too great; for his proceedings were blamed, even by them of his own Party: and he purchaſed the name of the <hi>Mad Biſhop.</hi> But the Catholicks were too much tyed to the Emperours ſervice, and therefore he thought fit to chaſtiſe them, ſince there was no other means, to hurt their Victorious head; and beſides, the diſguſt of their ſo often ſinging <hi>Te Deum,</hi> was too ſharp and hot to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.

But this joy was quickly turned into mourning, by the arrivall of the newes of the unhappy ſucceſſe of King <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericks</hi> Arms; and the loſſe of his Kingdom, which he had already had, ſome moneths in his poſſeſſion. Though yet the <hi>Gazets</hi> ſung alwayes of his victories, and of the decline of the Emperours Affayres: yea, and the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters repreſented him already, ſitting in the <hi>Imperial Throne; Ferdinand,</hi> on his knees before him; and the Eagle all peeled, and debilitated.<note place="margin">The Eagle peeled.</note> It was alſo publiſhed, that the <hi>Battail</hi> before <hi>Prague,</hi> was wonne by him and the contrary tidings contemned, as ſuſpects, and given out by the Papiſts; till himſelf ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and brought the naked Truth with him, and ſhewed in fine, that all was loſt. <hi>There are many perſons ſo paſſionate, that they cannot endure to hear truth ſpoken, if it be contrary to their expectation; and others preferre, before the infamy of lying, the unſteady profit which comes from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had often enough bid the Generalls of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> have a

                  <p>Now, the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrancers,</hi> as well by means of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> as by the company of the Prince (who declared himſelfe of their party) having wonne the Day,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Theſe changes begat many Libells, and gave ground to the Politicks, to make ſine obſervations, upon thoſe proceedings, which remained ſecret <hi>No definitive ſentence can be pronounced, upon what may be done, but upon what is done.</hi>
                  </p>

And it muſt be noted, that theſe people, how much ſoever divided in faction, return forthwith to a coherence, when they apprehend any forraine Enemy: For really, common danger hath ſo great a power upon their minds, that it makes them ſpeedily reunite, to reſiſt the attempts of ſtrangers: and if that come once to faile, farewell Liberty; for they will never, want private enemies; and their pride is growne too high, not to be envied by many. <hi>Their vertue is accompanied by envy, but their Power is too conſiderable, to be eaſily, and openly attacked.</hi> One of the greateſt wits of our times, adviſed the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to make a Truce with them if he had mind to tame them.<note place="margin">The nature of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>

                  <p>In fine, they being a people of a ſtrong nature, and lovers of Liberty (as all ſuch as dwell within the mountains are) found themſelves contemned by the Nobility (which, through delights, produced by great riches, was grown inſolent) and from contempt, drawn into ſervitude; and therefore, laying hold of the opportunity, of the confuſions of the Empire, they aſſaulted the ſaid Nobility, and expelled it by force of Arms, and ſo redeemed themſelves from the Yoke.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour <hi>Albert,</hi> having a great charge of Children, endeavoured
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101836:57"/>to joyn alſo that, which immediately depended upon the Empyre, to what he held there already, as well by inheritance, as by donation, and purchaſe; but in vain: wherereupon he turned his deſires into threats; but ſtill in vain: For his Governours had uſed tyranny,<note place="margin">The Governours Tyrants.</note> and brought this people to ſeek entyre Liberty, by way of revenge, of ſome crimes committed, and ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts done to ſome particular perſons; the firſt whereof was to him, who had alwayes diſſwaded them, from putting themſelves under the yoke, of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> The ſecond and principal, was for having attempted the chaſtity of a woman, a vice, which cauſed the Kings to be expelled from <hi>Rome;</hi> the Infidels, to enter into <hi>Spain,</hi> and whole nations, to go out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Countries: The third was a moſt abſurd, and ridiculous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; namely, to do reverence to the Hat of a Governour, which was at the end of a perch, when they paſſed by it: And it happened once, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain follow being brought before the Governour, for having ſlighted this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he commanded him to ſhoot a Apple from his childes head with an arrow, which he performed, to the great amazement of all ſuch as were preſent.</p>

                  <p>Yet, this was not enough; for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though well intrenched, for they could not remain there, without continual fear: and ſo the quarrel was renewed, and Allyances made, to force them out: Upon which the <hi>Marquis de Cocurre</hi> entred with ſome Troops, and rooted them out of their Holds.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> and his Biſhop ſeemed to have taken the like Oath, againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and by conſequence, for the continuance in action againſt it, they muſt have new forces. <hi>Holland</hi> could furniſh them with matter, conveniency, money, and hatred enough; <hi>England,</hi> with deſire enough, to ſee <hi>Frederick</hi> again in the <hi>Palatmate;</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie enough, in regard of the growth of the aforeſaid Houſe.</p>
                  <p>There wanted no bellowes to kindle this fire; mens humours being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſpoſed that way, by diverſity of Religions, hatred, envy, ſelf-ends, and Maxime of State; a Cover, which is never, either too long, or too ſhort, and ſtronger then even Juſtice it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Now, King <hi>James,</hi> though by the negotiations with <hi>Spain,</hi> he had diſgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted many of the Reformed Religion, ſhewed himſelf nevertheleſſe willing to have as good intelligence with the Catholick States, as the King of <hi>France</hi> had, with the Proteſtant, and ſo he ſent Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his Sonne into <hi>Spain,</hi> to eſpouſe the <hi>Infanta Mary:</hi> but, after the loſſe of much time, he came back into <hi>England,</hi> and demanded in <hi>France</hi> (through which he had paſſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed) the Kings Siſter, who was more eaſily granted him.</p>
                  <p>Men have laboured, to penetrate into the Myſtery of this Treaty; but all, by conjecture only. The Roman Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> who began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to feel ſome warmth of the buſineſſe, were extremely afflicted, at the breach of the aforeſaid Match; and the misfortune which befell them, was a teſtimony of the perpetuall Croſſe, which was ordained for them, in the Britannick Iſlands:<note place="margin">A misfortune at <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Cavalry, conſiſting of three thouſand, did likewiſe, no very long ſervice: for, the Generalls marching towards the <hi>Rhein,</hi> and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> after their old faſhion, their Army diminiſhed much, by disbandings; and themſelves fell into a quarrel, which had almoſt brought them to a Duell: though at laſt, they returned into <hi>Holland,</hi> and went from thence to the North, to warm thoſe people againſt the Emperour.</p>

Himſelf followed with the Foot: and in his Councell of War, there was found no more then one Colonell, who thought fit to begin the ſiege;<note place="margin">The ſiege of <hi>Breda.</hi>
                     </note> and that upon the ſame reaſons, whereby <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelf was moved to it.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> glad to ſee his Rivall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, before a place ſo well provided of all neceſſaries, as alſo of a ſtrong Garriſon, did not ſo ſoon diſpoſe himſelf to ſuccour it, but gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> leiſure to entrench themſelves, and they him to repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it.</p>
                  <p>But he hoped, by the ſucceſſe of his deſigne upon <hi>Antwerp,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore premeditated in his thoughts, and held by him infallible;<note place="margin">The enterprize upon the Caſtle or Cittadell of <hi>Antwerp.</hi>

                  <p>He was well informed, that there were but very few Souldiers in the Cittadell, and they, for the moſt part, diſmembred, and cripled. Wherefore, he ſent ſome Troops, which made a ſhew of coming from the Camp before <hi>Breda,</hi> as carrying the ſame Motto's and Colours, which <hi>Spinola</hi> carried; they arrived undiſcovered, to the very Mote, applyed their Ladders; and ſet all their rare Engynes on work, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves Maſters of the Place; whereof they could not have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not their own hearts failed them firſt. For one <hi>Who goes there</hi> of the Sentinell, followed by the diſcharge of a Musket, made theirs fall our of their hands, and left them no more courage then onely to fly.</p>
                  <p>It was thought, that he had a mind to beſtow the honour of this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom he onely employed in it; and that if he had mingled any of the other nations with them, the buſineſſe would have iſſued to his contentment.</p>
                  <p>This newes ſtruck the Marquis almoſt into a feaver; and ſent the Prince loaden with Melancholy, to the <hi>Hage,</hi> where towards the end of the winter, he died, leaving his Army to his brother <hi>Henry Frederick,</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> before <hi>Breda;</hi> who, ſeeing no meanes to take it by force, reſolved to famiſh it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Eneral <hi>Mansfeldts</hi> arguments, had as much ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in the North, as they had towards the South; becauſe the dangers, which ſeemed to threaten that Country, were grown greater, and beſides, a Prince which becomes potent, makes himſelf both feared, and hated. <hi>Tilly</hi> wintered in <hi>Haſsia,</hi> in deſpight of the Landgrave <hi>Maurice,</hi> nor were the States of <hi>Low-Saxony</hi> a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to ſee the Imperiall Eagles fluttering up and down upon their fronteers; and that not without giving them great incovenience; beſides, that they feared, leſt they ſhould peradventure come to replant their old authority there.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> together with many other Princes, and States thereabouts, were moved to much impatience, by the ruine of <hi>Frederick;</hi> as apprehending, leſt theſe Gueſts ſhould come, and take up their lodging amongſt them. Wherefore being advertiſed by common danger, and by that, which themſelves, perhaps, would have done, if they had had the ſame power, and right which the Emperour had, they made a League for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Circle</hi> of the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> into which entred the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France,</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi> together with the <hi>States Generall,</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> himſelf was the Head,<note place="margin">A League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Em perour.</note> as being General of the ſaid <hi>Circle.</hi> The Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick, Mekelenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Holſtein;</hi> the Adminiſtratour of <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Bremen,</hi> ſubſcribed alſo to it.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours forces, in the mean while, grew ſtrong, and <hi>Tilly</hi> began to ſmell, that under the mask of amity, there were ſome new deſignes a brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; however they proteſted, that they were doing nothing againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101836:61"/>an Army, to come and ſuccour him. <hi>Cauſes lye hidden, under pretexts drawn from neceſſity, and juſtice, but they are eaſily diſcovered, by people of the ſame profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many Prodigies preceded the fatall warres; as Armies fighting in the Ayre, raining of Blood, great Tempeſts; bearing down Trees, Houſes, and Dammes.</p>
                  <p>But that, which was by all interpreted for an ill Augure, or Token, was, that the King going one evening to walk upon the Rampars,<note place="margin">The Prodigies.</note> or Walls of the Town of <hi>Hamelen,</hi> to viſit the Sentinels, his horſe ſtumbled at a plank, and threw him into the Mote or Ditch, out of which he was drawne two houres after, and conceived to be dead, for more then three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, they who laid moſt to heart, the love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Reſt, employed all diligence, to find a means to reconcile this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, thereby to divert the misfortune, wherein all Lower <hi>Saxony</hi> was likely to be involved. To which effect, a Treaty of Peace was held at <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and it was already agreed, that the Armies ſhould be licenſiated,<note place="margin">They treat of peace in vain.</note> by Regiments; to wit, that the King ſhould caſheer the firſt, <hi>Tilly</hi> the next, and ſo conſecutively by turnes, to the end. But this Treaty was broken off by ambition, and ſo, ſuch advantages as could not be reaped thereby, were ſought by way of Arms. <hi>The Gameſter is more willing to hazard another mans money, then his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will note only the principal actions of the warre, and content my ſelfe with ſaying, that it is very probable, that the Emperour had a deſign, to make his Authority, and Religion flouriſh afreſh, in thoſe Countries, where there was no more left, then a faint, and languiſhing knowledge thereof; and,<note place="margin">The ayne of the League.</note> that mingled with coldneſs, contempt, and hatred. But as for the contrary Party, they endeavoured, not onely to repell the aforeſaid Gueſt, but alſo by vertue of the Allyance, to reſtore the Prince to his States, by force of Arms, ſince it could not be done by interceſſions; and ſo, in fine, deliver all the Princes, from the jealouſie which was given them by this Houſe, puffed up with ſo many victories.</p>
                  <p>The King retyred with his Army, as farre as the Biſhopprick of <hi>Werden,</hi> and thereby gave the Imperialiſts opportunity to ſeaze upon many places: But Fortune varied at <hi>Niemburgh,</hi> from which Town, after the loſſe of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great number of their men, they were conſtrained to retreat, though yet the ſaid loſſe, were repayred ſhortly after, by the taking of <hi>Calembergh,</hi> and the defeating of ſome companies of <hi>Dragoons.</hi>

                     </note> In this memorable Battell at the Bridge of <hi>Daſſaw,</hi> all <hi>Mansfeldts</hi> glory was buried; howſoever he loſt not his courage by ſo furious an overthrow, but having gotten on foot, a freſh Army of ſixteen thouſand men, (for <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Septemtrion</hi> were yet full of brave Souldiers) he drew towards <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> took in ſome places, paſſed thence into <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> where he gave up his Army to the Duke of <hi>Wimar;</hi> and accompanied by ſome of his principall Officers, put himſelf in the way towards <hi>Venice;</hi> but a <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> or Bloody Flux, or rather (according to the opinion of ſome) a <hi>Potion,</hi> ſtopped the

Thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the life, of this famous General, who had been fortunate enough in raiſing Armies, but not in fighting Battels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wallenſtine,</hi> having ſtifled the War of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> marched back into <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> diſſipated <hi>Wimars</hi> Troops, and retook the occupated places: And <hi>Baudis,</hi> and <hi>Holck,</hi> being ſent to joyne with the ſaid Duke, were cut off by <hi>Merode,</hi> and <hi>Beckman:</hi> So that <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> having put an end to all their diſorders, returned towards <hi>Brunſwick.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tilly</hi> being intent upon the occaſions of hurting his enemies, went, and unexpectedly attacked a Quarter commanded by that Valiant Souldier <hi>Obertrawt;</hi> who, together with one of the Dukes of <hi>Anholt,</hi> and ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Souldiers,<note place="margin">Obertrawt <hi>killed.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the King finding himſelf in great danger, by the loſſe of <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Halberſtadt,</hi> (who died at the ſame time, at <hi>Wolfenbottel,</hi> after he had vomited up a Worm of about four ells long) did not yet loſe his courage.<note place="margin">The death of the Biſhop of <hi>Halberſiadt.</hi>

In ſuch ſort, as that by this invaſion,<note place="margin">The peace is broken.</note> the Peace, which was made in the year 1622, before <hi>Montpellier,</hi> was broken, in that of 1625, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> his brother, recommenced the Warre in earneſt, both in <hi>High,</hi> and <hi>Low Languedock,</hi> under pretext that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace had been ill obſerved.</p>

                  <p>The King, upon the interceſſion of the States, pardoned them of <hi>Rochell,</hi> but the <hi>Zelanders</hi> did not pardon Admirall <hi>Hautain,</hi> who had for his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

                  <p>By this Peace (which a certain <hi>French</hi> Writer terms ſhameful for the Conquerours, as being with intention to diſpoſſeſs a Catholick Prince of his lawfull ſucceſſion) the King renounced the <hi>Provinces of Saxony,</hi> and ſo the amity between the two Princes was renewed.

He declared in his Letters Pattents, that Hereſie, under the pretext of Liberty of Conſcience, and Priviledges, hatched nothing in her boſome, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, Sedition, and Devices to ſhake off the yoke of Soveraigns, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magiſtrates. <hi>Princes look upon the intereſt of State, and the People, that of Religion; which once loſt, farewell all reſpect with it.</hi> The Peaſants muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſtirred up, to try if luck would turn, and whether Fortune would be alwayes fixed with a Diamant-Nayle. Complaints were rejected; Count <hi>Heberſdorf,</hi> the inexorable executor of this importunate and unſeaſonable Command, was firſt chaſed away with ſtones, and afterwards fury affoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded other weapons. For the ſaid Peaſants, to the number of ten thouſand, cut off his forces, ſeazed upon many Caſtles, and ſmall Places; and being at lenth, re-inforced by forty thouſand men, and forty Peeces of Ordnance, pillaged all <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſparing neither <hi>Prieſt, Monk,</hi> nor <hi>Gentleman. The Clergy hath ever ſerved as Fee, or prey to the ſeditious.</hi>

                  <p>The Emperour wrote to them; but they, endeavouring to obtain by force, what was denied to their ſupplication, diſdained to anſwer him. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, he diſpatched other Embaſſadours, to endeavour to reduce them gently, to their duty; but they retained them, and ſent ſome from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to demand free exerciſe of their Religion: diſmiſſion of the ſouldiers, and a generall pardon for what was paſt: All which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, had not their proſperity, by the defeat of ſome of the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia's</hi> Troops, made them undertake more. If any grow blind by happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is chiefly the abject ſort of the vulgar, <hi>which waxes temerarily bold, when it thinks it ſelf feared.</hi> But the Town of <hi>Lintz,</hi> which they beſieged, cowed their courage, and ſpeeded the puniſhment, which they had deſerved, by their raſh Rebellion. They aſſaulted it often, but were ſtill repulſed, with huge loſſe: ſo that <hi>Papenheim,</hi> who was appointed to chaſtiſe them, effected it not with ſo great facility, as <hi>Trucſes,</hi> and ſome other Generals had done, that of the like ſeditious Rabble, above a hundred years before. For he was fain to combat them at leaſt ſeven times, before he could vanquiſh them; ſo chearfully and ſtoutly would they rally, and defy their victorious enemies, even in the fight. The <hi>Romans</hi> found themſelves once in great trouble by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101836:66"/>the revolt of their ſlaves, and yet they more eaſily quenched that fire, though it were even within the Walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> then the Imperialiſts were able to do this, becauſe here was more combuſtible matter. But under what Heads or Leaders,<note place="margin">Their Generals, a Schollar, a Shoomaker, and a Smith.</note> did this deſperate Crew fight? A <hi>Schollar,</hi> a <hi>Shoomaker,</hi> and a <hi>Smith.</hi> With what weapons? Sticks, Stoones, Whips, Forks, and Muskets. And what more? Potion, and Enchantments. To what end? If we muſt judge Effects by their Cauſes, it was for the exerciſe of Religion, and to beat out their Soveraign Magiſtrate. Who were thoſe <hi>Aeoluſes,</hi> who letting looſe the windes, diſturbed the Calm, and raiſed their ſtorms? It is more eaſie to conjecture, and believe, then to prove.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They are at laſt defeated in many Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by <hi>Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim.</hi>
                     </note> After the laſt defeat, the moſt mutinous of them ran away; and the reſt pent up at home, like ſlocks of ſheep.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended this dangerous warre; which teaches us, how perilous a a thing it is, to endeavour to command mens conſciences. We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the word of God, and not with the ſword; or, to ſay better, we muſt pray with charity for one another, and not perſecute our ſelves with arms, unleſſe we be commanded by Politick neceſſity. The holy Scripture ſayes; <hi>Let the rares grow, fear leſt you root out the good corne. Papenheim</hi> acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no leſſe glory, nor merited leſſe to Triumph, then the two other Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. And thus was the Emperour delivered from a moſt apparent danger, by the remoteneſſe of his Armies. Let us now make a leap to the Low-Countries, and ſee what paſſed there, at the beginning of the year 1625.</p>

But in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Age, there hath been nothing found impregnable, for wickedneſſe being every where, the Sword enters every where, all gives way to Injuſtice, and Impiety. Nothing is able to reſiſt inſolence, nothing ſo ſacred, but it is prophaned, nothing ſo ſolid, but it is moved, and nothing ſo firme, but it is broken.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſeeing the Emperours forces employed in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Spaine</hi> a ground, by the taking of the <hi>Indian</hi> Silver Fleet, and carrying it to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> egged on from abroad, and inflamed alſo, with deſire of taking this place, by the very difficulties there were in it, reſolved, after having maturely picked out all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to go a Maying there, the laſt of <hi>April</hi> 1629. His Intelligences, both within, and without the Town, were not ſmall, and the obſtacles, which offered themſelves in bulke, very great. But conſidering, that the greater the difficulties be, the more luſter they give to Vertue, he ſlighted all. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune forwards the ſtout,</hi>

                     <hi>and hinders the timid.</hi> He inveſted it with an Army of thirty thouſand men, and ſpeedily finiſhed his Trenches, and Lines of Communication, whileſt they were diſputing at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Army.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bergh</hi> General of the Army.</note> Count <hi>Henry</hi> was choſen, but he marched ſo ſlowly, that he found the Prince too ſtrongly intrenched for his defence, to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly forced out.</p>
                  <p>For, he had dammed up the Rivers, and brought them round about his Fortifications, in ſuch ſort, as it was like a broad Sea. And on the other ſide, the Summer was ſo faire,<note place="margin">A dry Summer.</note> and ſo dry, that it looked, as if heaven had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into contract with the Prince, to give him the fruition of the Victory. For had it chanced to be moiſt, and rainy (as it is ordinary in that climate) their mills of ſo rare workmanſhip, would have proved uſeleſſe, and Nature would have jecred Art out of countenance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Velaw.</hi>
                     </note> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> indeavoured to ſuccour it in vaine: which made them paſſe the <hi>Rheyn,</hi> at <hi>Weſel,</hi> to joyne with the Imperialiſts; and the paſſage of the <hi>Iſell</hi> being open, and maintained with the ſword, gave them a fair prize, together with the defence of ſome Companies which followed. But, the Prince drew out part of his Army, which ſo well coaſted the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they made no remarkable progreſſe at all.</p>
                  <p>Never had they Fortune ſo favourable, and never did they looſe ſo many men, as in that field, not by the ſword, but by other inconveniencies: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had they gon forward at firſt, they had found no kinde of reſiſtance, all the Country being full of fear, and conſternation.</p>
                  <p>The Prince ſtood ſo faſt before <hi>Boiſleduc,</hi> that he could not be parſwaded by the States of <hi>Guelders, Overyſel,</hi> and <hi>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101836:68"/>were to ſave the Country; bidding them, by way of anſwer, to have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and put all in good order, &amp;c. that the enemy would give them more fear, then hurt. All which proved true: for, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken breath, and done all which was neceſſary for the defence of their Country, with ſome of the licenſiated Troops of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> put the Armies to a ſudden ſtand, without either Counſell or courage, upon the dry ſands of the <hi>Velaw.</hi> Yet howſoever,<note place="margin">Take <hi>Amerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                     </note> they were bold enough to attack <hi>Amersfort,</hi> which not being tenible, was forthwith yeelded, and ſome other ſmall paltry places near the South-Sea, were attempted, and not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in regard their deſign was diſcovered, before it was fit to be executed. Beſides, to encreaſe the misfortune of the Enemies, upon the nineteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being a very fair morning, <hi>Weſel</hi> was taken,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Henry</hi> retyred not to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> but to his Government; and could not ſo well clear himſelf, but that there remained ſome ſuſpicions greatly diſadvantageous to his reputation, in the ſoules of the more clear-ſighted men; which were verified, by the open retreat he made, grounded upon ſlight and frivolous excuſes only, concerning the Kings ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> yeelds for want of powder,</note> In fine, <hi>Boiſloduc</hi> was rendered; the Imperialiſts returned into <hi>Germany,</hi> much lighter then they came; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>Brabant,</hi> almoſt half of them waſted, by hunger, ſickneſſe, and disbanding, not without loud mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, and plainly curſing their General. <hi>Count Iohn of Naſſeaw</hi> left the paſſage of the <hi>Iſel,</hi> and the Prince went into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all, with marvellous acclamations of joy, and unparallelled applauſe.</p>
                  <p>This Place, being one of the moſt important the King had, was taken for want of powder, and a ſufficient Garriſon; and the Prince, on the other ſide, having no want of mony, commanded a Bank to be raiſed from <hi>Holland,</hi> overthwart the Fennes, or Mariſhes, which coſt the United Provinces much treaſure, and much haſtened the taking of the Town: beſides, that to ſay truth, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> were not backward to advance money, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the zeal they had, to the preſervation of the Common-wealth. Never did Fortune ſmile more upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with a more unhappy iſſue; and never frowned more upon the Confoederates, to give them a more glorious victory. The loſſe of this moſt important place, fruſtrated the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the hope of regaining <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſerved for an invincible Clauſure to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth for the future, if we look upon the outſide of it; but it is ſubject to corruption, in regard of the abundance of ill humours, wherewith it is ſtuffed within, as riſing from the fenny grounds about it, which yet eaſily are voyded by weak and ſlight phyſick, as will ſhortly appear. But let us now go ſee the concluſion of the Warre in <hi>France,</hi> againſt the <hi>Hugenots,</hi> and the ruine of that Party, which gave the King means afterwards to ſhock the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and afflict his Neighbours.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>DUring the ſiege of <hi>Rochell,</hi> that two Brothers (namely, the Dukes of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and <hi>Soublſe</hi>) did all they could to ſuccour the Center of their State; moving even Heaven and Earth, with the moſt zealous of the Party, to ſave the Place from the ſhipwrack whereof it was in danger. The one made inſurrections every where, ſaying, that if the Town were taken, all they of the Party would be maſſacred: but the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> charged him ſo often, and ſo cloſely, that he had almoſt ever the worſt.</p>
                  <p>The other encouraged the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and urged them to make haſte, before the Damme were finiſhed, about which the <hi>French</hi> wrought with great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,<note place="margin">

Two reaſons in my opinion, retarded the ſuccour ſo long: the one, that they could not imagine, that the ſaid Damme (at which they laughed) would be able to hinder their paſſage; and that being ſtronger by Sea then the <hi>French,</hi> they ſhould eaſily break all obſtacles. The other is, that they would not relieve the Town till it were in extremity; to the end that (the Towneſmen being for the moſt part ſtarved, or debilitated with hunger) they might make themſelves maſters thereof, and place a Colony of their own nation there; to be ready at all times, to incommodate <hi>France,</hi> and awaken their old pretenſions. <hi>They who ask relicfe, have one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; and he who gives it, another.</hi> Beſides, that it is alſo very credible, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> (who was not ignorant, of how great his credit would be, after the reduction of this Place, (which was judged impregnable) had corrupted the chief of the Counſell of <hi>England,</hi> with mony, that ſo the ſuccour, which was haſtened by zeal, might be delayed. Whatever it were, neither the great <hi>Arſenal,</hi> nor the ſtrength of the <hi>Baſtions,</hi> nor the Purſe at <hi>Porrette,</hi> nor the deſperate reſolution to die, and to hang him who ſhould firſt ſpeak of yeelding; ſerved to any other purpoſe, then to make the conſtance of the Townſmen admired, augment the ſtory of <hi>King Lewis the Inſt,</hi> and elevate that of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> above the Stars. A very great, and moſt acceptable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to <hi>France,</hi> had ſhe remained in the ſame liberty which ſhe enjoyed, during the potency of this Town. A moſt damnable victory to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> themſelves accuſe of having then forgotten her intereſt. A victory, which ruined, and brought to a full ſtand, or <hi>Non-plus,</hi> all that Party, which divided the Kings Authority. A Victory, which gave that great Cardinal one half of his honour; and upon which he founded the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt conſtant power, that ever any Miniſter had; to the ruine of many moſt illuſtrious Families, and old Priviledges, the confuſion of all Chriſtendom, and even of his own great Benefactreſſe her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had rather hindred, then furthered the Party, and were accuſed of being the cauſe of this irreparable loſſe; a reſolution was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſeek to ſome other ſupport elſewhere: and ſo an Embaſsadour was diſpatched into <hi>Spain,</hi> to repreſent to that King, that intereſt he had to keep this Party;<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHEN the Cardinal, by his great prudence, had broaken that puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Party, which in ſome meaſure, both divided and ſhocked the Soveraign Power; re-eſtabliſhed every where the Catholick Religion, and a freſh ſpringing Amity amongſt the people; he perceived himſelf in danger to be caſt out of the Saddle. But, he had acquired ſo great an influence upon the mind, both of King and People, by the good ſucceſſe of his Counſels, that he was not a jot moved at the puiſſant factions, which he ſaw growing againſt himſelf, at the Court; all which he ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted afterwards, by a certain felicity, which alwayes accompanied him, and which after the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhined with more force, and luſter. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes ſeemed to be carried to a breach, between the two Crownes:<note place="margin">The King makes peace with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </note> for the more eafie atchievement whereof, and to involve the <hi>Church</hi> in this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious warre, from which ſome Grandies were averſe, by the intermiſſion, or mediation of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he made peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom he could not attack by land; and thought of finding another enemy, whom he might lay aboard, when he would. His Maſter had deſerved, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the name of <hi>Juſt,</hi> by humbling with great moderation, the <hi>Hughenot</hi> Party, and there was no better meanes left to obtain it alſo amongſt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formates,</hi> who were yet very hot, then by poaſting to the ſuccour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, againſt the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> after the fall of the <hi>Hughenots,</hi> in whoſe defence he had loſt both many men, and much money, finding the lot of arms unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable (which was to be alſo fatall to him afterwards) choſe to ſit ſtill in Royall vacancie and repoſe:<note place="margin">The firſt war of the King againſt the <hi>Spiniards,</hi> the ſecond againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and the third againſt his Subjects.</note> He was unfortunate in the firſt Expedition he made, when he ſent that Fleer, with the Admirall of <hi>Holland,</hi> who joyned with a great number of ſhips, to ſurpriſe <hi>Cales.</hi> For after having ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences, and loſſes, it was fain at length to return; and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> remitted many priſoners into <hi>England,</hi> to be puniſhed like Pyrats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their King had not denounced the War. <hi>One affront was paid by another.</hi> In his ſecond undertaking againſt <hi>France,</hi> Fortune favoured him yet leſſe; and his third and laſi, was the ruine of his Family, as we will ſhew, towards the end of this Epitome. Suddenly after the reduction of <hi>Rochel,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal</hi> preſsed hard for the ſuccour of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> againſt the opinion of ſuch, as could not endure ſo glittering a Purple, and who apprehended a breach. But he began it, and ended it (as we even now ſaid) in the yeare 1633. The ſaid Duke ſold his homage, and duty to the Emperour: which gave contentment to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Guaſtala,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their pretenſions to the aforementioned Dutchies.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:101836:73"/>
                  <p>Now, having already diſſipated the ſmalleſt and weakeſt enemies of his Greatneſſe, he cruſhed that Party, which had been ſo formidable to the precedent Kings: and being confirmed by the aſſurances, which his Maſter had given him, of covering him with his Crown, againſt all ſuch as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his mine; he reſolved upon this great deſigne, againſt the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> A deſigne I ſay of huge danger; and which could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and ſet on worke,<note place="margin">The <hi>Cardinal</hi> diſpoſes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to War againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> but by means of potent Allyes, for fear of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hazard of deſtroying the State. Therefore he thought it fir, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Proteſtants, all the North, and all ſuch as hated the Roman Catholick Religion: nor were the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the laſt, though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> courted them (in vaine) to a Truce.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> was eaſily diſpoſed to it, in regard of his Son in Law, and ſo great a Family, as wherewith both himſelf, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were burthened in a ſtrange Country: however the Communion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and compaſſion made this charge ſeem ſupportable, and gentle. In briefe, for the common intereſt of upholding themſelves, and for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion which every one in particular had of this puiſſant Houſe; they were all reſolved. <hi>A powerful Oratour cannot faile to perſwade; when he pleads the Common cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, there wanted both a Captain, and Cauſe ſufficient, to cover both this apprehenſion, and the ambition alſo of ſome certaine people; the former whereof they were reſolved to finde quickly out, though they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to goe ſeek him in the Ice, and amongſt the Deſerts of the North; and as for pretexts, as well falſe as true, they could not be wanting; for ſince they were about to play their laſt Game, they would hazard all; and if they loſt, the conſequence would be an univerſal Monarchie.</p>
                  <p>In the Treaty of Peace at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Embaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> promiſed, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould not meddle with the affairs of <hi>Germany;</hi> and yet there was another Treaty at <hi>Stockholne</hi> at the ſame time, about an Allyance, for the quiet of the Empire, and a War againſt the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>But for the better underſtanding of what I ſhall ſay, of that cruell fatality, which hath made both <hi>Germany,</hi> and all the Provinces neer it, a kinde of a Church-yard; it will very much import, to make ſome ſhort mention; Firſt of the quarrells and pretenſions of the Emperours againſt <hi>France;</hi> and then of the ſtate of the Empire it ſelfe, the Theater, of the moſt deſtructive, and deplorable War that ever was. But there was a neceſſity in it, to the end that the Propheſies might be accompliſhed: nor is there any end even yet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, ſeeing <hi>Germany</hi> in great combuſtion, by jealouſies drawn from the difference of Religion, and being invited into <hi>Germany</hi> by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in armes againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> and offered the protection of that Party, and invited alſo on the other ſide by intereſt of State; ſent thither the Duke of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> with a puiſſant Army, who ſeized upon thoſe three Biſhopricks, by way of correſpondence; and would have done the ſame to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> if he had been able to get leave to march with his Troops through the Town, as he had done at <hi>Metz.</hi> But the concluſion of a Peace between the Emperour, and the Princes, ſtopped the progreſſe of the <hi>French,</hi> and made them return; as <hi>Metz</hi> did that of the Emperour, and forbide the Eagles any further flight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſecond, having triumphed over all his Enemies (whom the <hi>French</hi> by vertue of their Allyances,<note place="margin">The affront of the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, for the diverſion of this tempeſt, and to make it burſt upon <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf; he complotted, and projected with all his Allyances, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luck would turne, and take away that Party,<note place="margin">The utility of thoſe Allyances through <hi>France.</hi>
                     </note> puffed up with ſo many Victories, redoubted for greatneſſe, hated for the contributions, by which it exhauſted <hi>Germany;</hi> and execrated, for the redemanding of the Eecleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Poſſeſſions, which was executed about that time. If this Dam were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but by one ſingle Victory, of what a vaſt profit would it be to <hi>France?</hi> The people would fall upon the Imperialiſts, as they formerly did upon the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and ſo all that Party would be in confuſion. <hi>Lorraine</hi> and <hi>Alſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> would be but a Breakfaſt; the three Eccleſiaſtical Electors would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly caſt themſelves into the King of <hi>France's</hi> armes, thereby to ſhelter themſelves from the fulminating fury of the Proteſtants; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Imperial Crown could not eſcape the head of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſhut up, and deprived of ſuccour from <hi>Germany,</hi> would be eaſily droven out of the Low-Countries;<note place="margin">The ſecret Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance.</note> and thus a certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Allyance, which was diſcovered and miſcarryed ſince that time, would one day be a plank, or foundation to the univerſal Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>This great Cardinal, ſo admired, and glorious, after having broken the <hi>Hughenot</hi> Party, ſuccoured the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and trodden upon the belly of the Savoyers; prepared himſelfe (I ſay) for this moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigne; diſpoſed the Proteſtants to it, by Father <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Leipſick;</hi>

Others alleadge, that to ſave the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which was expoſed to the excurſions of the Barbarians, by that remore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſlackneſſe of the Emperours of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> it was transferred by the Pope upon the <hi>Gawles,</hi> or <hi>French;</hi> and that the race, or <hi>Charlemagne</hi> coming
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101836:74"/>to ſaile, <hi>Pope Gregory the fifth</hi> transferred the Right of Election upon the <hi>Germans;</hi> aboliſhed the Hereditary, and gave hope to Princes of vertue, to be able to aſcend to this charge, which is the moſt glorious in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours have been more abſolute, then they are at preſent; and in the contentions with the <hi>Popes,</hi> from whom they receive their Crown, or at leaſt their Confirmation, they have been much diſadvantaged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, coming to die in <hi>Italy,</hi> every ſeveral Town aſſumed to itſelfe, a peculiar principal; in ſuch ſort, as that the Emperours have had little there ſince, ſave onely the bare Title. Beſides, the ſame <hi>Popes</hi> have cauſed troubles in <hi>Germany,</hi> on purpoſe to leave the domination to them there, and cut off the opportunity of coming to rub up old quarrels in <hi>Italy.</hi> Our Saviour indeed ſaid, <hi>that his Kingdom was not of this world, and that his Apoſtles ſhould not reign.</hi> The Primitive Supreme Biſhops declared it, by the Crown of Martyrdom; but ſome others ſpurred on by ambition, have wrangled for another, which both made them odious, and their Authority deſpicable, in many places. And moreover, the peaceful nature of ſome Emperours, hath made them ſeeke reſt, and neglect the Rights of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Empire</hi> is not <hi>Haereditary,</hi> but <hi>Elective;</hi> and when the Emperour is dead,<note place="margin">The King of the <hi>Romans</hi> is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for great affairs.</note> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> writes to the reſt of the Electors, to aſſemble themſelves at <hi>Francfurt,</hi> within three months, either in perſon, or elſe to ſend their Embaſſadours. During the Interreign, or Vacancy, the <hi>Elector Palatin</hi> is the Vicar, or Lieutenant; and he who is elected King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> is declared Heir. There three Eccleſiaſtical Electors, and four Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Mentz, Trevirs,</hi> and <hi>Colein.</hi> The King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> the <hi>Prince Palatin,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> who are not Kings, but may ſtile themſelves the ſaid Kings Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p>Being aſſembled at <hi>Francfurt,</hi> they make Oath to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> they will chuſe one, who ſhall be capable of the Charge. They are obliged to finiſh the Election within thirty dayes; and may not go out of the Town, till all be accompliſhed. If the voices happen to be equal, he who receives the King of <hi>Bohemia's</hi> Vote, is infallibly proclaimed Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The King of the <hi>Romans</hi> is not choſen during the life of the Emperour, but for great Affaires; and he cannot any way faile of ſucceſſion, as ſoon as the Emperour is dead. All is obſerved, according to the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth. The King of the Romans is obliged to take Oath, that he will not ſeeke to make the Empire Haereditary to his Houſe; but that he will maintain all the Rights, and Splendor thereof,</p>
                  <p>There are two Fundamental Laws, namely the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> and the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Capitulation;</hi> to the maintaining whereof he is bound by Oath. Which makes me finde their opinion very weake who praeſume to ſuſtaine, that the Emperour is a <hi>Mouarch;</hi> in regard that his Authority is ſo parted, and divided between him, and the Electors, that it looks, as if they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated, to help him beare this heavy burthen. Beſides, ſince <hi>Germany</hi> hath been ſo diſtracted by the diverſity of Doctrines, the Proteſtants have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunced ſo much of the Majeſty to themſelves, through the too timorous bounty, and moderation of ſome Emperours, ſince <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> that his hath been but little more acknowledged, and adored, both in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> And therefore, it is no wonder, if the Eagles Triumphant by ſo many Victories, have endeavoured to look back, upon ſome Rights which are now ſo many years old; and if a general Conſpiracy of the Neighbours of the ſaid Proteſtantes have been made, to hinder old Praetenſions, though grounded upon very much equity, and juſtice. But thoſe forreign Princes,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101836:74"/>who have thruſt themſelves into this quarrel, have ſtopped their eyes to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, opened them to intereſt of State, and to the means, of either praeſerving or ingrandiſhing themſelves.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Pojes.</note> The Popes were the firſt, who weakened it in Italy, and gave matter thereby, to the moſt ambitious of that Nation, to appropiate ſome States to themſelves, as being either vacant, or deſecred, by the troubles, or care leſneſs, of the Emperours: wherein they ſerved themſelves of divers pretexts; as either through zeal of devotion, and reſpect; or for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome faults, which they imputed to the ſaid Emperous; or through the immenſity of their own ambition; or elſe, by favouring the factions, of the <hi>Ghilphes,</hi> againſt the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> or Imperialiſts: in ſuch ſort, as the Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie obumbrating, or overſhaddowing, the Imperiall, hath both now quite away the heat thereof, as I have already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Tranſlation of the States. The Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> Secondly, by the tranſlation of the Seate of the Empire to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and by the inundation of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which have come at certain times from beyond the <hi>Rheynt</hi> and from the <hi>North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Empire is much diminiſhed, by ſome Provinces, and Towns, yea,<note place="margin">The Kingdoms.</note> and whole Kingdoms alſo, which upon divers praetexts, have looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves from this great Body, which are mentioned in hiſtory, and not for our purpoſe heer. And moreover, ſince the <hi>Germans</hi> have reduced the Empire within the praecincts of their nation, and choſen the Emperours anoughſt themſelves, by the excluſion of all ſtrangers it is no wonder, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101836:75"/>have ſeparated themſelves from them, and erected particular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to the hunour of theirs.</p>
                  <p>But let us now come to the principall ſubject of all, drawne from the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> themſelves: which makes the Empire ſo weak, that any neighbouring Prince very often dares brave and affront it:<note place="margin">The diverſity of Doctrines, and ambition.</note> and this is the diverſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions; the over great porencie of the Princes, and States, and diſtruſt, in ſide, or diſſidence, mingled with ambition. For remedie whereof, the Emperoun and Princes have had many conſerences and it hath been agreed, &amp; reſolved, that there ſhould be but two Religions tolerated in <hi>Germany;</hi> as namely, the Roman Catholick, &amp; the confeſſion of <hi>Auxburgh,</hi> which is the <hi>Lutheran.</hi> But the diſeaſe being too great to be cured by ſo gentle phyſick; and the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> too powerfull, both in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Conntreys,</hi> not to give jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; diſtruſt, and ambition, (ſickneſſes of State) have alwayes peeped out their heads, in the Diets, after much time loſt in diſputing for place, and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeucie. So that theſe being gotten into the interiour of the firſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king little account of the languiſhing authoritie of the Emperous, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the hatred, ſeditions, and warrs, which we have relared already, and thoſe alſo, which are now going to deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>From this diverſity of Religions, ſprang the warre, between <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: <hi>John Frederick, Electour</hi> of <hi>Saxonie, Philip Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which rendred the ſaid Emperours luſter, more glonous, and begat ſuch a hatred in all the Proteſtant States, as is now grown almoſt irreconciliable.</p>
                  <p>There was a temperament, or kinde of agreement in Religion concluded afterwards, which was called <hi>The contract of Paſſavia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The contract of <hi>Paſſavia.</hi>
                     </note> which yet, being taken again into deliberation, hath ſince made a marveilous ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as we are about to ſhew. In this aforeſaid Treaty, it was ordered, and ſetled, that the Proteſtants ſhould enjoy all ſuch eccleſiaſticall goods, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, as they had formerly poſſeſſed; and that the reſt ſhould remaine in perpetuity, to the Catholicks. For example, the Catholick Biſhops coming to embrace the <hi>Luheran</hi> Religion, ſhould forthwith religne the place, to be occupated by another, who ſhould make open, not feigned profeſſion, of the Catholick; and ſo conſecutively, of all the <hi>Cloiſters, Abbies,</hi> and other digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which yet, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> cannot deny but they have conterveened, and contradicted, and that they retaine all ſuch aforeſaid goods, and revenues, againſt the will of the <hi>Teſtatonrs,</hi> and againſt all Rights, Juſtice, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

                  <p>AFter ſo many Victories gotten, by the Emperours Lieutenants; after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving humbled the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and all the Proteſtants of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: after having ſo often chaſtized <hi>Bethleem Gabor,</hi> deſtroyed the dreadful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the Peaſants of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and pardoned ſuch, as were too deeply inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Prince Palatines patty, who was deprived of his Stages, and fled for reſuge, into <hi>Holland;</hi> and after the death of <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> and his faithful Biſhop, the Emperour reſolved,<note place="margin">She complaints of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</note> to ſatisfy the complaints of the Roman Catholicks, who demanded juſtice, upon ſuch as by uſurpation, detained many Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and goods, after the contract of <hi>Paſſavia.</hi> For being the Head of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he could not deny them; and the Biſhops are as well members of this great Body, as the other Princes: but it was to move a ſtone, which threatned the fall of the whole building. It was repreſented to him, that the Proreſtants had very ill obſerved the Peace, and that the Catholicks had not diſpured with them, what was already granted them, by the ſaid contract; however it were done by force, and for the eſtabliſhment of firme repoſe: but that they, not being glutted with thoſe Prebendries, had leapt beyond their bargains, and againſt the Signed Promiſe, violently ravaged, and taken many other. <hi>But, we muſt not keep our word with Hereticks.</hi> Who muſt be upbraided with this maxine; he, who ſayes it, or he, who does it?</p>
                  <p>The Emperour, upon mature deliberation, finding the equity of the cauſe, ſlighting the danger, which yet was moſt vilable; for he went about to ſhock the <hi>Electours,</hi> Princes, States, and Towns of the Empire, who would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch dainty bits to be plucked out of their mouths, with out conteſting, and hazarding all; even though they were forced to call in ſtrangers.</p>

The Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, which falls before the feet of the travayler, doth not ſo much aſtoniſh him, as this ſentence did all the Proteſtants. But before we paſſe to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſterous War, let us ſee the motives, and reaſons of both patryes.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſhewed, upon what Right the Emperours command was grounded;<note place="margin">There ſon why:</note> the execution whereof was aſſured him to be facil enough, by ſo many victorious Armies, which it would be no leſs then evident temerity for them to oppoſe; ſince he had already ventered to expel the Heriticks out of his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101836:76"/>own Haereditary Countries, &amp; had brought the ſedition of the Peaſants to a good iſſue. But, the occult cauſes were, that he could not better fix his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then by this way; in regard that, it he would be generally adored, and root the Imperial Crown faſt in his Family, he muſt needs firſt reſorm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the Roman Catholick Religion every where. That he had a foor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Bahick</hi> Sea; and that ſince he had ſo well begun, he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, and finiſh: That he was obliged to God, the Church, and the <hi>Holy See; and that at ſerves for nothing, to undertake, without perſeverance, and the Iron muſt be ſtruck whileſt it is hot, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Proteſtants found this Command, of as hard digeſtion as the <hi>Belgicks,</hi> or Low-country people did the exaction of the <hi>Tenth Penny,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A hard Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them by the Duke of <hi>Alva. Men fight ſometimes</hi> (ſayes a learned Writer) <hi>with more reſolution, for the Harth, then for the Altar.</hi> Wherefore,<note place="margin">Pro arri &amp; focis.</note> it was held ſit to oppoſe it, by ſome Proteſtation: and ſo, they beſeeched his Majeſty to ſuſpend the execution thereof, till it were decided, in a Generall Diet. But, in the mean while, there grew murmuration, and grumbling every where, the hatred for Religion was renewed; and a moſt manifeſt averſion of the people, diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour granted them a Generall Aſſembly at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Aſſembly at <hi>Rathbone.</hi>
                     </note> and tranſported himſelf thither, at the ſame time, that the newes was brought him, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was entred with an Army into the Territories of the Empyre. Whereupon, the Proteſtant Embaſſadours, even raviſhed with joy, required not only a Revocation of the ſaid Edict, or Command, in order to the Eccleſiaſticall poſſeſſions, but alſo that all might be reſtored to the ſame ſtate wherein it was, before the Revolt. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would not hearken to this; for either he muſt make himſelf obeyed, or leave to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Hereupon, the Embaſsadors ſneaked away,<note place="margin">And at <hi>Lepp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</hi>
                     </note> and aſsembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Leipſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Neighbouring nations ſeeing this alteration, were not a little glad, to underſtand that there was a preparation made, to give this Majeſty a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral check in the very foundation, and root thereof. In a word, Leagues and Confoederations were concluded, and ſtrangers, (who, by occult wayes, helped to fabricate this fire) called in, and embraced; the ambition of <hi>Spain</hi> not forgotten, which aymed at nothing but the Univerſal Monarchy: the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> canvaſed, and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as Parricides, Incendiaries, Eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to peace, and Authours of all ſedition, coupled: The <hi>Roman Antichriſt</hi> carried alſo his pack, by the writings of ſuch, as whoſe whoſe party was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the cruell lot of Armes; and in fine, by all the Proteſtants: The Imperial Majeſty it ſelf was expoſed to the rage of the people, which wiſhed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a change. Yea, even the Imperial Townes, which ſuſpected that Majeſty, and which, by the licence of the change of Religion, had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to themſelves all the aforeſaid Lands and Goods, thruſt on the wheel, augmented the diſtruſt, and offered the profuſion of their treaſures, thereby to hinder the drawing of the principall ſource thereof.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo alledged, that the Princes and States, had had ground and cauſe to employ the Eccleſiaſticall Lands, and Goods, to better uſes; and that the Prieſts; and Monks, lived ill, fatted themſelves like hogges, and gave ſcandal, to the whole world. That they had peacefully enjoyed them above ſixty years, and that ſuch of them, as were left them by their Anceſtours, might be retaken by them, to provide for their children. In fine, complaints, reaſons, and libels were not wanting: And after a great wind, commonly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes rain: ſo, all here being diſpoſed, they came from words to blowes.</p>

And ſo, the Proteſtants being inflamed, and incouraged, by the Catholicks, which were intereſſed, and deſirous to ſee ſome diſorder ſpring up in this powerful Body; undertook the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.

                  <p>VVHere ſhall I be able to finde tearmes, and Inke black enough, to expreſſe, and write tragically enough, the cruel, and diſmal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, of this ſanguinary, and horrible War? Where ſhall I chuſe words of energy, or force enough, to curſe the inhuman actions, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tragedies, which have been acted in wretched <hi>Europ,</hi> and which are not yet ended; and that, onely by the immenſe ambition of ſome few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? It is lawful openly to blame Vice, but not ſuch as commit it: It is God onely, who muſt judge, and we poor Subjects muſt bend our ſhoulders, and expect our deliverance from above.</p>
                  <p>About Mid-Summer, in the year 1630. the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> entred <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> with an Army; having firſt cleanſed the Iſle of <hi>Rugia,</hi> and the borders of <hi>Stralſund,</hi> from the Imperial Garriſons. The reaſons which he publiſhed, for his coming as an Enemy, were.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe his Embaſſadours had not been admitted, to the Treaty of <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard the Imperialiſts came againſt him in <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thirdly, for that ſome Letters of his, which he ſent to <hi>Bethleem Gabor,</hi> had been intercepted, in full peace. But theſe, were but pretexts: for the true, and moving grounds were theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">His reaſons.</note> Firſt, becauſe the Emperour had deprived his kinſmen, the Princes of <hi>Meckelemburgh,</hi> of their Dutchyes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that he had built Forts, in all the Havens; and made Ships, to render himſelfe potent upon the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> with deſigne to paſſe one day further into <hi>Sweden,</hi> then he was to expect, that the Eagles would be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to coaſt.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, in reſpect there was ſome apperance of extending his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in <hi>Germany;</hi> and in a word, it is <hi>alwayes profitable to fiſh, in troubled waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The anſwer to the aforeſaid reaſons.</note> The Emperour anſwered, that he himſelfe had begun, by putting a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon into <hi>Stralſund,</hi> and that there could be no treating with him, without drawing it from thence.</p>
                  <p>As for his Letters, beſides that all the plots, and practices, both of himſelf,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101836:78"/>and his Allyes, were already diſcovered; it was impoſſible, but they muſt tend to his diſadvantage, being directed to a man, who had as often revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as opportunity was offered him to do it; and who never kept his faith, but when he wanted occaſion to break it.</p>
                  <p>In relation to the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, he had at leaſt (being Chief, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) as much to do with it, as <hi>Guſtavus</hi> had.</p>
                  <p>That the ſuccour which he ſent the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was ſounded upon the ſame Maxims, upon which himſelfe had ſuccoured the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Stralſund.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to the Dukes of <hi>Meckelemburgh,</hi> he objected, that he had nothing to do, to controwl him in <hi>Germany;</hi> and that himſelfe would not take it well, that he ſhould medle with any of his kingdom.</p>
                  <p>That his cares were open to Interceſſions, but not to Commands.</p>
                  <p>But, all theſe arguments ſerved for nothing; there muſt be blowes. For, the King was ſure of his Allyes, and of the inclination of all the Proteſtants, whoſe Cauſe, and Religion, he vanted, that he came to defend. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this generous Prince, being brought up in arms, was ſure, that, could he but once come to beate that old Captain,<note place="margin">Tilly.</note> that victorious Rock, againſt which all his Enemies had made ſhipwrack; all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would lend him their hands, from the one end of the Empire, to the other; and then, what honour, and what glory ſhould he obtain? And if it hapned other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he might conſolate himſelfe, with all ſuch other Warriers, as had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the like diſgrace; though yet ſtill, with this advantage beyond them, that his Enemies could not follow him, into his kingdom. In brief, he wanted but the getting of one General Battel, to put into his hands the two thirds of the Empire: and one more for all; and <hi>Italy</hi> in, to the bargaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">King <hi>Guſtave</hi> leagues with the Dake of <hi>Pomerania.</hi>
                     </note> Whileſt he was treating the League with Duke <hi>Bogiſlaus</hi> (who received him in <hi>Stetin</hi>) and driving the Imperialiſts out of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and <hi>Meckelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargh;</hi> being fortunate in many Encounters, and chiefly, in that which was offered for the ſuccour of <hi>Colbergh</hi> (where the Imperialiſts were knocked, and <hi>Torquaro Conty</hi> forced to incamp himſelfo at <hi>Gartz</hi>) the Proteſtants aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelves ſecretly at <hi>Leipſick,</hi> from whence they communicated with him, and amongſt themſelves, about the means of retaining the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Lands, and Goods in queſtion; of maintaining their Religion; and reducing, and reſtraining the Empire, to the ſame ſtate, wherein it had been before the troubles. All kindes of defence are authorized, when there is fear of the diminution of eſtate, and State, together with that of Religion. It ſeems, that in theſe times, men may diſpenſe with their faith or word gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even upon meer doubts; and that it is lawful, upon meer apprehenſions onely, though without any ground, to withdraw ones ſelfe from obedience. But diſſidence, and power to hurt upon occaſion, have more weight in State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt, then in Right; and they, who have not Peace, and Juſtice, for the ſcope of their armes, do not make War, but commit robberies; for the end of War, ought to be Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He blocks the ſea Towns.</note> Now, the King ſpent all the Summer, in blocking up the maritine Places; raiſing new Troops; exciting the Inhabitants to expell their Gueſts, and receive their old Maſters; wherein they ſhewed themſelves ſo good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that their fear effectively appeared in all parts. <hi>Bogiſtans</hi> wrote com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and excuſes to the Emperour; but they brought nothing back, but reproaches, and condemnations.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Imperial Army and that of the League, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Head; becauſe the Duke of <hi>Frithland</hi> had obeyed the Emperours Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and General <hi>Tilly</hi> had a minde to ſubmit to ſome pious inſpirations, which commanded him to leave this Trade, and paſſe the reſt of his dayes in the ſervice of his Heavenly Maſter: In ſuch ſort, as there was much
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101836:78"/>a doe, yea, and many great Divines were faint to diſplay their eloquence, to make him re-admit this Burthen upon his ſhoulders. For he conſidered, that he had alwayes had Fortune as his Handmaid; that he had acquired as much glory, as any one Captain in the World; and that all this might change; that in a great Calme, a great Storme is to be feared; and that it often happens, that the ſoundeſt, and beſt diſpoſed bodies, are thoſe, which moſt eaſily fall into grevous ſickneſſes. <hi>No, no, (ſaid he) let another younger then I am, untangle this Web: It is a faire Field to winne the Lawrel; ſince the diſpute is about Religion, and the Authority, of the Prime man of the World; the Cauſe is juſt; and the more difficulty it hath in it, the more glory will it alſo have.

                  <p>
                     <hi>MAgdeburgh</hi> is an Imperial Town, in the Country of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> ſituated upon the River of <hi>Elbe,</hi> grown very rich, and puiſſant, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inſolent, by the conveniency of Trade; It put <hi>Charles</hi> the fiſth to much vexation, and trouble, and he proclaimed an Outlawrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and gave <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> the execution thereof; who, either through colluſion, or otherwiſe, forbore to take it; and from thence came the <hi>German</hi> Proverb:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance thereof.</note> 
                     <hi>Metz and Magd refuſed to dance with the Empetour.</hi> After <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine was planted there, the Arch-Biſhops authority began to be much vilifyed, and conſequently, that of the Emperour. But let us now come to the ſtate of the controverſie.</p>
                  <p>This Town choſe <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Son to the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> for her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtratour. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> conſented not to this Election; and the Pope, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to reſtore his credit in that Country, together with that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; eſtabliſhed the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who is at preſent Governour of the Low-Countries, for the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Imperialiſts ſeized upon ſome places neer it, and extorted a ſumme of money from it for their <hi>Solde,</hi> or <hi>Pay;</hi> and by continuing to demand a greater, provoked the averſions of the Cirtizens, and encouraged them to take arms, and chaſe them away.</p>
                  <p>They ſeized alſo upon ſome Barkes, which went to the Country of <hi>Meckelenburgh;</hi> ſo that <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> at length was faine to come and revenge
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101836:79"/>that Commotion.<note place="margin">Appeaſed by <hi>Wallenſtem.</hi>
                     </note> Brief, the Town was inveſted, temerity turned into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and arms into ſupplications: in concluſion, all was pardoned, they diſpenſed with for a Garriſon, and the Forfeit of a hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Riv.-Dollars,</hi> which was liberally remitted, out of reſpect to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Princes: though yet, all this made them not a whit better Servants, to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Thus, was the firſt bout paſt; but there followed a ſecond, which brought an utter ruine, and that the moſt miſerable one, that ever fell upon any Town; I will be bold to ſay, then that of <hi>Troy,</hi> even though all were true, which hath been written thereof by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and then that of <hi>Foruſalem, Saguntum,</hi> and <hi>Numantia:</hi> yea, of <hi>Sancorra,</hi> and <hi>Tirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> But we will deliver the motives thereof, and the Prodigies, which praeceded it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The couſe of the diſturbance.</note> The Arch-Dukes Embaſsadours were ſent to <hi>Hall,</hi> and <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> to preſs the Inauguration, or Inveſture, re-demand the Churches, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the Evangelical Canonries. This infinitely diſpleaſed the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratour <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who could not brook, that ſuch a dignity, together with ſo great Revenues (wherewith he could maintain himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his quality) ſhould be forced from him: Nor was he ignorant, of how the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> took this proceeding, with what eyes theſe new Catholicks were looked on, and that Fortune did forward the valiant, and hinder the timid: and therefore, he fell to work.</p>
                  <p>On that one ſide, he perceived the Aſsembly of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: on the other, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who made great progreſs, and who was expected by all, as a true Liberatour, or Deliverer, and in the middle, all the people extremely affectionate to the Party, and deſirous of nothing more, then to be in action for it. We alwayes covet that which is hurtful to us, and ask that, which we ought to ſhun.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The A Imini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratour enters into the Town, and gaines the people.</note> He entred into <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> diſguiſed, with Marſhal <hi>Falkenbergh,</hi> and brought things ſo to paſs by his practiſes, and ſhifts, that he gained the Principall of the Town privately; and they, the people publickly. He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, whether they would hold with the King <hi>Sweden,</hi> and with him? To which they anſwered with a loud voyce, <hi>Yea. Ah! Blind people, what do you? You tumble both your fortunes, and lives into apracipice, by a fatality, which no body can comprehend, and yet leſſe, reſiſt. You have forgotten your firſt ſickneſſe, but you will periſh, in the relaps. You ſee not any of the Prodigies, which admoniſh, and threaten you: One part of your Walls, and Bulwarks, tell you by their tottering, that they are to be thrown downe, and that flaming ſword, which appeared aver your Town five or ſix moneths before your ruine, whilſt you ſtept, announced to you, that fire and ſword ſhould deſtroy you.

                  <p>After having plucked out this thorne, he bent all his thoughts, to the ſuccour of <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> where we will leave him, to ſee what paſſed at that famous Aſſembly of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> where there was preſent that renowned <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin, Father Joſeph,</hi> to animate, together with the other Embaſſadours, the Proteſtants, to warre againſt the Catholick League.

But it was now too late to talk of remedies; ſtrangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already gotten in, and <hi>Ferdinands</hi> honour too deeply ingaged. Nor did their diſtruſts, and jealouſies derogate one jot, from the juſtice of the Edict; no more then their poſſeſſion of ſo many yeares made them true, and lawfull Proprietaries: For, <hi>That which is differed, is not loſt.</hi> And for the praeſcription, it ſerved for nothing; it being as lawful for the Emperour, to take the ſaid Lands, and Goods from them by way of Juſtice, as it had been for them to diſpoſſeſſe the Eccleſiaſticks thereof by violence, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, againſt the agreement made, after they had withdrawne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ancient Church,<note place="margin">Refuſed by other.</note> to marry: and ſo much the rather, becauſe he was obliged thereto by his Authority, Right, and Intereſt.

                  <p>All theſe commandments were proſperous enough, in High <hi>Germany:</hi> but the face of all things was changed, in Low-<hi>Saxonie,</hi> and the <hi>Maritine Towns</hi> (the principal ſubject of the diſtructs) which had long been blocked up, and put themſelves again, into King <hi>Guſtaves</hi> hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tilly</hi> and <hi>Papenheim,</hi> being reſolved rather to dye, then abandon the Siege, diſſembled their loſſes received, and continued it with ſo much order, that they quickly made themſelves maſters,<note place="margin">All the Forts taken.</note> of all the Forts and Out-works; ſo that there remained nothing but the Town, which periſhed, more out of hatred, and by the induſtrie of wiſe <hi>Falkembergh,</hi> then by her own ſtrength. The Inhabitants were ſummoned to render; the Mines were ready, and the hand liſted up to ſtrike: and yet, through their obſtinacie and blindneſſe, they would needs expect extremityes, which at length they found. For <hi>Papenheim,</hi> irritated, as well by their flowts, as by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumatious reſiſtance, entred firſt by force, and was repulſed by the Valour of the <hi>Marſhal,</hi> who being killed by a bullet,<note place="margin">And the Town by force. which is all burnt.</note> the Inhabitants quickly retreated into their houſes; the neereſt whereof he commanded to be fired; and almoſt at the very ſame inſtant, the fire was ſeen very far from thence, neer the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and ſo, in leſſe then four hours, this fine Town was reduced into aſhes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Souldiers were fighting with the Citizens, for plunder, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any care at all, to extinguiſh the devouring flames.</p>
                  <p>This was the end of that deplorable Town, the aſhes whereof produced ſuch animoſities amongſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Reformates,</hi> againſt the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, that they cannot be highly enough expreſſed; and principally againſt <hi>Tilly,</hi> whoſe actions they carped, and ſaid, that he had ſtained all his gallant Victories, with the ſmoaky ruines of <hi>Megdeburgh.</hi> What ever were in the matter, true it is, that <hi>Tilly,</hi> after this ranſack, found fortune alwayes againſt him; and the Proteſtants reproached him with the indignation, and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, for the ſhedding of ſo much innocent blood.</p>
                  <p>The Catholicks, on the other ſide, retort the fault upon the inſolencie of the Burghers, or Townſmen, who refuſed honorable conditions, when there was time for them: and whileſt the gate was yet open to favour, and pardon: and ſay beſides, that the <hi>Swedes,</hi> ſeeing the place loſt, leſt it on fire, for feare leaſt it ſhould fall entyre, together with the <hi>Magazin,</hi> into the hands of their enemies; alledging for proof thereof, that the fire was kindled, in many parts of the Town, from which the imperialiſts were very far off; though yet indeed, when ſouldiers are once gotten into a place by force, they make no account at all of command. But really, had they been able to enjoy this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, by an honourable compoſition, they would have been able by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie of the paſſage, and the Bridge, to keep the warre alwayes in <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemburgh;</hi> ſuccour the places beſieged, and have <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> behind them: for; a little before the taking of this Town, they had forſaken the Bridge of <hi>Daſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi> upon information, that the King was coming thither, and for fear leaſt he ſhould ſerve himſelf of the ſaid paſſage.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101836:81"/>they ſaved (according to the opinion of many) the Town from the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt; but after they were ſecretly ſtolne way, the wrath of heaven fell upon it, and cruſhed it, <hi>Had not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyffes ſtolne the Image of Minerva, Troy had not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</hi>

                     <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> being loſt in her ruins, and the poor inhabitants buryed, or burnt in their houſes, nothing was left to the conquerours, but a juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to ſee the deſolation thereof. <hi>Tilly</hi> marched with his army; entred into <hi>Saxonie;</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101836:81"/>to get the winde.

                  <p>

But he exhorting his men, both by his Majeſty, actions, and eloquence; and a terrible execution, being done upon the Imperialiſts, as well by their own Canon, as by that of their Enemies; their Cavalrie began to fly. <hi>Tilly</hi> followed, though he were wounded, and thereby gave the lye to ſuch as had impudently publiſhed; that he was invulnerable, by vertue of ſome certain Characters, or Charms.</p>
                  <p>If the Imperiall Horſe, had done their duty, as well as the foot theirs, the confederates had runne hazard to looſe all. But the Foot being abandoned,<note place="margin">The valour of the Imperial Foot.</note> fought ſo valliantly, that they were faine to turne the ordnance upon five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, which were rallyed, and fortifyed a part before they could break them.

In fine, the confuſion of the one, &amp; the joy of the other, was ſo great, that it could not be expreſſed, and the money of the Prieſts ſerved for a bait to attack them. Indeed, their avarice was ever blamed, and the great Revenues they poſseſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, purchaſed them hatred: They were too much at eaſe, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to unfatten them a little. The hope of plundering upon them, encouraged an infinite multitude to bear Arms for King <hi>Guſtave;</hi> who never let them be quiet, but kept them continually in action, thereby to diſable the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from recollecting himſelf. Thus luck turned, and Fortune took part with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> whom we will now leave, in the honours which are done them, and the ſhouts of joy, which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> make, for this glorious victory.</p>
                  <p>Now, the King ſeeing himſelf thus adored by his own party, and ſo much redoubted by his enemies, courſed them every where; imagining that from thence forward, he ſhould eaſily find the way to the Univerſall Monarchy: But in an allyance, every one hath his deſign apart, as I ſhall more amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,

Thus deſtroyed he her, who laboured to elevate him, and who truſted wholly in him, and made him, in fine her prime, and principall Minſter. But, they who relate this proceeding, to ſave him from the attack of ingratitude, alledge forſooth, that the Kings Cauſe ought to prevail, and that it is by no means neceſſary to obſerve, and keep a Contract, which is made againſt the Lawes, and Rights of the kingdom.

                  <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> feeling himſelfe ſo roughly attacked, by an enemy whom he had never offended (unleſſe Princes take the occaſion to hurt, for an offence) ſent the <hi>French</hi> Reſident, <hi>Monſieur de Sainct Eſtienne,</hi> to the King, to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to him, that in regard he was ſo deeply ingaged in the Allyance with the King of <hi>France,</hi> he could not be aſſailed by him,<note place="margin">A notable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note> without making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his enemy.

This was not the firſt prank of activity, which the Cardinal played in <hi>Germany;</hi> though it were well obſerved by the Elector, and would have been taken for couzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in another Age; but in this, for politick craft. Howſoever, he made his profit of it; ſtood faſt with the Emperour; and ſo neately, and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly retorted the ball upon the <hi>French,</hi> that the Cardinal himſelfe was faine to avow, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was the moſt cautious, and ſubtile Prince in <hi>Germany.

                  <p>ALl the World admired <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> in his proſperity; many lamented him, in his diſgrace; and every body wondered, to ſee him now, at head of ſo puiſlant an Army, with ſo much glory and Majeſty. The firſt dart he ſhot, was againſt the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> (and it was a Propoſition of Peace) the point whereof not being yet well ſharpned, was quickly unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and cleanſed afterwards.<note place="margin">

The ſecond he ſhot, had ſo much vigour, that he diſlodged the ſaid Electors Troops out of <hi>Prague,</hi> and all <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and made them returne into <hi>Miſnia,</hi> leaving <hi>Gallaſſo</hi> behinde them, with ſome forces. But he was not troubled at all, to ſee the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> chaſtiſed by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> nor did he haſten to beat them out of his Country; in reſpect of the hatred he bore him, for his having diſpoſed the Emperour, by the advice of Cardinal <hi>Richelien,</hi> to deprive him of the Generalſhip. In fine, after having been often beſeeched to come, he moved at lengh, towards the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Guſtave Horne</hi> was not idle in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and by the aſſiſtance of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Straſburgh</hi> (for ſo many Imperial Towns, ſo many little Armies for the <hi>Swedes</hi>) he beſieged the Fort of <hi>Benefeldt,</hi> which by the ſlackneſſe of the Governour,<note place="margin">Horne <hi>takes</hi> Benefeldt.</note> he quickly took; and ſo, by breaking the Irons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Towns ſeemed to be bound, the <hi>Swedes</hi> forged other, to ſtop them. He took many Towns, and would have made greater progreſſe, had he not been called by his King, to ſuccour him neer <hi>Nuremburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dukes of <hi>Meckelemburgh</hi> were alſo ſtill in action, and had ſo clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their <hi>Dutchy</hi> from the Imperial Garriſons,<note place="margin">Stirrs at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock,</hi> and why?</note> who were not expected to be ever ſeen again in thoſe parts. But there chanced a Tragedy at <hi>Roſtock,</hi> which was like to have deſtroyed the Town, and the Inhabitants alſo with it; and it was this. A certaine <hi>Burgher,</hi> or Townſman, having a minde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of <hi>Iudith,</hi> to deliver the ſaid Town, from the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as he ſaid) of the Imperialiſts; went to the Governour in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to deſire a Paſtport; and when he ſaw him buſie in writing it, he ſtruck him ſo many blowes with a hatchet, that he cut off his head, and carried it away in a bag, and threw it into the Cellar of another Burgher. This mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being diſcovered, gave an alarme to the Souldiers, who gave it alſo ſo hotly to the poor Citizens, that they thought no leſſe, then to be all knocked in the head, and plundered. But inquiry being made, the head was found, and the murtherer ſhortly after, who was examined, and made ſuffer the puniſhment of his Crime, for the diſcharge of the innocent; and his ill ſetled head flew off his ſhoulders, for an example, to ſuch as ſhould undertake, falſly to imitate that aforeſaid Lady, who was accompanied by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Wirtembergh,</hi> and all who had renounced the League of <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> took arms again, with as much facility, as a Candel newly put out, and yet hot, takes fire: All muſt be changed; there muſt be another <hi>Golden
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101836:87"/>Bull,</hi> other <hi>Electors,</hi> and another Emperour; for they ſcoffed at this, and all his deſignes: but as ſoon as the Armies were ſeen before <hi>Nurembergh,</hi> all was huſht, and every body ſtood mute, at the expectation of a ſucceſſe, which was to give the Law. When the King came out of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> he found but onely <hi>Ingolſtadt,</hi> which reſiſted him; and in revenge thereof, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed all his forces throughout the whole Country; and <hi>Minnecken,</hi> one of the fineſt Towns in <hi>Germany</hi> preſented him her keyes; where he ſeized upon a huge Treaſure; and being informed, that there were many pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance buried under ground, he cauſed them to be digged up, and found them full of <hi>Ducats.</hi> In fine, being loaden with booty, and not able to ſtay there, he extorted three hundred thouſand Rix-Dollars more from the Town, to ſave it from plunder, as he did ſome other, after the ſame rate. Many Villadges were ſet on fire, for a ſigne that the Enemy had been there; who retired himſelfe with ſpeed, letting the <hi>Bavarians</hi> take breath by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and leaving Garriſons in three Towns onely, to aſſure them of his returne, at his pleaſure; and ſo he went, and incamped himſelfe before <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rembergh;</hi> a place of much renown, for the induſtry of the Inhabitants, and for being one of the principal Imperial Towns beſides. It is ſeated, almoſt in the Center of <hi>Germany;</hi> hath alwayes been extreamely jealous of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours happines, oppoſed his deſignes, by many direct wayes;<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Armies drew neer the Town, and invironned it, together with the King; who not being ſtrong enough, to oppoſe ſo great, and terrible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſent for all his Generals; as Marſhal <hi>Horne,</hi> the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Haſſia;</hi> Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Wimar; Axel Oxenſterns,</hi> and a multitude of other Officers, with their Troops, who all arrived happily to his camp;<note place="margin">All the forces before <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Shal not mention all which paſſed, between the two greateſt Armies, that have been ſeen theſe hundred yeares, compoſed of ſo many Generals, as well as others. Every one laboured to excell his companion; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever art, and ſubtilty, can be in Arms, was here ſet on work.</p>
                  <p>The King, who boaſted, that he had to do with a Prieſt, which was <hi>Tilly;</hi> with a ſouldier,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tilly</hi> called Prieſtly the King <hi>Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> Souldier, and <hi>Willenſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> Foole.</note> meaning <hi>Papenheim;</hi> and with a Fool, which was <hi>Wallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> (who gave him more exerciſe then all the reſt) not being able to draw him to a generall Battail, offered him the Crown of <hi>Hungary;</hi> but that not ſucceeding, and the Impoſtume, which <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> had in his ſoul, not being yet ready to burſt, and vent the filth which was in it; recourſe muſt be had to force. For the Imperialiſts were grown <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and ſerved themſelves of the Spade, inſtead of the Lance. But <hi>Guſtave,</hi> longing to be Maſter of the Empyre, reſolved to unneſtle him from thence, and aſſembled his principall Officers, to diſpoſe his Army that way: But finding them of a contrary opinion, through the impoſſibility of the Enterprize; he fell to reproach them, and utter ſuch injurious language againſt them, as had not their intereſt been tyed to his,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Guſtave</hi> abuſes his Officers.</note> and their averſion from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> too great; would have made many of them disband. In ſo much, as that Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> riſing full of generous choler, anſwered him in theſe terms. <hi>Sir, the Germans are not Cowards.</hi> But, the King appeaſed him, ſaying, that it was not he whom he taxed, and ſo diſpoſed him, together with the other Officers, to a Generall Attack.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The loſſe of the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
                     </note> The <hi>Swedes</hi> advanced; and the Imperialiſts, covered with their Trenches, withſtood them; and after a ſtubborn fight of many houres, and the loſſe of the Flower of their Army, repulſed them; There were aboue five thouſand killed upon the place, beſides hurt, and taken. Then, was the gold of great <hi>Guſtaves</hi> wiſdome ecclipſed, and appeared that it was neer an end. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts loſt about fifteen hundred men. And the King fearing, leaſt he ſhould looſe the Electour of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> left a good Garriſon in the Town, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, and marched with all his Army, towards <hi>Saxonie,</hi> to preſerve that Countrey for himſelf. But, whileſt the Armyes were incamped neer <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> and the circumjacent Countries for more then ten leagues compaſſe, ruined, by the excurſions of ſo many men; General <hi>Arnem,</hi> domineered over <hi>Sileſia</hi> at his pleaſure, and being reinforced by ſome Troops, conſtrained <hi>Holck,</hi> to caſt himſelf into <hi>Miſnia,</hi> with <hi>Galaſſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Maſters of Politick Science were of opinion, that if <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> had had a mind to deſtroy the King, he might have done it, without putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the danger of hazarding a Combat; had it not been upon very great advantage; but that he let him paſſe, ſo to play his part the better. Whatever were the matter, his actions were more neerly, and narrowly pryed into afterwards, which, when the right ſide of the Meddal was turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were diſcovered to be all criminal.</p>
                  <p>The King, not having been able to ruin <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> paſſed to the Dutchy of <hi>Wirtembergh,</hi> and ſent General <hi>Bannier</hi> over the <hi>Danub.</hi> The Duke ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf, to go and defend his Countrey; and <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> followed the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101836:88"/>King, but ſuddenly changed his reſolution, and marched into the Dutchy of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> there to take up his Winter quarters. <hi>Guſtave</hi> haſtened thither: <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> ſpeedily ſent for the Valliant <hi>Papenheim.</hi> The King, whoſe genius ſeemed to apprehend that of the <hi>Souldier,</hi> laboured to hinder this conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deſired to deſtroy him, but could not; for the <hi>Souldier</hi> had too much craft, and dexterity; and he was very well receaved by his General, who ſent him, with ten, or twelve Regiments, to ſurpriſe <hi>Hall,</hi> and keep <hi>Galaſſo,</hi> and <hi>Holck</hi> with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The King being incamped before <hi>Nurenburgh,</hi> had notice from <hi>Wallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteins</hi> Camp neer <hi>Lutzen,</hi> of the departure of him whoſe valour he ſo much eſteemed; and being deſirous to end the difference by a Battail,<note place="margin">The Battail of <hi>Lutzen.</hi>
                     </note> diſpoſed his Army thereto with a ſhort ſpeech; And <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> having diſcovered his intenſion, ſent ſpeedily after <hi>Papenheim,</hi> and reſolved to ſtand faſt, and expect the Enemy. The Shock, or Ouſet was furious, and bloody: The <hi>Croats</hi> did well enough, at the beginning, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> better; and if <hi>Papenheim</hi> had ſtayed a little longer, the Imperialiſts had fled. But, he came time enough,<note place="margin">Papenheim <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                     </note> to redreſſe the Army which already began to ſtagger, and to repulſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: but the ſhot of a <hi>Falkon</hi> (a piece of Ordnance ſo called) put a period to his life, and all his glorious enterprizes. <hi>Germany</hi> hath produced but few ſuch Souldiers as he was for Valour, Felicitie and Courage;<note place="margin">His elogies.</note> and the Emperour hath had few, who have equalled him in fidelity. He firſt made himſelf known, in the <hi>Valtelme;</hi> and at the Battail of <hi>Prague,</hi> he was found amongſt dead. He finiſhed the Tumults of the Peaſants in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and above all after the Battail of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> he redreſſed his Maſters deſperate party in <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> He ſeemed to dye content, when he was told that the King was killed, and it is held, that if he had lived yet ſome years more, he would have reſtored the Imperial Majeſty, to the firſt ſplendour.</p>
                  <p>The Horſe baſely gave ground, as they had done in the firſt Battail. It is beleeved, that the King was ſlaine, about the beginning of the Battail, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receaved five wounds, two whereof were mortal, but it could never be learnt, by whoſe hand he fell, and opinions were ſo different, that the truth could never be diſcovered. The <hi>Swedes</hi> have reported, that he was killed,<note place="margin">Guſtave <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                     </note> by a great Lord of his own Army; others, by <hi>Papenheim:</hi> but neither the one, nor the other is very likely to be true. He was found amongſt the dead, ſo trodden, and tumbled by the Army, which had paſſed over his body, that he was hard to be known. What ſhall we ſay of the potency of this world, ſince ſo much glory, and merit is trodden under foot by horſes? This Prince, who, like another <hi>Alexander,</hi> was grieved, and vexed to ſtay ſo long in <hi>Germany,</hi> and wiſhed nothing more,<note place="margin">His praiſes.</note> then to go ſeek new Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies elſewhere; is borne down, and that ſo venerable Majeſty, ſo much reſpected, and feared every where, is now reduced to duſt: This great Warrier, this invincible Monarch, the delight of the Proteſtants, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Catholicks; the Darling of Fortune: loſt his life in the middle of Triumphs, and of <hi>Germany.</hi> His fall cauſed ſo much rage, and deſpaire, in the ſoules of his ſouldiers, that they choſe rather to die, then retyre; and obliged the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> after they had fought till dark night, to make a retreate, but little more modeſt, then plain flight, towards <hi>Leipſick.</hi>

                  <p>VVHileſt the Princes, and States, which were enemies to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> rejoyced extreamly to ſee the Eagle loſe her ſtrength, under their noſes; by the weakening of ſo many Provinces; by ſo much blood-ſhed; by the totall occupation, or ſeazure of all <hi>Lorraine;</hi> and by ſo many rubs, and traverſes, as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> gave the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> (who yet like a good Phyſician defened her with his forces, and fortified her,<note place="margin">His money from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </note> with his <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> or <hi>liquor of life,</hi> from the <hi>Indies</hi>) it ſeemed high time to that ambitious General, to hatch his perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſignes, for that by ſo many brave actions as he had performed, he thought, he deſerved to wear a Crown, though it were at the charge of his Maſters.</p>
                  <p>Behold here, the moſt ungratefull of mortalls, and the moſt dangerous of all the Emperours enemies, who was likely to have effected alone, that which all the reſt together, had not been able to do. Deſire of revenge, and ambition, made him forget his duty; and cruelty, moved him to undertake this deteſtable Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>He ſent Generall <hi>Holck</hi> into <hi>Miſnia,</hi> who reduced many Towns, and even <hi>Leipſick</hi> it ſelf, for the third time; but a contagious ſickneſſe ſtopped the courſe of his proſperity, and greatneſſe. He was a <hi>Dane</hi> borne, and a Gentleman, that had acquired reputation in <hi>Stralſund,</hi> whereof he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; and after the peace was made, he obtained the honour of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding an Army, in the Emperours ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galaſſo</hi> paſſed into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> not being well ſatisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conditions of Peace,<note place="margin">The <hi>Swedes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated towards <hi>Stenaw</hi> the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>October, 1633.</hi>
                     </note> followed him with the Body of the Army, and employed ſo much promptitude, and addreſſe, that he ſurprized the Enemies near <hi>Stenaw;</hi> defeated the Horſe, (which was much in number) and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Food, which yeelded, and put into his hands above ſix ſcore Colours, with all the Baggage and Artillery. Whereupon all <hi>Sileſia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſubmitted; and it was firmly beleeved, that he endeavoured to bring back the war, to the mouth of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, to recall the <hi>Swedes</hi> to defend that paſſage, by which they entred, and ſent home their booty. But he, on the other ſide, did the direct contrary; and as if he had been vanquiſhed, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from <hi>Pomerania;</hi> and ſent Generall <hi>Henry Count de la Tour,</hi> with <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and his forces, to take up their Winter quarters, in the Emperours He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Lands.</p>
                  <p>Which proceeding amazed the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> gave the <hi>Swedes</hi> time, and means to recollect, and diſcovered to the whole world what he had hatched in his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>None made any profit of this victory, but they of <hi>Colein,</hi> who were much encouraged by it; and conſequently, they declared, that they could not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily the Treaty which they had made with the King of <hi>France,</hi> nor receive any Garriſon of his, into their City; but that he might put four hundred men into <hi>Andernach,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Colonians</hi> will not ratiſy the Agreement made with the King of <hi>France.</hi>

In effect, the Citizens, being ſingularly affected to the Emperour, memeed both the Magiſtrate, and the Clergy it ſelf, to beat them of Town, if there were any more ſpeech of changing their Maſter.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:101836:92"/>
                  <p>Let us now ſhew the tragical end of the ungratefull <hi>Wallenſtein;</hi> for ſince we have already ſeen the recompence of his ſervices, let us alſo publiſh the juſt puniſhment of his crimes, and treaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Biron</hi> was advanced to the high dignity of Marſhall of <hi>France,</hi> to crown his vertnes; and his head was ſtrucken off by the publick Executioner, for having plotted againſt his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>This ſaid <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> (whom the Emperour had made Duke of <hi>Frithland</hi>) collected his forces near <hi>Eguer</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> gave them three moneths pay, and made them take an oath to himſelf, without mentioning the Emperour at all. Thus the <hi>Impoſtume brakes' ambition brought forth Rebellion:</hi> all was diſcovered, and his practice with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> known. But what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for ſo deſperate a buſineſſe?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Weallenſtein</hi>'s deſigns diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> The Veſſel could not chooſe but run aground, when the Pilot himſelf caſt her upon the Sand-bank, and againſt the Rocks. This Traitor had all in his hands; and the Emperour ſeeing that his own ſervants had reſolved his ruine, implored the help of heaven. However, it was thought fit; in this diſorder, to ſend money, to the Garriſon of <hi>Prague,</hi> ſo to be ſure of that, as being the Capitall City of the Kingdom, and to retain the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was ready to march into the Field, with too weak forces. <hi>Frithland</hi> ſent his Brother-in Law Count <hi>Terskie</hi> to <hi>Prague,</hi> but it was too late, for they made him underſtand, that they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge none but the Emperour. Whereupon <hi>our deſign</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, let us pack away, and Joyn with the Swedes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this infamous treaſon was known to <hi>Gordon, Leaſly,</hi> and <hi>Butler;</hi> the two former <hi>Scotch,</hi> and the laſt an <hi>Iriſh Officer;</hi> but all the difficulty was, how to ſtifle it in the Cradle; to which effect, they invited <hi>Terskie, Kinskie, Illaw,</hi> and <hi>Newman,</hi> (all his Creatures) to ſupper,<note place="margin">Supper at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer.</hi>
                     </note> where they took their lives to pay the ſcore, and ſave their Maſter <hi>Ferdinands:</hi> And thus the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie being begun upon them as the Members, muſt be ended upon him, the deteſtable Head; the Commiſſion whereof was faithfully, and laudably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by <hi>Butler,</hi> who thruſting open his dore, and finding him up, ſo ſtaggered and hared him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> maſſacred.</note> that he could not make one word of anſwer to this fatal ſalutation. <hi>Oh Traytour, to the Emperour, and Empyre, art thou there?</hi> And therewith, run him through with his Partizan, ſo that he fell down dead, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſouldier having cruſhed his head, with the But-end of his Musket: took him by the heels, and threw him out at the window.</p>
                  <p>This was the end of this ungratefull Miniſter, who from an ordinary Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, was riſen to ſo much greatneſſe, that he could climbe no higher, without being a Traitour, and a Parricide. As he had done great ſervices, on the one ſide, ſo had he alſo received great recompences, on the other; his Maſter having created him Prince of the Empyre, and made him ſo potent, that he had trouble enough to unmake him again; yea, and much adoe, to ſave both himſelf, and his Houſe, from his cruel perfidie. <hi>Never were Traitours ſeen to make a good end, ambitions perſons fall into the praecipice, which they intend for others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was very much hated, and that chiefly by the Emperours enemies; and yet ſome, to make the Prince odious, have preſumed to excuſe him, as if he had been wrongfully killed. <hi>Men, who are overballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Paſsion, have no ſolid judgment.</hi> It is ſaid of him; that for having only awaked him out of his ſleep, he had cauſed many to be hanged, with this ſentence; <hi>Hang that beaſt:</hi> And yet I ſay, he hath found pennes, which have juſtified his proceedings, and accuſed the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> of cruelty, and ingratitude, But, that <hi>Poliſh</hi> Biſhop, who hath defended him againſt the ſenſe of the very <hi>Swedes,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi>

                     <hi>ULadiſlans</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was, after the death of his brother <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> by the coſent of the Stares and Nobility, preferred to the Throne; and there ſuddenly preſented it ſelf a fair occaſion, to ſignalize the beginning of his Reign, and let the <hi>Polanders</hi> ſee, that he would be the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muſcovits</hi> after having done much ſpoyle in <hi>Lituania,</hi> beſieged the Town of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> the walls whereof are extremely thick. The King ſent his Army thither, and went himſelf ſhortly after, to command it. Great skirmiſhes were made, but ſmall means, to beat up a quarter: whereupon he reſolved to ſtorm two Fortreſſes, or Holds, which were upon the River, and would needs be there himſelf in perſon. The more difficult this Enterpriſe was, the greater was the glory; for, more then ſix thouſand <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covits</hi> were put the ſword. Upon theſe advantages he intrenched himſelf, and not being able to unneſtle them totally from thence, he cut off all their Proviſions, in ſuch ſort, as they quickly found themſelves reduced to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity either of ſtarving,<note place="margin">An Unheard of victory.</note> or rendring themſelves to his mercy. A terrible thing, and not heard of before; that a hundred and twenty thouſand men ſhould bring their Arms, and Colours, and caſt them at the feet of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Prince. This was not a victory, but a monſter of a victory.

                     <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was burnt to the ground, with incredible loſſe. A prodigie, which threatned the <hi>Turkes</hi> with that misfortune which is now befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them.</p>
                  <p>Let us now return into <hi>Holland,</hi> through <hi>England,</hi> where we ſhall finde King <hi>Charles</hi> as much in love with peace, and quiet, as King <hi>Iames</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was.

                  <p>We leſt the Deputies of the Obedient Provinces very buſie: about ſeeking the end of their evills, in a happy peace; but there was a wind, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſprowting forth of this good ſeed.

Her ſubjects expreſſed very great grief, for the departure of ſo good a Mother, by whom they had been ſo gently governed; and that which moſt afflicted them, was to foreſee, that theſe Treaties would produce no good effect, as it was eaſie to judge: for the States ſtood faſt upon impoſſibilities; and theſe could not by any means exclude their Maſter; beſides, the Prince going to beſiege <hi>Rhinbergh,</hi> (which he took in three weeks) made them conceive, that they treated with them almoſt no other wiſe, then Conquerors uſe to do, with ſuch as they have vanquiſhed. For, they offered them conditions of advantage enough, to teſtifie, that their thoughts were very much inclined to peace: but the wind of <hi>France,</hi> quickly cooled that pious heat. <hi>Charnaſſe</hi> made uſe of the two moſt potent wayes in the world, to make this Treaty infructuous; that is, of Eloquence; and of that <hi>divine Mettall,</hi> which <hi>Inpiter</hi> knew to be the ſtrongeſt. In fine, he effected ſo much by his diligent purſuits,<note place="margin">The Treaty of Peace vaniſhes.</note> and ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he brake off the whole match, and brought the States to take Arms again, with his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis of <hi>Aitona</hi> not having force enough to face the Prince before <hi>Rhinbergh,</hi> was content to fortify the <hi>Iſle of Saint Stephen</hi> upon the <hi>Moze,</hi> whereby to have the paſſage free.

For if the Prince had gained it, he had found no reſiſtance; but if he had loſt it, he had left the Conquerours nothing but the glory of having wonne it, without any other profit at all, ſave only (peradventure) of a Town, or two, as <hi>Wenlo,</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remund.</hi>

                  <p>The Prince ſent a ſupply to <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> and retyred himſelf faſter then he came, which cauſed the disbanding of many of his men. And the Marquis haſtened, with three thouſand horſe, to defend the <hi>Iſle of Saint Stephen;</hi> and thus ended the Field of this year of 1633, upon which the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who had committed unknown inſolencies in this Militia, and ſome diſſolutions, which ſpoyled the <hi>Holland</hi> diſcipline, repaſſed the <hi>Rheyn;</hi> as the Imperialiſts on the other ſide, alſo did.

I know, there were ſome who beleeved, that he was the firſt, who diſcovered to his friend, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Emperour, the Treaſon, which the Duke of <hi>Frithlund</hi> had brewed againſt him.

                  <p>Such as would be compriſed in this Agreement, were obliged to give their forces to the Emperour their Head, under paine of being declared
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101836:96"/>Enemies to the Empire; and ſo they reſolved (though many of them with grudging) to enter this holy Temple of Peace: from which yet (ſince they could not force it) many of them flinched afterwards upon the firſt occaſion, with greater animoſities then ever, as we will ſhortly demonſtrate. A Peace conſtrained, is like a rapid Brook, which may be ſtopped for a time, by a ſtrong Dam, or Sluce; though at length, it either peirce it, or flow over it.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes of <hi>Meckelemburgh</hi> were pardoned, and re-inveſted in their Dutchyes: And all participated of this common Good, ſave onely the Lands which had been occupated, or ſeized on by the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi>

                     </note> who not having been able to recover what his Anceſtours had loſt, caſt his eyes upon the <hi>Flower de Luce;</hi> whoſe favour with that King, had kindled a great jealouſie in the Electors Soul, which turned into hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as it appeared in the continuation of the War.</p>
                  <p>The ſcatterings of this Army rallyed neer <hi>Francfurt;</hi> and the <hi>Ryngrave,</hi> who had had his ſinger in the pye, and ſaved himſelfe by ſwimming, was there, with the Great Chanceller <hi>Oxenſtern,</hi> who did all he could, to hinder this Peace, or re-Union of the Members with their Head. For, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that being the Queens Lieutennant, the direction of the Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him: but neither his arguments, nor any ſuch as ſounded like them, could be heard. Indeed, if we muſt ſeek the juſtice of a Cauſe, in good ſucceſſe, and argument; the complaints of the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeemed, in ſome ſort lawful, and the reproaches which they caſt upon the <hi>Germans,</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a ſtrong reſentment. <hi>Is this the recompence</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>of ſo many labours, and troubles as we have ſuffered, and ſo many Battels as we have hazarded for your liberty? Do you make us this ungrateful payment, for the blood which we have ſhed, and for the life which our King hath loſt, to free you from the oppreſſion of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>and ſave your Religion? How will you endure to hear, that they who have been your Deliverers, ſhall be called your Enemies?</hi> Theſe notes rung loude every where, and found both the eares, and the hearts, of a multitude of Proteſtants open, to produce a ſeed, the bitterneſſe whereof was ſoon taſted; however they had to do with a Nation, which was but too grateful, and acknowledging.</p>
                  <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> both in his own name, and that of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Body, offered them a hundred thouſand <hi>Rix-Dollars</hi> for a reward, and ordered them to withdraw;<note place="margin">A reward offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.</note> but they would have more, and ſtay'd hankering, and hunting after many difficulties; for they ſaw, that they had yet many good Towns, and Provinces; and that the whole Empire was not able to beat them out of <hi>Pomerania.</hi> They had the Allyance of <hi>France;</hi> the affections of the people; yea, and of ſome Princes alſounder hand, who had ſigned the Peace, but by conſtraint, and with regret.

There is colluſion, and cheate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well in <hi>Germany,</hi> as in other Nations; and <hi>Macchiavels</hi> leſſons are very much practiced there, in this Age.</p>
                  <p>The Chanceller <hi>Oxenſtern,</hi> environed by a great number of Counts, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and great Lords, kept his Court at <hi>Francfurt;</hi> but finding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Conquerours, he made a ſtronger Allyance with the King of <hi>France;</hi> put <hi>Philipſburgh,</hi> and all that, which the <hi>Swedes</hi> held thereabouts, into his hands, for a huge ſumme of money, and retired himſelfe, with <hi>Rautzaw,</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> into <hi>Sweden;</hi> having ſent before his departure, his Traine of a hundred and fifty brave horſes for breed, into <hi>Pomerania;</hi> which fell all into his Enemies hands.</p>

                  <p>THe King, being irritated by the loſſe of this moſt important Place, and for that his protection had not been ſufficient to cover the Elector of <hi>Trevirs;</hi> ſent to re-demand him from the <hi>Cardinal Infanto;</hi> who anſwered him, that he could hot diſpoſe of ſuch a buſineſſe, without the knowledge, and conſent, of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spana:</hi> which anſwer not pleaſing him, and finding no hope of any orther; he reſolved to declare war againſt the ſaid <hi>Infanto,</hi> under this ſpecions pretext.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> declares war upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                     </note> Now, in regard that this War'v as derived, like a contagion, from that of <hi>Germany,</hi> by which, as by a great fire, all the circumjacent parts were ſo ſcotched, that they kindled with the firſt winde: we will returne again to the Source.</p>
                  <p>The Civil Wars (as we have already ſhewed) ſtopped the motion of thoſe old quarrels, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was diverted from them, by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death. But the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> having well weighed the ſtrength of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the furious ſhocks or foiles ſhe had ſuſtained, conceived that it was now time, to make her fall: for he was fully confirmed, that ſome Provinces (as that of <hi>Flanders, Artoiſe,</hi> and <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>) had formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon <hi>France:</hi> howheit King <hi>Francis</hi> had renounced his propriety in them for all perpetuity, by way of Ranſome from his captivity; which the <hi>French</hi> themſelves do not deny; but they ſay, <hi>that the Kings cannot alienate the Rights of the Crown.</hi> If ſo, how can there be any firme, and ſure Treaty made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. For, there may as much be ſaid, of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Princes; and ſo it will be a buſineſſe without end. But it might with more equity be alleadged, that in regard they loſt thoſe Rights by arms, a hundred years agoe, they may upon a faire occaſion, endeavour to recover them by the ſame means.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:101836:98"/>
                  <p>Now in theſe ſo confuſed embaraſsments, there might ſome pretext be found, which might, perhaps, be rendred juſt by the lot of Arms: and that of the Elector made all the <hi>French</hi> murmure nor was there ever a fairer opportunity, to beat out the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and therefore it was not fit to neglect it. However the <hi>Spaniards</hi> rejected it, and affirmed that they were punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informed, that the King had ſigned the League for the <hi>Offenſive war</hi> with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> at the <hi>Loivire,</hi> upon the eighth of March, at ſeven of the clock in the Evening: Inſuch fort, as though they had not taken the Elector, they were nevertheleſſe ſure of a War fifteen dayes after, as by conſequence they had.</p>
                  <p>They would not make mention, of many frontier Towns, which the <hi>French</hi> had attempted to ſurprize by treachery, as <hi>Cambray,</hi> and <hi>Graveling,</hi> to the Governour whereof they offered a hundred thouſand Piſtols. All which infractions they had prudently diſſembled, to keep that part of the Country in quiet. Neither was it the vanity of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> were to ſcuffle with a Nation, which is not ſtartled at noiſe.

                  <p>They of <hi>Hannaw,</hi> went more cunningly to work, and put three Barks loaden with proviſions, into their Town, which paſſed before <hi>Mentz,</hi> with a <hi>Burgundian Croſſe,</hi> and two ſouldiers clad like Monks, thereby to cozen their enemies. <hi>It is not the Habit which makes the Monk.</hi> This Euterpriſe iſſuted well, but the ſecond was not ſo happy; and ſo the <hi>French</hi> were conſtrained to render this good place, into the hands of the Imperialiſts.</p>

                  <p>THE Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſecond, feeling himſelf debilitated in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by the burthen of ſo many years, and ſo many Warrs, as whereby he had been tormented; took nothing more to heart, then the meanes, how to provide for the eſtabliſhment of that Empire, which <hi>Domeſtick</hi> partialities, ſeconded by the ambition of Strangers, had much ſhaken. Holy thoughts, and worthy of ſuch a Pilot, as merited to govern ſuch a ſhip, in a ſtorme, which threatened this great world with deſtruction. But it had paſſed the bounds of all Juſtice; the great Sun-dyal of the Sea, had no more ſtrength; recourſe muſt be made to the Stars, to implore their aſſiſtance, and direction for fear of making Shipwrack, by the extraordinary violence of the windes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was gratiouſly heard, againſt the expectation of his enemies, whoſe practiſes were faine to give way, to the incomprehenſible decrees, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence.</p>
                  <p>He called a Diet at <hi>Ratiſbone,</hi> and ſent for the Electour of <hi>Trevirs,</hi> who was priſoner in the Low-countries.<note place="margin">The aſſembly at <hi>Ratiſbone 1636. Ferdinand</hi> the third, King of the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here we may admire the ſtupendious, and ſupernaturall effects of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, in this Prince; who, by the good ſucceſſe, and proſperity of his Lieutenants, maintained his Scepter, directly, and indirectly, at ſeveral times, and all together, againſt almoſt all the world. For, he was no ſooner Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> then that people revolted, and choſe another. When he was Emperour, he had the ſeditions of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and of his own ſubjects in <hi>Auſtria, Mansfedt,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Halberſtadt,</hi> never lelt to hate him, nor ceaſed to hurt him, till they ceaſed to live. The <hi>Danes</hi> provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his Arms, and felt the effects thereof. The <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> conſpired againſt him. In fine, the <hi>Swedes,</hi> with an Army of ſix thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under the conduct of Marquis <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> body; and the <hi>French,</hi> by the profuſion of their Treaſures, and the effuſion of ſo much bood, openly manifeſted the deſire they had, to pul the Crown from his head; or at leaſt, to take it away from his Houſe: nor was it enough, to excite the Peaſans, but they muſt alſo corrupt the faith of that impertinent General. In a word, this poor Prince was no ſooner got out of one War, then there ſprung up two other; and the weapons whereof he ſerved himſelfe in theſe extremities, were the prayers he daily addreſſed to God; which King <hi>Guſtave</hi> ſeemed more to apprehend, then he did all his Armies.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:101836:103"/>
                  <p>He experimented the Arms of the <hi>Tuks, Catholicks, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates;</hi> over all which he triumphed, ſaw his Sonne Crowned King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in deſpight of all his enemies; the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhut up in <hi>Pomeranta;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> beaten out of <hi>Germany;</hi> yea, and his own Army, together with that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> almoſt at the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> a year before his death. He was a ſo mild a Prince, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves found nothing to blame in him, but that he hearkened too much to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and that he was too zealous for the Reformation. Strong reaſons for them to revolt,<note place="margin">Very zealous for the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and call in the <hi>Swedes:</hi> but they had cauſe to repent afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Let us now drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and hear the complaints of the Imperaliſts, upon the diſorder of their Army, for want of bread.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> had formerly taken the Town of <hi>Luneburgh,</hi> and put the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Altar of Gold to Ranſom. Duke <hi>George</hi> beſieged it in Auguſt, and carried it, in September following: but General <hi>Bannier</hi> cauſed the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be beheaded, for not having done his duty. <hi>Galaſſo</hi> marched out of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Elbe; Glitznigh</hi> the General of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> ſtormed <hi>Gariz;</hi> and he of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Varnemont</hi> neer <hi>Roſtock;</hi> where he loſt his life.</p>
                  <p>Now, who would believe, that the <hi>Swedes,</hi> being forſaken in apparence, by all the States of <hi>Germany;</hi> droven back to the <hi>Baltick ſea;</hi> beaten in many Encounters; deſpoiled of the Iſle of <hi>

But General <hi>Hats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felds</hi> ſickneſſe made them take courage; though General <hi>Bredaw</hi> defeated them, and made them ſtart back again into theit Iſlands. And yet all this was not able to hinder them from afflicting <hi>Germany</hi> yet more, and that with more confuſion, then it had been before. The feaver required yet greater blood-lettings, which made this Body, once ſo puiſſant, and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, grow faint, and languiſh.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was not enough afflicted yet, by ſo many loſses, and ſo many Plots, and Treaſons; but ſhe muſt be yet more tottered by other diſaſters, and rebellions. <hi>Spain,</hi> was indeed within her ſingers breadth of deſtruction, by the revolts, which are yet in durance, and which, it was believed, would make her looſe the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and her States in <hi>Italy.</hi> But, as a great Oak, agitated by the windes, reſiſts ſtrongly, and raiſes it ſelf up againſt them; juſt ſo does this Houſe, which men labour in vain, to overthrow. For there are too many Allyes to maintain her. It is in the deepeſt misfortunes, that ſhe ſhewes leaſt apprehenſion; and in the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers, that ſhe makes her valour known.</p>
                  <p>This year of 1640, was almoſt fatall to her, by the defection of <hi>Catalunia, Portugal,</hi> and part of the <hi>Indies;</hi> the loſs of <hi>Arras,</hi> and the unhappy ſucceſs of her <hi>Arms</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> beſides the approach of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> war, to the bank of the <hi>Danub.</hi> Let us take notice in due order, as much as brevity will permit us, of the motives of theſe ſtirres.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, (who now reignes in <hi>Spain</hi>) being a milde Prince, and a little more addicted to his pleaſures, then the ſtate of his affaires requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, left the adminiſtration thereof to the Count of <hi>Olivares,</hi> who (as chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges grow not without a cauſe) rendred himſelf odious, to almoſt all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Subjects; yea, and complaints came of him, even from the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> themſelves: beſides, that the Grandies, who ordinarily pry upon all occaſions to get themſelves rid of a potent Miniſter; ſo well fomented the grievances of the people, that they brought them to open revolt, upon theſe pretexts.</p>
                  <p>He had great forces, of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Walloons</hi> in <hi>Catalunia,</hi> ordered to guard that Province, againſt the invaſion of the <hi>French.</hi> But Rule, and Diſcipline was not ſo exactly kept, but that the licentiouſneſs of the ſouldiers, made the Inhabitants murmur; who ſuddenly riſing up in Arms, ſlew their Gueſts, and beat ſuch as came to revenge the ſedition: Yea, upon <hi>Corpus Chriſts-day</hi> it ſelf,<note place="margin">The revolt of the Cataluni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, <hi>1640.</hi>
                     </note> they cruelly murthered their Governour. <hi>With a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous people, there is nothing ſacred, no more then there is reaſon.</hi> The King was not able to ſtop this torrent by mildneſs, and clemency; and ſo ſince the Sluce was broaken, the water muſt be let run. For the very Biſhops, and Prieſts themſelves, wore plain Incendiaries; and <hi>Don Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Margarita,</hi> with ſome other great perſons, made them ſubtract themſelves from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Prince, to embrace the protection of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain great Politician of this Age, diſcourſing one day upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaid, that the <hi>Catalunian</hi> took Armes for their Priviledges, and to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by a Nation, which made profeſsion of obſerving none at all. The Marſhall of <hi>Schoonbergh,</hi> deſirous to advantage himſelt by this occaſion, offered them his forces, and obliged them to ſend their Deputies to the King, to conclude a Treaty.</p>
                  <p>Fortune was not leſſe adverſe to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Marquis of <hi>Leganez</hi> had beſieged <hi>Caſſal,</hi> a fatall place to them, and an unhappy ſiege, for this third cime. For the brave Count of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> brother to the Duke <hi>d'Elbenf,</hi> and of the generous blood of the <hi>Guiſards,</hi> (who had done that Kingdom ſo many ſervices) haſtened thither, with a leſſe and weaker Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101836:107"/>attacked them, in their Trenches, and after two ſeveral repulſes,<note place="margin">The Spainiards beaten before <hi>Caza.</hi>
                     </note> fell on again, killed above four thouſand men, put in as much relief as he would; and forced this ſo provident and cautious Nation, to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
                  <p>Let no body ſay now. <hi>That the French are not valiant, but in the firſt fury, in which they are more then men, and in continuance, leſſe then women.</hi> For, this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious action being conducted by one of the moſt ſtrenuous men of his Time, deſcended from a Houſe which hath alwayes ſwarmed with brave Captains, and others; declares the contrary. They know how to fight, and when they are broken, to rally, and carry away the victory.</p>
                  <p>After this miracle, he wrought yet another, which could not be done, but by a<note n="*" place="margin">Hyperbole. The Count of <hi>Haicourts</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, who takes <hi>Turin.</hi>
                     </note> Saint full of merits, and it was this. He beſieged <hi>Turin,</hi> where Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> Uncle to the Duke, whom he would diſpoſſeſs, commanded. The Marquis of <hi>Leganez</hi> attacked him, and pierced through his Lines, but the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which were entered, could not get out again; in ſuch ſort, as that all their victuals being conſumed, they were forced to ſubmit to an enemy, who was weaker then themſelves. Which glorious exploits of his, redreſſed that State, when it was going to ruine; made him admired, and reputed by all men for one of the beſt Captains in the world, and the <hi>French</hi> Nation for brave ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Wherefore the Cardinal could do no leſſe, then cheriſh ſuch a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, and ſo by conſequence, he honoured him with his Allyance.</p>
                  <p>Their victory obtained in the the Low-Countries was not of leſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, nor leſs famous for the difficulties, which they encountered therein. The Marſhalls of <hi>Chaunts, Chairiſlon,</hi> and <hi>Meillieraye,</hi> made a ſhew of going to beſiege <hi>Marienburgh,</hi> (where two <hi>German Canoneers</hi> ſet the powder on fire) but ſuddenly wheeled about towards <hi>Arras,</hi>

                  <p>The Cardinal <hi>Infanto,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and ſix Generals more, with an Army of thirty thouſand men, went to viſit them, with intention to make them ſorry for their temerity. Wherefore they pitched their Camp upon <hi>Mount</hi> Saint <hi>Eloy,</hi> near the way where the Proviſions were to paſs: ſo that the Beſiegers were in worſe condition, then the Beſieged; for all the ſmall Convoyes were beaten, and a pound of bread was worth forty<note n="*" place="margin">Pence.</note> 
                     <hi>Solls,</hi> and more</p>
                  <p>Upon notice given, that the great Convoy was almoſt ready, the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> went, and ruined above a thouſand Wagons, at the very Gates of <hi>Dourlens,</hi> and returned victorious to the Camp. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very buſie in conſultation, about what good reſolution they were to take. The great Convoy advanced, and <hi>La Meillieraye</hi> went to meet it, with fiſteen thouſand men. The <hi>Infanto</hi> being adviſed by ſome, to make a firm ſtand, and fight it (though it were guarded with above twenty thouſand men) choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to attack a quarter; which, had it been done two houres ſooner, as it was concluded, the Town had undoubtedly been ſuccoured. However, they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded pretty well, and were already become Maſters of a Fort, but the bickering happened in a part, from whence they were repulſed, with great ſlaughter, and at the ſame inſtant, arrived the Convoy, which dulled the heat of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the deſire in the Beſieged to make any further defence; and ſhewed beſides, that the moſt conſiderate, and adviſed, are often deceived, and that the greateſt wits incurre the foul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </argument>
                  <p>GOod Mariners very often foreſee a great Storme, in a great Calme. In high proſperity, we muſt apprehend ſome misfortunes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previſed, will be leſſe able to hurt, by meanes of the preventive reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which may be procured.</p>
                  <p>This potent Miniſter, during the time of good ſucceſſe, had his eyes upon the Poupe of that vaſt Veſſel, the government whereof he had in his hands, thereby to obſerve which way the Tempeſt might chance to come. He eaſily diſcovered by the diſcontentment of ſome certaine Princes, a kinde of fog, which by condenſing, might cauſe a furious blaſt. <hi>It is not ſufficient, to know what paſſes, but to foreſee alſo what is to come.</hi> Wherefore he ſecretly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Duke of <hi>Lorraines</hi> pulſe to be felt, and laboured to untie him from the intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> by rendring him his States. The Duke, who had ſo often experimented his pranks, and who never had any other then good thoughts for <hi>France</hi> (and never changed them, till he ſaw, that they endeavoured to deprive him of his Dutchy) liſtened to the overtures made him; received the Promiſes, which were ſent him ſigned to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for his entire re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; and thereupon, departed towards <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was received with much honour (more then a hundred and fifty Coaches going to meet him) and the King expreſſed great kindneſſe,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> goes into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </note> and benevolence to him. They would make him ſweare to the Treaty, and yet they would keep <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> for a pledge of his promiſe. So that, the poor Prince, perceiving the Cardinals jugglings, and the averſion of the Courtiers; diſſembled ſome affronts, and endeavoured to withdraw himſelfe thence, to returne into <hi>Lorraine.</hi> For, they would needs ingage him againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which he neither could, nor would do. The <hi>Cardinal,</hi> conceiving that he would not be able to do any harme, nor finde any credit, in the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuffered him to go. A piece of cunning, whereby he had couzened many.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the diſcontented Princes contracted forces at <hi>Sedan;</hi> with whom the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Princes at <hi>Sedan.</hi>
                     </note> (having already gotten a ſmall body of an Army on foot) refuſed to joyne, but kept his word with the King: But ſeeing, that <hi>La Motte,</hi> and ſome other ſmall Places, were not reſtored him, and that he was but ſcoffed at by them; at length, full of generous reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and zeal of revenge, he caſt himſelfe again into the intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> with intention to remaine therein, till a General Peace.</p>
                  <p>Why would they needs retaine <hi>Nancy?</hi> What aſſurance could he have, of the reſtitution? And what hope, or apparence of conſtraining ſo great a Monarch to render it to him, if he were untyed from the <hi>Spaniards?</hi> If, when he was re-eſtabliſhed, he ſhould not keep his word (whereof yet there was no doubt at all) the King had but too much means, with the forces in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to make him repent himſelfe of any ſuch light Change. No, no; had it not been for the full reſtitution of his Country, he would not have gone from <hi>Bruſsels;</hi> and had they performed what they promiſed him, he would have lived in pence, and quiet, with his Subjects. But ſuch
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101836:109"/>as penetrated into this Miniſters deſignes, ſaw well enough, that they would never render it him, becauſe they intended to adde to <hi>France,</hi> ſuch other Conqueſts as they had already made, and hoped to make, in <hi>Germany.</hi> Thoſe Writers, who flattered the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and accuſed the Duke of levity; either did not, or would not, know the bottome of the buſineſſe, and had a minde, to make men believe, that a Prince ought to want reſentment, and intereſt, when they break their word with him: in order whereunto, I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the example of ſome others, if it might be done without offence.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the ſeaſon permitted, the King of <hi>France</hi> put a ſtrong Army into the Field,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ayre</hi> beſieged, and taken.</note> under the command of Marſhal <hi>de la Meillieraye,</hi> who took ſome ſmall places (as the <hi>Iſlers</hi>) and laid Siege to <hi>Ayre,</hi> a ſtrong Town in the Province of <hi>Artoiſe;</hi> but the ſtrength thereof, ſerved for nothing, but to kindle the generous courage of the <hi>French,</hi> who, notwithſtanding all the deſences both within, and without, took it in leſte then two moneths 1641.</p>

                  <p>The Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> a Prince of the Blood, having received au affront at the Siege of <hi>Corbie,</hi> and many other at the Court, too ſenſible to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; removed himſelfe, and retired to <hi>Sedan;</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> came to him; and all complaining of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> unjuſt Miniſtery, and of the oppreſſion of the Kingdom; they publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> containing their complaints, and the ſubject for which they took Arms, which was for the peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the expulſion of him, who fomented the War.</p>

                     <p>Whether the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> aſpire to the univerſal Monarchy; and whether the reaſons of ſuch as accuſe her thereof, be ſufficient, or no. Why <hi>France</hi> retains <hi>Lorraine.</hi>

                     </gap>erably torne; for the onely finding of the truth whereof, we will anſwer thoſe arguments of a certaine modrene writer.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101836:110"/>to think of a deſigne ſo ful of chimera's as this. For we muſt ſecure what we have, from peril, before we ſeek more.</p>

                     <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, is the principal object of his propoſitions, and over whom he labours to triumph. But I ſtay not upon words; I come to effects, which make us judge of unknown cauſes: The advantage which Fortune gave this ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> upon <hi>Francis</hi> his Competitour for the Empire, made him obtain the Renunciation of the <hi>Fiefs,</hi> or hereditary Titles, which the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> had, upon ſome Provinces in the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> though the reſtitution of the Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>chy of <hi>Burgandy,</hi> the patrimony of his Grand-Mother <hi>Mary of Valois,</hi> did not follow his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The many victories he got in <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> crowned his head, and more glorifyed his memory, then amplifyed his States. He bought the Soveraignty of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trick,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Guelders.</hi> That of <hi>Milan</hi> was carryed by Arms, and juridically diſputed. Had he aſpired to the univerſal Monarchy, he would not certainly have been diverted, by ſome ſmall croſſes of Fortune; but, on the other ſide, being ſome moneths elder then <hi>Henry</hi> the Great was, when he prepared himſelf to give his Enemies a furious ſhake; this great Monarch, (invincible to all but himſelf) ſtripped himſelf of ad, to chooſe a privat life.</p>
                  <p>His Sonne <hi>Philip,</hi> found by the Warrs of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> that his life would be too ſhort, to ſee the termination of them; and as for his meddling with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> the effects thereof have declared, that it was more through paſſion of Religion, then to acquire the poſſeſſion of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If the ſaid Houſe, being conſidered all together, had had this deſigne, ſhe would have endeavoured to retain the conqueſts which ſhe made in the North, which upon occaſion, would have opened her the paſſage to other. Beſides that, ſhe hath always reſtored ſuch States as ſhe hath purchaſed by quarrels, both in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elſewhere; in ſuch ſort, as that I ſee not by what means, and in how many Ages, ſhe would be able to reach to this pretended Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>But, upon what Branch of this Family, ſhal this Monarchy be placed? Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that of <hi>Germaty?</hi> The Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> could not endure to ſee (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the report of that learned writer) the Imperial Crown, upon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers head, becauſe he would rather have had it, upon his Sonnes; and the <hi>Germans</hi> will not ſee it upon that of a <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How then, ſhall theſe inſtruments be tuned? I conclude, that ſhe hath been moved to act by Intereſt only, to uphold her ſelf, and not to hunt aſter this chimericall Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours which have been ſince, have manifeſted no exceſs of ambition; and <hi>Philip</hi> the third made no ſtir at all. So that it muſt be either <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſaid <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſecond, had War with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> every one knows for what. He would have the three Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Townes; had he not right to them? The Victories he got in <hi>Low-Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> moved him to reſtore, and re-eſtabliſhed his Authority there; was he out of reaſon? Here-demanded, as Soveraign Judge, the Eceleſiaſticall Lands, and Goods, according to the tenour of the contract at <hi>Paſſavia;</hi> was he ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded? The <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves will not ſay ſo. Shall we therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Houſe to ſwallow up all? Now it is, that we muſt have recourſe to the intereſt; which every body ought to have in commendation, and not ſtray from the path of Juſtice.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:101836:110"/>
                  <p>As for Hypocriſiy, whereof he accuſes them of this Family, by comparing their piety to the colours of the Rain-bow, which are but deceipts and illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is acalumnie, which confutes it ſelf, and a malice convinced by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who have frequented the Imperiall Court,<note place="margin">A calumny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</note> and have wiſhed, that all the Courts of the Proteſtant Princes were regulated like that. Indeed, the words which he uſes, to cure (as he ſayes) the mindes of ſuch as are praeoccupated by errour, are not ſtrong enough, to make them paſſe for good, even in his own opinion. For, a <hi>may be</hi> cannot form a determinate truth, of future things.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is not my intention, to approve all the actions of this Houſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her ends; and much leſſe, to deliver the Bordering Princes, from the fear which they may have, of her greatneſſe; by the refutation of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but only freely, and plainly to lay open the juſtice of her Arms, and the ſtrong neceſſity of her intereſts, to maintain her ſelf, againſt ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I combat no Soveraign Family, but reverence them all, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and praeoccupation. I only demonſtrate the practices, cheateries, and effects of ambition, together with thoſe of ſelf-advantage, which render whole Provinces deſert, and breed general calamities.</p>
                  <p>In the Treaty of peace at <hi>Manſter,</hi> we ſhall diſcover the intentions of all the Princes, without amuſing our ſelves any more, with the words of intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Clarks.

But, ſhe will not let <hi>Lorrain</hi> go, in regard of her conqueſts made in <hi>Germany,</hi> and becauſe the Princes of that Country, being divided into Parties, are not ſourgent for the reſtitution of the loſſes of their Neighbours, as thoſe others are.</p>

                     <hi>France</hi> calls the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and all ſuch as are tyed to her intereſts, her Enemies; and in regard that this irreconcitiable-hatred is not very ancient; we ſhall quickly finde out the ſource thereof.</p>

                     <p>Of the Warre of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with all the circumſtances thereof.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NEver did Fortune more undertake the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Intereſt, then in this War; and never was good King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in more danger of being ſtripped of his States, then in this perillous conjuncture. It is ſaid, that that great Aſtrologer <hi>Ticho Brahe</hi> had foretold him, that he ſhould be droven out of his Kingdome; that he ſhould depart with a ſtaffe in his hand, and that this immutable fate ſhould defal him, in the moneth of <hi>Jannary,</hi> in the year 1644. I know not, whether this report be true; but ſure I am, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was falſe; though yet, there were once very great apparence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that it would come to paſs. For, had the <hi>Swedes</hi> been able to ſnap the ſhips and Barks, which were in a certain haven of that Province, as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was to do; they would eaſily have entred into the Iſle of <hi>Fune,</hi> and craſtily rendred themſelves maſters of the whole Kingdom, at unawares, and without ſtriking ſtroake.<note place="margin">The war of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> againſt the <hi>Dams.</hi>
                     </note> But the moſt premeditated Enterprizes, are ſometimes hindred, and overthrown, by a meer matter of nothing: for the Soule of great deſignes, is ſilence; and he who knows not how to keep that, will never bring any thing to good effect. The <hi>Swedes</hi> fayled not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but God only, made them faile.</p>
                  <p>The King was ſtrucken with as much amazement at the firſt notice of this invaſion, as it a thunderbolt had fallen upon his head; and writing to his Reſident at the <hi>Haghe,</hi> he commanded him to tell the <hi>States General,</hi> that this irruption ſeemed ſo ſtrange to him,<note place="margin">And why.</note> that he would father have believed, that the Sky would fall, then that he ſhould ſee the <hi>Swedes</hi> enter into his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. But what could move the <hi>Swedes</hi> to begin a new War, having ſo great a one already in <hi>Germany;</hi> and knowing, that this latter endangered the loſſe of all their conqueſts, yea, of their very Kingdom it ſelf? For, the reaſons, which they alledged, of the ſtopping, and viſiting ſome of their ſhips, are neither valid, nor ſufficient; and therefore we will ſhew ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Swedes</hi> conſented thereto; and the Emperour, being much troubled, at this too long, and too bloody dance, very freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended, and accepted him for Judge. <hi>Munſter</hi> was choſen for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and the Embaſſadours were invited thither. The King ſent his; and wrought ſo far with the Emperour, that he withdrew his Garriſon from <hi>Wolfenbottel,</hi> and rendred it to the Duke of <hi>Lune burgh.</hi> This gave the <hi>Swedes</hi> jealouſie, as imagining, that the King was more affected to the Emperour, then to them; and that he would infallibly make them let go their prize. In ſuch ſort, as that, in ſtead of ſending their Embaſſadours to <hi>Munſter,</hi> they ſent their Armies into his territories; as alſo Commiſſion into <hi>Holland,</hi> to hire ſhips, and raiſe Sea-men, whereof that little Province is the Nurſery.</p>

He ſurpriſed <hi>Kiel</hi> whileſt the Marohants, and Gentry were aſſembled there; took away the money; paſſed on further, and ſeazed, with facility enough,<note place="margin">The <hi>Swedes</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupats <hi>Intland.</hi>

                  <p>The King provided the ſmall Iſle of <hi>Fune;</hi> intrenched the approaches, and made all take arms, who were able to beare them; ſo that <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> was repulſed with loſſe, as often as he offered to paſſe. In the interim, the King applyed all his thoughts to the Sea; prepared a little Fleet, and went with it before <hi>Gotemburgh;</hi> and having given charge to make a greater, he diſtributed Patents for the raiſing of men; and diſpatched his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours towards the Emperour, to implore his aſſiſtance, in a farre greater danger, then that of the year 1628. He complained of this invaſion, to all Neighbours, Friends, and Allyes; and informed them, that they made war upon him in full peace, and without having denounced it before.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> in the meane while, got ground in their Enemies Country; and <hi>Coninxmarck</hi> ſubjugated the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Bremen,</hi>

Nor was there need of any other exhortations, then his example; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could have loſt his courage by ſeeing him act, would have deſerved to looſe his life.

                  <p>The <hi>Dunkerekers,</hi> being conſiderable at Sea, offered to maintain at their own charge, a Fleet of a hundred Ships, and Frigots; as well to defend the <hi>Sownd,</hi> as to offend, in all the Ports of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and that the King might onely keep the ſaid Streight, with his own, and forty of their Ships againſt all ſuch as ſhould come from <hi>Holland.</hi> To which Leagve he much inclined, as finding himſelfe ſtrong enough to attack <hi>Guſtave Horne;</hi> and the Imperialiſts able, with ſome forces, to ſtop <hi>Torſtenſons</hi> paſſage; who could neither aſſault any more places, nor hold thoſe he had taken, if he were compelled to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into a poſture of defence.</p>
                  <p>The Embaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> repreſented to him, the danger there was for him to involue himſelfe in ſuch an Allyance, not forgetting the old argument, that that formidable <hi>Houſe,</hi> which was in her decline, and had alwayes aſpired to the Univerſal Monarchy; ſought no other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſet her ſelfe up again, and make his Kingdom the ſeate of the war.

                  <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet eſcaped without any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and got into the maine.

However, it is not my deſign to refute that opinion, which refutes it ſelf; but I remain within the limits of that war, and in great amazement, to ſee the <hi>Swedes,</hi> at one, and the ſame time, at the Gates of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna, Copenhaghen,</hi> and <hi>Bremen,</hi> every where tredding down their Enemies.</p>

I ſhould never have done, if I ſhould particularize upon ſo many takings of Towns; ſo many furprizes, and encounters; ſo many Provinces grown deſert, and ſo much poverty, by continuall invaſions: but it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces me to note the Fields, and Battails.

And they, who walked a ſlow pace, and obſerved the falling back of the <hi>French</hi> (with their bravado of ſaying that this Field would make them Maſters of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the next after, of all <hi>Holland</hi>) judged by the raſh diſcourſe of the Souldiers, of the intention of their Maſter, and ſhewed themſelves very cold, in the purſuance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, to come to the concluded Stake ſharing; for in this knot it is, that the beſt friends become foes; and this was the ſtumbling-block, as it ſhall ſhortly appeare.</p>

This generous Prince gave ſo many teſtimonies of his valour, in ſo many perilous Sieges, that he made himſelf admired by all the world.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Arms of <hi>France</hi> had better luck in <hi>Catalunia;</hi> where the Marſhall of <hi>Schoonbergh</hi> recompenced the loſs which the Count of <hi>Harcoart</hi> made in raiſing the Siege of <hi>Lerida,</hi> in doing the like for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> before <hi>Flix,</hi> and by eaſily taking <hi>Tortoza,</hi>

                  <p>In ſine, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt the Battail, and had almoſt loſt the Imperiall Prince too, had he not been ſuccoured by the Prince of <hi>Ligne,</hi>

                     <p>The Peace made betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated States. The remarkable Siege of <hi>Brin. Torſtenſon</hi> quits the <hi>Generalate.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe laſt Field, having produced no remarkable effect at all, was taken by many, as the ſhooting off of a Musket, without a bullet, rather to content the Allyes, then to advance upon the enemy; rather to drive away the time, then to make uſe of advantages; and rather to tyre the <hi>French,</hi> then to come to ſhare ſtakes with them. Indeed, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had a fine game of it; for the enemy, not being able almoſt to ſtoop, was fain to avow, that all their defences being taken away in <hi>Flanders,</hi> they had nothing more left to oppoſe againſt them, then the Walls of <hi>Amwerp, Gaunt,</hi> and <hi>Bridges;</hi> for <hi>Guelders</hi> was half conquered, <hi>Brabant</hi> open, and <hi>Flanders</hi> almoſt quite ſubjugated; ſo that there remained but one and the laſt Bowt to come to the ſharing of ſtakes.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the Embaſſadours which laſt arrived, were the firſt diſpatched; for they found ſo much inclination in them of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Propoſition for a Truce, being changed into that of a Peace, all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were granted them. In ſuch ſort, as more then a twelve moneths time was ſpent, in attending and uniting the two Parties; howbeit they had brought them ſo far already, that whatſoever the <hi>French</hi> had gotten by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and other enemies, was to remain as their own for perpetuity; and they had confirmed it amongſt them, by a ſure, and faſt League; in order to which <hi>Monſieur de Seruient</hi> had taken great pains at the <hi>Haghe;</hi> yea, he indevoured, under this pretext, to draw the States to a continuation of the war,<note place="margin">The Peate made between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                     </note> and the utter expulſion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> and therefore it was no marvaile, if Prince <hi>William</hi> leaned that way with him. For this young Eagle, being newly received as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Captain Generall, deſired to accompliſh, what his Predeceſsors had begun. But <hi>Seruient</hi> found himſelf repugned by ſuch as had power, and was not able to hinder (however his arguments ſufficiently incumbred the Colledge) but the Peace, which was ſigned at <hi>Munſter</hi> the 8. of <hi>January,</hi> was ratified at the <hi>Haghe,</hi> publiſhed at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and proclaimed through all the Towns, and Villages of this puiſſant, and glorious Republick the 5. of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101836:124"/>
                     <hi>June</hi> 1648. And here, by the way, we may take notice, of the admira ble conduct of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who, though at a great diſtance, and having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage then by ſea, have nevertheleſſe, againſt all human apparence, defended theſe Provinces the ſpace of thirteen years, againſt three moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Such as have more ſence of particular, then publick intereſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned this Peace, as having been too much precipitated; alled ging, that the <hi>States</hi> ought not to have ſeparated themſelves from the <hi>French,</hi> but that they ought to have helped them to drive out the old enemies, and come to ſhare ſtakes, and many other arguments making for the prolongation of the War. To which it may be anſwered, that all Wars which have not a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary defence, and true Peace, for their ſcope, are unjuſt. Beſides, if the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> obtained by this Peace, whatſoever they deſired, and aſked, it needs muſt follow, that they were obliged to ratify it. And as for the intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> which was alſo to accept it for the repoſe of her Subjects, and for the great advantages offered therein; they clearly perceived, that that great Miniſter would not have it; and therefore they reſolved not to obey his paſſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the Embaſſadours themſelves adviſed them to embrace it, in caſe they could bring the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to an utter renunciation, both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Succeſſours; which, after the attendance of a whole year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was effected. All the world is alſo of opinion, that for the good of their State, it is better for them, to be ſeparated from the <hi>French.</hi> There are likewiſe ſome other reaſons which remained in the Cabinet, and which ſome events, not foreſeen by many, have made to be judged very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> hath ſufficiently declared by the taking of many Holland-March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants ſhips, how diſpleaſing this Peace was to her, but <hi>Holland</hi> hath diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled this proceeding with admirable prudence, as attributing it, to the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great Miniſters Creatures. <hi>Allyes of different nature, bold good in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſity; but at the end of the reckning, that frienſhip growes faint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This War, which had laſted almoſt ninety years, and which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved to be immortal, expired in the Spring time, 1648. to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of ſuch as love peace, and tranquillity; and the great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the <hi>French,</hi> who had much reaſon to be angry at it, for two ſubjects; the one for the diviſion, or Stake-ſharing; and the other, becauſe they had not quite chaſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The pence was not pleaſing to all.</note> It was obſerved nevertheleſs, that this joy was not univerſal, and that ſome others beſide the <hi>French,</hi> would have been more glad to carry on the War, to the total expulſion of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Indeed, the Bonefires were kindled with more zeale, and ſhined with more light, in one Town, then in another, and coldneſſe appeared in the countenances of many perſons. But above all, they who made their advantage of following the Armies; and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, as with whom paſſion of Religion prevailed more, then intereſt of State, expreſſed their diſſatisfactions.</p>
                  <p>The number of ſuch as embraced the Reformed Religion, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> growing, in deſpight of all <hi>Placarts,</hi> and Prohibitions, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and multiply, ſowed the firſt ſeed of the diviſion; to which was added the ambition of ſome certain Governours, (who according to their own ſence,<note place="margin">The cauſes of! the firſt tumults</note> were ill enough divided) the diſcontentment of the Nobility, the Clergie, and all in general, for augmentation of the Biſhops, and the retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Forrain <hi>Militia,</hi> in the Low-Countries.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101836:124"/>Duke of <hi>Alna;</hi> the weakening of the Royal Prerogative, and the pretexts of maintaining priviledges, were the windes, which brake the bounds of reſpect, and concord, and cauſed the Warrs againſt the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Victories, having made the King burie the confederates, moved them to begin the War againſt him, which laſted till the valliant <hi>Henries</hi> death.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the tumults, they firſt indirectly ſet upon the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, by deſtroying Altars, and Images, under colour of abuſe, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, and liberty of conſcience; and then upon the King, under that of the Tyranny of his Governours togeather with the avarice, cruelty, and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Souldiers. But in fine by the ſuccour of ſtrangers, the War was carried on directly; and that with ſo much dexterity, and good ſucceſſe, that the King hath loſt ſeven Provinces, and the ſaid Church, her exerciſe; in ſuch ſort, as that <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth now raigning, by the articles of this Peace, hath declared the ſaid Provinces Free States.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee in what coudition the Emperours affayrs are, after a loſſe ſo little expected.</p>

And he, finding no ſubject to take Arms, and ſo ſlightly to break his Oath, obtained Newtrality of the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and merited beſides to be called by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf, <hi>the Faithful Prince.</hi> The chief motive of this immovable conſtance of his, ſhall be inſerted beer, as I have learnt it.</p>
                  <p>The Landgrave <hi>William</hi> his Father, feeling himſelf decaying in his ſtrength, and drawing neer his end, ſent for this <hi>George</hi> his Sonne; to whom, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good leſſons, and inſtructions, he declared, as it were by a Prophetick Spirit, that there would happen many Warrs in <hi>Germany</hi> againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, under the pretext of Religion; wherein Strangers would be alſo ingaged, being attracted by the deſire, and occaſion of making themſelves great. And therefore, that he ſhould be ſure to take heed of caſting himſelf into that precipice; but that he ſhould remain faithful to the ſaid Emperour; without ſuffering himſelf by any meanes to be diſtracted, or carried away, to the ambition of any ſuch people. <hi>Promiſe me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that you will never abandon the Emperours Party, unleſſe he endeavour to force you, and your Subjects, in your Conſeience.</hi> Which he did by Oath, and hath always obſerved it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; ſo that he could not be loved by the Proteſtant Party; neither was the Newtrality he obtained, and ſo religiouſly obſerved by him, ſufficient to keep him out of the dance; for the Fidlers played about him, and made him dance in deſpight of his heart. But there muſt be a pretext, which was not long to ſeek. Oh curſed, and deteſtable Age!</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Apretext to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</note> 
                     <hi>Butſback,</hi> a place belonging to the ſaid <hi>Landgrave,</hi> was taken by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Gieſe,</hi> for a puniſhment (as was ſaid) becauſe it had refuſed paſſage to Colonel St. Andrews Forces; or rather, for that indeed the Politick neceſſity of affaires required it. For, where this Maxime hath the upper hand, Juſtice is ſhut out of door.</p>
                  <p>From thence the ſaid <hi>Gieſe</hi> went to <hi>Marpurgh</hi> in <hi>Novem.</hi> 1644. which Town forthwith yeelded, and leſt the diſpure to the Caſtle; which was alſo, after having briefly defended it ſelf, forced to bow the knee, in regard that the Foot was already taken away.</p>
                  <p>By this unheard-of, and unexpected proceeding, againſt all Right, againſt faith, and promiſe; this agreement, which had bin ſolemaly made, and ſworn between the two Branches of this moſt illuſtrious, and moſt ancient Houſe <hi>Haſſia,</hi> this Agreement, I ſay confirmed by the Emperour, approved by the of Electoral Colledge, and the whole Empire, was quaſhed, by this invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that paciſicall Prince <hi>George,</hi> induced to defend his Countriel by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101836:125"/>Arms, ſince the Lawes, and the Columne, or Piller which ſupported them, was too weak.</p>
                  <p>In a word, a War was kindled in that diſtrict, and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion, and the Liberty of <hi>Germany;</hi> ranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt this poor <hi>Lutheran</hi> Prince, in favour of the <hi>Calvinſticall Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravinne,</hi> or <hi>Princeſſe Landgrave</hi> their Alley. <hi>Maximes muſt be changed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to occaſions, and the pretext of Religion, is but to amuſe the Vulgar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Lutherans</hi> were not a whit ſorry, to ſee this Prince tormented: but ſuch as yet cheriſhed right, and juſtice, openly pittyed him. In brief, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med powerfully, and ſet forth a Manifeſt, againſt which the <hi>Landgravinne</hi> publiſhed another; ſo that the War was begun, both with the pen, and with the pike. Indeed ſhe could not take a fitter time; <hi>For it is alwayes good, to fiſh in troubled water,</hi> 1646.</p>
                  <p>General <hi>Wranghel</hi> returned towards <hi>Haſſia,</hi> took <hi>Hoxter,</hi> and <hi>Paderborne</hi> at diſcretion, and cleanſed all thoſe parts from the Imperialiſts, whileſt they were very buſiy about doing the like, in <hi>Moravia;</hi> where they retook <hi>Crambs</hi> with much trouble, and <hi>Corneuburgh</hi> with more. So that when <hi>Auſtria</hi> was beginning to reſpire, by the retreate of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and unexpected misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune put all the Court into Mourning, the Empereſſe into her Tomb, and the Religious Prince <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> into the greateſt ſadneſſe that any invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soule could be able to ſuſtaine. This Princeſſe,<note place="margin">The death of the Empereſſe.</note> being great with childe, was ſtifled by a Catharr or Rheume, and univerſally regretted by all, for her bounty, and other Imperial Vertucs. The King of <hi>Spaines</hi> onely Son followed her, which ſo much afflicted his Father,<note place="margin">And of the Prince of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </note> that it cauſed him a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt theſe things paſſed, General <hi>Mortaigne</hi> was taken by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, and found furniſhed with certain papers,<note place="margin">Mortaigne <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</hi>
                     </note> which contained ſo exact, and perfect a Liſt of the Imperial Army, and all other particulars belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to it, that many of the principal, and higheſt Officers, had not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a knowledge thereof. Yea, and he affirmed beſides, that there was nothing done, nor any Order given, which was not forth with diſcovered to the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and therefore no wonder, if Victory marched with them, ſince Traitours marched with the Imperialiſts.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt the Conquering Army was approaching <hi>Haſsia,</hi> and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals were making good cheare at <hi>Caſſel,</hi> the Count of <hi>Holtſappel</hi> General of the Elector of <hi>Coleins</hi> Forces, endeavoured to redreſſe his Party, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her, whoſe Troops he had long Commanded.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Whileſt this ſmall war was mennaged in this Biſhoprick, the motion of theſe great. Armies made all tremble, all fear, and all hope. For, never were all parties ſeen ſo hot, as after the Treaty was begun at <hi>Munſter;</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that ſome tooke it for an amuſement, and that the Strangers would winne the whole Game, ſince they had the better of the play.</p>
                  <p>Let us return to the <hi>French Weymarians</hi> who were grown proud by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Philipſburgh,</hi> and <hi>Memz.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> after theſe brave exploits, which made the <hi>Germans</hi> know, how much the valour of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be redoubted; returned into <hi>France</hi> with two Regiments. The <hi>Bavarians,</hi> being incamped upon the River <hi>Necker,</hi> retook ſome places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victualled <hi>Friburgh;</hi> and having repulſed four thouſand men, who attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to croſſe their deſigne, took up their winter Quarters; as the Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts alſo did theirs, in <hi>Alſatia, Lorrain,</hi> and upon the <hi>Rheyn;</hi> where being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with ſome Regiments, they repaſſed the River to feck the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>

The Conflict was horrible, and the dexterity of that brave General <hi>Merey</hi> was the maine inſtrument of the whole Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory. <hi>John de Werdt</hi> (who was now a Count) Colonel <hi>Colbe,</hi>

In briefe, they cloſed with ſo much reſolution, and courage, that it looked as if the Monarchy of the whole Univerſe had depended upon this Conflict.<note place="margin">The laſt, Battel of <hi>Nottlingo hen, 1645.</hi>
                     </note> In effect, the number of perſons of condition ſlaine, was very great; and the <hi>Germans</hi> have written, that the <hi>French</hi> Army was ſo much ingaged, that without the ſuccour of the <hi>Haſsians,</hi> after ſo fierce a Blood-letting, it would have fainted.</p>
                  <p>The Bauel laſted till night, and the death of brave <hi>Merey,</hi> that <hi>Lorrain</hi> Baron, gave the Enemies ſome advantage; for they kept the Field, as I have already ſaid. And really, after this Lords death, the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army made no more then a meer Defenſive war; rather for want of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, then gallant Troops; but it was too dangerous to vener again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out huge advantage, both Armies being ſo extreamly weakened.

                  <p>General <hi>Wranghel</hi> upon the other ſide, attacked <hi>Starbergh,</hi> which yeelded upon the ſame conditions with the Towns before taken; but the Burghers, or Townſmen, for having ſhewed too much zeal for their own defence, were ſacked, as a forfeit, for their duty, and conſtancy.

It is ſaid, that his hat falling once from his head, when he was on horſe-back, was found, and brought to him full of water; and he being wholly amazed at this myſtery, ſhewed it to his Miniſter, who not moved at all thereat, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to tell him, that it <hi>was the teares of the poor people, whoſe houſes he had cauſed to be fired.</hi> I know not, whether this be a ſtory made on purpoſe, to render him odious, and the better to paint out his rigorous proceedings, and to deface ſo many gallant actions as he had performed; but howſoever, it is alſo true, that he was very cruell.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101836:129"/>was preferred before ſo many great Lords of merit, and illuſtrious extraction; whereof he not being ignorant, laboured upon the firſt occaſion, to render ſo great proofs of his vertue, and zeal, as that every one might be moved by his example to prefer their Princes occaſions, before their own particular intereſts;one whereof you ſhall forthwith ſee.</p>

                  <p>By this Combat, <hi>Bavaria</hi> was laid open, and the Inhabitants ruined by both Armies; for however the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> were ſtronger then the Conquerours, they were faine nevertheleſs, to content themſelves with tormenting them onely by ſurpriſes, and Encounters, whileſt the old Town of <hi>Prague</hi> defended it ſelfe ſtourly, and ſo repulſed the Chief Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that he could not take it, and loſt above four thouſand of his men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>

But what ſeems impoſſible to man, is not to God.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the moſt zealous Proteſtants fancyed to themſelves, that the Catholick Religion being divided by the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> might be eaſily annihilated, and then the Conquerours would have all or nothing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plempotentiary-Embaſſadours,</hi> had already treated at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Oſuabrugh,</hi> the ſpace of four years, when it pleaſed at length, the Father of light, to diſſipate the darkneſs of ambition, and to ſend back peace into poor <hi>Germany:</hi> which was ſo much tottered, diſpeopled, and deſert, that it was not any more to be known.

                  <p>THe war which was made upon the Emperour by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> had ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the people of <hi>Europe,</hi> that there were very few perſons to be found, who ſhewed not themſelves either glad, or ſad, upon the iſſue of any remarkable Battel.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who looked upon it only for the intereſt of their Doctrine, were afraid leaſt, if the Emperour grew victorious, he ſhould deprive them of the exerciſe thereof by a Reformation, and retake from them all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Lands, and Poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>The Catholicks, guided by zeal, were inwardly afflicted, at the decline, or decay, of that Great Houſe, which alone ſuſtained the hatred of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; and could not forbeare to murmur, and cry our aloude againſt Pope <hi>

                     </note> leaned alwayes towards <hi>France.</hi> For the intereſts of States enter as well into the Conclave, as thoſe of the Church.

                  <p>This unhappy Age could not produce but miſerable fruits, ſince the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, as well as the Seculars, forſook Gods Cauſe, to ſerve their own irregular Paſſions, and evil Cuſtomes.

                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> had been oft enough advertiſed of a ſcourge which was prepared for it, by that Mountain near it, which ſo often vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up lumps of fire, and ſent it ſnowes of aſhes, but the Preſervatives hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not the diſeaſe.</p>

                  <p>But at preſent, Juſtice is trodden under foot, mony does all, vertue is made a laughing-ſtock, even by them, who boaſt to have drawn their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from it; and vice, being <hi>a la mode,</hi> or in faſhion, is eſteemed: yea, many ſin rather by example, then by inclination in this depraved Age; and more to pleaſe the vicious, then for that they approve of the vice.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:101836:132"/>that this is not the firſt time that Soveraignes have ended their lives by the hand of an ordinary Executioner; and that a good cauſe hath not alwayes a good iſsue. For the three hundred <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen who were ſacrificed to the ſpirits of theſe two Lords, and the Torches of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Veſpers, or Even-ſongs, which were extinguiſhed in the blood of the ſame nation; tell us, that vengeance hath alwayes been ſweet, and that it is moſt dangerous, to put an irritated people into fury.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Gateneſa,</hi> from a mean Landreſs, being grown the Nurſe of a Prince, and afterwards, Governeſs of ſix Princeſses, one after another, with ſuch an abſolute power upon their mindes, (and chiefly upon that of the laſt) that ſhe grew to diſpoſe of the greateſt Charges, and Offices of the kingdom, and diſtributed the beſt part thereof amongſt her own children; ſaw her ſelf at laſt, with all her family, dragged to the execution: Yea, a King was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Grate of a window, by conſent of his wife; and ſhe ſome years after, ſtrangled by a juſt judgement of the Great Judge. Theſe were the miracles, or rather the prodigies of thoſe Ages, which hapened all in the ſaid king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with ſo many other, as make us conclude, that uſurped poſſeſſions ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom paſs to the fourth Heyr, or elſe alwayes cauſe troubles.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end of the fourteenth Age, this kingdom being revolted from <hi>Alfonſo</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the States thereof offered the Crown to <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth King of <hi>France,</hi> who eaſily got it into his poſseſſion, and the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> with the ſame facility, ſhook off that yoke afterwards, for being fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their Charges, and recalled the aforeſaid <hi>Arragonian.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> returned thither, by the commandment of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, who ought to ſhare it with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtill;</hi> but they could not agree about the ſpoyles; and ſo <hi>Gonſalvo,</hi> rather by might, then right, drove them both our. It hath been attacked ſince, but not ſubdued, and ſo remaines to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the wars being grown hot, both in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Coumtries,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> finding her ſelf taken to task by ſo many enemies; the State of <hi>Neaples</hi> was oppreſsed by ſo many Impoſts, or Taxes, that that Houſe being ſtrong and vigorous before, became ſo lean, and feeble, that he could not longer carry ſo heavy a burthen.</p>
                  <p>This miſchief began firſt to operate almoſt throughout all <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the people conſtrained the Vice-King to take off the Impoſts. From thence, it paſsed to <hi>Neaples,</hi> and by that good ſucceſs, made the <hi>Ne politans</hi> take the ſame reſolution; and that, by ſuch meanes, as you ſhall forthwith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>

                     </note> The tears of the poor peeople; the advices, and admonitions of ſome great ones; the libells, and burning of the Cuſtome-Houſes, were all able to draw but faint promiſes of eaſe, without any effect at all.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, a certain Fellow of the very dregs of the People, who had dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the obſcurity of his birth, had not this furious revolt,<note place="margin">And why?</note> (whereof he was Head, and Authour) elevated him to the higheſt top of this Theater, to make him ſeen by all the world, and to teach as well Noblemen, as Gentlemen, that God ſerves himſelf of abject and contemptible means, when it pleaſes him to chaſtiſe them.

                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:101836:133"/>
                  <p>The ſaid cuſtome-Houſes being burnt to aſhes, they began to run up and down the City, crying out, <hi>Live the King, and the Devill deſtroy the ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and went to the Vice-Kings Palace, who, not being able to mitigate them by fair pronuſes, (nor the Archbiſhop, by gentle words, and writings) ſled to the Church, and from thence, to the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Elme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vice-King being thus retyred, they intreated the Duke of <hi>Carafa,</hi> to be their Head, and Leader; who not being able to ſtop their rage, retyred himſelf alſo privarely, thanking God that he was eſcaped out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The war of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and why? The taking of <hi>Canea.</hi> The Knights of <hi>Maltha</hi> take a huge booty, or prize, as a great number of <hi>Gallies,</hi> and the young <hi>Sultaneſſe,</hi> or Empereſſe of <hi>Turky,</hi> with her Son. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> obtain ſuccour, but are beaten.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>VVE had ſo much trouble to ſinde an end of this war of <hi>Germany,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> terminated with regret, and as through ſpight with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for having too ſoon left the Dance, which they had no minde at all to finiſh, till after the Conqueſt of the whole Empyre; that we ſignified thereby, the ſmall care we had to ſet down the other wars in fit place and order; which yet were not deſpicable, neither in ſucceſſe, not proceeding; according to the boundleſſe irregularities of the Age; however they were not conſiderable in any other reſpect, then for being dependent upon that great Body, which makes (according to the ſenſe of ſome learned perſons) the fourth, and laſt Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Under the prerext of ſtopping the proſperity of this laudable Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> there was formed a puiſſant League to ruine her;yea, and the Eagle was already painted naked every where,<note place="margin">The Eagle peeled.</note> panting, and grieving, and even at the laſt gaſp, by the Arms of the ſaid League; and the Duke of <hi>Lorrame</hi> holding her head, and giving her phyſick. The Confederates, on the other ſide, had their hands full of her feather, and ſtood waiting for her death. But all theſe riddles ſerved to no other end, then to amuſe the people, feed the eyes of the curious, and diſcover the intention of the ſaid Confederates.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Peace, which it was thought, would never have come down again, but with the Revenger himſelf of innocent bloud, and oppreſſion;checred up the hearts of ſuch as were timerous; made the Birds of prey withdraw, and the Husbandman live in hope; however let him who ſtands upright, take heed of falling; for there is nothing ſure, in regard, that though the windes be r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Indeed, the war, having like a fire, incompaſſed all <hi>Germany,</hi> paſſed on into <hi>Denmark, Sweden, England,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that there is not ſo much as any one Province, which can boaſt of being, or of having been free, and exempt from this univerſal Diſaſter. The <hi>Germans</hi> are hard to be moved; but having once taken Arms, they are very hardly brought to lay them down again.</p>

                     </note> In the interim, the ſworn enemy of Chriſtendom, took his time, &amp; meaſure, kept his cadency, entred into <hi>Candy,</hi> beſieged <hi>Canea,</hi> and couzened the moſt clear-ſighted of the whole Company; who thought that this ſtorm would burſt upon the Iſle of <hi>Malta.</hi> Let us lay open the counterfeit, and mark the pretext, and ſubject, which kindled the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>'s wrath; who cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the Levant, or Eaſtern Sea with an infinite multitude of Veſſels, thought to ſurprize, and devoure that moſt ſerene Common-wealth, which muſt not periſh, but with the diſſolution of the world. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſerve themſelves alſo of diſſimulation, and when they make a ſhew of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one way, they go another.</p>
                  <p>The effects of the hatred which they bear the Chriſtians, had not been differred ſo long in ſo many fair occaſions, had it not been for the war between them, and the <hi>Perſians.</hi>

                  <p>This war, I ſay, had taken away the meanes of prevailing againſt us, by thoſe diſorders which had ſo much weakened us: For neither the brooks of blood which was ſpilt, not the Towns and Villages which were burnt; not the fields which were made deſert, haſtened them to come, and diſpatch the reſt. They ſeemed to have loſt their intereſts, and rejoyced to ſee the Name of Chriſtian deſtroyed, by the Chriſtians themſelves. But when it ſeemed to them a fit time to act, againſt a Body, which was grown faint by the loſſe of ſo much blood, and whileſt they were momentarily delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongſt themſelves, where, and how to begin the Round; the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> ſhewed them the way, and let them ſee, that there were yet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians enow, to give them exerciſe, and make them pay the expences of the Revel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the <hi>Sultan,</hi> being a bloody Prince, and ſpurred on to war by the Counſells of his Minion, or Favorite (for the Barbarians, as well as our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have ſome who make them condeſcend to their paſſions) was much more moved by ſpight, and rage, when he received the vexatious newes, that the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> had taken, near the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi>

                     </gap>e him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon all the Chriſtians; and to this effect, he contracted the principal Forces, of all the Provinces, and fitted a Fleet of near four hundred ſaile, and lulled the <hi>Venetians</hi> aſleep in the meane while, by aſſuring them, that it was not againſt them, but to draw ſatisfation from the aforeſaid Knights, who put themſelves into a poſture to undergoe the ſtorme, by ſending for all the Knights, demanding the ſuccour of Princes, and fortifying all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid <hi>Venetians,</hi> and other States of <hi>Italy</hi> thought alſo of their defence, but a little too late; and ſo they tryed, to their coſt, and loſſe, the <hi>Great Turks</hi> perfidy; who, having made a ſhew of attacking <hi>Malta,</hi> returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Candy,</hi> and took <hi>Canea</hi> by compoſition, after he had battered it by a Siege, and many aſſaults.</p>
                  <p>Some States ſhewed their zeal for the Common Good; but the reliefe came too late, like phyſick to the dead; and the cauſe thereof was jealouſie. But this inopinated Invaſion much aſtonniſhed the Illuſtrious Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> (which asked aſſiſtance every where, and in <hi>Holland,</hi> Ships for their mony) but was not able to reſtore Chriſtendom to peace. When the Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves attack a flock of Sheep, the courage of the doggs is cooled, from falling upon the Common Enemy. The ambition of Chriſtians was too great; the opinions in Religion, too different, and various; their charity too much chilled, and the ruin of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (which was judged infallible) too much in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>This puniſhment ſeemed to have been drawn upon them, by their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well adminiſtred juſtice in the ſaid Iſland, upon the Governours Son, who had committed a rape; and violated a woman, 1646. which crime made the <hi>Mores</hi> invade <hi>Spain,</hi> and hath cauſed many afflictions in the world beſides. One misfortune followes another:<note place="margin">Fire got into the <hi>Arſenal</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </note> for the fire got into the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and indangered the blowing up of that brave City: which ſo much frighted the noble <hi>Senators</hi> thereof, that as well for this mishap, as alſo for many other advertiſements, they reſolved to provide it well, to the end that the Traitours might have no power to hurt it.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:101836:135"/>
                  <p>In this conjuncture, the <hi>French</hi> were in danger to be ill treated, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſed of intelligence with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of having kindled this fatal war: <hi>But that which is without ground, is alſo without exiſtency; and what is not proved, ought not to be believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turke</hi> cauſed his General to be beheaded, for having loſt too many men before <hi>Canea,</hi> and failed to ſeize upon the Haven of <hi>Suda</hi> in the ſame Iſland; and not with ſtanding ſo many prodigies as appeared at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> for many dayes together;<note place="margin">

For, the year before, one part of the ſaid City was conſumed by fire; and this year, the contrary Element threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to drown it, and made the Inhabitants go up to the tops of their houſes, to ſave their lives. In brief, theſe ſupernatural ſignes make us hope, that heaven, being angry with theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> will diſſipate their Monarchy, together with the impiety of their <hi>Alcoran:</hi> but the incredulity of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, together with their ill lives, will quickly involue Mortals in the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> blocked up <hi>Canea,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> being ill Neighbours to the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> laboured to enter into <hi>Frioll,</hi> and cauſed the <hi>Tartars</hi> to march into the Field; but the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> made a powerful diverſion, towards the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> which divided the ſaid <hi>Turks</hi> Troops. The <hi>Muſcovits</hi> joyned themſelves to the ſaid <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and the <hi>Basſhaw</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> revolted; ſo that the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> found worke enough to do.

                  <p>The State of <hi>Venice,</hi> being mennaced by three Armies, implored the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Chriſtian Princes,<note place="margin">The defeat of the <hi>Venetions.</hi>
                     </note> and beat the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Dalmaria,</hi> but received a furious overthrow in the Kingdom of <hi>Candy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>General <hi>Moreſini</hi> took a good number of veſſels appointed to re-victual <hi>Canea;</hi> but he could not hinder the Fleet; and ſo the Army was defeated there; ſix thouſand men, with two Generals killed: <hi>Retimo</hi> taken, and all the Chriſtians maſſacred.</p>
                  <p>This misfortune ſo much ſtartled the Common-wealth, that however <hi>Grimani</hi> had very happily taken a great many Gallyes,<note place="margin">Which implores the help of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> ſhe made it highly known at <hi>Vienna, Paris, Madrid,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> that ſhe was not able alone, to ſuſtaine the weight of the Half-Moon; and that having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſumed about two and thirty millious of Crowns, ſhe ſhould, at laſt be conſtrained to enter into ſuch unequal conditions, with this devouring Wolfe, as would be ſhameful to all Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>Though Fortune had been unkinde in the Kingdom of <hi>Candy,</hi> ſhe yet ſhewed ſo gay, and chearful a countenance in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and in many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters at Sea, that ſhe made the Republick break off all Treaty of Peace, and reſolve to continue the war.</p>
                  <p>There arrived forty veſſels from <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome from <hi>Denmark,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counting the ſuccour of <hi>Genna,</hi> and that of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who took the ſaid Republicks Cauſe to heart, as alſo the repoſe, and quiet of Chriſtendom.</p>

The Shops were ſhut up; the Chaines made faſt; and all the approaches bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricaded: So that <hi>Paris</hi> was in greater diſorder now, or elſe the danger was greater, then that which chanced in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, till the Queen being ſupplicated to releaſe them, was content to grant it. And thus,<note place="margin">Appeaſed.</note> was the firſt bout (which was but precurſory to greater evils) paſt; and a calme reſtored to that little world, for three, or four moneths.</p>
                  <p>It is very reaſonable (ſay the Strangers) that the Shop where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of ſo many wars had been forged, ſhould feel a part of the Calamities, by which <hi>Europe</hi> hath been ſo miſerably tottered; but the miſchiefe falls upon the heads of the innocent. Strange effects of the Divine Providence; which leaves nothing firme, and ſtable, in this deteſtable Age; and nothing unpunniſhed, though deferred.</p>
                  <p>Let us paſſe to the ſecond, much more dangerous, then the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Queen, together with the King, and Princes, went out of <hi>Paris,</hi> upon the fifth, or ſixth of <hi>January</hi> at night 1649, which clandeſtine retreat,<note place="margin">The King goes out of <hi>Paris,</hi> which cauſes a tumult.</note> gave the Inhabitants ſuch an Alarme; as imagining that ſhe would revenge her ſelfe of the former Commotion, that they took arms again, with as much heate as they had done before, and raiſed forces to conſerve themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort, Elbouf,</hi> and <hi>Bouillon,</hi> as alſo the Marſhal <hi>de la Motte;</hi> and their chief General was the Prince of <hi>Conty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King raiſed ſome alſo, and there came many to him from all parts, to reduce this great City to reaſon; he had already ſeized upon ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and ſome hot Skermiſhes were made, in one whereof,<note place="margin">The pretended Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> killed. His e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</note> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was killed, of whoſe education the Reader will be pleaſed to hear a word or two, as I have been able to learne it.</p>
                  <p>Being yet an Infant, he was carried into <hi>Holland</hi> by a certain Captain, and put to nurſe to a Country-woman in <hi>North-Holland;</hi> where together with his milk, he ſucked in the love of the Roman Catholick Religion. When he was grown pretty big, he was ſent to the Latin Schooles at <hi>Leyden;</hi> but with ſo little care, that he was as it were, quite abandoned; and almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the extremity of betaking himſelfe to learne ſome Trade. During this ſmall ſtate, and low condition, he told his School-fellowes (and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my ſonne) that he remembred well, that he was come of a good Houſe, and that he well knew, that he was the ſonne of a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman. He went publickly to the Sermons, and privatly, when he could, to Maſſe; which being come to the knowledge of ſome, to whom he was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, without knowing who he was, they forbid him to go to the ſecret Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101836:137"/>of the Papiſts. But in fine, the vizard was taken off, and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of <hi>Rohan</hi> acknowledged him by Letters, for her ſonne; ſent him men, and mony, to ſet up his Traine, and bring him into <hi>France,</hi> where he ſoone ſound his grave; for a Piſtoll bullet decided the ſure, and the doubt, of whether he were the true ſonne of the deceaſed Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> was in a more dangerous State, then it had been in a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the King held S. <hi>Dennis, Mewdon, Corbeil,</hi> and <hi>Lagny; ſo that,</hi> to get out of one extremity, recourſe muſt be had to another, and that to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Kingdom; I mean, they were faine to implore aſſiſtance of their Enemies, which being favourably offered, they received it.</p>

                     <hi>Cardmal Mazarin,</hi> ſeeing the Arch-dukes approach, and Parliaments care for the remedy of the diſorders, which threatned the Kingdome with a great breach; gave way to this ſterme, which being once joyned, might come to deſtroy him.

                  <p>THis fatall War is like the <hi>Hydra;</hi> the more heads are cut off, the more grow up; out of one ſmothered in one place, their ſprang many, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Nor may we hope for any amendment, ſince thoſe horrible effects, which we have now deſcribed, and which we yet ſee dayly happen, will not permit us to doubt, but that this is the laſt Age.</p>
                  <p>The people of <hi>Liedge</hi> are very firme Roman Catholicks, and very much love novelty, as well as the <hi>French;</hi> they are ſtank, and ſingle-hearted,<note place="margin">A deſcription of the City of <hi>Liedge.</hi>

                  <p>In the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Elector of <hi>Colein, Prince,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Liedge,</hi> there were ſome tumults, and complaints tending to the deſtruction of his authority.

                  <p>The power of theſe factions encreaſed, which pretended nothing but the conſervation of Priviledges, and Liberty, the general pretext of all ſuch as love novelty; and ſtrangers endeavoured to blow this fire of diviſion; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, after the taking of <hi>Maſtricht.</hi>

                  <p>In the laſt Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> theſe ſuperſtitions, and obcecations of the Divel, were much put in practice, and were uſefull for ſometime, but to the ruin of ſuch as truſted in them.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having received ſome ſatisfaction, drew his forces out of the ſaid Biſhoprick, and ſent them towards the Kingdome of <hi>Aix:</hi> which invaſion put ſuch a flea in the ear of all the bordering Princes, and the Governour of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> that they were already complotting an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to fall upon them, who had pillaged ſome Carts, coming from <hi>Boiſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc,</hi> and ſent ſome Regiments into the land of <hi>Raveſtein;</hi> but they changed their way, and went to the Dutchy of <hi>Gulick.</hi> There wanted not Muſkets, but<note n="*" place="margin">Gold ſo talled.</note> Piſtols, to drive them into the Biſhoprick of <hi>Trevirs,</hi> where they ſhore the ſheep, which had very little more left, then the bare ſkin, becauſe they had been ſhorn ſo often before.</p>
                  <p>One part of them repaſſed, at the beginning of Summer, into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the reſt ſtayed, to haſten the contributions.</p>
                  <p>This Army is at preſent the moſt odious, and moſt revyled of all <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe the laſt evils are more ſenſible, then the firſt, which are half-forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Indeed, they do much harme; but the <hi>Swedes</hi> did much more in <hi>Sazony,</hi> through the ſpight which was cauſed them by the peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> and through a reſentment which they made ring very loud, nor doth this Prince want any indignation, as not having been comprized in that of <hi>Munſter;</hi> thought yet the tyrannies, which his Souldiers have exerciſed, as well in <hi>Germany,</hi> as elſewhere, be not excuſable. But all theſe deſolations muſt be imputed to the corruptneſſe of this Age, which being curſed, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing but abhomination, not to be remedied by humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The end of that deſtructive War of <hi>Germany,</hi> made all the world ſee, that the ay me of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> was quite contrary to what they pretended.

                  <p>In the year 1635. the <hi>Swedes</hi> would not accept of an exceſſive ſumme of money for a recompence, offered them by the Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> they were faine to leave them in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pomerania, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſatisfaction of <hi>France,</hi> which ſerved it ſelf of the ſame pretexts, they were conſtrained to yeeld it the Rights in the three Biſhopricks; leave it <hi>Briſack,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Alſatia</hi> (to the loſſe of a Prince allyed to it by bloud) and forſake the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> cauſe. For though Peace were treated, War was nevertheleſſe carryed on with extremity, and the ſaid Allyes imagined that they ſhould have brought all the forces of the <hi>Empire</hi> to an end, before it were concluded. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being pacifyed, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to conſider, that Fortune often changes; and to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with what they ſeemed able to keep in all occurrences, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                  <p>Thus were the Protectors of the <hi>German</hi> Liberty, againſt the Soveraigne Head. The Emperour being attacked by a Vaſſal of the Empire, deſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his States; and having many times defeated them who acted for him, impoſed nothing more upon him for reſtitution of all his Lands and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101836:139"/>Goods, then a meer ſingle acknowledgement of his fault, and a feigned hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, by asking pardon. I mean, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> who entred <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> in an hoſtil manner, and was beaten; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for the expences of the war, manifeſted, by reſtoring him all, that he would have the world know, that he ſought not to give jealouſie to any, by retaining ſuch States as he had occupated by a juſt Cauſe, and by the lot of Arms. <hi>Oh you Clarks, who vant ſo much of the ſincority of the intentions of your Maſters, and who deſire to make things appeare quite otherwiſe then they are; confeſs, now what you cannot deny; namely, that their deſigne was, to fiſh in troubled waters; and that in ſtead of the liberty of the Empire, they effectively ſought the ruin thereof. Before you make a Family guilty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, look firſt what they are, whom you defend. Give her leave to maintaine her intereſt, as well as your Maſters do theirs; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver blame that in others, whereof you are culpable your ſelves.</hi>

                  <p>In this Treaty, the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> complaints, and the proteſtations of his Embaſſadours, concerning the <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> obtained not that ſatisfaction they hoped, and expected; for the <hi>French</hi> had there, too much authority; and ſo the aforeſaid King expreſſed his reſentment thereof, by retaining his Garriſon in <hi>Frankendal</hi> (as we will ſhew) and manifeſted, that he was able to caſt yet more prejudice upon his enemies.</p>

                  <p>I Was thinking to make a full ſtop in the middle of this Age, as hoping that the Great God, being moved by ſo much blood-ſhed, would ſtop his ſcourge, and caſt his rod into the fire; but alas! It is not yet done; for it ſeems, that they who contributed to the deſolation of the Empire, muſt now feel the effects of his indignation, in their own States. They danced in <hi>Germany,</hi> and now the Revel is amongſt them at home, to the end that all may be accompliſhed. If they have made ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, they will pay deare enough for them.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever takes a firy coale in his hand, ſhakes, and ſtirs it gently, and ſhuts not his hand for feare of burning it. My deſigne, in the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of this matter, is to do the like, and to handle it ſo tenderly, as not to burne my ſelfe, in a ſeaſon, when the World is ſo eaſily toucht, and when truth is hardly able to finde a lodging.</p>

                  <p>The Impriſonment of the Princes of <hi>Conde,</hi> and <hi>Conty,</hi> and of their Brother in Law the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi>

                  <p>Whileſt all the world was waiting to know the ſubject of this so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Impriſonment, there came other news more ſtrange then this; which ſtruck the ears of every one in particular, filled all <hi>Holland</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and the curious with deſire to ſee the Iſſue.</p>

                  <p>The Prince not having received ſatiſfactions, his complaints were to be manifeſted; but in what manner? Every body knows.</p>
                  <p>The night of the twenty ninth, or thirtieth of <hi>July</hi> (a remarkable night and day) till next morning, being Satterday, and all quiet at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the Poſt of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> arrived about eight of the clock, and brought word to the magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Troops ſtraight to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A very dark night.</note> It is to be noted, that that night was ſo dark, and rainy, that it deprived the Souldiers of the knowledge of the wayes, and of the ſtrength to march ſtedfaſtly: In ſuch ſort, as the guydes ſtayed, and being puzled at a croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, made the <hi>Van</hi> march as ſoon as they found themſelves right; but the reſt wandered ſo much up and down, that they found themſelves, in the ſame Village an houre after.</p>
                  <p>The Magiſtrates, having cauſed the Bridges to be drawn up, diſpatched their Deputies to ask <hi>Count William,</hi> to what end he came thither with ſo great

                  <p>The Prince having made himſelf ſure of the aforeſaid Lords, ſent for the Penſioner <hi>Gatz,</hi> and acquainted him with his having ſecured them, and told him, that he had ſent ſixty companies of Horſe and Foor, to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Count Williams</hi> conduct, whom he believed to be infallibly already,<note place="margin">The States ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> in the Town; which being reported by him to the Aſſembly of the States, they forthwith retired; and the Deputies of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> having taken a cow ple of Waggons went by the way of <hi>Harlem,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>

                  <p>There were ſo great changes that they made ſome murmour, and others blame the Peace with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and caſt in fine, all the <hi>Hollanders</hi> into ſuch aſtoniſhment, that they knew not how to free themſelves from it.<note place="margin">The Peaſants fly.</note> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people about <hi>Amſterdam</hi> fled; and no body knew, either what to hope, or feare.</p>
                  <p>The rich were ſilent, and the dreggs of the People ſpake. What State can be ſure of being free from War, ſince <hi>Holland,</hi> being in the middle of the Water, ſees her ſelf precipitated into theſe diſquiets, in full peace?

                     </note> and ſo he entered upon a ſuddain with an Army of about eighteen thouſand fighting men, and by often skirmiſhing came as far as <hi>Worceſter;</hi> but (either for want of Arms, or will) no body ſtirred for him, but the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> with ſome three hundred men, which were cut in pieces, very few eſcaping, but the ſaid Earl himſelf, who carryed him the newes.</p>
                  <p>General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> being recovered of his ſickneſſe, and informed of this inopinated invaſion, followed him; and the Parliament raiſed alſo new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                     </note> in regard that all the paſsages were ſtopt; ſo that the condition of theſe, was more miſerable, then theirs who died fighting.

                  <p>He was conceived to be ſlain; but the Parliament ordained, that no body, under pain of death, ſhould either lodge, or relieve him, in any wiſe; which begat a ſuſpicion, that he was living, and enjoyed ſome kind of fearfull liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For when he ſaw, that the Battail was loſt, he fled with twelve Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in his company, whom he was forced to leave, for fear of being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and known, retaining only the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> with whom he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an hollow Tree, for the ſpace of two dayes,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Scots</hi> mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus we ſee how Fortune raiſes ſome, and pulls down others: For had <hi>Charles</hi> gotten the Battail, it is very probable, that <hi>England</hi> had been the price of the victory.</p>

                  <p>THe Queen being very often petitioned by the Members of Parliament, to ſet the Princes at liberty, for the Kings ſervice, and the kingdoms quiet, and ſeeing the <hi>Reſolute</hi> run up and down the ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> requiring their deliverance; condeſcended to it: but the Kings Counſell, on the other ſide, was not a little ſtaggered, to hear the importunate voyce of the people, <hi>Live the King, Live the Princes, no Mazarin.</hi>

                  <p>His enemies had now their time, and he not long after, had his. It is better to laugh at laſt, then at firſt. His departure was ignominious, but his return was glorious.

The Parliament of <hi>Roüen</hi> Decreed alſo againſt him.

Some Prodigies preceded this War, which I will ſet down briefly, without ſtaying upon the circumſtances thereof.</p>
                  <p>Oh unhappy Age! No ſooner are we delivered from one misfortune, then we fall into a greater. For theſe united Provinces had no ſooner given thanks to the Almighty for Peace, then they found themſelves ill looked upon, by many Potentates; envied by ſome, and incommodated by others, in their trade. In fine, the miſchief came from that part, which they leaſt ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>Take heer the Prodigies which were ſeen by men of credit, and report thereof made to the States, in this ſubſtance.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Prodigees ſeen neer the mouth of the Sea.</note> 
                     <hi>That upon Fry day the twenty ſecond of</hi> December 1651; <hi>about nine of the clock, ten or twelve leagues from the mouth of the</hi> Moze; <hi>they ſaw a plaine Field, of the hight of a man, about the Horizon, and therein many Souldiers, both foot, and Horſe, which forthwith diſappeared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next, they ſaw, neer about the ſame place, a great Fleet coming from the North, ſome of the Veſſels whereof had their Sayles but half up. By and by, there appeared another from the South-eaſt, which came ſtraight to attack the Former; and then it ſeemed as if all the Ships were ſunk to the bottom; which yet ſhewed themſelves again ſo diſtinctly, that they were able to diſcerne the Ropes, and Cables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſt of all, they ſaw the great Veſſels again, which they had diſcovered firſt. Theſe viſions laſted about three houres. A Lyon, on the North ſide of the Ships, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the laſt Act, under which there appeared animals of different ſhapes, which turned into Ships.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being grown formidable, by <hi>Charles Stewarts</hi> expulſion, whom they quite expelled the Iſland; and by the conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was much intenſe upon War, and deſirous to diminiſh the traffique which hath inriched theſe united Provinces; as by taking the Ships which they met either at Sea, or came into their havens, and then, by giving Letters of Mart.<note place="margin">The begining by Letters of Mart.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon, the complainrs of the <hi>Holland</hi> Marchants obliged the States to ſend their Embaſſadours, to acknowledge them for a Free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth: to renew friendſhip; and to redemand their Veſſels ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point pleaſed them; and the ſecond was payed with ſilence; and the third differred, as never to be granted. The Propoſitions which they made the ſaid Embaſſadours, were ſo high, and beyond their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>High and Might Lords</hi> reſolved upon War.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt theſe things were in agitation, there hapned an encounter betwixt General <hi>Blake,</hi> and Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> about ſtriking,<note place="margin">The firſt attak.</note> wherein <hi>Tromp</hi> was ſo briſkly received, that he had much adoe to get handſomly off, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two ſhips behind him, in the poſſeſſion of the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>This action haſtened the returne of the Embaſſadours; and ſet the States on work, for the fitting of a ſecond Fleet, which was retarded by the wary <hi>Hollanders,</hi> out of hope of compoſing the difference, by repreſenting the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a good harmony betwixt the two Nations.

                  <p>HItherto, we have ſeen the wars begun, and caried on, firſt for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and occupation, or ſeazure of Countries, under the princt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal pretext of Religion; and then there hapned ſo great a Hotchpot, and ſuch a confuſed variety, by the ſhuffling together of ſo many different Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and deceiptful practices; that this precicus Cloak being grown quite thred-bare, could be no longer worne; and therefore the hatred of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and old quarrels, muſt now be brought upon the Stage.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if (according to the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian</hi>) by forging ſo many Religions, there grow at length to be none at all left; with the like founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may I alſo ſay, that by making ſo many various Allyances, which are ſo eaſily broken, and ſo dexterouſly patched together again, there is no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance at all. <hi>I have to do</hi> (ſaid a certain Monarch) <hi>with a bordering people, which never keep their Faith, but when they perceive no occaſion to hurt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this it is, that there is ſo much trouble to make a peace; and they who labour to joyne the two Parties, finde ſo much difficulty, and repugnance, in regard of the indelible diſtruſts, and jealouſies between them, that they cannot accompliſh it.<note place="margin">Sea-Rovers.</note> Beſides, that there have alwayes been Sea-Rovers, who, as The The eves, hidden in the Woods and Forreſts, have ſurprized paſſengers, and laid wait for the Merchants Ships; and at preſent, we ſee whole Fleets, the Sea loaden with Veſſels, to attacke, not by ſtealth, but open force, the ſaid Merchants Ships, and the men of War alſo, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them.

                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Norway,</hi> being ſecured by its poverty feared not, the year before, nor this preſent year neither, the war, wherein the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſeemed ready to involve himſelf.<note place="margin">

                  <p>That Libell which was made in <hi>Sweden,</hi> being waſhed, and wiped off with the blood of the Authours thereof, all was there in good order, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101836:153"/>diligence was uſed for the ſetting out of a little conſiderable Fleet; which gave the bordering parts ſo much jealouſie, that King <hi>Frederick</hi> ſent his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours thither, who returned with a good anſwer.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Muſcovits</hi> did nothing in a long time, which deſerves to be noted here.

                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> made ſome irruptions into <hi>Hungary,</hi> which gave both dammage, and fear by the marching of ſome Troops, but at preſent, the Peace is exactly kept.</p>

                  <p>THis young <hi>Mars,</hi> this invincible Courage, judging his perſon to be more neceſſary at <hi>Paris,</hi> then at <hi>Bourdeans;</hi> left his Lieutenants the direction of his own Forces, ſhewed himſelf quickly amongſt thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Strangers, and made the Marſhal <hi>D'hoquincour</hi> feel, that he was no more in <hi>Guyenne;</hi> for after having loſt his Troops,<note place="margin">Marſhal <hi>D'ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quincour</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> he was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſly. The King made his Army march, under <hi>Turenns</hi> orders, who went to attack <hi>Eſtampes;</hi> but finding the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> to draw near, he retired, and confeſſed that the Strangers who were in the Town, defended themſelves bravely.</p>
                  <p>It looked, as if the Princes would have a good bargaine of all ſuch as made head againſt them; when upon a ſuddain, the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Eldeſt Son, made a contract apart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived mony, and retired himſelf out of the Kingdom; but he ſent back his Army ſhortly after, with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe the reſtitution of the three places promiſed, was not performed.</p>
                  <p>The Prince being irritated, and the <hi>Pariſians</hi> extreamly amazed, began to revile the ſaid <hi>Duke,</hi> and all in fine, diſcourſed of him, according to their paſſion. Some accuſed him of inconſtance, and others of avarice: but ſuch as had a ſtraine above the vulgar, judged that there was ſome vengeance hidden under this action; and that the levity both of the one and the other ſo often manifeſted, to them whoſe aſſiſtance they had both implored, and felt; ought to be recompenſed by a juſt retaliation. Be it what it will, the Princes Troops being tired by frequent Skermiſhes, and by that furious, and bloody ſhock given in the <hi>Faubourgs,</hi> or Suburbs of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> (wherein
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101836:155"/>the <hi>Mazariniſts,</hi> or <hi>Royaliſts</hi> had the worſt) being very much diminiſhed, the Arch-dukes ſuccour was ſent for again, which being conducted by the Baron of <hi>Clinchant,</hi> advanced quite to <hi>Paris.</hi> But let us come back into <hi>Flanders.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mardyke</hi> was abandoned: and <hi>Dunkerk</hi> expecting the relief by Sea, which was dofeated by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was retaken without either; loſſe, or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Thus, were three places reduced to obedience with a hand-full of men, which had coſt the <hi>French</hi> mountains of Gold, and Seas of blood. Who would have ſaid ſo much ſix years before, when there ſeemed to be no doubt at all made, of the utter expulſion of the <hi>Spaniards? Times change, men change, victories are alternative, and nothing is conſtant, but the immutable Order of the Decree of the Everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reduction deſervedly rejoyced all <hi>Flanders,</hi> which ſaw her Traffick, and Inhabitants ſlouriſh again. The Town of <hi>Dunkerk</hi> had been offered to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> for <hi>Maſtricht;</hi> for a ſumme of money, but the bargain was not made.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Paris</hi> ſeeing it ſelf in violent, and murtherous factions; the Parliament in confuſion; the Country People frighted away ſtrangers in the Kingdome; the Princes in a very difficult paſſage to be cleared, and the Clergy afflicted by theſe unhappy diſorders; reſolved to diſpatch the Cardinal <hi>de Retx</hi> to the King, (who was with a new Parliament at <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe</hi>) to beſeech him,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <p>Thus, we ſee the figure turned up-ſide down; the <hi>Cardinal</hi> above the wheel, and the <hi>Princes</hi> under it; ſo that <hi>Conde</hi> choſe rather, to caſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> arms, then to truſt his own Maſters Act of Oblivion; and <hi>Conty</hi> was received at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> together with the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> his Siſter, whileſt her husband ſtayed amongſt the waves of this raging Sea, in his Government.</p>
                  <p>Reader, be not amazed at theſe Metamorphoſes, or changes, for the cauſes thereof are not ſo hard to be comprehended, as that of the Tyde of the Sea was to the Prince of the Philoſophers. What do you hope to ſee, but mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, prodiges, and miracles?</p>

                     <hi>Holland</hi> is ſo ſituated, and her number of ſhipping is ſo great, that there arrive merchandizes from all the Havens of the world, which are tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to other parts, as well by Sea, as by the Navigable Rivers which ſurround it. The People are very open, and plain, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Trade with ſo much induſtry, craft, and cunning, (I ſpeak in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall) that they ſurpaſſe all other Nations of the Univerſe therein. Now, as the <hi>Liver</hi> in mans body makes the <hi>Chylus,</hi> or Concocoction, and diffuſes the blood through all the vaines; juſt ſo <hi>Holland</hi> receives the Merchandizes into her bowels, and ſends them through all the vaines of this world. But the Liver being corrupted, the body cannot long ſubſiſt: ſo the Traffick being ſpoyled; not only this Country, but the other alſo would have too much to ſuffer. Their knowledge in order to the Sea, is ſo perfect, and their proevidence ſo laudable, that they ſeldom make ſhipwrack.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet ſomewhat more; for ambition makes face of the Piramide, which doth not ſhew it ſelf, and is ſtolne from the eyes of the moſt clear-ſighted perſons. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carihage</hi> were in perpetual controverſies.

                  <p>The States having received the troubleſome news of the taking of thoſe ſhips of war which accompanied the fiſhermen, gave order to attack the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by way of retorſion.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> approached; but came off with loſſe, and returned into the <hi>Thames;</hi> and ſo the Fleet arrived in <hi>France,</hi> without any dammage.

                  <p>For the mitigation of Gods wrath, and the diverſion of his ſcourge from the United Provinces, the States ordered prayers to be made every Weducſday at four of the clock in the afternoone, all Shops to be kept ſhut, and all negotiations forborne during the time of the Sermon.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the War indirectly mennadged upon this blew Element, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two moſt potent Nations that are at preſent, or ever have been in all the <hi>North,</hi> for the Dominion of the Ocean, and for the retention of Trade.

                  <p>The ſaid States, being advertiſed of the great preparation which their Enemies were making to attack <hi>Tromp</hi> in his return with the Marchant-Fleet, gave order for the ſpeedy equipaging of ſome other Ships, to go to meet him; but they were hindred by contrary windes.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The end of the Combas was, that <hi>Tromp</hi> retreated into <hi>Calais</hi> Road, and brought back the moſt part of the Fleet into <hi>Holland,</hi> all which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thought to eatch, though they were faine to becontent, with the taking of ſome Marchant Ships, and ſome Men of War; and with letting the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
