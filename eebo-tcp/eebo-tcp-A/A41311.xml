         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHoſo would go about to ſpeak Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s
worth, hath no more to do but onely to Number and
to Name his Writings, as they were written in the
following Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtio Quodlibetica,</hi> or <hi>a Diſcourſe of Uſury,</hi> written
about 1630. and firſt publiſhed in the year 1656.</p>
            <p>Patriarcha, <hi>or the</hi> Natural Right of Kings maintained, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Unnatural Right of the People to Govern, or chuſe
themſelves Governours. <hi>Written about the year 1642. and
never Publiſhed till of late.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Publiſhed in
the year</hi> 1656.</p>
            <p>The Anarchy of a Limited and Mixed Monarchy, <hi>or</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
upon Mr. <hi>Hunton</hi>'s Treatiſe on that Subject. <hi>Firſt
Publiſhed in the year</hi> 1646.</p>
            <p>The Free-holders grand Inqueſt, touching our Soveraign
Lord the King, and his Parliament. <hi>In the year</hi> 1648.</p>
            <p>Of the Power of Kings: and in particular, of the King of
<hi>England. Firſt Publiſhed in the ſame year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations upon Mr.</hi> Hobbes'<hi>s</hi> Leviathan, <hi>Mr.</hi> Milton
<hi>againſt</hi> Salmaſius, <hi>and</hi> H. Grotius <hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi>
concerning <hi>the Original of Government.</hi> To which <hi>thoſe upon
Mr.</hi> Huntons Book being re-printed, were annexed in the year
1652.</p>
            <p>Obſervations upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Politicks, touching Forms of
Government. <hi>Publiſhed in the ſame year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the</hi> Advertiſement to the Jury-men of <hi>England</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Witches, with the difference between an <hi>Engliſh</hi> and an
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Witch. <hi>In the year</hi> 1653.</p>
            <p>Whoſo would give his Writings their due, hath done it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in ſaying that they are His. Of which, who reads any one,
may have ſome cauſe to wonder how he came to be ſufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to write that; but who proceeds yet farther to read them
all, will have more abundant cauſe to wonder, ſhould any elſe but
he have wrote the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53029:3"/>
His Political Writings are chiefly levell'd against a Doctrine
but too generally embrac'd of late <hi>That, all men are born equal.</hi>
To diſprove which, though it might be ſufficient to appeal to the
Practice and Experience of Mankinde, whether all Nations have
not ſtill with one Conſent mounted their Kings upon <hi>Thrones;</hi> and
whether all the Maſters of Philoſophies and Religions have not
conſtantly appeared in their <hi>Chairs,</hi> and in their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> while
their Diſciples have humbly preſented themſelves at their <hi>Feet?</hi>
Not to ſpeak of all the ſeveral Heights of Authority, or extents of
Command, which either Popular Oratory have attained to by their
Wit, or Conquerours have raiſed themſelves to by their Arms. Our
Author himſelf is an undeniable proof of his own Aſſertion, and has
given us the beſt evidence that all men are not equal by Birth,
while he himſelf hath no equal in Writing. So impoſſible is it for
him to treat either of the means of Acquiring, or the Rights of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
Soveraignty, without acquiring and exerciſing a new So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
over his Readers. For does he overcome others? even
we at the ſame time are made Captives without reſiſtance, and are
his by right of Conqueſt. Or does he govern in their ſtead? even
then all Readers are inſenſibly under his Command, as much as if
they were his Subjects, and are his by right of natural Soveraignty.
A Reaſon ſo far exalted above ours as his, makes him appear like
thoſe Kings of old, who were in Stature much ſuperiour to their
Subjects, and ſeemed ſo far to overtop the reſt, as if Nature it ſelf
had marked them out for Heads of all. To be ſhort, no Power,
whoſe Cauſe our Author pleads, can be ſo abſolute, as what he obtains
over us at the ſame time himſelf. And yet of ſo ſweet a Tyranny,
who that are under it can complain? Arguments ſo prevailing, who
is able to withſtand? And where the Maſtery is gained over us by
no other force than that of Perſwaſion, who would forego the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Obedience? The Empire which Wit and Eloquence have
over men, ſeems to be like that Command which Muſick hath over
the Wilde Beaſts, that civilizes and ſubdues them at one and the
ſame time. And we, while we read this Author, feel the higheſt
of rational Pleaſures, even then when we are made at once both
Better Subjects, and Wiſer Men.</p>

            <head>The Power of Kings:
And in Particular,
Of the KING of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O <hi>Majestie</hi> or <hi>Soveraignty</hi> belongeth an <hi>Abſolute
Power</hi> not ſubject to any Law. It behoveth him
that is a Soveraign, not to be in any ſort Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Command of Another; whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is to give Laws unto his Subjects, to Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Laws unprofitable, and in their <hi>ſtead</hi> to Eſtabliſh other;
which he cannot do, that is himſelf Subject to Laws, or to
Others which have Command over him: And this is that
which the Law ſaith, that <hi>The Prince is acquitted from the
Power of the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Laws, Ordinances, Letters-Patents, Priviledges, and
Grants of Princes, have no force but during their Life; if
they be not ratified by the expreſs Conſent, or at leaſt by
Sufferance of the Prince following, who had knowledge
thereof.</p>
            <p>If the Soveraign Prince be exempted from the Laws of his
Predeceſſors, much leſs ſhall he be bound unto the Laws he
maketh Himſelf; for a man may well receive a Law from
Another man, but impoſſible it is in Nature for to give a
Law unto Himſelf, no more than it is to Command a mans
ſelf in a matter depending of his Own Will: <hi>There can be
no Obligation which taketh State from the meer Will of him that
promiſeth the ſame;</hi> which is a neceſſary Reaſon to prove
evidently, that a King cannot binde his Own Hands, albeit
that he would: We ſee alſo in the end of all Laws theſe
words, <hi>Becauſe it hath ſo Pleaſed us;</hi> to give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that the Laws of a Sovereign Prince, although they
be grounded upon Reaſon, yet depend upon nothing but
his meer and frank good Will. But as for the Laws of God,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53029:4"/>
all Princes and People are unto them ſubject; neither is it in
their power to impugne them, if they will not be guilty of
High Treaſon againſt God; under the greatneſs of whom,
all <hi>Monarchs</hi> of the world ought to bow their Heads, in all
fear and reverence.</p>
            <p>A Queſtion may be, <hi>Whether a Prince be ſubject to the Laws
of his Countrey that he hath ſworn to keep, or not?</hi> If a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Prince promiſe by Oath to his Subjects to keep the
Laws, he is bound to keep them; not for that a Prince
is bound to keep his Laws by himſelf or by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
but by the juſt Conventions and Promiſes
which he hath made himſelf; be it by Oath, or without any
Oath at all, as ſhould a private man be: and for the ſame
cauſes that a Private man may be relieved from his unjuſt and
unreaſonable Promiſe, as for that it was ſo grievous, or for
that he was by deceit or fraud Circumvented, or induced
thereunto by Errour, or Force, or juſt Fear, or by ſome
great Hurt; even for the ſame cauſes the Prince may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
in that which toucheth the diminiſhing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:
And ſo our <hi>Maxime</hi> reſteth, <hi>That the Prince is not
ſubject to His Laws, nor to the Laws of his Predeceſſors, but
well to his Own juſt and reaſonable Conventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soveraign Prince may derogate from the Laws that
he hath promiſed and ſworn to keep, if the Equity thereof
ceaſe, and that of himſelf, without Conſent of his Subjects;
which his Subjects cannot do among Themſelves, if they be
not by the Prince relieved.</p>
            <p>The Forraign Princes well-adviſed, will never take Oath
to keep the Laws of their Predeceſſors; for otherwiſe they
are not Sovereigns.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all Oaths, the Prince may Derogate
from the Laws, or Fruſtrate or Diſanul the ſame, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Equity of them ceaſing.</p>
            <p>There is not any Bond for the Soveraign Prince to keep the
Laws, more than ſo far as Right and Juſtice requireth.</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be found, that the Antient Kings of the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> took any Oaths, no not they which were Anointed
by <hi>Samuel, Elias,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>As for General and Particular, which concern the Right
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53029:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of men in Private, they have not uſed to be otherwiſe
Changed, but after General Aſſemblies of the Three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
in <hi>France;</hi> not for that it is neceſſary for the Kings to
reſt on their Advice, or that he may not do the Contrary
to that they demand, if natural Reaſon and Juſtice do ſo
require. And in that the Greatneſs and Majeſty of a true
Soveraign Prince is to be known, when the Eſtates of all
the People aſſembled together in all Humility preſent their
Requeſts and Supplications to their Prince, without having
any Power in any thing to Command, or Determine, or to
give Voice; but that that which it pleaſeth the King to Like
or Diſlike, to Command or Forbid, is holden for Law.
Wherein they which have written of the Duty of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
have deceived themſelves, in maintaining that the
Power of the People is greater than the Prince; a thing
which oft-times cauſeth the true Subjects to revolt from the
Obedience which they owe unto their Soveraign Prince,
aud miniſtreth matter of great Troubles in Commonwealths;
of which their Opinion, there is neither reaſon nor ground.</p>
            <p>If the King ſhould be Subject unto the Aſſemblies and
Decrees of the People, he ſhould neither be King nor Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and the Commonwealth neither Realm nor Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
but a meer <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> of many Lords in Power equal,
where the Greater part commandeth the leſs; and whereon
the Laws are not to be publiſhed in the Name of him that
Ruleth, but in the Name and Authority of the Eſtates; as
in an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Seignory, where he that is Chief hath no
Power, but oweth Obeiſance to the Seignory; unto whom
yet they every one of them feign themſelves to owe their
Faith and Obedience: which are all things ſo abſurd, as hard
it is to ſee which is furtheſt from Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When</hi> Charles <hi>the eighth, the</hi> French <hi>King, then but Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years old, held a Parliament at</hi> Tours, <hi>although the
Power of the Parliament was never Before nor After ſo great,
as in thoſe Times; yet</hi> Relli <hi>then the Speaker for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
turning himſelf to the King, thus beginneth:</hi> Moſt High,
moſt Mighty, and moſt Chriſtian King, our Natural and Onely
Lord; we poor, humble, and obedient Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are
come hither by your Command, in all Humility, Reverence, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53029:5"/>
Subjection, preſent our ſelves before you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And have given
me in charge from all this Noble Aſſembly to declare unto You,
the good Will and hearty deſire they have, with a moſt fervent
Reſolution to Serve, Obey, and Aid You in all your Affairs,
Commandments, and Pleaſures. <hi>All this Speech is nothing
elſe but a Declaration of their good Will towards the King,
and of their humble Obedience and Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like Speech was uſed in the Parliament at <hi>Orleans</hi> to
<hi>Charles</hi> the 9th, when he was ſcarce Eleven Years old.</p>
            <p>Neither are the Parliaments in <hi>Spain</hi> otherwiſe holden, but
that even a greater Obedience of all the People is given to
the King; as is to be ſeen in the Acts of the Parliament at
<hi>Toledo</hi> by King <hi>Philip,</hi> 1552. when he yet was ſcarce Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Five Years old. The Anſwers alſo of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
unto the Requeſts and humble Supplications of his People,
are given in theſe words: <hi>We will,</hi> or elſe, <hi>We Decree or
Ordain;</hi> yea, the Subſidies that the Subjects pay unto the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they call <hi>Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> which have commonly been
holden every Third Year, the Eſtates ſeem to have a great
Liberty, (as the Northern People almoſt all breathe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
yet ſo it is, that in effect they proceed not, but by
way of Supplications and Requeſts to the King. As in the
Parliament holden in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1566. when the Eſtates by a
common Conſent had reſolved (as they gave the Queen to
underſtand) not to Treat of any thing, until She had firſt
Appointed who ſhould Succeed Her in the Crown; She gave
them no other Anſwer, but <hi>That they were not to make her
Grave before ſhe were Dead.</hi> All whoſe Reſolutions were to
no purpoſe without Her good liking, neither did She in that
any thing that they requeſted.</p>
            <p>Albeit by the Sufferance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
between the King and his People are ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the High Court of Parliament; yet all the Eſtates
remain in full ſubjection to the King, who is no way bound
to follow their Advice, neither to conſent to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates of <hi>England</hi> are never otherwiſe Aſſembled,
no more than they are in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> than by Parliament-Writs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53029:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and expreſs Commandments, proceeding from the
King; which ſheweth very well, that the Eſtates have no
Power of themſelves to Determine, Command, or Decree
any thing; ſeeing they cannot ſo much as Aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
neither being Aſſembled, Depart without expreſs
Commandment from the King.</p>
            <p>Yet this may ſeem one ſpecial thing, that the Laws made
by the King of <hi>England,</hi> at the Requeſt of the Eſtates, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be again repealed, but by calling a Parliament; though
we ſee <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to have always uſed his Soveraign
Power, and with his only word to have diſannulled the
Decrees of Parliament.</p>
            <p>We conclude the Majeſty of a Prince to be nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
or diminiſhed by the Calling together, or Preſence of
the Eſtates: But to the contrary, His Majeſty thereby to be
much the Greater and the more Honourable, ſeeing all His
People to acknowledge Him for their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>We ſee the principal Point of Soveraign Majeſty and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Power to conſiſt principally in giving Laws unto the
Subjects without their Conſent. It behoveth, that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Prince ſhould have the Laws in his Power, to Change
and Amend them according as Occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> every one in particular muſt ſwear to the
Obſervation of the Laws, and their Allegiance to One Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<hi>Monarch;</hi> who, next unto God, (of whom he holds
his Scepter and Power) is bound to No Man: For an Oath
carrieth always with it Reverence unto whom, and in whoſe
Name it is made, as ſtill given to a Superiour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Vaſſal gives ſuch Oath unto his Lord, but receives
None from Him again, though they be mutually Bound, the
One of them to the Other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trajan</hi> ſwore to keep the Laws, although he under the
name of a Soveraign Prince was exempted; but never any of
the Emperours before him ſo ſware: Therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> the
Younger, in a <hi>Panegyrical Oration,</hi> ſpeaking of the Oath of
<hi>Trajan,</hi> gives out, <hi>A great Novelty,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and never before
heard of, He ſweareth, by whom we ſwear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe two things the one muſt come to paſs, to wit,
the Prince that ſwears to keep the Laws of his Country, muſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53029:6"/>
either not have the Soveraignty, or elſe become a Perjur'd
Man, if he ſhould but Abrogate but one Law contrary to
his Oath; whereas it is not only Profitable that a Prince
ſhould ſometimes Abrogate ſome ſuch Laws, but alſo Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for him to Alter or Correct them, as the infinite Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Places, Times and Perſons ſhall require: Or if we ſhall
ſay, the Prince to be ſtill a Soveraign, and yet nevertheleſs
with ſuch conditions, that he can make no Law without the
Advice of his Councel or People; He muſt alſo be Diſpenſed
with by his Subjects, for the Oath which he hath made for the
Obſervation of the Laws; and the Subjects again which are
obliged to the Laws, have alſo need to be Diſpenſed withal
by their Prince, for fear they ſhould be Perjur'd: So ſhall it
come to paſs, that the Majeſty of the Commonweal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
now to this ſide, now to that ſide; ſometimes the
Prince, ſometimes the People bearing ſway, ſhall have no
Certainty to reſt upon; which are notable Abſurdities, and
altogether incompatible with the Majeſty of Abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
and contrary both to Law and Reaſon. And yet
we ſee many men, that think they ſee more in the matter
than others, will maintain it to be moſt Neceſſary, that
Princes ſhould be bound by Oath, to keep the Laws and
Cuſtoms of their Countreys: In which doing, they weaken
and overthrow all the Rights of Soveraign Majeſty, which
ought to be moſt Sacred and Holy, and confound the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of One Soveraign <hi>Monarch,</hi> with an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> or
<hi>Democracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Publication, or Approbation of Laws, in the Aſſembly of
the Eſtates or Parliament, is with us of great importance for
the keeping of the Laws; not that the Prince cannot of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
make a Law, without the Conſent of the Eſtates or
People (for even all his Declarations of War, Treaties of
Peace, Valuations of the Coin, Charters to enable Towns to
ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, and his Writ of Summons to
both Houſes to Aſſemble, are Laws, though made without
the Conſent of the Eſtates or People;) but it is a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
part to do it by the good liking of the Senate.</p>
            <p>What if a Prince by Law forbid to Kill or Steal, is he not
Bound to obey his own Laws? I ſay, that this Law is not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53029:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His, but the Law of God, whereunto all Princes are more
ſtraitly bound than their Subjects; God taketh a ſtricter
account of Princes than others, as <hi>Solomon</hi> a King hath ſaid;
whereto agreeth <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Magiſtrates are
Judges over private men, Princes judge the Magiſtrates, and
God the Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not only a Law of Nature, but alſo oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
among the Laws of God, that we ſhould be Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto the Laws of ſuch Princes, as it hath pleaſed God
to ſet to Rule and Reign over us; if their Laws be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
Repugnant unto the Laws of God, whereunto all
Princes are as well bound as their Subjects: For as the Vaſſal
oweth his Oath of Fidelity unto his Lord, towards and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all men, except his Soveraign Prince: So the Subject
oweth his Obedience to his Soveraign Prince, towards and
againſt all, the Majeſty of God excepted, who is the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Soveraign of All the Princes in the World.</p>
            <p>To confound the ſtate of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> with the <hi>Popular</hi> or
<hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> eſtate, is a thing impoſſible, and in effect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible,
and ſuch as cannot be imagined: For Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
being of it ſelf Indiviſible, How can it at one and
the ſame time be Divided betwixt One Prince, the Nobility,
and the People in common? The firſt Mark of Sovereign
Majeſty is, to be of Power to give Laws, and to Command
over them unto the Subjects: And who ſhould thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
be that ſhould yield their Obedience to the Law, if
they ſhould have alſo Power to make the Laws? Who
ſhould He be that could Give the Law, being he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to Receive it of them, unto whom he himſelf Gave it?
So that of neceſſity we muſt conclude, that as no One in
particular hath the Power to make the Law in ſuch a State,
that there the State muſt needs be Popular.</p>
            <p>Never any Commonwealth hath been made of an <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi>
and Popular Eſtate, much leſs of all the Three Eſtates
of a Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Such States, wherein the Right of Soveraignty is Divided
are not rightly to be called Commonweals, but rather the
Corruption of Commonweals; as <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath moſt brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but truely written.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53029:7"/>
Commonweals which change their State, the Soveraign
Right and Power of them being Divided, finde no reſt from
Civil Wars.</p>
            <p>If the Prince be an Abſolute Soveraign, as are the true <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland, Turkey, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovy,
Tartary, Perſia, Aethiopia, India,</hi> and almoſt of all the
Kingdoms of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> where the Kings themſelves
have the Soveraignty, without all doubt or queſtion, not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with their Subjects: In this caſe it is not lawful for any
One of the Subjects in particular, or all of them in general,
to attempt any thing, either by way of Fact or of Juſtice,
againſt the Honour, Life, or Dignity of the Soveraign, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he had committed all the Wickedneſs, Impiety, and
Cruelty that could be ſpoke. For as to proceed againſt
Him by way of Juſtice, the Subject hath not ſuch Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over his Soveraign Prince, of whom dependeth all
Power to Command, and who may not only Revoke all
the Power of his Magiſtrates, but even in whoſe Preſence
the Power of all Magiſtrates, Corporations, Eſtates and
Communities ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Now if it be not l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wful for the Subject by the way of
Juſtice to proceed againſt a King, How ſhould it then be
lawful to proceed againſt him by way of Fact or Force?
For queſtion is not here what men are able to do by Strength
and Force, but what they ought of Right to do; as not
whether the Subject have Power and Strength, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have lawful Power to Condemn their Soveraign
Prince.</p>
            <p>The Subject is not only guilty of Treaſon in the higheſt
Degree, who hath Slain his Soveraign Prince, but even he
alſo which hath Attempted the ſame, who hath given
Counſel or Conſent thereto; yea, if he have Concealed the
ſame, or but ſo much as Thought it: Which Fact the
Laws have in ſuch Deteſtation, as that when a man guilty of
any Offence or Crime, dyeth before he be condemned thereof,
he is deemed to have died in whole and perfect Eſtate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he have conſpired againſt the Life and Dignity of his
Soveraign Prince. This only thing they have thought to be
ſuch, as that for which he may worthily ſeem to have been
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53029:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now already Judged and Condemned; yea, even before he was
thereof Accuſed. And albeit the Laws inflict no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Evil Thoughts of men, but on thoſe only
which by Word or Deed break out into ſome Enormity;
yet if any man ſhall ſo much as conceit a Thought for the
Violating of the Perſon of his Soveraign Prince, although he
have Attempted nothing, they have yet Judged this ſame
Thought worthy of Death, notwithſtanding what Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
ſoever he have had thereof.</p>
            <p>Leſt any men ſhould think [Kings or Princes] themſelves
to have been the Authors of theſe Laws, ſo the more ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to provide for their own Safety and Honour; let us fee
the Laws and Examples of Holy <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> with Fire and Sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all the Country of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
took it, rob'd and razed it down to the ground, burnt the
<hi>Temple,</hi> and defiled the <hi>Sanctuary of God,</hi> ſlew the King, with
the greateſt part of the people, carrying away the reſt into
Captivity into <hi>Babylon,</hi> cauſed the Image of himſelf made
in Gold to be ſet up in Publick place, commanding all
men to Adore and Worſhip the ſame, upon pain of being
Burnt alive, and cauſed them that refuſed ſo to do, to be
caſt into a burning <hi>Furnace.</hi> And yet for all that, the holy
Prophets [<hi>Baruch 1. Jeremy</hi> 29.] directing their Letters unto
their Brethren the <hi>Jews,</hi> then in Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> will
them to pray unto God for the good and happy Life of
<hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> and his Children, and that they might ſo long
Rule and Reign over them, as the Heavens ſhould endure:
Yea even God himſelf doubted not to call <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi>
his Servant, ſaying, <hi>That he would make him the moſt Mighty
Prince of the world;</hi> and yet was there never a more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
Tyrant than he: who not contented to be Himſelf
Worſhipped, but cauſed his Image alſo to be Adored, and
that upon pain of being burnt quick.</p>
            <p>We have another rare Example of <hi>Saul,</hi> who poſſeſſed
with an evil Spirit, cauſed the Prieſts of the <hi>Lord</hi> to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
iuſt Cauſe ſlain, for that one of them had received <hi>David</hi>
flying from him; and did what in his power was to kill, or
cauſe to be kill'd, the ſame <hi>David,</hi> a moſt innocent Prince,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53029:8"/>
by whom he had got ſo many Victories; at which time he
fell twice himſelf into <hi>David</hi>'s Hands: who blamed of his
Souldiers for that he would not ſuffer his ſo mortal Enemy,
then in his power, to be Slain, being in aſſured Hope to
have enjoyed the Kingdom after his Death; he deteſted their
Counſel, ſaying, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſuffer the Perſon of
a King, the Lords Anointed, to be violated.</hi> Yea, he himſelf
defended the ſame King perſecuting of him, when as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Souldiers of his Guard, overcome by Wine and
Sleep, to be wakened.</p>
            <p>And at ſuch time as <hi>Saul</hi> was ſlain, and that a Souldier,
thinking to do <hi>David</hi> a pleaſure, preſented him with <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Head; <hi>David</hi> cauſed the ſame Souldier to be Slain, which
had brought him the Head, ſaying, <hi>Go thou Wicked; How
durſt thou lay thy impure Hands upon the Lords Anointed? Thou
ſhalt ſurely Die therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And afterwards, without all Diſtimulation, mourned Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for the dead King. All which is worth good conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for <hi>David</hi> was by <hi>Saul</hi> proſecuted to Death, and yet
wanted not Power to have revenged Himſelf, being become
Stronger than the King; beſides, he was the Choſen of God,
and Anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> to be King, and had Married the
King's Daughter: And yet for all that, he abhorred to take
upon him the Title of a King, and much more to Attempt
any thing againſt the Life or Honour of <hi>Saul,</hi> or to Rebel
againſt him; but choſe rather to Baniſh himſelf out of the
Realm, than in any ſort to ſeek the Kings Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>We doubt not but <hi>David,</hi> a King and a Prophet, led by
the Spirit of God, had always before his Eyes the Law of
God, <hi>Exod. 22. 28. Thou ſhalt not ſpeak Evil of thy Prince,
nor detract the Magiſtrate;</hi> neither is there any thing more
common in Holy Scripture, than the forbidding not only to
Kill or Attempt the Life or Honour of a Prince, but even
for the very Magiſtrates, although, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>They
be Wicked and Naught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> before they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, demanded of <hi>Martin
Luther,</hi> if it were Lawful for them ſo to do, or not; who
frankly told them, That it was not Lawful, whatſoever Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53029:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or Impiety were pretended; yet was he not therein by
them Believed; ſo, thereof, enſued a Deadly and moſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
War, the End whereof was moſt Miſerable; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with in, the Ruine of many great and noble Houſes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> with exceeding ſlaughter of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Prince, whom you may juſtly call the Father of the
Country, ought to be to every man Dearer and more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
than any Father, as one Ordained and Sent unto us by
God. The Subject is never to be ſuffered to Attempt any
thing againſt the Prince, how Naughty and Cruel ſoever he
be: lawful it is, not to obey him in things contrary to the
Laws of God, to Flie and Hide our ſelves from him; but yet
to ſuffer Stripes, yea, and Death alſo, rather than to Attempt
any thing againſt his Life and Honour. O how many Tyrants
ſhould there be, if it ſhould be lawful for Subjects to kill Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants?
How many good and innocent Princes ſhould as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
periſh by the Conſpiracy of their Subjects againſt them?
He that ſhould of his Subjects but exact Subſidies, ſhould be
then, as the Vulgar People eſteem him, a Tyrant: He that
ſhould Rule and Command contrary to the good Liking of
the People, ſhould be a Tyrant: He that ſhould keep ſtrong
Guards and Garriſons for the ſafety of his Perſon, ſhould be a
Tyrant: He that ſhould put to death Traitors and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
againſt his State, ſhould be alſo counted a Tyrant. How
ſhould good Princes be aſſured of their Lives, if under colour of
Tyranny they might be Slain by their Subjects, by whom they
ought to be Defended?</p>
            <p>In a well-ordered State, the Soveraign Power muſt remain
in One onely, without Communicating any part thereof unto
the State, (for in that caſe it ſhould be a Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and no <hi>Monarchy.</hi>) Wiſe <hi>Polititians, Philoſophers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
and <hi>Hiſtoriographers,</hi> have highly commended a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
above all other Common-weals. It is not to pleaſe the
Prince, that they hold this Opinion; but for the Safety and
Happineſs of the Subjects. And contrarywiſe, when as they
ſhall Limit and Reſtrain the Soveraign Power of a <hi>Monarch,</hi>
to Subject him to the General Eſtates, or to the Council; the
Soveraignty hath no firm Foundation, but they frame a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Confuſion, or a miſerable <hi>Anarchy,</hi> which is the Plague of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53029:9"/>
all Eſtates and Commonweals: The which muſt be duely
conſidered, not giving credit to their goodly Diſcourſes,
which perſwade Subjects, that it is neceſſary to ſubject <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,</hi>
and to give their Prince a Law; for that is not
only the Ruine of the <hi>Monarch,</hi> but alſo of the Subjects. It
is yet more ſtrange, that many hold Opinion, that the
Prince is ſubject to his Laws, that is to ſay, ſubject to his
Will, whereon the Laws which he hath made depend; a
thing impoſſible in Nature. And under this Colour, and
ill-digeſted Opinion, they make a mixture and confuſion of
Civil Laws, with the Laws of Nature and of God.</p>
            <p>A pure Abſolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the ſureſt Commonweal, and
without Compariſon, the Beſt of all. Wherein many are
abuſed, who maintain that an <hi>Optimacy</hi> is the beſt kinde of
Government; for that many Commanders have more Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Wiſdome, and Counſel, than One alone. For there
is a great difference betwixt Councel and Commandment.</p>
            <p>The Councel of Many wiſe men may be better than of
One; But to Reſolve, Determine, and to Command, One
will always perform it better than Many: He which hath
adviſedly digeſted All their Opinions, will ſoon Reſolve
without Contention; the which Many cannot eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form:
It is neceſſary to have a Soveraign Prince, which may
have Power to Reſolve and Determine of the Opinions of
his Council.</p>
