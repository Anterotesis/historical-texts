         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Muche rather a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine shoulde require that all lawes be squared accordinge to the iustice of God. The seconde reason: the Prince muste be abridged of the prerogatiue of perdoninge. The question in myn opinion, is not whether a Prince maye forbeare the execution of a sentence vpon good respectes, but whether he maye make a lawe contrarye to Gods eternall iustice. The thirde reason: punishments of deathe for fellonye muste be mitigated, &amp;c. Suerlye suche maye be the circunstaunces that in some cases in conscience they ought to be mitigated, and in some cases they maye be increased. when Dauid pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sentence of deathe, accordinge to the case that was put vnto hym by Nathan the prophete 2. Sam. 12. he increased the punishment of fellonye, yet he decreed not contrarye to the iustice of God. The reste that followeth of lawyers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge awaye ther bookes, and priests becomminge iudges, I take to be but Iestinge, vnsemely for so serious matters: as for the auctorities he alleageth out of Musculus, Hemingius, Caluine, &amp;c. reade them who will with any indifferencye, and he shall fynde nothinge in them contrarye to the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of T.C but rather agreable to the same: wherefore in my symple iudgment, this doctryne tendeth not to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of states of Commonwealthe, &amp;c. But rather this assertion of M <hi>D</hi> printed in great letters
("That the iudiciall lawe is leste to the discrescion of the magistrate to adde to yt or to take from yt, or to alter and chaunge yt as yt shalbe thought moste fytt, &amp;c.")
tendethe to the settinge vp of all tyrannie and confusion, and to the ouerthrowe of all well ordered common wealthes. For yf ther be no certayne rule of iustice in that lawe, whiche is immutable (as there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite circunstaunces mutable) it is in the discrescion of the magistrate be he wyse or vnwyse, godly or wicked as yt shalbe thought fytt by hym (for who muste be iudge of the fyttnes but he to whose discrescion yt is lefte?) to decree all thinges at his pleasure, then maye he punysh a trespas of three halfpence damage by treble tormentes of deathe, and assesse a parricide at three halfpence fyne: he may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe an incestuous person with a fyllip and persecute a fyllyp giuen with fyer and faggott.

not see what accusation M D can haue agaynst hym. As for the differens he putteth of bringinge the Churche to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and preseruing yt therein, is needles in this place, for T, C speaketh not onelye of layinge the foundation of the Churche, but of bringynge it to perfection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate vnitie in Christe the heade, whiche of force impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth continuance to the ende.</p>
            <p n="10">10 <hi>He holdeth that it were more safe for vs, to conforme oure indifferent ceremonies to the Turkes whiche are farre of, then to the Papiste whiche are so neare: whiche can not be so, for the Turkes vtterly denye Christe, and be voyde of all Christian ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. pag</hi> 475.</p>

I had rather abhorre all images with the Turkes, then committ idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with the Papistes, and yet I lyke nether of bothe. Suche comparatiue sayinges do not imploy a simple allowinge of ether of the thinges compared, as when they comonlye saye: I had rather be combred with an ague then with a curste wyfe, they meane to cherishe nother the one nor the other, yf they maye chuse. So I am perswaded that T. <hi>C.</hi> wysheth nether Turkysh ceremonies nor Popishe, and yet ther were lesse hurte in Turkishe ceremonies, then in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe. to be vsed of vs, because of greater offence growinge in the vse of one, whiche is neare and knowen, then in vse of the other that is farre of and vnknowen.

But from Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils and Turkes we differ wholy in matter and substaunce of relligion, from the Papistes we differ not wholy in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and substaunce. Truely if Antichrist differ wholy from Christ in matter and substaunce Antichristian religion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth wholy from Christian religion in matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce.

Therefore as we differ wholy in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and substaunce of oure Religion from the dyuells, so doe we from the Papistes.

In these the secret consent of the Churche receyuinge them for mynisters vntill there wicked vsurpation be espied maye be sufficient to auctoryse, there mynisterie, towards others, althoughe they haue no grounde of there callinge in them selues. Nowe, it is another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether a woman, or a laye man whiche professeth hym self to be no mynister, yf he presume to baptize doe mynister the Sacrament, or in deede abuse the Sacrament. In this I will determine nothinge my self, but onely I will let you see by certeyne reasons that the matter is not so cleare as <hi>M. D.</hi> woulde seme to make it First it is manifest that T. <hi>C</hi> woulde haue no rebaptization: because he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20574:8"/>
Secondly I am throughly resolued that nether any laye man or any woman oughte to take vpon them to baptize. For there is no suche necessitie of the outward element that the institut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on of Christe shoulde be broken for yt. But yf a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man haue presumed to breake the ordinaunce of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she haue mynistred the holye Sacrament is all the doubte. I woulde aske of M. Whytgifte (if I were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with hym) yf a woman presume to mynister the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whether she giue the bodye and bloude of Christe or no, yf he saye no. I woulde knowe why she shoulde rather giue the one Sacrament then the other, for I suppose he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth the Popishe opinion of the necessytie of Baptisme, and yet I maye doubt, because of the auctorities whiche he alleadgeth out of Tertulliane, Ambrose, Ierome, Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and Zwinglius where he was not best aduised. Moreouer, because he affirmeth that the onely essentiall forme of Baptisme is to baptise in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holye Ghost. I woulde haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired also whether yf the element be chaunged as well as the mynister yet the Baptisme is allowable: as there is great question amonge the Papistes, yf Baptisme be myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with wyne, mylke, brothe, and other more vile liquor whether yt be sufficient: but that he seemeth to allowe the Baptisme of sande in the fabulus storye, so water were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde sprinkled on and then aryseth another dunsicall question: yf those wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the booke very godlye and soundlye appeareth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire syxe thinges vnto lawfull and perfecte baptisme. First, one that hathe auctoritie to baptise, for els the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion were in vayne, yf all men and women might lawfully baptise, secondlye wytnesses or a congregation, which bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism ought to be ministred, thirdly, inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods name, whiche as it dothe consecrate all holye actions so yt ought not to be seuered from the admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: fourthly, the element of water accordinge to the institution of Christe, and not sande, milke, or suche lyke baggadge. Fyftlye, the wordes of Christes institution that baptisme be mynistred in the name of the holye Trinitie. Lastely fayth in them that haue mynistred the Sacrament, that they maye be assured they haue done all thinges required by the worde of God, for what so euer is not of fayth is synne.
<q>And if the mynister shall proue by the aunswers of suche as brought the childe, that all thynges were doone as they ought to be, then shall he not baptise the childe againe, but receiue hym as one of the flocke of Christ, But yf they make an vncertayne aunswere to those questions and saye they can not tell what they thought, did, or sayde, in that feare, &amp;c. He is appoincted to baptise hym in this forme, yf thou be not baptised alreadye then I baptise the in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holye Ghoste:</q>
you see by the iudgement of the booke, that the outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonye not vsed as it ought to be, or not certaynlye knowen, whether it hathe been rightly vsed, maye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated againe, and yet no rebaptisation commytted, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistrie allowed. As for example, yf aunswere were made to the fourthe question, that the childe was baptised with sande or with ashes, mylke, wyne, or with any thing but water, yf I were mynister I woulde no more doubte to baptise the childe by the worde of God, and the direction of the booke, then any that hathe had no ceremonie of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme vsed towards hym. And yf aunswere were made to M.<hi>D.</hi> in the fyfte question, that the childe was baptised into the name of God and our ladye, I suppose he woulde not thinke yt to be rightly baptised, but woulde baptise it hym self into the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holye Ghoste. And if vnto the last question it were aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them that tooke vpon them to baptise, that they coulde not tell whether the childe so baptised by them were lawfully and perfectly baptised.

"That they offende not anye, especiallie the Churche of God."
S. Paule sayeth. Be suche as giue no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence nether to the Iewes, nor to the grecians, nor to the Churche of God Now whether those that are weake in the Churche of God are especially to be consydered rather then Iewes or Gentills whiche are out of the Churche, is all the question. M. <hi>D.</hi> sayeth they that are out of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20574:15"/>
Churche are especiallye to be regarded. But he onelye sayeth it without other reason or auctorytie. For reason of the contrarye syde this maye be sayde: that as charytie is the chiefe rule in auoydinge offences and charytie regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth especially those that are of the how shoulde of faythe, so we muste haue especiall care not to offende them. The Apostle also speaketh moste of them teachinge to auoyde offences calling them thy brother, thy weake brother, those for whom Christ dyed, &amp;c Rom 14 1. Cor 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>He opposeth Ignatius and Tertullian, to Ambrose and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, as thoughe Ambrose and Augustine shoulde thinke it to be lawefull to faste on the Lords daye, and the other two should wrytte the contrarie: whereas Ambrose and Augustine fullye agree with Ignatius and Tertullian in that matter pag</hi> 99.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The wordes of T. C. be these.
<q>I will not enter nowe to discusse whether it were well donne to faste in al places accordinge to the custome of the place you oppose Ambrose and Augustine. I coulde oppose Ignatius and Tertullian, whereof the one sayeth that it is nefas a detestable thinge to faste vpon the Lordes daye, the other that it is to kill the Lorde, and this is the inconuenience that commeth of suche vnlearned kinde of reasoninge Sainte Ambrose sayethe so, and therfore it is true.</q>
In the 99 pag this is noted to be an vntruthe procedinge of ignoraunce, but in deede this a false and a proude Censure proceding of malyce and arrogance, as thoughe T. C coulde not tell what difference is betwene the Sabbat and the Lordes daye I shoulde haue reade these wordes an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth tymes, and neuer vnderstoode that he opposeth Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and Tertullian to Ambrose and Augustine, but to M. D. Whytgifte, and his kinde of reasoninge as M. Whytgifte op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth Ambrose and Augustine to his aduersarye. For yf the auctoryties of Ambrose and Augustine be irrefragable for fastinge one satterdaye, then the auctoryties of Ignatius and Tertullian are the lyke touchinge fastinge one Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye: which notwithstanding are meare absurdities But as it is not so haynouse an offence to faste on Sondaye, because Ignatius and Tertullian saye so: So no more is the rule of fastinge one satterdaye true because Ambrose and Augustine saye so.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>He mangleth sainte Augustines words bothe before, behinde and in the middest pag</hi> 107.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This is a friuolous quarellinge for T. C. pretendeth not to recyte the wordes of Augustine, nor to translate them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20574:16"/>
into Englysh, but onlye to giue the somme of his meaninge. whiche he dothe sufficientlye to showe that M. D. hathe no greate grounde in that epistell ad Ianuarium, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Pag</hi> 144 <hi>he falsefyeth the woords of saint Paule</hi> 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 3. <hi>and vntruelye translateth them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 Yt is no smale offence to falsefye the worde of God, and therefore M. W. shoulde be well aduised before he accuse his brother of so horrible a crime. God forbyd that euery one whiche erreth in translation, shoulde be a falsefyer of Godes worde muche lesse he that giueth suche a translation as the originall worde will beare, whiche I thinke T. C. dothe in this place: his wordes are pag. 144.
<q>And beinge tryed lett them execute there functions, as longe as theye remaine blameles.</q>
Firste he translateth not worde for worde, for then he woulde haue sayd, and lett them be tryed fyrste, and then lett them minister beinge blamelesse. So that it maye well be, that he mente onlye to gather an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Apostles wordes, who yf he will not haue Deacons admitted to minister before they be tryed, and in try all founde blameles, no more woulde he haue them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to remayne in that office yf they do not contynewe blameles. What falsefyinge is here ether of the wordes or of the meaninge of the Apostle. But yf he ment to translate those wordes 'anegclytoi 'ontes so longe as they remaine blameles: Theye are better Grecians then M. <hi>D.</hi> is compted to be that thinke it maye stand bothe with signification of the worde, and with the circunstaunce of the place, for S. Paule dothe not only speake of election of Deacons: but also of suche qualities as shoulde contynewe in them after they be chosen. Therefore yf it be an errour (whiche wilbe harde for M. <hi>D.</hi> to proue) it is no errour in matter, but in translation and no falsification: except M. <hi>D.</hi> wilbe compted a falsefier for reading out of the 12. of the Apocalypse verse 11 and expoundinge it also accordinge to his readinge
"by the worde of his testimonie,"

This was vttered within these two or thre yeres in a sermon at Paules crosse, and noted by manye learned man, whiche had there greake Testaments, whereof one syttinge by me sayd, that before that tyme he thought M <hi>W</hi> had been a verye good Grecian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but nowe he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the contrarye that he coulde not so muche as reade his
