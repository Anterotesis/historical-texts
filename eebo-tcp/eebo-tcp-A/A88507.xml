            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE NEVER TOO MUCH TO

            <head type="sub">Whoſe Hearſe was upon Wedneſday <date>the 19th day of January, 1642.</date> Solemnly conducted from King-ſtreet in Weſtminſter,
through the Citie of London, to the Pariſh of St. Stephens Coleman-ſtreet, by above two hundred Apprentiſes, with ſwords
and black Ribbands, in Funerall equipage; and with above four hundred Citizens, all in mourning, with

might have prevented: but the latter, never with all your lamentations. Come and weepe
over him, whom with all your teares you cannot recover again, whoſe each drop of
bloud out-weighs an Ocean of that corrupted Fountain, which lyes hid in the veines of thoſe
who were his, and our Common-wealths inceſtive enemies: had not his loyall and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart bin animated with the true love of his King, Religion and Country, he eaſily might
have put offraſhneſſe, which by more grave, and more cautelous Stateſmen of our republick,
is accounted wiſdome, and exempted himſelf from danger, and not expoſed his laſt bloud
to ſuch eminent misfortune: but as he was borne more for us all, then for himſelfe, hee hath
ventured what he hath loſt, <hi>Supremum Spiritum:</hi> Although all be for his better purchaſe
which is Heaven, in ſo good a cauſe.</p>
            <p>I need not relate to you the circumſtance of his fatall blow, which he received amongſt the
promiſcuous conſent of Raſcals in Weſtminſter-hall: where he ſtoutly fought, <hi>Pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> but God who knew him more
ripe for heaven then for earth, determined it the ſecond cauſe of his death, and ſo took him from us, who are unworthy of him,
or ſuch as he is, and received him to himſelf, a fit companion for the Quire of heaven: his body onely being left for its due rites
of Sepulcre, was ſuddenly received, being (wonderfull to conſider) by the Apprentiſes of <hi>London,</hi> being above 200. in their
orders. Together with 400. of grave Citizens ſadly pacing along with their tears in their eyes, in commemoration that not
long before they joyfully conducted him alive, with the reſt of thoſe moſt worthy Members, from whence they now as ſadly
bring him back. Heaven be more propitious to us all in the ſafe protection of the reſt that remains, if a few more ſuch pillars fal,
the whole Fabrick will ſhake? ſo this flouriſhing, peacefull, and fertile land, will become a Chaos, or meere deſolation; the true
picture at the length, of her wretched and moſt diſconſolate ſiſter <hi>Germanie.</hi>
