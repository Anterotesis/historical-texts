            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whan our learned men departed from this City, the <hi>Indian</hi> rulers sent about fyue thousande <hi>Indians</hi> to accompanie them, and presented vnto them many pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of cloth of Golde, and many other things.</p>
            <p>This garde of fyue thousande men was sent to defende our learned men from the <hi>Turkes,</hi> because at that tyme were tenne Sayle of <hi>Turkes</hi> on the Coast, who did greate hurte vnto them. These <hi>Tutkes</hi> gaue chase to our men, and theyr company, and slewe thyrtie Christians, and many <hi>Indians.</hi> The Christians slewe of the <hi>Turkes</hi> aboue fyue hundred. And the next day following, our men &amp; their <hi>Indians</hi> hauing refreshed them selues, set agayne vppon the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and slewe their king, and neare two thousande persons of his army, and draue the residue

to flight.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Indyans</hi> that went to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our men, returned with that newes, all the Citizens reioyced, and chiefly the King of <hi>Chyna,</hi> who was abyding in an other Citie farther within the mayne lande. And forthwith he sent a present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for their King, which was a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Golde, in token of victory: and aduertised him of the valiantnesse of his subiectes, which had slayne the mightie Turke King of <hi>Brazer,</hi> in remembrance whereof, hee sent vnto him the ymage of the same God of Battayle, saying, that hee deserued that Idoll, whiche was made at the beginning and foundation of that land, &amp; that the keeping of that Idol was onely preserued for him. And with this Present he sent 10000. <hi>Indyans,</hi> &amp; 10. vesselles of warre for wafters, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, vntil they should ariue at their Iland, laden with victual, and many riche thinges. Also fruite, as Nuttes, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondes, Chestnuttes, Pomgranates, Orenges, and Lymons, with store of Rice, Kine, and Sheepe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17438:6"/>The Christians had carried before that time, ky<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for to breede, whiche cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell are lesser then ours, but better fleshe and sweeter, and the Sheepe also better then ours. And with this fleete of <hi>Indians</hi> and. 300. <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> they proceeded to seeke the Turkes Nauy, whiche they met not, but they conquered in that returne homewards, other. 3. Ilandes, the which they left in subiection, to the King our maister.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Indyan</hi> Fleete retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Ilande towarde <hi>Chyna,</hi> two Shippes departed from the newe <hi>Spayne,</hi> for those parties in the whiche went. 12. learned men, to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vnto those <hi>Indyans,</hi> and to instruct them of the mistery of the holy trinytie, I beseech God that the fruite thereof may insue, as we trust it will, and comming so to passe, it wyll be the richest Lande that euer was knowne.</p>
            <p>Wee doo nowe looke for other two Shippes, that the Uiceking pretendeth to sende for. 1000. men, to attempt the Conquest of <hi>Chyna,</hi> for hee sayeth that his hart serueth him to fynishe that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
<pb facs="tcp:17438:6"/>
with so many men, because the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyans</hi> are of small courage, yea, and though they haue Hargabushes, and other Artillarie, yet they know net howe to vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so that now this city prepareth 1000 men to send thither. And al the citizens of <hi>Mexico</hi> are moued with desire to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with loue of the great quantitie of Golde that is there.</p>
            <p>Those that are come from them, doo report, that they exchaunge more Siluer for Golde, then waight for waight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those <hi>Indyans</hi> esteeme Siluer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Golde.</p>
            <p>There is now brought for the Kings tribute, which is a fifth part of all that is wonne, 600000. Dukets all in Golde.</p>
            <p>They brought not the Idoll of Golde to pleasure the <hi>Indyans,</hi> and also that they shoulde thinke that Christians doo not so much esteeme Golde.</p>
            <p>They haue also brought great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Cloth of Golde, as fyne as the sortes of Calicute clothe, and of better workmanship, then any heretofore hath bene brought. Likewise, pepper, Ginger,
<pb facs="tcp:17438:7"/>
Cloues, and Sinamon.</p>
            <p>They haue brought fleeces of Wooll for a moster, but not so fyne as ours, and much Rice.</p>
            <p>They doo also certify, that the Uice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hath woorkmen making. 4. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies lyke vnto ours, for to expulse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Turkes, and to ayde the <hi>Indyans,</hi> which thinke themselues happy to bee defended from them.</p>
            <p>There are many other thinges to write of, wherefore I wyll procure the copy of the whole relation, and send it you in the fleete that is in a redynesse to departe. &amp;c.</p>
