            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Honoured Friend,</p>
            <p>THERE is certainly something still wanting to <hi>Happiness,</hi> whilst our good Fortune remains a Secret; nor will the <hi>Greatest</hi> be able to <hi>satisfie,</hi> if se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Knowledge of the <hi>Publick.</hi> This is a sort of <hi>Vain-Glory</hi> (however blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it may seem) that has been and is the Parent of e'ry <hi>Noble Deed,</hi> for the Greatest men of all Ages (I will not except Rough <hi>Cato</hi> himself) had never aim'd at <hi>Vertue,</hi> and mighty Actions, had it not been for the Glory that attended them; and that <hi>Glory</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in their being <hi>KNOWN</hi> to all. Thus <hi>Good Luck,</hi> like a Young rich Heir, full of lusty Vigour, and brisk Spirits, thrusts forward, and shoulders it's
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:55544:3"/>
way through the Croud, and Hurry of the World, coveting to draw the Eyes of all to behold it's Gay <hi>Trappings</hi> and <hi>Golden-Train,</hi> whilst <hi>Misfortune,</hi> like an <hi>Anchoret,</hi> seeks the Coverts of <hi>Dark Cells,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented <hi>Deserts,</hi> to hide it self from the <hi>prying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of pittyless Mankind.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Vain Glory,</hi> perhaps it is, that makes me not content with the frequent enjoyment of your <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> and the elevated <hi>Bliss</hi> of your <hi>Friendship;</hi> but I must thus take hold of the first opportunity of boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <hi>Felicity.</hi> Tho I am highly sensible that I shall not have a <hi>few,</hi> that will be ambitious to Out-rival me in your esteem. Nor can the Fate of <hi>Candaules</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me from discovering the <hi>Charming Beauties</hi> I am possess'd of in <hi>You,</hi> since the Noble <hi>Setledness</hi> of your <hi>Temper</hi> secures me from a <hi>Change. Constancy,</hi> the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of stedfast <hi>Honour,</hi> first-born of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and the sure <hi>Companion</hi> of all other <hi>Heroic Vertues,</hi> is so graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your <hi>Nature,</hi> that is <hi>You;</hi> and you can as soon cease to <hi>Be,</hi> as cease to be firm to whatever you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to.</p>
            <p>Truly happy therefore will that fortunate <hi>FairOne</hi> be, who shall subdue you to the Empire of <hi>Love: Happy as her Charms are Great!</hi> For nothing less than the greatest Accomplishments of <hi>Youth, Beauty</hi> and <hi>Wit,</hi> can do it; and when that <hi>Tripple Force</hi> concurs, what <hi>Heroe,</hi> or what <hi>God</hi> resists? And if the certainty of their lasting be the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Joys</hi> above, then it cannot be but a vast
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:55544:3"/>
addition to <hi>Hers,</hi> to be secure of an uninterrupted En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her <hi>Conquest,</hi> which she must be, when once you have told her you <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Vertue</hi> too, your <hi>Friends</hi> have no small share, when once you have chose. The <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> has been very barren in <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Friendship,</hi> affording us in so many thousands of Years not above Six; nor was there any even of them more exact than you in all it's sacred Rules, even to the highest and nicest Points. The Precepts of <hi>Tully</hi> fall short of your Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. You greatly resolve to partake of no Happiness of which you are not the Author; and therefore begin your <hi>Friendship</hi> there where the rest of the selfish Town end theirs, that is, in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and <hi>Storms</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> as I my self can witness, whom you embrac'd, when the <hi>base Ingrates,</hi> whom generous Obligations ought to have bound faster to me, fled from me.</p>
            <p>What shou'd I mention the rest of the <hi>Vertues</hi> that adorn your Mind and Person? Your impartial Justice, both in Action and Sentence on Books and Men, your Temperance in flying many of those throngs of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which eagerly invite you beyond the bounds of Moderation; few being able to know when 'tis well, whilst the Syrens of <hi>Youth, Vigour</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> sing such bewitching Songs. Your <hi>Liberality, Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> with the rest of the Excellencies that build up a <hi>Heroe,</hi> are but a part of them that compose you. What shou'd I mention that uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:55544:4"/>
Grace, <hi>Modesty?</hi> the Queen of <hi>Vertues,</hi> and the certain Off-spring of true <hi>Worth,</hi> too bright and dazling for the <hi>Vulgar Make</hi> to approach, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore embrace it's opposite Vice <hi>Impudence,</hi> as more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their servile Natures, and more conducive to their God, <hi>their Gain:</hi> For tho the unshap'd <hi>Cub</hi> of sordid Ignorance, it has still been so successful to obtain more Preferments in <hi>Courts, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Camps,</hi> and (that which is most hard) with the <hi>Fair</hi> too, in one Age, than all the Perfections and Merits of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> since the <hi>Golden One.</hi> Nay, your very self, <hi>Onust,</hi> (if I may use that word) as you are with such vast Accumulations of Excellencies, will never carry the Prize either in the <hi>Lists</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi> if you retain this in the Pursuit, as this following short Fable of <hi>Calcagnius Apollonius</hi> will not unpleasantly inform you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> having for their seconds <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> once contended in the <hi>Olympic Games,</hi> whilst all Mankind were the Spectators, who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> wou'd lose the Race; and therefore being won by their <hi>Gay Youth,</hi> and taking <hi>Prettyness,</hi> e'ry one shed Tears of Compassion for them. But the Event prov'd quite contrary. For <hi>Fortune</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind, car'd not whom, nor where she struck, on e'ry side, without any Consideration or Law; <hi>Folly</hi> on the other hand, <hi>impudent</hi> and <hi>inconsiderate,</hi> and as little what she said or did; <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> gave
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:55544:4"/>
way, were exploded, and hiss'd out by both the great Vulgar and the small; and <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> clap'd, huzza'd, and admir'd. Thus the <hi>Modest Man</hi> so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prevails in his Pretensions. Cast therefore off this <hi>sterile Good,</hi> if you are for the Chase of <hi>Interest, Dignities,</hi> or (I am sorry I must add) <hi>Love:</hi> This never will succeed; believe me, I have try'd it; tho there be this difference betwixt them that Impudence, is the fond-led Minion of the unthinking <hi>Many;</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> the Darling of the <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Heaven.</hi> By this 'twill appear, I mean not that bashful Vice, or foolish Rusticity which covers the <hi>Country Virgins</hi> in the Company of Strangers with <hi>Blushes;</hi> but that which is consistent with a generous and complaisant Assurance, all beyond which (however successful and applauded) is nothing but <hi>Arrogance</hi> and <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see, Sir, shou'd I give way to dilate upon your <hi>Vertues,</hi> into what endless Digression they wou'd lead me, when one alone has thus long retain'd me; I will therefore pass in silence what all that know you can witness, and what your Enemies themselves (if there be any so curst) must confess. For who is there that is ignorant of your Volubility in Discourse, dexterity in Argument, readiness of Wit, and acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Judgment? The <hi>Philosophy of your Life</hi> (gain'd both from the Study of <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Men</hi>) gives us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more taking <hi>Lessons</hi> of <hi>Morality,</hi> than all the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:55544:5"/>
Argumentative <hi>Harangues</hi> of the <hi>Lazy,</hi> unpractising, venal <hi>Gown.</hi> The sublime Precepts of this <hi>Practice,</hi> tho' the business of your serious Hours, does not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize you so, but you sometimes unbend to a <hi>Friend,</hi> and a <hi>chirping Bottle,</hi> or else admit <hi>Poetry</hi> and the rest of <hi>Philology</hi> to entertain your softer <hi>Minutes.</hi> And there also the vivacity of your <hi>Witt,</hi> your true <hi>Palate,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> I have not a little admir'd, as often as you have given me leave to peruse an <hi>Author</hi> with you; so justly you apprehend those Places that are esteem'd the most abstruse, that you baffle the Dull, and often Erroneous, and generally imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Annotations of their <hi>Scholiasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are the <hi>God-like Beauties</hi> of your <hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> has taken care to inclose so rich a <hi>Jewel,</hi> in a proportionably valuable Form, that it's Works might be perfect; a Form beyond which Fancy and fond Imagination can hardly arrive.</p>

Not all the <hi>ravishing Sweetness</hi> of your <hi>Tongue</hi> (sure the best learnt in the soft Art of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion</hi>) can be more fatal to their <hi>Ears,</hi> than to their

            <p>Pardon me <hi>Friend,</hi> for exposing this imperfect, and much unmasterly <hi>Sketch</hi> of your transcendent <hi>Worth,</hi> and bear it with the patience of a <hi>Friend,</hi> as you do my other Defects in <hi>Wit, Judgment</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> since 'tis only an Error of well-meant <hi>Gratitude,</hi> or at most a rash Sally of that <hi>Joy</hi> I cou'd no longer contain.</p>
            <p>If I were not persuaded that you are not so severe a <hi>Critick,</hi> but the partiality of <hi>Friendship</hi> may prevail with you to pass a favourable <hi>Censure</hi> where it is not deserv'd; I cou'd not with any face desire your <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> of this <hi>Trifle,</hi> which falls so e'ry way short of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi> I must confess I am much asham'd I cannot recommend it to your perusal on those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, which wou'd be most acceptable to you; for you will find none of that <hi>Happiness</hi> of <hi>Thought, Gaiety</hi> of <hi>Elocution,</hi> nor biting sharpness of <hi>Satyr</hi> you meet with in e'ry page of those several Authors you either <hi>Study</hi> or <hi>Read.</hi> I shall only presume to thrust in this small piece, as a change of Diet; a dull thing sometimes for variety being directive, provided it be not too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and I hope I have not enlarg'd this beyond your Patience.

            <p>THE Modesty of my Friend being such, that he would not venture into the World alone, and doing me the Favour to think me worthy to usher him into a Critical and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious Age, whose good Nature he has no reason to expect more than his Predec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssors; I believing the following Piece will please the Judicious and Moderate Reader, and he bashfully unwilling to have his Genius expos'd, have at last so far influenced him as to commit these Sheets to the Press, with an Opinion, that they may give Diversion equal to, if not exceeding what has been written before on the same Kind.</p>
            <p>It is divided into Two Dialogues:</p>
            <p>The First is the more gravely severe, and a nearer Imitation of <hi>Lucian</hi> (who is an Author esteem'd by all the Ingenious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be imitated). And all that I think necessary to Advertise the Reader in it, is about the Pre-existence, and often return of the Soul to the World, which has been a receiv'd Opinion amongst the Ancient Poets and some Philosophers, as the Great <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> and the Greater <hi>Virgil,</hi> may evince; for on this <hi>Basis</hi> the latter has built all the incomparable Beauties of his sixth Book of
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:55544:7"/>
               <hi>Aeneids,</hi> and would have been extreamly Fatigu'd without it, to have brought in that excellent Encomium upon <hi>Marcellus,</hi> which affected his Mother at the Reading with an Extasie of Joy above the Power of her Nature to bear: And on this, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> founded his Doctrine of Transmigration, which continues to this Day in the Eastern Parts of the World, who were of opinion, That we learn'd not anew, but only by degrees call'd to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what was formerly known to us in the World, when we were in some other Station, and which with the knowledge of the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Humane Life, the draught of <hi>Lethe's Lake</hi> had made us forget.</p>
            <p>And tho' <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Timon</hi> were not Contemporaries here, yet we may suppose them as well acquainted in the Shades below, as <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hanibal</hi> in <hi>Lucian;</hi> and since he has made them talk of the past Transactions of their Lives, notwithstanding the quassing of the Lake of Oblivion, the same in my Opinion will hold good for my Friend.</p>
            <p>The Second is grounded on that Celebrated Novel of <hi>Matchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> which has hitherto, tho' a bare Narrative, given so much Delight and Satisfaction to all the Learned, nor ought (I think) to be less esteem'd, when thus improv'd to the enlivening Quality of a Dialogue.

                  <p>SO, so, so.—Thanks, ye gracious Powers! that have once more freed me from that sordid Carcass of Mortality, in which I was just now coop'd up, and set me at liberty again to breath at large in these happy <hi>Elizium</hi> Fields: Where Nature appears to the clear sight of new unclouded Reason in all her easy <hi>Plainness,</hi> divested of that Jargon of Words, and those gaudy <hi>Robes</hi> and <hi>Trappians,</hi> which the weak Brains and contradictory Guesses of the fond <hi>Philosophers</hi> have hid in it above. Hail! happy Shades secure, and free from <hi>Ambush</hi> and <hi>Design,</hi> where Villany, Usury and Treason, and the false Train of inconstant Parasites above so mis-call'd Friend, dare ne're approach, and nothing but what's generous, compassionate, and just, is e're admitted! all hail! But what Noble <hi>Man</hi>'s this comes skimming by?—Those glorious Wreaths that circle in his sacred Head, declare him a true, persevering, and faithful Friend. I see now, 'tis the fam'd <hi>Laelius;</hi> I'll accost him—Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Laelius,</hi> have you forgot your old Acquaintance in these happy Fields?</p>

                  <p>Oh! <hi>Laelius,</hi> I find you baulk'd your Glass at <hi>Lethe Lake,</hi> you wou'd not else have remembred these inconveniences of Humane Life, but a been throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a New Birth into some of those numerous Bodies which Mankind above beget Day and Night without any fear, or consideration. But to answer your Query: I must confess the World is indeed alter'd, but by vast and incredible Degrees, for the worse. For if Villany were sometimes successful in your Age, in this nothing else is. If Honesty and Wisdom were in little esteem then, now they are in <hi>None.</hi> If Vertue was then less saught after, 'tis now grown the greatest <hi>Scandal.</hi> Now from the <hi>Crown</hi> to the <hi>Cott,</hi> from the Peasant to the Prince, there are not the least footsteps of <hi>Honour, Iustice,</hi> or <hi>Moral Honesty.</hi> Nay, e'ry <hi>individual Man</hi> has more subtlety, and designing Cunning in his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affairs, than the greatest <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or the most famous for <hi>Dissimulation</hi> (in which there`s not a <hi>Farmer</hi> but excels a <hi>Claudius</hi>) if you`r ever understood in the Administring of the Publick. <hi>Stedfast</hi> Honour (that <hi>generous Idol of Antiquity</hi>) veers now with every Wind of <hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>Ambition,</hi> as changeable as the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon,</hi> or the Poetick <hi>Proteus;</hi> and there are as many differing Notions of this <hi>Plain,</hi> this <hi>Well-known</hi> Excellence, as of Religion.</p>

                  <p>No, upon my word <hi>Laelius</hi> (for <hi>in these Fields you may believe one on ones word,</hi>) my Account reaches not to half the reality, and truth of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Villany of Mankind. No, no: Were <hi>Athens</hi> with all it's Ingratitude now in being, 'twould be such a Pattern and inimitable Example of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> that the present World wou'd never arrive at it.

                  <p>Where`s Religion then? That sacred Tye, that bound the World to Vertue; What`s become of that?</p>

                  <speaker>Timon.</speaker>
                  <p>That sacred Name still remains in the World, and nothing but the <hi>Name,</hi> which makes a mighty Noise and Busle, and affords as solemn and pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shew, as the Anti-Feasts of Old, and has no more of Substance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Laelius.</speaker>
                  <p>Does the old Opinion of the Plurality of Gods prevail with the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar still? The Vulgar, I say, for it never did with the wiser sort.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Timon.</speaker>
                  <p>That Opinion, however irrational, prevails very far to this day; for if we consider the whole Circumference of the Earth, and all the numerous Nations that dwell on the surface of it, the old Opinion of Plurality of Gods takes up the largest extent; but if we consider only, those parts where the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55544:8"/>
                     <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> were known, they are quite of another Opinion, generally all admitting of one only God. But then they differ again so in point of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that they make more various Religions for that one God, than we had different Gods for one Religious Worship; and indeed they make Gods of their own Opinion. E'ry one being ready to spend his Substance, nay Life, and all, to force his Neighbour to be of his mind. They are divided into three sorts, <hi>Turks, Iews,</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> you heard of in your time.</p>

                  <speaker>Timon.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, they are the most Antient of these three great Bodies, and draw, as they say, their Original from the first Man, never altering their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Unity of the Godhead, with whom they us'd to have frequent Converse, and by whom they were promis'd a great <hi>Theantropos</hi> that shou'd deliver them from Thraldom, not of Princes, but of their own deprav'd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, their Avarice, Treachery, Pride, and Sedition. And when this great Deliverer came, they very fairly murdered him; and from this <hi>Theantropos,</hi> it is that the <hi>Christians</hi> derive themselves; I mean their Religion, which is not only compos'd of all the excellent Morals which the Old Philosophers found out in the Law and Dictates of Nature, but several wonderful Mysteries that past my Understanding there, and must my Narration here. These <hi>Christians</hi> now possess old <hi>Rome,</hi> and great part of <hi>Europe,</hi> tho cut and rent into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Sub-divisions, which are more averse to one another, than to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy of the whole. But notwithstanding all these elevated Precepts of Morality, which they boast are so much improv'd above ours of Old, you shan't find one of theirs arrive to the Practice of the worst of us; if indeed they were follow'd, the Life of Man wou'd be so happy above, that all our blest <hi>Elizium Shades</hi> below wou'd be Deserted for it; for it wou'd make a large and general <hi>Amity</hi> betwixt Mankind, banishing all Causes of Strife, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing an Epidemick Love through the whole Creation; and whereas you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly confin'd Friendship to the narrow compass of two, or a few; this has made it appear it wou'd, if practised, unite the whole World in the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Bond of Allyance and Friendship. But as it is, it proves but a Pearl cast before Swine, which no body values or takes notice of, unless to deceive another.</p>

                  <p>Have they no Philosophers and Instructors in this admirable Law, whose excellent Example of the Contempt of the World, Honours, Interest, Strife, and Enmity, transcend <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and are a living Lesson of the Good, and advantage of these wise Institutions?</p>

                  <p>O, yes: They have numerous Instructors, but such as least of all follow what they teach; to hear them, wou'd cause a Veneration for them next to a Divinity; but to see their Practice, wou'd breed a Contempt beyond all Expression. There is no Villany forbid, but they will greedily embrace, if interest persuade; and no good commanded but they will more readily aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to gratifie their brutal Pride, Luxury, and Revenge. They extol Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their Pulpits, but know it not in their Behaviour. They persuade Commiseration for the Misfortunes and Miseries of their Fellow-Creature, as a Duty commanded, and not to be dispensed withal; but are themselves inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable to the most moving Object. They <hi>Deify</hi> Obedience in their numerous Eulogiums of it, but if it suit not this Ambition, and Violence, they run it into endless Distinctions till they have lost it. They inculcate mutual Love,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55544:9"/>
and Amity, as the necessary and characteristical Mark of their Profession; yet are the most violent <hi>Bouteseu</hi>'s. They enjoyn Forgiveness of one anothers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries as an indispensable Precept, and arraign Revenge as unpardonable, and an Usurpation on the Province of the Deity, yet never forget the least Offence against themselves, but prosecute an accidental Error with all the Malice of an inraged Revenge. Prudence they have none, aiming <stage>Qui summum credere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fas Animam pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Justice they think Folly to practice in any Concern, where they have any Profit: Fortitude is an Antiquated Vertue, which they tell of Primitive Gentlemen that were stock'd with so as to contemn Life and Torments, rather than to forsake their receiv'd Opinion of Truth; but the Examples are so old, that they look almost like our Golden Age, and are quite out of use; there being no greater Cowards in nature as to Passive Fortitude, and will rather veer with e'ry Wind that blows than let their Spouses have a Knot less on their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes. And as for Temperance, <hi>Epicure</hi> was a Stoic to the most Moderate; in their Diet and Ease, they transcend, in proportion to their capacities ev`n <hi>Heliogabal</hi>'s, or the greatest Gluttons of the old or new World. Thus you see they have no one of those Vertues that were known to the Antients; nor are they more stock'd with those peculiar to themselves, which they call Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical, as Faith, Hope, and Charity, words which neither you nor I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand no more than they possess.</p>

                  <p>Truly they generally are of that Opinion, and therefore the greatest Pretenders to it are most commonly the greatest Villains. For I know not by what Witchery it comes to pass, that none of all the Bace, either Hearer, or Teacher, have or believe any thing of the Matter; yet the Major part of those same People shall be gull'd with a pious Cant, a precise Look, or any other Religious Visor.</p>

                  <p>You are in the right. For the <hi>Turk,</hi> if his Moral Precepts are not so Refin'd and Excellent, yet he practises abundantly more; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, if they had the Doctrine of the other without their Commerce (for that does corrupt where-ever it comes) they wou'd arrive to a pitch of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>

                  <p>But I have neglected one Question, which more nearly hits my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: Is there no Friendship among any there? Are there no <hi>Pylades,</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> no <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Perithous,</hi> no <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> no <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius?</hi> Or in short, no <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi> famous for their Faith and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to one another, which no Fortune nor Distress cou'd seperate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy?</p>

                  <speaker>Timon.</speaker>
                  <p>O, yes Sir; there are abundance of Friendships in the present World betwixt all Sexes; the Men have their friends Male and Female; but with this Difference, they keep neither any longer than their Pleasure, or Profit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, which is seldom long. If you have Plenty, you shall not want Friends that shall caress and admire you above all Mankind; but then they are like Shadows, they all vanish at the first Cloud that obscures the Sun of your good Fortune; or if any stick to you, 'tis no longer than there is some hopes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55544:9"/>
that you may once retrieve your lost Glory: Nay, if you raise a Worm, a little reptile Animal, that us'd like the Serpent to eat the dust of the ground, if (I say) you should raise such an Out-cast to be your Bosom Friend, and give him all that is delightful or desirable to Mankind, yet if the least Storm threatens you, he shall betray you to your Ruine. So that tho' you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so nice an Idea of Friendship, and reduce it to Practice either with the Illustrious, or the Ignoble, with those that Birth and Education shou'd have taught the Noble Principles of <hi>Honour,</hi> or those that have not had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of great Parents, but might be thought through the Dictates of Nature, to be won by the highest Obligations, you will find there is scarce one in a thousand Millions that is worthy your Love.</p>

                  <p>Tho those incredible Ingratitudes of my old Country-men of <hi>Greece,</hi> might perhaps prevail with another less generous, and brave, to condemn all Man-kind for ever for their sakes, as I did in my angry mood, in my Epitaph; yet I do assure you, that I represent them very short of their Deserts; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> were but Dwarss in Ingratitude and Selfishness to the present World. Tho the Memory of their Villanies to me rendred my Abode here very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy for many Centuries, which made me at last resolve to drink of <hi>Lethe-Lake</hi> to forget them, that I might not disquiet my self any more about them; but as I had the Water in my mouth, I began to reflect, that if I should wholly forget them, I might in my Return to the World incur the same Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes again, and therefore I let but a drop or two go down, and spurted out the rest again. So keeping my Resolution to be as Selfish as any, and to give nothing, unless I had almost a certainty of getting twice as much by it; I enter'd at last into a Body that was just come to a ripeness to receive a Soul, and as 'tis a Lottery to us, you know what Body we are convey'd into; so I sound too late that I was born an <hi>English Man,</hi> and as I grew up, I found that Opinion by Experience verify`d, <hi>That the Organs and Constitutions of the Body form the Inclinations of the Mind.</hi> For spight of all my former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, I began to imbibe the pernicious Opinion, That none was born for himself <hi>only;</hi> and that there was nothing more worthy a <hi>Man,</hi> or indeed made nearer Approaches to <hi>Divinity,</hi> than to redress the Misfortunes of my <hi>Fellow Creatures,</hi> shielding off Ruine from those in Distress.</p>
                  <p>Among the rest of my beloved Follies, reading your Examples, and those of old <hi>Greece,</hi> fam`d in the <hi>Schools</hi> for Friendship; I fell into a ridiculous Opinion, That it was possible for me to cull out some Dear <hi>Pylades</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> to build up that Chymera of a Pleasure call`d Friendship. Nor cou`d I <hi>then</hi> imagine, I cou`d persue a surer Tract to find that Noble <hi>Phaenix,</hi> than in the Circle of the Sciences, which generally inform`d the minds of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers with more refin`d and generous Principles than the <hi>groveling</hi> Souls of the ignorant part of Mankind ever rise to, believing their elevated Beings to be above those little selfish Tricks of the <hi>Crafty Designing</hi> part of the humane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. But in such a one to shew you the extremity of the less perfect, I`ll give you a short touch of his prevarications.</p>

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55544:10"/>The agreeableness of our Inclinations I laid for the <hi>Basis</hi> of our <hi>Amity,</hi> you allowing no prospect of Advantage, and Interest in these Associations; and as I desir'd and expected, he first stood in need of <hi>me.</hi> Liberty is the Idol of all Men, that I gave him with the hazard of my own; and <hi>Life</hi> it self he ow`d to my Sword and Purse: Nor cou`d Fortune (envious as she is at the success of the Ingenious) cast more Distresses on him, than my Friendship did <hi>unask`d,</hi> Endeavour to hinder him from, as long as my Abilities remain`d: But no sooner had my Generosity to Others reduc`d me to want the returns of a Friend, but he grew saint in the Noble Course, and repay`d my past Services with <hi>odd, long, strange, needless, base Put-offs,</hi> monstrous Protestations, without any Effect, and Promises without any Preserment. Extravagantly kind in Words when I ask'd nothing, but wretchedly and beyond measure penurious in <hi>Action</hi> when intreated. An Inferiour and Impudent fellow shou`d succeed, when the modest Importunities of his Friend were fruitless. Behold in a word, the Difference betwixt us. The least occasion was sufficient for me to throw my Favours without being ask'd (as you in your divine <hi>Rules</hi> prescribe) and the greatest and most extraordinary Emergency, too little to make him remember a Promise.</p>

                  <p>But perhaps, Good <hi>Timon,</hi> you weigh`d not well your Man before you made your Choice. For as the Offices of Friendship are reciprocal, so neglect shewing want of <hi>Love,</hi> was a just Cause of Change, without that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious imputation of Levity. For as I asserted, `tis no easie matter to find out One that is fit Matter to make a Friend of.</p>

                  <p>Oh! during my better days, none more ready in returning all the superficial and little Offices that cost nothing, or at least no more than he was sure of again; but when Fortune had cut off present Hopes, all his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were procrastinated, till a more lucky hour; nor wou`d he part ev`n with Words to raise me from Distress.</p>
                  <p>These Faults may perhaps <hi>Laelius,</hi> seem Villanous enough to you, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par`d with others, the Dog was a <hi>Cherubim.</hi> For tho he assisted me not, he wou`d not depress me farther; tho he prefer`d not my obliging Love and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Services to a Whore, and a Bottle, yet he betray`d me not; and tho he`d rather let me perish than speak for me, yet he wou`d not cut my Throat himself. Thus Noble <hi>Laelius,</hi> you have seen the <hi>Mirrour</hi> of Friendship in the present World above; I desire you wou`d give me some Idea of it as in your Time, since both my Visits thither have never given me the delight of half a Friend. I have indeed read fine Storys of `em in <hi>Romances,</hi> and the Historys of the Old <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> but at last concluded them to be only the Gay Children of Imagination, pleasant in Speculation, but never to be brought to use.</p>

                  <p>Yes, yes, there is a Temporary Friendship yet in the World, that lasts as long as the hot Blood of Youth continues; but then it consists not in Vertue, nor among Vertuous Persons, as you require, but in Pimping for one another, in being in Rake helly Exploits together, in spending the Day in Gaming and Intreagues, and the Night in Lewdness, and Drinking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till both are drunk. You may Pimp for a Friend, nay and fight for him, but where it comes to pinch upon your Pocquet, there the greatest Friend <hi>Mony</hi> is prefer'd to the other call`d <hi>Man.</hi> So that your Sentiment, that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship cou`d be among none but the Vertuous, is now quite inverted; for they cease to be Friends as soon as either takes to Sobriety and Vertue. Of these Friends e`ry place swarms, not a Tavern, Coffee-house, or Stews, but is full of them. Nay, there are another sort of Friends too, that if you have a pretty Wife, shall endear themselves to you to have the better Admittance to her to make you a Cuckhold; or if you have a fine Daughter, shall omit nothing of the Formalities of a real Friend, till he has debauch`d her: If you have a She-Relation that is a Fortune, you will not want Friends that will buy her of you, and stand by you with their Life and Fortune till the Job is done. If you are a young Heir, you will not be destitute of the dearest protesting Creatures that seem to have learnt the Dissimulation and Deceit of Harlots, who will never forsake you; and if short kept by the Avarice of a Father, will not let you want Mony, if you will but pay `em for their kindness in a <hi>Stifled Obligation.</hi> So that Dear <hi>Laelius,</hi> you must not mistake me, for the World was never stock`d better with Friends; but those Friends are all Villains, all Sycophants, Cheats, Pimps, and Userers. Generosity and Honour they understand no more than Arts and Sciences.</p>

                  <p>Your Account of the present State of the World, proves evidently that what I formerly thought was not without great reason, that there can be no true Friendship where Vertue is wanting. For you give an Account to me of a meer Chaos of Confusion and Villany, and not of a World where Men with immortal Souls, and the light of Nature, improv`d as they pretend, in Habit; and <hi>Greece</hi> with all the punishments it has plac`d in Hell, has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided sufficient for the <hi>Luxuriancy</hi> of the Villanies of this latter World, where Faith, Integrity, and Liberality, void of Avarice or Lust, the solid Basis and Foundation of that Coelestial Prerogative of a Rational Being <hi>Friendship,</hi> are no where to be found; but Pride and Rapacious Desire, generates continual Feuds, and Anarchical Confusion. No, my unfortunate <hi>Timon,</hi> I`ll ne're for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake these dear <hi>Shades,</hi> blest with the presence of my Noble and Generous <hi>Scipio,</hi> for so base and servile a World. But if Strangers have no Friendship for one another, I mean such as are not related by Blood; I presume among Kindred, there may be found some Pairs of Friends: For Nature, the best directrix of Humane Life, has establish`d in her sacred Laws a Friendship among them, as she has in several Degrees among all Mankind. For our Country-men are nearer to us than Foreigners, or Fellow-Citizens, yet nearer, and Relation nearest of all, according to their several Degrees of Allyance.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps these might be the Sentiments of yours; but now I assure you, the Opinion, or at least Practice of the World is quite contrary; for you are so much the farther from a Friend, as you are nearer a Kin, and a Stranger shall find Success when a near Relation shall be deny`d: A For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner

be courted, admired, and caress`d, when a Country-man, or Fellow Citizen shall starve with twice his Merits. A Child be turn`d out of door for an unknown Vassal to take his place, and starve whilst his Fathers Servants live like Princes; and <hi>rara est concordia fratrum,</hi> your Brother shall besure to ruine or destroy you, to make himself: Nay, the Child shall betray his own Father if he can but get by it, and Mothers that us'd to dote upon what they bore, and have a tender regard to their own Off-spring, shall cast `em off without the least Compassion to receive an Address, and Gallant. You wou`d imagine, if you beheld the Transactions of e'ry Family, it were a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, or rather a more Criminal place, where e`ry one is Catching and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himself, with continual Feuds, and eternal Quarrels; and this is that Friendship which you say Nature her self establishes. I pray you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generous <hi>Laelius,</hi> to tell me what Friendship is in your Opinion.</p>

                  <p>Friendship I always took to be as I ever practised it with <hi>Scipio;</hi> A firm and absolute Consent and Agreement in all things both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, join`d with the greatest Charity or Love, and Benevolence, or Good Will, demonstrated in frequent, and generous Offices to one another; nor do I think Heaven it self has bestow`d any greater Blessing on Mankind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Wisdom.</p>

                  <p>That was just the Idea I fram`d of it; but I find by Experience, there is never two in one Age to make up one pair of such Friends, which if there were, nothing certainly were to be prefer`d to `em.</p>

                  <p>There were those in my time too that did prefer Riches, Health, Power, and Honours to it, nor were we without some Brutal Minds that thought Pleasures more desirable. But certainly, they were not a little in the wrong, for the first were the Proprieties of <hi>Fortune,</hi> more than of our own Industry, and of a frail and fading Nature; and as for the last, they were only Emulators of the Beasts, who enjoy`d those Delights in a more elevated manner than any of them; not considering that Friendship afforded the most solid and lasting Pleasure. Nor were we without some sceptical Gentlemen, who for a cloak to love none but themselves, plac`d all their Delight (as they pretended) in Vertue, as their <hi>Summum bonum:</hi> Whereas that very Vertue they Idoliz`d, is the Mother of the Friendship I contend for, since I have laid it for a Fundamental Maxime, That none but the Vertuous can be true Friends; nor am I able to set forth the incredible Advantages Friendship has among such Men. For what Man living is there that cannot repose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the mutual Good Will of his Friend? What is there so delightful? What so charming, as to have one with whom you can as freely Discourse all your Concerns as in your own Thoughts? Where wou`d be the mighty Fruit of Prosperity, if you had not one that shou`d rejoyce with you, and take as much satisfaction in it as your self? And Misfortunes wou`d be almost insupportable, if we had not a Friend that shou`d bear `em with greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret than ones self. In short, all other <hi>Goods</hi> which we hunt after and desire, are stinted to their several particular Advantages, <hi>Riches</hi> for use, <hi>Power</hi> that you may be fear`d or courted, <hi>Honours</hi> that you may have the Applauses of the Vulgar, and <hi>Pleasure</hi> that you may Rejoyce, and <hi>Health</hi> that you may be free from Grief, and perform the Functions of your Body; but Friendship is of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55544:11"/>
general use; nor can you turn your Thought to any thing where you will not find it necessary; 'tis never out of season, nor ever impertinent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome; nor is Water, Air, or Fire, of greater necessity than Friendship in all places, and in all times; for it heightens good Fortune, and alleviates bad by Communication with a Partner. Whoever beholds a true Friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as it were another Self, and is present with the absent, has Plenty in Distress, and Health in Sickness, and that which is most surprizing, survives his own Funeral. This was the Blessing that made me value Life, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it do I think, should the <hi>Golden Age</hi> return, and the Native Innocence of Mankind with it, and <hi>Astraea</hi> once more Visit the Earth, I should desire to live again; unless <hi>Scipio,</hi> my <hi>Scipio,</hi> were to be with me in the same Noble Bond of Friendship.</p>

But travelling toward <hi>Genoua,</hi> I met the Spark, my pretended Friend, on the Road to my Dwelling; I seemingly pass`d on my way, but in the Night return`d unexpected, and surpriz'd `em all: And therefore as my Honour <hi>bid</hi> me, I <hi>murder`d</hi> him, and baked him in a Pye, and (<hi>ingeniously in my Revenge</hi>) swore she should eat no other Food but her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the Crust she a while did eat; but one day having prepared a <hi>Stelleto,</hi> at Supper she dispatched me thus to your thrice <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Illustrious Devilship.</hi>

                  <p>Thou hast spoken as much to the purpose as when in the World thou us`d Harangue at the choice of a Sheriff: And therefore I shall proceed to a singular Punishment for you. Your Argument of punishing your Children for their undutifulness turns here on your own Head; for there you punish them for what you breed `em up to your selves; for when they are little, you encourage their Impudence: And that is a witty Child with you, that can prate saucily and lewdly before he can read, and Swear, and catch the Maids <hi>by it</hi> before seven <hi>Years Old;</hi> and then when you have given them their Head without controul, during their Childhood and Minority, you <hi>punish</hi> them for the Fruit of that Tree which your selves have planted, which is in it self the height of <hi>Injustice;</hi> but on the contrary, here you are condemn`d for breaking the Laws of your Maker, which you were bred in fear of, and taught to obey: and you that cou`d punish your own Flesh and Blood so for nothing, without relenting, have a just Judgment for being punish`d here without <hi>Mercy.</hi> And as for their being Lewd and Extravagant, that is no <hi>Plea</hi> for you, since that is the Lesson you have taught `em both by Example and Precept, from the time of their Birth till their coming to Years of Understanding; for you shall have a <hi>Taylors Daughter</hi> with you go in the Garb of the Children of a <hi>Duke</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> and even Miss <hi>Ketch</hi> be call`d away from the Mob: Your Sons must keep their Horses, and their <hi>Whores</hi> too, before they know the use of either, and then you punish them for persevering when they are better skill`d. And as for the Birds and Beast (Examples I think unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be follow`d by a Nobler Being, or quoted as a Precedent,) they are so far excelling you in that Point, that they educate their Young in the simple course of Nature, not elevating them above what's necessary, nor leaving them, till they have sufficiently enur`d them to provide for themselves, all that Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But just contrary to the Example you quote, you, all the Infancy of your Children, keep them from <hi>hardship,</hi> and <hi>knowing how to live,</hi> and to provide for themselves, and then on the sudden cast `em out of their Nest unfledg`d, without teaching `em to fly. Nor is your proud Supposition that you may dispose of your own Gettings more pious or justifyable, unless you will make your selves Gods, and claim the propriety of that, which you cannot carry out of the World with you, no more than you brought it in. `Twas Heav`n that gave Success to your Endeavours, to provide for those other Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings it bestow'd upon you, of fine hopeful Children, and you were in right, but their Tenant for Life to improve your Substance for their good. Nor can you in reason imagine any one deserves it better; for Justice and Reason both will have it, that you that have begot them into the World without their seeking or desires to satisfy your own Pleasure, ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all you can for them, that you brought thus involuntarily into the Maze of Fortune and the Treachery of Mankind. And of all in the World, you have the least reason to leave it to a Wife, that not only betrays the Rights
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55544:16"/>
of your Bed, prostituting her self and your Honour to Rascals; but shew`d at first so little Respect and Love for you, as to desire so unreasonable a thing, that you shou'd cast off all the Bonds of Nature, and forsake your own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which she cou`d not but Love if she Lov'd you: For you know the Proverb, <hi>Love me, Love my Dogg.</hi> Having thus therefore shew'n the Villany of your Crimes, `tis fit I proceed to your just Punishment; for which you are sent hither. You that have thus <hi>more than monstrously</hi> prevaricated against <hi>Nature,</hi> shall want all the <hi>Benefits of Nature;</hi> Fire you shall have, but not to give you gentle Warmth from the Cold of the Season (as when you liv`d, and hugg`d your self in all <hi>Epicurism,</hi> whilst your Children starv'd) but to scorch your wretched Consciences; and continual fears of burning your Goods, Houses, and Writings, shall attend you; to which shall be added, the piercing Fire of Jealousie, that shall prey upon e'ry part of you; nor shall you be without the knowledge of your Wives Transactions on Earth, and see how they mourn in Sack and Claret, and how they Marry, and Whore, before you are Cold; how they spend that profusely which you scrap`d together to give them, with so much Injustice to your poor <hi>Orphans,</hi> whose Injuries shall never let you rest, but with all the <hi>Fury of Hell</hi> for ever Torment you; you, worse than <hi>Onan</hi> or the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> away with them whose Villanies raises a Horror, even in me the <hi>Prince of Hell,</hi> and great <hi>Source</hi> of all <hi>Wickedness.</hi>
