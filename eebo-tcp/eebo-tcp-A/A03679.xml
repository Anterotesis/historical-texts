            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>¶ Here <hi>Horace</hi> dooth by ryght rebuke, suche as keepe not the meane:</l>
                  <l>Not leauing eke vntouched those, which to theyr lustes do leane.</l>

               <l>THe rowte &amp; crewe of dronken drabs, &amp; oynctment they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sell,</l>
               <l>the beggers, bawdes, &amp; al the kind of flatterers fowle &amp; fell</l>
               <l>Are wofull sad when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they heare, of <hi>Tigill:</hi> singers deathe:</l>
               <l>For that he spent his wealth on them. But this will not vnneath</l>
               <l>(For feare to bee so prodigall,) gyue to his fryende in neede,</l>
               <l>Therby his hunger &amp; his cold, to dryue away with speede.</l>
               <l>If thou the one demaund why hee his fathers wealth doth wast,</l>
               <l>And substaunce great on daintye fare, with persons vyle vnchast,</l>
               <l>Preparing so such gluttons feast, with money had by hyre?</l>
               <l>Because (saith hee) to shunne the name of Niggard I requyre.</l>
               <l>Which one his mates do much comend, but him the wyse do blame.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fusidius</hi> fearth on thother syde, of gluttons great the shame.</l>
               <l>When that he hath great grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; eke, much money lent for gaine,</l>
               <l>Who doth requyre for euery pounde, fyue pounde to hym agayne.</l>
               <l>And looke thunthryfter any is, the more hee wryngthe of him,</l>
               <l>And so hee haunteth yonkers out, that wolde go fyne and trym.</l>
               <l>But yet whom fathers harde do fynde, what God could now lo, lo,</l>
               <l>Chuse but exclayme, and crye on such, when those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do kno?</l>
               <l>But this mans charge is as his gayne, thou scarsly mayst belyeue,</l>
               <l>How small a freynd vnto him selfe, is hee that thus doth lyue.</l>
               <l>Lyke as the father, (<hi>Terence</hi> sayth) was sad, his sonne awaye,</l>
               <l>No greater greife susteyned hee, then doth this churle alwaye.</l>
               <l>If any now do aske of mee, what meane these tales begun?</l>
               <l>To shew that fooles auoyding faultes, to faultes ouerwartly run.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Malchinus</hi> walkthe with gowne so long, as flappeth oft the ground</l>
               <l>A mecier man doth weare agayne, a cutted cloke and rounde:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rufillus</hi> smelthe of Muskbals styll, and <hi>Gorgon</hi> stinkes as Gote,</l>

               <l>whose gownes do traile the ground, &amp; so ar wyues &amp; matrons such.</l>
               <l>Another on the other parte, but stynking hoores will tuche.</l>
               <l>When that from stewes was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming foorth, a certaine famous man</l>
               <l>To him sage <hi>Cato</hi> sayd, procede in vertue if thou can,</l>
               <l>For lo, as soone as fylthy lust, the puffed vppe with desyre,</l>
               <l>Such youth then here for to discend right lawe doth it requyre:</l>
               <l>And not to tempte the matron wyfes: but I defye that prayse,</l>
               <l>Said he <hi>Cupennius</hi> which did loue, none els but wifes alwayes.</l>
               <l>For you to heare is labour worth, which that aduowtrous men</l>
               <l>Wolde not to speede, or haue theyr wil, how they are payned then</l>
               <l>And how the pleasure rare they haue, corrupted is with grief,</l>
               <l>Still chaunsing vnto daungers greate, that dayly bene &amp; rief.</l>
               <l>The one from window hygh in house, hath fallen headlong rownd,</l>
               <l>the other whipt almost to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> third they theues haue fownd.</l>
               <l>Another caught compelled is, to saue him selfe with brybe,</l>
               <l>With pyspots, Skoollions, dresse the fyfte, &amp; sixte I will describe.</l>
               <l>Whose chaunce is for to suffer payne, and gelded for to bee,</l>
               <l>Which they deserue as all men saye, yet nay sayth <hi>Galba</hi> hee.</l>
               <l>But how more safe the next degree of women men may vse,</l>
               <l>I meane all such as are made flee, whom <hi>Salust</hi> could not chuse</l>
               <l>But like aduowtrer fancie much, yet if that hee had so</l>

               <l>Then myght become one lyberall, and bounteous fayne wolde bee,</l>
               <l>Hee shuld them gyue as that hee might, not hurting his degree</l>
               <l>As that shuld to his shame redound, but this was his desyre,</l>
               <l>And this hee lykte, that hee might say, no Matron I requyre.</l>
               <l>As <hi>Marsaeus</hi> seruent Louer once, <hi>Origines</hi> of the queane.</l>
               <l>Did giue that daunsing drab his ground, his house nor substance meane,</l>

               <l>But yet vile drabs &amp; naughty queanes, thou <hi>Marsaeu</hi> oft didst kno</l>
               <l>By whom thy name susteineth losse, more then thy goods I graunt,</l>

               <l>For thee to lose good name, and spend thy fathers wealth awaye</l>
               <l>Is ill and hurte, wherso thou spendes vnthryftly that I saye,</l>
               <l>What diffrence if thou synne, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matron graue or harlot gaye</l>

                  <hi>Annius Milo</hi> sonne in lawe of <hi>Silla</hi> foole in thys,</l>
               <l>In hauing pleasure in such name, hee suffred payne Iwys</l>
               <l>More then ynoughe, for buffets had, with sworde hee was beset</l>
               <l>And dryuen foorth when <hi>Longaren:</hi> within his loue did get.</l>
               <l>To him with wordes of pryuye part, perceauing all his woe.</l>
               <l>If reason sayd what meanest thou? do I of thee looke so,</l>
               <l>To haue a mate begotten thus, of <hi>Consuls</hi> stately race,</l>
               <l>And clad in robes when that my lust, doth thee so feruent chace?</l>
               <l>What shuld hee say? the mayde is borne, of father noble great.</l>
               <l>But by how much thynges far more meete, &amp; contraring this yet</l>
