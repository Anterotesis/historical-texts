            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Fire</hi> is comonly struck by concussion of Flint and Steel, which are two differing bodies; So <hi>Truth,</hi> who is the <hi>Child of Light,</hi> as also <hi>Knowledg,</hi> who is the <hi>Child of Truth</hi> use to break out, and appeer more conspicuous by contest of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and the clashing of discrepant Opinions: It was the first Dessein, and it is the Method of this Work all along, which descants by way of contraries and altercations upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of all the <hi>European</hi> Nations: Som of these Orations (in point of matter) may be sayed to be Sugar dissolv'd in Oyl, Others Salt mingled with Pepper and som dashes of Vineger, yet it is not <hi>Sal Momi,</hi> but <hi>Sal Mercurii,</hi> ther is nothing here scurrilous or favouring of malice; the dirt which is thrown here is like the dirt of Oysters, which rather cleanseth then contaminats: We all are Coppies of <hi>Adam</hi> the Prototype, Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are entail'd upon us by a Conveyance drawn in his time, therfore it must not be expected that Man shold be better out of Paradis, then when he was in't: Ther is neither Horse, nor Humane Creture so good but is subject to stumbling, and that stumbling may make him afterwards go faster and stronger in the road of Vertu. I have read of an old French Poet <hi>Iean Clopinel or de Meung</hi> who was a great Satyrist, his Pen was like the dart of Death, it spar'd none; and having fallen foul upon the Queen's Maydes of Honor for their wantones in these two verses which were fix'd upon the dore of the back staires.</p>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Complaint being made herof, <hi>Iean de Meung</hi> was deliver'd over for a Sacrifice to the Maydes, who having got him bound to a post to be whip'd, he sayed, Noble Ladies, Let me desire but one boon of you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you fall to execution, and it is, That She of you which finds her self most guilty wold give me the first lash: Therupon they fell gazing one upon another, and none wold begin; so the Poet scap'd. The application herof is easy if it be made to relate to the Countreys of <hi>Europe:</hi> We read the Queen of <hi>Bewty</hi> herself had a <hi>Mole,</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bullen</hi> had a <hi>Wren</hi> upon her Neck, to hide which, Ruffs were brought first in fashion. So the best Region and fayrest City on earth have their blemishes.</p>
            <p>Now touching those frailties which are thus hereditary to Mankind; ther is nothing contributs more to the propagation &amp; practise of them then diversity of Opinions and Caprichios of the Brain, which are infinit; And how can it be otherwise? for if out of 24. letters only in the Alphabet so many millions of differing words may be fram'd, and if these two Verses alone (which relate to Good and Bad according to the subject of the Book)</p>
            <q>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>I say if so few words (and we know words are the Indexes of the mind) may be varyed (as it hath bin tryed) to nere upon four millions of Verses, how many variations of Crochets and Opinions must then the boyling braines of so many millions of men be subject unto? To this may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed the miseries and distempers of most Countreys, especially the rents and heresies in Religion, wherof som peeple have so many that they need not pray, <hi>Adauge Fidem nostram,</hi> (<hi>Lord increase our Faith</hi>) but rather, <hi>O Lord decrease our Faiths,</hi> they are so many; and I am sorry that <hi>England</hi> deserves to have a fillip upon the nose for this.</p>
            <p>Now as these alternative Orations treat of the humors of Nations, so they do also of the quality of their Countreys. They will tell you that <hi>France</hi> hath the best <hi>Granary</hi> of <hi>Europe, England</hi> the fattest <hi>Kitchin, Spain</hi> the best <hi>Exchequer, Italy</hi> the richest <hi>Wardrobe, Germany</hi> the best <hi>Woodyard, Holland</hi> the best <hi>Dayrie,</hi> &amp;c. They will tell you that som Countreys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to others are like Gold compar'd to Silver, others as Silver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to brasse: as <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> is as Silver in point of value to Gold which requires 12. ounces for one, and <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> is as Brasse to Silver which requires 100. ounces for one in proportion of intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique value; in so much that one may say the Union 'twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> was like Oil mingled with Vineger: They will tell you also that som Countreys are so perfect that they are created to preserve themselfs only, and not to propagat, as <hi>England</hi> with her Concomitant Provinces; Others to plant abroad and expand themselfs, as <hi>Spain</hi> with her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Others to be Umpires and Arbitrators among their Neighbours, for their fit posture, as <hi>France,</hi> and the Popes Territories, the first being seated about the midst of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the other running through the midst of <hi>Italy;</hi> Others are unhappily placed 'twixt two Neighbours more potent then themselfs, as <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Lorain,</hi> the one being seated 'twixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and <hi>France,</hi> the other 'twixt <hi>France</hi> and the dominions of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> so that they cannot make a legg to the one but they must pull off their hatts to the other; They will also tell you how some peeple are so <hi>fiery mouth'd</hi> that they must be ridd with a <hi>bitt</hi> as the <hi>Napolitan</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> &amp;c. whereas a small <hi>Snaffle</hi> will serve others, fearing that if they cast their Rider they may fall from bad to worse, as the <hi>Castillian,</hi> the <hi>Savoyard,</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and <hi>Florentine.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Touching the perfecting of this Work, ther were Stones fetch'd from many Quarries (whereof the learned and well-read <hi>Lansius</hi> affoorded most) which were pil'd up to compile this fabrique. Now, I impos'd upon my self this task for the demulsions of my life, and to delude those tedious howers and turbid intervalls which the contemplation of these sad disjointed times makes many subject unto besides my self, specially those active spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritts who having bin formerly in Employment who lead now a sedentary and umbraticall life; So I wish that this Peece may produce the same effects in the <hi>Reader</hi> as it did in the <hi>Writer.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW joyfull am I to see this day! O, how happy I am to behold this glorious Assembly! What a high Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is it to be a Member of it! Specially being met upon such a brave Designe of Vertue, as to render a voluntary free account of our forreigne Peregrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to discover what we have observ'd most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abroad: And to do this with such a latitude of liberty, that our hearts and tongues may be Relatives, they may go together all along; It being the Prerogative of this Noble Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that every one may deliver and descant upon, without the least apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of danger, or giving any distast, what he hath met withall most remarkable in other Countries, as well as his own, either in point of Morality, or Military Discipline; either referring to their Vertues, or Vices, their Poverty, or Wealth, their weaknesse, or strength, their policy, or misgovernment. And so in order to the Province he hath undertaken, to vent his Conceptions, and passe his Judgment accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>China,</hi> a <hi>Potent,</hi> and <hi>Eagle-ey'd</hi> People, as being the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Neighbours to the <hi>Rising Sun</hi> of any upon this side of the <hi>Hemisphear,</hi> are reported to have such a haughty conceit of themselves, that beholding all other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95159:7"/>
Nations with a Supercilious disdainfull Countenance, they magnifie and extoll their own, contemning as it were, the rest of Man-kind, as an inferiour and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Race of rationall Creatures, which appeares by a kind of proverbiall Saying they have common amongst them: <hi>That the Chineses have two eyes, the Europaeans one, and the rest of the World is blind.</hi> For my part, I cannot deny but the people of <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Sina,</hi> more properly the true Appellation of the Country, being <hi>Sinarum,</hi> or <hi>Tzinarum Regio,</hi> may be an ingenious progeny of men: They may be exquisite Artists, as we finde by their Manufactures; They may also have good Intellectuals, and forecasts in framing wholesome Statutes, and Politicall Constitutions, for the safe and peacefull Government of that huge tract of Earth, which is estimated to be in one intire peece, eight times as big as the whole Continent of <hi>France.</hi> Yet, under favour, they have two Lawes which favour not so much of Prudence and Rationability. The first, an <hi>Inhibition,</hi> that none of their Natives must travell abroad beyond the bounds of their own Country, under pain of loosing one of his eyes. The second, that no Forreigner be permitted to enter into the bowels of the Land, except onely Ambassadours, and Ministers of State, and they also must be carried hoodwink'd all along from the Marine. I say, though the <hi>Chineses</hi> in other things may haply be wise, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gc-ey'd</hi> (who was all eye) yet herein they may be said to be as blind as <hi>Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,</hi> and their <hi>Noddles</hi> to be as flat as their <hi>Noses,</hi> which is a peculiar shape they have above all other people: for these restrictive Lawes are repugnant to common humanity; They destroy the <hi>magna charta,</hi> the grand Ordinance of Nature, which injoynes mankind in generall to endeare themselves one to another, by reciprocall Offices of benevolence and love, of Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, of comfort, and mutual Commerce. Such a dotage as this seem'd to have sez'd upon <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> in point of Opinion: The furr'd Muscovit, and frozen Russe is possess'd also with it to this day.</p>
            <p>But oh immortall Gods! what Infatuation, or Frenzy rather transports this people so far from the dictates of reason? What a transcendent presumption is it in them, to invade, as it were, the Capitoll of Heaven, and violate the Decrees of the divine Providence: For we well know that God Almighty himselfe, by the mouth of his Chancellour <hi>Moses,</hi> hath commanded <hi>Peregrinos non minui ac Cives benignè habendos esse:</hi> That strangers should be as gently intreated, as the Natives themselves. Moreover there is a Sanction published by our Saviour, love thy Neighbour as thy selfe; Nay, Nature her selfe doth dictate unto us, that man hath the least share in his own Nativity, but he is born to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. a communicable Creature, born to benefit others: Therefore that Custome and Constitution of <hi>China</hi> is dissonant to the Law of the Creator, the dictates of nature, and disagreeable to humane reason. Now whom shal we give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto, the eternall word of God, or the Policy of these men? For, if as the Canon goes, <hi>de Imperatoris judicio disputare sacrilegij instar est,</hi> If to dispute of the judgment of the Emperour be a kind of Sacriledge, what Trespasse, what Piacle, what a flagitious Crime are they guilty of, who doubt of the verity of divine Oracles. It is the Imperiall Decree of <hi>Gratianus, Valentinianus,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> confirm'd by all their Successors, <hi>Qui Divinae legis sanctitatem aut nesciendo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittunt, aut negligendo violant &amp; offendunt, sacrilegium committunt:</hi> Whosoever doth by ignorance omit, or by negligence infringe, or offend the Sanctity of the divine Law, commits Sacriledge. Therefore I may say, that the <hi>Chineses</hi> are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious, that the <hi>Muscovits</hi> are likewise so, with all their Adherents, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would go about to overthrow the Rights of the Rationall Creature, unlesse they would extinguish all the sparkles of Charity, would not put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise so absurd a Law. For it stops the Channels, and choakes up the Cisternes of all Hospitality, of all kind of Humanity; it utterly subverts all increase of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, all mutuall Offices of love, all Trade and Commerce, all improvement of Wealth, and plenty, all intercourse of Kindnesse, and Civility among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam.</hi> For, in my judgment, this whole Globe of the Earth, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95159:7"/>
then the Native Country of all kind of men: It is but one common City, Domicile and Habitation. Therefore that Saying of <hi>Socrates</hi> was a true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall one; when being askt what Country-man he was, he answer'd, <hi>I am a Cosmopolite,</hi> I am a Citizen, or free <hi>Denizon</hi> of the World. For what an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is it to Captivate the mind of man, which Heaven can scarce hold, to one territory or clod of Earth? What an injustice is it, that the Volatils of the Aire should have such liberty to flye, and the Fish of the Sea to swim where they please without controulement, or interruption, and that <hi>man,</hi> who by divine Charter is Lord of all Elementary Creatures, should be confin'd within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of one poor tract of ground.</p>
            <p>Therefore as those high Ethereall, and heavenly bodies above delight in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so among men all generous and noble Spirits should take pleasure in Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination; they should make truce with their domestick Affaires, ask their Parents blessing, embrace their Kindred, bid their Friends farewell, and shake hands a while with their own Country, to take a view of the World abroad, to observe the Customes, and Carriage of other people, to pry into their Lawes and Government, to their Policy and waies of preservation, to attain unto the knowledge of their Language, to convert every good thing they see into wholesome juice and blood, and for the future benefit of their own Country; to learn how to converse with all people: For the French have no improper saying, <hi>Un honneste homme est un homme mesle,</hi> an honest, or wise man, is a mixt man; that is, one who hath something in him, in point of knowledge of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Truely, that I may discover unto you the most Intrinsick thoughts of my Soule, I am of Opinion that it is a kind of degenerous thing, for any gentile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to sit still at home, as it were lurking in the Chimny corner, &amp; be so indulgent of himselfe, as never to see the World abroad. Nay, a noble mind should resolve with himselfe to undergo any injury of the Elements, any roughnesse of waies, any difficulty of passage, to be acquainted with forreigne Nations; he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently get his Bills of exchange, or Letters of credit, settle his Servants, call for his Boots and Spurs, put his Sword by his side, and mount a Horseback, being invited thereunto by so many noble examples, specially by yours, most Illustrious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who have made such exuberant fruits of your Peregrinations, whereof all <hi>Germany</hi> your deare Country is like to make such a mighty benefit. For I know there is none of you here, but, as the Prince of Poets speakes of <hi>Ulisses,</hi>

            <p>You have seen the manners of millions of men, with so many magnificent Cities, Castles, Fortifications, and Palaces. Touching my selfe, though I do not travell in body, as I have done, yet in a contemplative way, and upon the wings of Fancy I daily passe through, and measure with my thoughts all those most flourishing Kingdomes of <hi>Europe</hi> I once perlustrated with my eyes: I travel still in my imagination, and nothing is so delightfull unto me, as the Ideas of those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Objects I have seen abroad.</p>
            <p>I confesse there are some, and they are too many, who abuse this excellent benefit of forreigne Travell: if they have but once saluted <hi>France,</hi> they return altogether <hi>Frenchified;</hi> If they have eaten their bread a while tother side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> they come back altogether <hi>Italianated:</hi> if they have cross'd the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> they return altogether <hi>Spanioliz'd:</hi> They force themselves by affected and fanstastick postures and gestures, to imitate forreigne Fashions, by their Garb, their Cloathes, their Speech; they would shew themselves Travellers in a kind of Histrionicall, Mimick way, like Actors or Comedians upon a Stage, whose part is to represent others; They seem to slight, and some of them to scorn the Manners, the Custome, and Behaviour of their own Country. Such a Caprichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Traveller, or Stage Player, Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> that Golden English Knight,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95159:8"/>
hath accurately set forth in his own Colours in that witty facetious Epigram, which I beleive is not unknown to any of this Illustrious Auditory.</p>

            <p>In the person of <hi>Lalus</hi> this renowned Chancellor displayes a phantastick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellor, or <hi>Landloper</hi> rather; who having breathed a while the ayre of <hi>France,</hi> returned all metamorphozed, and <hi>Frenchifield</hi> in the motion of his members, in the accent of his words, in the tone of his voyce: He was become, <hi>Ex Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanno Gallus,</hi> or <hi>Capus;</hi> he came home all transvers'd, not only in his braine, but in his body and bones, having haply left a snip of the Nose he carryed with him, behinde him. Such sort of <hi>Lalie's,</hi> such <hi>Capons</hi> are most worthy of <hi>Cybeles</hi> Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (whose Flamins were Hermaphrodites, or Capons) we finde in the midst of <hi>Germany.</hi> Now, as the <hi>Spanish</hi> mares use to conceive sometimes by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle breezes of a Southerly Favonian winde, but the colts they bring forth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently languish and dye; so these fantastick Landlopers, returning home, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with some odd opinions or fashions, bring back nothing that is serious and solid; but their braines are stuffed only with windy fables, and frivolous stories. And as neer <hi>Charenton</hi> Bridge in <hi>France</hi> there is an Eccho, that reverberates the voyce thirteen times in atticulate sounds, so these Peregrinators do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>multiply</hi> what they heare, or see.

And what they have haply read of in <hi>Pliny, Lucian,</hi> or <hi>Brandanus,</hi> they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour as if they had seen them all, and that with strong asseverations, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with oathes.</p>

            <p>But now, Most illustrious Princes, and Noble Lords, whom I see present at this splendid Convention, may you please now to reduce into an Oratory me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall way those discourses and Forraine observations, wherewith you have been used to season your Tables and meetings at other times, confining your selves to the Kingdomes and Common-wealths of <hi>Europe,</hi> according as you have pleased to assigne every one his particular task; that at last we may make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture which Country of <hi>Europe</hi> may merit the Palme and Prerogative of all the rest. I know by proposing this, my boldnesse is as great as my request; but I shall endeavour to make some retaliation unto you most Noble Princes, and brightest eyes of Germany, when any opportunity whatsoever doth present it selfe, and shall court all occasions to do it.</p>

Yet for my part I wold after the example of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> were I worthy to give Counsell herein, prohibit Forren travell, under pain of a penalty, as the times go now, or at least I wold prescribe som exact Lawes to regulat Peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Now whereas the young Traveller shold apply himself principally to the knowledg of that which might prove pertinent and profitable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good of his own Countrey; let him make account before hand that he cannot find that every where as he passeth: For as a man cannot expect to find out in a Taylors Shopp in <hi>Hungary</hi> a suite of Clothes that will fitt a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or in <hi>Spain</hi> a suite that will fitt a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> though his next <hi>Conterranean</hi> Neighbour, their modes of habit being so different. So every Countrey hath som municipall constitutions and customes peculiar and proper to themselfs, which are not onely disagreeable, but incompatible with the Goverment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; and one of the chiefest curiosity and care the prime judgment of a Traveller shold be to distinguish betwixt such Lawes. But helas, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go now abroad, of whom ther are high hopes conceav'd that at their return they might act the part of <hi>Agamemnons;</hi> but having so journed som yeeres in <hi>Italy</hi> and other hott Countreys in the flower and spring of their youth, they com back grown old men before their time, bringing home Winter in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so are rather fitt to act the part of <hi>Thersites</hi> then <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> How

               </gap>ee, and sweeping the earth with their feet, or by ducking down their necks, by poudring their Dublets, by extenuating the tone of their voice, after a womanish fashion, or by jetting, dancing, or pratling up and down the Streets, with other loose, and affected Modes. Now, as <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> when he went abroad, fell enamour'd with <hi>Helen,</hi> which was the onely fruit of his Travels: So these never looking after serious things, hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter toyes, and bables; Or as Physitians observe of Horse-leeches, that when they apply them to the body, they use to suck onely the ill, corrupted blood: So these Travellers draw in the worst things, and it were well, if it remained onely with them; but the mischiefe is, that they disperse the poyson among others, and infest them by their touch, or breath. For where can be found a greater Lux in Apparrell, then in <hi>Germany?</hi> where a greater vanity in cloathing dead Walls? while poor living Soules, who beare the Image of God Almighty, go naked. Where is there greater excesse in Dyet, in Queckshoses, Made-dishes, and Sawces? And all this may be imputed to Peregrination. Where is there more crisping of haire, more boring of Eares to hang in Rings? where is there more dead mens haire worn upon the heads of the living? And we may also thank Peregrination for this. How many have gone to <hi>France</hi> with some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and come back without any? How many have gone to <hi>Spain</hi> with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and well-dispos'd humours, but come back with a kinde of dull Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? How many have gone o're the <hi>Alpes</hi> with plain and open hearts, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd full of cunning and mentall reservation? How many have gone to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>' and come home with Tobacco-pipes in their mouths? How many have gone to <hi>Holland</hi> gentile men, but come back meer Boors? And we may thank Peregrination for all this. The <hi>French</hi> Disease, the <hi>English</hi> Sweat, the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Scab, the <hi>African</hi> Leprosie, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Calenture came into <hi>Germany</hi> by Peregrination. The Physitians observe that if a man hath drunk Poyson, and be presently clap'd into the belly of a Mule, he may recover; and if one Mule will not serve, another must be kill'd. I was told of one that was preserv'd so by the death of ten; but I beleive if all the Mules of <hi>Barbary</hi> were sacrificed, they would not be enough to cure our <hi>German</hi> Gentlemen, who have suck'd in so much Venome abroad, under the tast of Hony. Now, if there be a strict Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, to punish those severely who import counterfeit Merchandises by way of Commerce; And if it be death to bring in base Sophisticated Coine, how much more do they deserve to be punisht, who indroduce Vice instead of Vertue, bad Customes for good; to pervert the manners, the dispositions, and nature of the whole Nation? I know this itch of Travelling, and to wander abroad, is no where greater then among us: How many thousands of us are found in <hi>Paris</hi> at this time? How many hundred in <hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Venice; England</hi> is full of us, and many other Countries. Prince <hi>Rodolphus</hi> discoursing with one that had been a great Traveller, told him, <hi>Iam vidisti Orbem terrarum universum, qui nihil aliud est quam colles, Montes, Valles, Planities, syluae &amp; hujus generis alia.</hi> I finde thou hast gone over most part of the earthly Globe, which is nothing else but Hills, and Dales, Mountaines, Vallies, Plaines, and Champians, Woods, and Groves, with such like things. <hi>Eudoxus</hi> wish'd and implor'd the Gods, that he might but have power to go neer the body of the Sun to behold his Beauty, Magnitude, and Matter, and he would willingly be content to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards burnt with the Beames thereof. So many of our Country-men are so greedy of <hi>Peregrination,</hi> that they will venture upon it though they shorten their lives thereby. Let us heare how <hi>Seneca</hi> that grave Philosopher, descants upon Peregrination, when he writes thus to <hi>Lucilius. Quid per se prodesse Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinatio cuiquam potuit?</hi> What hath Peregrination of it selfe profited any man?

the judgment, nor rectified errour, but it hath detain'd us a while with new Sights, as Boyes are with Rattles: It provokes the inconstancy of the minde, and by tossing it to, and fro, makes it more light and moveable; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men use to be quickly cloy'd with those places they formerly did so much covet; and like Birds, flye away thence almost before they have taken any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Peregrination</hi> will give you knowledge of Nations, it will shew you new shapes of Mountaines, of Fields, and Meadowes, with the course and nature of some River: As how <hi>Nilus</hi> swels in the Sommer Solstice, and <hi>Tygris</hi> is sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly snatch'd away from our sight, but passing a little under the Earth reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers her former greatnesse: How <hi>Meander,</hi> which hath afforded the Poets so much matter and sport, is intangled with so many windings, and often-times rushes into her Neighbour before she can recover her selfe, but she growes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neither better, nor wiser. Beleive me, my noble Country-men, unlesse this strange itch of forreigne Travell be cured in us, or at least-wise unlesse there be some Lawes and Cautions prescribed to regular Peregrination, that there be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returns made, our Ancestors Ghosts will rise up against us, and Posterity will bewaile our Incogitancy, and weaknesse too late; for they will hardly be able to finde out among us what were the Primitive manners, the continence, the constancy and nature of a true <hi>German.</hi>

            <p>And now to the task impos'd upon me; but before I buckle my selfe for the businesse, I make it my humble request that those touches I have given of <hi>Peregrination,</hi> may be understood in a sane sense: It is not out of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like I have of it, for there is no Creature on earth hath a greater esteem thereof, then my selfe, acknowledging it to be the ripest Schoole and principall Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for the study both of men, and manners; and the World affoords not more gallant Students and Proficients herein, then I finde now before me in this Princely Assembly: but what hath dropt from me, was touching the <hi>abuse</hi> thereof, as also in order to the method we have propos'd to our selves, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of things <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> and to answer in part to that incomparable Speech of your <hi>Highnesse,</hi> made in praise of <hi>Peregrination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I will enter into the Province I have under-taken, which is high <hi>Germany,</hi> and for performance of your desires, most Excellent Prince, which are Commands to me, I will compose my voice and tongue accordingly; and at the very first, will unmask my minde unto you in three words: <hi>Germania Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropae Princeps, Germany</hi> is the Princesse of <hi>Europe.</hi> And truly never any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion proceeded more impartially, and more from the Center of my heart, then this: For the maintenance of which Tenet there wants not much Oratory, or any moving perswasions and allurements of words, which the ancient Orators both Greek, and Latine did use, when they delivered their mindes in any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or desperate matter. The greatest difficulty I finde in this businesse, is out of such a hugh heap of matter to cull out, and put before you the choicest and best peeces: And as <hi>Geographers</hi> in describing the World, use by little lines to shew the course of mighty Rivers; as <hi>Danube, Nile, Ganges, Thames, Tyber, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> with others; As also in small points to describe <hi>Rome, Constantinople,</hi> the gran <hi>Cayre, Paris, London,</hi> and <hi>Ghent,</hi> the greatest wall'd Towne in <hi>Europe:</hi> So will I be as briefe and as punctuall as possibly I can, in setting forth the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this mighty Country, and Nation.</p>
            <p>But to speak the worst at first, I pray hear what <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique of his times, writes of it; <hi>Quis prater periculum horridi &amp; ignoti Maris:</hi> Who without the dangers of a doubtfull and unknown Sea would leave <hi>Asia, Affrique,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> to seek <hi>Germany,</hi> an informed peece of earth, a rough clime, a Land unmanured, full of thick horrid Woods, huge Lakes, impatient of fruitfull Trees, yet full of Cattle though small: In stead of Silver Vessells they have them of the same stuff as themselves, of pure earth: They have no Cities, they are given to sleep, sloth, and gluttony, being ignorant of the secrets of Letters; they use Dice among their serious affaires, with so much rashnesse

            <p>And such was the height and excesse of piety among our Ancestors, that they were forcd to enact Lawes to restrain the disposing of Legacies for Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call uses: There were som Emperours, and <hi>German</hi> Princes that bequeathd to the holy Church whole Provinces and Territories; Bishops became equall to Kings, and Prelats fellowes to Princes, and Abbots to Barons, both in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dignity, in extern pomp, power, and riches: No Nation hath bin more munificent to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no Countrey endowd her own Churches with larger demains: Among others, I will instance in one Abbot and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whereby you may make a conjecture of the rest, and he is the Abbot of <hi>Fuldo,</hi> who as <hi>Lipsius</hi> hath it, supplyed the Emperour at one time with three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score thousand fighting men.

How can this be aver'd by any that hath the least spark of Ingenuity and truth in him; considering that I have already musterd up so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Heros</hi> in all knowledg, as well in Theologie, as in Civill Policy, in Physic, in History, in the Mathematiques, in Philosophie, Philologie, with all other kind of knowledg, as well morall as naturall; So that <hi>Germany</hi> may be without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to any other Country be call'd the Gran Schoole and Academy of all Knowledg.</p>
            <p>But most Illustrious Princes, because by our Adversaries own confessions we have such ingenious hands, let us search a little into the ground of this Saying. The first Broachers of it were the <hi>Italians,</hi> who were well known to be a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning acute Peeple, yet they give us the priority almost in every thing; there passeth never a yeer but they send out of <hi>Germany</hi> for Architects, Statuaries, Limmers, Painters, Surveyors, <hi>Aqueduct</hi> makers. <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> had all his Artificers hence: <hi>France</hi> also makes the same use of our men, for the best Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry, Hangings, and Household-stuff, with Tables, Chaires, curious Glasse

which are fetcht away hence. <hi>Norimberg</hi> is admired all the Earth over for her rare industry, and inventive faculty: The Goldsmiths of <hi>Auspurg</hi> are cryed up in every corner for Bracelets, Rings, Chaines, Necklaces, and other Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities, which are carried every where abroad, from the rising to the setting Sun. Nor doth <hi>Norimburg</hi> and <hi>Auspurg</hi> excell only, but every Citty in <hi>Germany</hi> abounds with exquisit Opificers, though som Townes do apply themselfs to one thing more then another. In <hi>Friburg</hi> they have an art to polish Christall, and make Vessells and curious Cupps therof: Other Townes are dextrous in making Muskets, Archibuses, and Pistolls: <hi>Ulms</hi> excells in Drapery and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Cloth, whereof she vents an incredible quantity: Other places excell in making of Pewter, Tinn, Brasse, and Copper Vessells; som in casting of Canons, som in making of all kind of Pikes, som in exquisit sorts of dying, som in painting of Glasse, som in framing of all kind of earthen Potts, som in devising new sorts of Waggons: But he who desires to see a Compendium of the Manuall subtilties of the <hi>German,</hi> let him beg leave to go to <hi>Dresden</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> or to <hi>Stutgard</hi> in <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> or to <hi>Munchen</hi> in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and ther he may take a surfet of beholding thousands of rarities, and feed his eyes with new objects a whole twelvmonth together.</p>
            <p>Now what we have already spoken of high <hi>Germany,</hi> may be as well sayed of the lower, who is little inferior herein to the higher, whom <hi>Thuanus</hi> avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to abound with Artificers more then any part of the earth in so narrow a compas. It is upon record in story, that iu the yeer one thousand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty, ther were in <hi>Lovain</hi> alone, four thousand Weavers Loomes, every Workhouse employing thirty or forty persons to prepare the Wooll, to spinn and card it; so that by this computation ther must have bin an hundred and sixty thousand soules at least did eat their bread upon this sole Manufacture. And what credit the English Cloth hath now gaind, may be attributed to the <hi>Lovanians,</hi> and other Low-Countrey Opificers, who brought whole Colonies into great Britain, and made that Nation such able Workmen in this kind of comodity, who were given altogether before to Agriculture and grasing of Cattle: for the fury of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> drive many Families of <hi>Flemins</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they peepled many Townes which were very thin of Inhabitauts before, as <hi>Norwich, Colchester, Maidston, Sandwich, Canterbury, Hampton,</hi> and others, teaching them the art of making Bayes and Serges, with other such like woollen Manufactures; yet the <hi>Belgians</hi> still florishd by this industry, and the Drapers of Wooll began to lessen among them; ther was a compensation made by making Linnen cloth, wherin they are so exquisit, and herin the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavians</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi> bear the Bell, who are arrivd to that perfection of making fine Cambricks, and other Cloth, that <hi>Holland</hi> hath given the name to the thing it self, which is commonly calld <hi>Holland;</hi> and their dexterity is such herin, that their <hi>Loomes</hi> may be compard to <hi>Arachnes</hi> webb for finenesse, as if they were woven by <hi>Pallas</hi> her own hand; for they may be sayd to equall the Snow in whitenesse, Lawne in thinnesse, Silke in softnesse and value: <hi>Cambray</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so famous for this, and growes rich from what it was beyond beliefe: For <hi>Thuanus</hi> reports there are 30000. Clothes made in that Town alone every yeer, which at four pound Sterling a peece come to a vast Somme. <hi>Flanders</hi> also excels in woven Pictures, specially <hi>Holst,</hi> and <hi>Oudenard,</hi> fit for the Pomp of Princes; I know the Ancients have been Admirable for the <hi>Needle,</hi> the <hi>Phrixian Gownes,</hi> the <hi>Istrian Cadowes,</hi> the <hi>Attalicall</hi> Hangings, and the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cutwork were very famous, according to that of <hi>Martiall.</hi>

            <p>But these are triviall things, most Illustrious Auditors, they are Stars of the least magnitude, in comparison of others that shine in this Firmament: What think you of the invention of <hi>Gunns,</hi> and <hi>Printing,</hi> the first for <hi>Mars,</hi> the last for <hi>Mercury;</hi> two mighty things worthy of German Inventors, whereby Armes and Arts are so much advantag'd.</p>

What a care the Emperour took to keep <hi>Tacitus,</hi> commanding him to be written out ten times every yeer; yet this Golden Author had been like to perish, had he not been found in <hi>Corbe</hi> Monastery in <hi>Westphalia,</hi> whence after many ages silence <hi>Tacitus</hi> was brought to speak again: Besides the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Scribes in former times used to fill the Books with errors, as <hi>Cicero</hi> witnesseth in his time, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Latin books were so falsly written in his time, and adulterated, that he knew not what to do; whereupon Christian Authors thought it fitting that Booksellers shold be sworn to divulge none but tru ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amind Coppies, which made <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the end of his Worke to adjure the Transcriber by the name of Christ, and the dreadfull day of Judgment, that all coppies therof shold be examind and made concordant with the Originall.

Yet the <hi>Helvetians</hi> scarce made any use, or had any esteem of Gold and Silver, till they gave that fatall over-throw to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Hardy</hi> nere <hi>Granson,</hi> where they carried away their Cap-fulls of Gold and Silver, which since is extremely multiplyed amongst them by the salary the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have given them both for their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance about his person, by way of garde as also for their service in the Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> The <hi>Swisse</hi> herby being come to the apprehension of the value of Gold and Silver, with other Nations have mightily approvd their stock since that time. In so much that they provd often very usefull to <hi>France</hi> and other people in great sommes of money. And as <hi>Germany</hi> abounds thus with Gold and Silver, so the bowels of her earth is also full of Mettalls in divers places; <hi>Tirol</hi> above other Provinces of Europe hath plenty of Mettalls:

And as high <hi>Germany</hi> is full of such gallant Marchants, so the lower <hi>Germans</hi> exceed all other in the feat and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of comerce, where Women as well as men do exercise the trade, and beat bargaines in their Husbands absence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the advantagious situation of their Countrey seems to invite them hereunto. And if any doubt this, let him look upon the multitude of Shipps that lye in every Port, so that take bottoms of all sorts, they have more that sayle upon salt water then all Christendom besides: witnes els that nomber which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> did stay of theirs at one time in the Baltique Sea, which were 600 for offring an affront to his Ambassadors. In <hi>Amsterdam</hi> alone ther go in and out as many Vessells of all sorts one day with another as there be dayes in the yeare, either for <hi>England, Scotland, France, Spain, Italy, Turky, Egypt, Norway, Russia,</hi> and the East or West Indies. What a thing was <hi>Antwerp</hi> before the revolt of the Low Countries? ther usd to be more Mercantile businesses transacted there in one month, then a whole yeer in <hi>Venice,</hi> ther being no lesse then 300 families of Spaniards there at one time, besides other Nations; she erected the first Burse in Christendom, where twice a day many thousand negociators use to meet, and upon the River of <hi>Skeld</hi> before the Citty two thousand five hundred Vessells have rid at anchor at one time, one tide bringing in sometimes four hundred sayles, and two hundred Waggons going out and coming in. Nor do we include in this nomber, the Countrey Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were reckond in one week to have been ten thousand: So that by this vicissitude, and perpetuall exercise of Comerce, five hundred millions of Crownes were computed to have been received and payed by buying and selling at home and abroad upon the account of this sole Citty. And when the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards fell one time to pillage that City, the booty they made was estimated at two millions of Crowns: I do not put in this account the plate and Jewells they took, nor the brave houses which were burnt: The common Gregarian Souldiers were so much enrichd hereby, that it was observd, one of them lost in one day neer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ten thousand Crowns in the exchange, where publique tables were erected of purpose for gaming. They made hilts for their Swords, and Daggers som of massy Gold, som of Silver, yea Corslets and Helmets were made of the same mettall; but because they would not have it discovered when they went out of Town, they causd them to be varnishd over with some other colour; but therein the Artificers and Gold Smiths were too hard for them, for they mingled cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with the Gold, and Tin with the Silver, whereby they redeemed som of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95159:16"/>
their Wealth again from Free-booters. Yet Negotiation did not quite depart from this glorious City, but she flourisht awhile afterward in the midst of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Mars;</hi> Insomuch, that at one time ther were a great many valued at mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Crownes a peece, and some worth three millions, some more. But I will make a step hence to high <hi>Germany;</hi> how many famous Mercantile Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have you there, besides the sixty and odd Hans Townes? Ther is <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon the Main, the Mistresse of all the Marts of <hi>Europe,</hi> where one may meet with all sorts of Nations, and any kind of imaginable Comodity; And ther is such excellent order usd to secure their passage, that it is a most rare thing to heare of a Robbery. And as, most Illustrious Duke, your renowned Ancestor <hi>Everard,</hi> the first Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> calld <hi>Barbatus</hi> (because going young and beardlesse to the Holy-land against the common Enemy of Christ, he after many exploits came back with a great Beard which he had got there, and never cut it off afterward) was usd to say, that when he went amongst his Cittizens, or Tenants abroad, he might sleep securely in any one of their lapps, and his men might carry home his Rents in the palmes of their hands; So is it universally up and down <hi>Germany,</hi> where ther are fewer Robbers then any where else: For innated probity and down-right dealing the <hi>German</hi> is cryed up more then any, as also for his fidelity and trust; which hath causd divers great Emperours and Kings to put their lives in their Custody. <hi>Augustus Caesar, Tiberius,</hi> and other Emperours till <hi>Galba's</hi> time, had a Guard of <hi>Germans</hi> next their persons; but <hi>Galba,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> recordeth, dissolved this most faithfull and valiant Guard, whose fidelity had bin tryed so many yeers: yet other Emperours took them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; nay, <hi>Herodes</hi> King of <hi>Iudaea</hi> sent for a Guard of them: And they continue to have this high honour to this very day; for not onely the late <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> but the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> together with the Gran Duke of <hi>Toscany,</hi> with divers other soveraign Princes, committ the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their lives and persons to this stout and honest Nation; insomuch that we may glory with the <hi>Frizland</hi> Legions, not onely in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Theater, as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> hath it, but all the World over, <hi>Nullos mortalium armis, aut fide ante Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manos esse,</hi> There are no kind of Mortals superiour to the Dutch in Armes, and trust; nor shall you seee a tru <hi>German</hi> ever beat his Servant, or clap in Prison any of his Tenants for non - payment of Rent, but either defalk something out of the wages of the one, and amercing the other to some small Heriot.</p>
            <p>And as the probity of our Nation is like a great flourishing Tree, whose branches shoot every where, so the <hi>German</hi> Chastity is very remarkable; which as <hi>Egidius</hi> the <hi>Fraciscan</hi> sayed, is like a cleer crystall Glasse which may be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the breath onely: And where doth this Chastity look more cleer, and shine more bright then in <hi>Germany.</hi> For one to have knowledg of a woman there before yeer twenty, is held a great turpitude, and a disgracefull thing: Let <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> be heard herein: The <hi>German</hi> lust is care, every one is contented with his own wife, so that adultery is rare among them, and it is not as much the punishment as the publique shame that deterrs them from it. And <hi>Thuanus</hi> sayeth, that no Nation observes the honests of conjugall honesty according to Gods holy Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept more then they; Insomuch that the Verses of the Lirique may be applyed to them.</p>

            <p>Which causes a strict Law against Bastards, which are rendred incapable of all Promotions; which was the reason that <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Sister to <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. could never be entreated by the Emperour to pardon one of her prime Noble-men, who had deflower'd one of her Maydes of honour, though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95159:17"/>
much importun'd thereto. To this vertu of Chastity we may add the strength of conjugall love, which is found in <hi>Germany;</hi> and hereof there be many signall examples. Among other, let that in the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Conradus</hi> the third take place here, who having in your Town of <hi>Writsberg</hi> in <hi>Writemberg,</hi> streightly block'd up <hi>Guelpho</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and reduc'd the place to extreme Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, at the cryes and importunity of the women of the Town, he publish'd a Diploma, or imperiall Placart, wherein he indulg'd all women this priviledg, that they might freely depart from the Town, but not carry any luggage with them, but what they could bear upon their own backs. Hereupon the Dutchesse took <hi>Guelpho</hi> her Husband on her sholders, and all the women else following her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, came out of the Gates laden with men and youths. The Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much taken with this witty Stratageme, forgave <hi>Guelpho</hi> the Duke with all his Adherents. <hi>Lorenzo de Medicis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Toscany</hi> reading this Story, was transported with so much joy and plesure, that being sick of an indisposition, whereof all his Physitions could not cure him, recovered his health hereby, as <hi>Bodin</hi> relates.</p>
            <p>Let us proceed now to another Vertu, which is signal and shining in the <hi>German,</hi> and that is Modesty. Can there be a greater example then that of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth? who being yet in a vigorous state of body, voluntarily resignd the <hi>German</hi> Empire to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and all his spacious Dominions to his Son <hi>Philip;</hi> though as some malevolent spirits reported afterwards, that the next after his resignments was the first day of his repentance.</p>
            <p>But now I will speak something of the heroik Valour and Fortitude of our Nation, whereby <hi>Europe</hi> hath stood unshaken so many ages: And truely to dilate this, my words must needs com short of the matter; and herein it was the disadvantage of <hi>Germany</hi> to be destitute of Writers; for our Progenitors were more for the Pike then the Pen; <hi>bipennem, non pennam tractabant:</hi> And it was enough for other Nations to extoll their own feats, not ours, so that it may be sayed of the Children of this Noble Continent,</p>

Yet those frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of stones which are found up and down in our Archives, shew well what heroique Spirits this Clime hath bredd, and what Martiall men; in comparison of whose Preliations and Fights, those of the <hi>Greeks</hi> were but Combats twixt Froggs and Mice.

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95159:18"/>Rise up Daughter and go to thy Daughter, for thy Daughters Daughter hath a Daughter. The story is notable of <hi>Babo</hi> Count of <hi>Abeneberg,</hi> who of Wifes had two and thirty Sonns and eight Daughters, whom he gave the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest education unto that could be; this Count being invited one day to Hunt with the Emperour <hi>Hen:</hi> the second, took oportunity to bring his Troup of Sonns well horsd, and in gallant Equippage, and making a present of them to the Emperour, he took them all with much grace and contentment to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and married them very nobly, insomuch that many Illustrious Families sprung from their loynes. And the Emperour was bound to do this according to Law, for whosoever in <hi>Germany</hi> getts seven Sonns together, the Emperour is to maintain them all; and though the German Continent be very vast, yet is it full of people, so that as <hi>Boterus</hi> hath it, ther was a cense of ten Millions of soules who breathd ther at one time; but he corrected himself afterward, and averrs, <hi>Veggo che quella amplissima provincia passa</hi> 19. <hi>millioni d'anime senza comprendervi I Regni di Danemarca &amp; di Boemia:</hi> I find that that huge Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince besides <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath nineteen millions of soules within it. Therfor though an Army of two hundred thousand Soldiers shold be carried out of <hi>Germany,</hi> ther would be no misse at all of them.</p>
            <p>What shall we say of the <hi>Normans</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who establishd a Monarchy both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sicilie</hi> by their meer prowesse; and having subjugated that fertile Province in <hi>France,</hi> calld <hi>Normandy</hi> ever since, they did so infest the rest of that spacious Kingdom, that it was a part of their Letany, <hi>a Furore Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manorum libera nos Domine.</hi> From the <hi>Norman</hi> Fury the Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>At last <hi>Charles</hi> the simple was forcd to give <hi>Rollo</hi> their Duke, his Daughter <hi>Gista</hi> to wife, with that whole Province; and when at that Ceremony <hi>Rollo</hi> was advisd by his Nobles to kisse the Kings foot; answerd no, <hi>by God,</hi> which is the cause that the <hi>Normans</hi> are calld <hi>By-gods</hi> to this day. <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> speaks thus of the <hi>Normans, Audax Francia Normannorum Militiam experta est, ferox Anglia captiva succubuit, dives Apulia sortit aestoruit, Heirosoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma famosa, &amp; insignis Antiochia se utraque suppoluit.</hi> Bold <hi>France</hi> felt the <hi>Norman</hi> Disciplin, fierce <hi>England</hi> yeelded her selfe as Captive, rich <hi>Apulia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavd them, and flourishd; holy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and famous <hi>Antioch</hi> subjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs both unto him. What a man of men was <hi>Tancred,</hi> who going as a Martiall Adventurer abroad with many goodly young Princes, his Sons did perform ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exploits in <hi>Italy,</hi> chasd the <hi>Saracens</hi> out of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and did sundry brave feats in the Holy-land: And to this day the <hi>Sicilians</hi> acknowledg that it was by his valour they enjoy their own Country, that they live free, and became all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans again. <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself, though no great Friend to our Nation, confesseth that the <hi>Germans</hi> cut the <hi>Romans</hi> more work to do, then either the <hi>Samnites,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Parthians;</hi> For what can the <hi>Orient,</hi> as he sayeth, bragg of, but that they conquerd and killd our Generall <hi>Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Pacorus?</hi> But the <hi>Germans</hi> did not onely rout five <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Consulship of <hi>Carbo, Cassius, Scaurus, Aurelius, Servilius, Cepo,</hi> and <hi>Manlius,</hi> but they took away <hi>Varus</hi> with three Legions besides; And this happened when <hi>Rome</hi> was at her highest point of strength. It was cryed up for a Triumph that <hi>Caligula</hi> brought and put in the Capitoll of <hi>Rome,</hi> certain Cockle shels that he had gathered upon the Costs of <hi>Holland. Augustus Caesar</hi> himself who was calld happy to a Proverb, yet he receavd two overthrowes by the <hi>Germans,</hi> calld <hi>Lolliana,</hi> and <hi>Variana Clades: Iulius Caesar</hi> conquerd the <hi>Gaules</hi> by the help of <hi>Germans,</hi> and in the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> fields they performd the prime Service. Then the <hi>Romans,</hi> because they could not do much upon <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> by strength and valour, they went another way to work, they found means to raise and foment divisins among the <hi>Germans</hi> themselfs, and did more that way then they could by Armes: Which policy also <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, a <hi>German</hi> himself, did put in practise to break the strength of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> But that I may return a little to the old times, what shall I say of that <hi>German</hi> Legion, which in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95159:19"/>
               <hi>Spain</hi> gave the denomination to the Kingdom of <hi>Legio,</hi> now calld <hi>Leon.</hi> What shall I say of the Exploites of the <hi>Vandales,</hi> who gave name to <hi>Andalusia?</hi> Of the <hi>Longobards,</hi> who denominated <hi>Lombardy</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> and occupied it two hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red yeers?? What of the <hi>Goths,</hi> who did lead a dance through all <hi>Europe?</hi> All these were Birds of our Feathers: And <hi>Charles</hi> the quint was usd to say, that the prime Nobility of <hi>Christendom</hi> descended from the <hi>Gothique</hi> race, and that ther was no one more entire body upon Earth then <hi>Germany,</hi> if united.</p>
            <p>But to go from lesse to great, what a Mirroir of men was our <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> translated the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to <hi>Germany,</hi> where it hath continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight ages. By these rivulets you may gesse at the greatnesse of the River; by these sparks you may conjecture what the flame is, and by these Rayes you may know somthing of the Sun. Indeed in <hi>Germany Caesar</hi> sits like the Sun him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> surrounded with seven Planets; that is, the Septemvirat of Electors, with multitudes of other refulgent Stars: And this <hi>Caesarean</hi> dignity is now so rooted in <hi>Germany,</hi> that it is a Fundamentall Law, <hi>Ne quis exterus, &amp; non Germanus in Imperatorem eligatur,</hi> That no Forrener, that is no <hi>German</hi> be chosen Emperour. And why should we seek for any abroad, when there are so many Imperiall Families at home? Now, the Imperiall Majesty is without a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>Caesar</hi> of any mortall is next to God, and deserves Veneration all the world over, his Dignity being supereminent, and his power shold be transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Athalaricus</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> could say so much, that the Emperour is doubtlesse an earthly God, and whosoever doth heave up his arm against him, he is guilty of his own blood. By <hi>Baldus</hi> words he is <hi>Summus superior, Dominusque Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Occidentis, Meridiei &amp; septentrionis.</hi> He is the highest Superior, and Lord of all the four Cardinall corners of the World; He is the Supreme Judg, from whom there is no appeal, the prime Arbiter. It is he who in sign of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence wears a triple Crown on his head; He is Creator of Kings, the chief source of honor, and Fountain whence all greatnesse flowes. Nay, the common and Capital Enemy of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> gives his Ambassadors more honor then to any other Potentate. As among others, ther is one pregnant example; for when <hi>David Ungnadius</hi> was Ambassador for the Emperour in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and went to take his leave of the grand <hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing com to the <hi>Duana</hi> before him, and taken the Chair before him, he was going away without saluting the Sultan, but the gran Visier, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or chief Minister of State perceaving that, causd the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador, though a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> to take a lower Seat. Another time upon the Celebration of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third's Circumcision, which lasted forty daies and nights continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there being in <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Legats of the greatest Monarchs upon earth, yet he who was Ambassador then in the Port for <hi>Rodulphus</hi> the second, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the first place.</p>
            <p>Now, as the Emperour himselfe is the prime Potentat, so the Princes and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Germany</hi> are the best descended of any other; and wheras divers <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes bore great sway abroad, it is probable that they left there much of their Of-spring. But in <hi>Germany</hi> there are no forren extractions; <hi>Germany</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducd and ruld other Countries, but none ruld <hi>Germany</hi> but her own Children; swarmes of <hi>Germans</hi> have gone abroad to <hi>Italy</hi> and other Provinces for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, but no strangers have swayd in <hi>Germany.</hi> Tis tru, that Captives of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been brought thither from <hi>Italy</hi> and other places; and among those Captives ther might be haply som Princely Stemms: As now in <hi>Westphalia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Boors ther are som found who derive themselfs from the <hi>Caesarean,</hi> and <hi>Consulary</hi> Families in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in <hi>Rome</hi> her self there are very few of them left, having bin ravisht and ransackt so often. There are none left of the <hi>publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colae,</hi> of the <hi>Iunij,</hi> of the <hi>Fabij,</hi> of the <hi>Valerij,</hi> of the <hi>Manlij,</hi> of the <hi>Cassij,</hi> of the <hi>Cincinnati,</hi> of the <hi>Menucij,</hi> of the <hi>Papirij,</hi> of the <hi>Bruti,</hi> of the <hi>Fulvij,</hi> of the <hi>Sempronij,</hi> of the <hi>Tullij,</hi> of the <hi>Hortensij,</hi> of the <hi>Aurelij,</hi> of the <hi>Tarquinij,</hi>

               <hi>Hostilij, Licinij, Sempronij, Caecilij, Crassi;</hi> and multitudes of other Illustrious Families of <hi>Rome</hi> they are all extinct, onely the Lakes of <hi>Venice</hi> hath preservd som upon the inundation of the <hi>Goths.</hi> Therefore sayeth <hi>Aeneas Sylvius, Ita a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus, ut nos potius Germani quam Itali nuncupemur, &amp;c.</hi> Let us carry the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse so, that we may be calld <hi>Germans</hi> rather then <hi>Italians;</hi> for ther the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and certainst, ancientst Nobility upon earth doth yet flourish.

Let <hi>England</hi> also boast of their Nobility &amp; Gentry, and in so doing they praise <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Normandy.</hi> Let <hi>Spain</hi> vaunt of their King, and who knowes not but he is a <hi>German</hi> two wayes, by the <hi>Gothique</hi> and <hi>Austrian</hi> Family, with the best Stemms of <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, where he is accounted but an upstart Noble-man, that is not derivd <hi>de la sangre de les Godos,</hi> of <hi>Gothic</hi> Blood. Let <hi>France</hi> stand as high a tiptoe as she will, to vaunt of her twelve hundred yeers Monarks, and she will confesse her three race of Kings, <hi>Merovengians, Carlovingians,</hi> and <hi>Capevingians,</hi> whence <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourteenth now regnant is descended, came all primarily of the <hi>German</hi> race.</p>
            <p>But let us com to <hi>Germany</hi> her self, and you will find that she is like the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, spangled and glistring with so many coruscant Starrs, I mean so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny illustrious Families. I will begin with those of the Order of Knighthood, which being so many in nomber, I dare not adventure to nominat one without naming all, for fear of offence; let it suffice that ther are in <hi>Germany</hi> her self, besides her annexed Regions, above six hundred Knights, who according to the Lawes of the Emperour <hi>Henricus Auceps</hi> (the Faulconer) do train up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs in noble exercises, disdaining any kind of mechanique Trade, or to marry any but a Gentlewoman by descent. Now, touching Counts and Barons, their number is incredible: I will instance in the chiefest. You have in <hi>Germany</hi> the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Families of the <hi>Barbij,</hi> the <hi>Bronkhorstij,</hi> the <hi>Castelli,</hi> the <hi>Cimbrij,</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berstenij,</hi> the <hi>Erbachij,</hi> the <hi>Falkenstenij,</hi> the <hi>Furstenbergij,</hi> the <hi>Gerobrekij,</hi> the <hi>Gleichij,</hi> the <hi>Hannovij,</hi> the <hi>Helfenstenij,</hi> the <hi>Hohenloi,</hi> the <hi>Isenburgij, Leimnigij,</hi> the <hi>Leonstenij,</hi> the <hi>Limpurgij,</hi> the <hi>Lippij,</hi> the <hi>Mansfeldij,</hi> the <hi>Monfortij,</hi> the <hi>Nassovij,</hi> the <hi>Oldenburgij,</hi> the <hi>Ortenburgij,</hi> the <hi>Oestfrislandij,</hi> the <hi>Oettingij,</hi> the <hi>Rappolstenij,</hi> the <hi>Rhenigravij,</hi> the <hi>Reussij,</hi> the <hi>Salmij,</hi> the <hi>Schaunburgij,</hi> the <hi>Swaertenburgij,</hi> the <hi>Solmij,</hi> the <hi>Stolbergij,</hi> the <hi>Sulzij,</hi> the <hi>Tubingij,</hi> the <hi>Wald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgij,</hi> the <hi>Waldbeccij,</hi> the <hi>Wirdij,</hi> the <hi>Witgenstenij,</hi> the <hi>Zollerij,</hi> and divers more. I put down here the names of the Trees onely, whereof every one hath multitude of branches; And some of these have such Prerogatives and Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that countervaile some Soveraign Princes elsewhere. But to look upon the high Classis of Nobility, how many Imperiall and Regall Families are there? <hi>Guilielmus Brussius</hi> sayeth, that as <hi>Italy</hi> excels in Palaces, and Monuments of Antiquity, as <hi>France</hi> in Soldiers, as <hi>Spain</hi> with Bishops, as <hi>England</hi> with Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as <hi>Poland</hi> with Nobles, so <hi>Germany</hi> abounds with Princes. <hi>Brussius</hi> herein said true; but besides the last, he may also find all the rest in <hi>Germany;</hi> I will instance first in your Princely Family, my Cosen <hi>Frederique Achilles;</hi> how famous was <hi>Ulric</hi> the seventh for his Amability? Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> for his probity? Prince <hi>Georg</hi> for his Hospitality, <hi>Ulric</hi> the ninth; the first, second, third, and fourth <hi>Eberhards</hi> for their Fortitude, and your Father <hi>Frederique</hi> for his Magnanimity? What a signall Prince was <hi>Eberhard</hi> the first, whom the <hi>Italians</hi> seemd to adore, being inflamd with the Rayes of his Virtues; Soe that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first, passing by this Tombe, sayed, There ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>So you, my noble Cozen <hi>Ioachim Ernest,</hi> a branch of the Illustrious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall House of <hi>Holsteyn,</hi> do shine with many splendid titles, whose vertues not all <hi>Denmark, Norway, Gothland,</hi> or the Kingdome of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> nor <hi>Holsasia, Dictsmarsh</hi> and <hi>Sleswic,</hi> nor <hi>Oldenberg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorst</hi> can equall; the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall memory of your Oncle <hi>Frederique</hi> the second, of your Granfathers, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> the second and third, of your great Granfather <hi>Christian</hi> the first, doth so illustrat and ennoble; O the high felicity of the great <hi>Witikind,</hi> whose renown after so many centuries of yeers is yet fresh and fragrant.</p>
            <p>I will be modest in speaking of my <hi>Saxonian</hi> Family, twise Electorall, and in the setting forth of the magnitud of their merit; he made the greatest opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, who by indirect meanes was Emperour a while, but afterwards he forcd him to quitt it; an exploit to be preferrd before other tropheys and triumphs, because he therby did vindicat the liberty of <hi>Germany.</hi> I could run into a larg field to display the princely vertues and merits of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily—<hi>Sed Cynthius aurem vellit.

            <p>Touching the Family of the <hi>Bavarian Palatin,</hi> wheresoever I cast my eyes upon any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> I find most parts eccho forth their Glory: For out of this Family as out of a <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, there have issued out nombers of venturous and magnanimous Princes. <hi>Othowitelsbachius,</hi> who meerly for his high worth receavd <hi>Bavariae</hi> from <hi>Frederique</hi> the first, <hi>Lodwick</hi> the first, and second, both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors: <hi>Lodwick</hi> &amp; <hi>Rupert</hi> both Emperours, <hi>Wolfangus Bipontinus,</hi> who with five thousand Foot, and six thousand Horse, penetrated the very heart of <hi>France,</hi> and from the banks of the <hi>Rhin</hi> advancd as far as <hi>Aquitane,</hi> insomuch that the very name of <hi>Deuxponts</hi> is grown famous and dreadfull in <hi>France</hi> to this day. What shall I say of <hi>Albert</hi> the third, who being offerd the Kingdom of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> by a very splendid Embassy of the chiefest Nobles, utterly refusd it: <hi>Maximilian</hi> the present Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is accounted a Prince of consummated

wisdome, his Authority and Esteem being so great throughout the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: With what prudence, prowesse, and prosperous successe did he take <hi>Prague,</hi> when ther was an Army twice greatet in number that stood in his way! How glorious is the memory of <hi>Philip Palatin</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who made the great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman to break his Vow, wherof he had made three, the one to finish that huge Aquaeduct of bringing water into the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> from the <hi>Danube:</hi> The second to erect two Bridges in a Creek of the Hellespont, the third the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Austria;</hi> though he finisht the two first, yet he fayld in the performance of his last Vow, chiefly by the Valour of the foresayed <hi>Bavarian Philip,</hi> who forcd him to quit the Siege with tears in his eyes, and to go back with his three hundred thousand men, for his Army consisted of so many, though the Defendants in the Town were not sixteen thousand, who repelld them after twenty times storming.</p>
            <p>But I ascend to the cumble of all Renown and glory, the house of <hi>Austria;</hi> and now although I had a brazen brest, a hundred toungs, and so many throats, as the Poet once wishd, I should not be able to set forth the Majesty of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Stemm: Nay, if all the green leafs that wag in the <hi>Hercynian</hi> Forest were turnd to toungs, I should not be able to expand the glory of this Heroique Family.

I have read that when <hi>Timanthes</hi> wold have drawn <hi>Iphigenia</hi> standing at the Altar, and ready to be Sacrificed, together with the standers by, he painted them in a Picture of deep Melancholy, specially her Oncle; but being come to her Father, all his fancy being spent, he coverd him with a Vaile: So must I do at this time, passe over this <hi>Semidean</hi> Family with silence: for having spent my Fancy in displaying the high Vertues of other <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes, I want both imagination and words to set forth the glory of this. And now most judicious and noble gallant Princes, what think you of <hi>Germany?</hi> may not she expect the highest roome among the Kingdomes of <hi>Europe?</hi> Yes surely, being the seat of the Empire, the Source of such a Nobility, and having so many advantages besides. For my own particular, as we read that <hi>Plato</hi> gave Nature thanks for three things; <hi>viz.</hi> That he was born a man, and not a woman, a <hi>Greek,</hi> and not a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and not a <hi>Theban,</hi> specially in <hi>Socrates</hi> his time: So I render most hearty thanks to the divine Majesty for three things likewise, that he hath made me a man, a Christian, and a <hi>German,</hi> and that I live in the Raign of the most glorious Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ever <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> whom Heaven conserve.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O be a good Patriot, and to love his Countrey, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a noble mind in any man; for my own part I am so wholy possessd with an inhaerent, and tru naturall affection unto her, that did necessity require, I wold not only employ all the limbs of my body, and faculties of my brain to do Her service, but I would hazard the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest arteriall bloud which lies in the best ventricle of my heart, for her incolumity, honour, and wellfare; but now there is a businesse of another nature incumbent upon me, which is touching the Excellence and Prerogative of <hi>Germany,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the rest of the Provinces of <hi>Europe;</hi> and this task I must discharge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, measuring her according to her merit, not according to blind affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is far from the rules of Justice, and incongruous to reason we shold exalt our own, by depressing other Countries, or <hi>Dares</hi> like, triumph before Victory. We <hi>Germans</hi> do not see that Wallet that dangles behind us, which I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver now to shake off with a gentle hand: And by the favour of this high and honourable Assembly, and your patience, most illustrious Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> I will make it my businesse to make some inquiries into the extravagances, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and vices of our own Country, which when I have displayed unto you, I beleive you wil revoke your former Opinion of ascribing the Principality to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95159:22"/>Now, touching the Vices of <hi>Germany,</hi> as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayeth of the Bishop of <hi>Rome, Tantam esse papae amplitudinem &amp; Majestatem, ut perquam difficile sit illam definiri,</hi> The Amplitude and Majesty of the Pope is such, that it is a hard matter to define it; so by a kind of Antithesis I may say, the ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and customes of <hi>Germany</hi> are so large and lothsom, that it is a very difficult task to describe them. And where shall I begin this task? I will take my rise at the power and Dominions of <hi>Germany,</hi> which I find to faint, and languish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day more then other. O immortall God! What Diminutions hath she receavd? how many potent and flourishing States have fallen away from her? The <hi>Venetian,</hi> the <hi>Milanois,</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> the <hi>Genoways,</hi> the <hi>Luqueses,</hi> have quite shaken off her Yoke: Nay, <hi>Rome</hi> her self hath played the Fugitif, and ran away from her. Witnesse the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, who being to make his entrance into <hi>Rome,</hi> was let in, but limited to this condition by the Cardinall of <hi>Ostia, Ut neque Romae, neque in Italia diu moraretur,</hi> That he should not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ long in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Nauclerus</hi> hath it. Nay, all the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour is almost quite vanisht in <hi>Italy;</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Caesar</hi> cannot restore any of the Popes Subjects to his Birth-right, either in point of Title or Possession, without the Popes consent, which if it be wanting, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of legitimation is invalid: Nay, the Pope doth not onely interdict him in his, but he will not permit the Emperour to exercise absolute power in his own Territories: Witnesse that Act of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> who glorified himselfe to be of an Illustrious House, meaning a small Cottage, which for want of Roof took in alwaies the lustre of the <hi>Solar</hi> Beames. In this <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Pontificat, it chancd that the Count <hi>Pepili</hi> possessd som Manners beyond the River of <hi>Po;</hi> Cardinall <hi>Salviatus</hi> questioning his Title, in that the said Count came from the Race of som <hi>Banditi;</hi> he producd the Emperours grant, but this wold not serve the turn, for the sayed Cardinall causd him to be apprehended in his own Palace, and sending for a Ghostly Father to confesse him, he causd him to be presently strangled.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lorrainers, Burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Belgians;</hi> I mean the united Provinces are also revolted, who in regard they have by their Armes shaken off the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> alledg they have also at the same time freed themselfs from any Homage to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi> So have also the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> or <hi>Swisses,</hi> whom <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> calls <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellum principum, ac nobilium; Homines naturâ superbos, qui ipsam sibi Iustitiam famulari volunt, justumque id putant quod eorum phantasticis est conforme capitibus.</hi> The <hi>Swisses</hi> are a scourge of Princes and Nobles, men naturally proud, and who wold make Justice her self to attend them in quality of a servile handmaid, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that onely to be just, which conformes with their caprichious heads. Hereof ther was a late example, for being summond upon a Processe of a high nature to the Imperiall Chamber at <hi>Spire,</hi> they sent their rough-hewn Ambassadors, who told the Councell, <hi>Domini confaederati Helvetij vos vicinos suos salvere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, mirantur vero quod tam crebris citationibus, &amp;c.</hi> The Lords Confederats of <hi>Swisserland</hi> do greet you their Neighbours, but they wonder that by your so often Citations you wold disquiet them, therfore they pray and exhort you that you wold no longer molest them.</p>
            <p>So also ther are very spacious Countreys Northward, who have fallen quite away from our <hi>German</hi> Emperour; among others, som part of the <hi>Livonians</hi> Countrey, who when they were summond to obedience by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, otherwise he would reduce them by force, they answerd in a geering manner, That they knew his Horse wold be tyred before he could reach the skirts of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> as <hi>Thuanus</hi> hath it. Good Lord, whersoever I turn my eyes, I behold Nations revolted from <hi>Caesar,</hi> which makes the Imperiall Eagle so thinn of Feathers, and almost stark naked. From the raign of <hi>Rodolph</hi> the first, which is not much beyond the memory of man, I could instance in two hundred States and Princes who have unmembred and emancipated themselfs from our <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperour, who were usd to obey his summons, and make apparance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: All the <hi>Hansiatique</hi> Townes are now grown petty Republiques,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95159:22"/>
whereas they did once owe Vassallage to the Empire. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, though a glorious Prince, yet he made in his time such a pittifull complaint to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> that <hi>Germany</hi> was reducd to that penury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, that she was not onely not able to bear up against the incursions of the common Enemy, but she was not able to suppresse Domestique insolencies, and maintain Peace and Justice within her own dores; This <hi>Goldustus</hi> hath upon Record; nay <hi>Scioppius</hi> goes further, that <hi>Germany</hi> was grown so beggerly, that ther were some of her best born Children, som of Regall extraction, who had not three hundred Crownes a yeer for their whole subsistence, insomuch that many of them went habited rather like Poets then Princes; but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is too much, it is a meer <hi>Scioppian</hi> Chymera, and indeed there was not since the creation of man, a more lying and base licentious toungd fellow then <hi>Scioppius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, our very Foes can tell us our defects in Government, and in what a deplorable condition <hi>Germany</hi> stands, as will appeer by this example. When <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second was chosen Emperour, it chanced that <hi>Ibraim, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Ambassador was then at <hi>Frankefort,</hi> who having bin a spectator of the Shew, and observd what great Princes did attend the Emperour that day, and being told that som of them could raise an Army of themselfs against the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Ambassador smiling, sayed, That he doubted not of the strength of <hi>Germany,</hi> but that the minds, the counsells, and actions of the <hi>Germans,</hi> were like a Beast with many Heads and tayles, who being in case of necessity to passe through a Hedge, and every head seeking to finde a particular hole to passe through, they were a hindrance one to another, every head drawing after his own fancy, and so hazarded the destruction both of all the heads and tayles; but the Empire of <hi>Solyman</hi> his great Master, was like a Beast with many tayles, yet she had but one head, which head getting through, or over any passage, withour confusion of fancy and dispute of any other, all the tayles and the whole body followed him accordingly; well sayed the <hi>Turk,</hi> and very wisely, and I am sorry that we find it so by wofull experience.</p>
            <p>Ther is another mighty soloecism in the <hi>German</hi> Government, which is the confusion and differences that useth to be in Diets, which made. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> to give us a tart reprehension when he saith; <hi>Omnes Germanorum Dietas esse faecundas, et quamlibet in ventre habere alteram; Ac credibile est quia fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineum sit nomen, libenter impraegnari, Pietas est parturire.</hi> All the <hi>German</hi> Diets or Assemblies are fruitfull, so that every one hath another commonly in her belly; And it is credible that Diets, because they are of the Faeminine Gender, are willing to become pregnant and bring forth. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth could also say to the same purpose, That the <hi>German Iuntas,</hi> and <hi>Iudicatories</hi> and <hi>Diets</hi> were like Vipers, for as these destroy their Dam, so the latter decrees of <hi>Diets</hi> destroy the former. Now what a lame imperfect power the Emperour himself hath in these Imperiall Chambers or Diets we well know: Indeed as one said, the name of <hi>Caesar</hi> remaines, but the Majesty is gone. The thing it self is vanishd, and the shadow remaines. O degenerous times! O deplorable poor <hi>Germany:</hi> In former times the greatest Kings of <hi>Europ</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> thought it no disparagement to submit to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and now not only Kings, but every meane Count doth scorn to stoop to him; And indeed it doth not tend much to the reputation of our Ancestors, that in lesse then three hundred yeers nine <hi>German</hi> Emperours should be destroyed, besides those that were deposed, and abdicated. It grieves me to remember here the improbous saying of <hi>Gerardus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who having with divers others conspird against. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the first, and intending to elect another, the said <hi>Gerardus</hi> having a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting horn about him, and being a potent popular man, in so much that he was calld <hi>propola imperij,</hi> the Huckster of the Empire, he belchd out these words: <hi>In hoc Cornu complures gesto Caesares,</hi> I carry many <hi>Caesars</hi> in this Horn; But the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95159:23"/>
               <hi>Albert</hi> by the speciall benedictions of Heaven was quit with them all at last, that he made them carry Doggs so many miles, which is accounted in <hi>Germany</hi> the most opprobrious and disgracefullest punishment that can be inflicted upon a Nobleman or Gentleman; whereas a Plebean is bound according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the offence, to carry a Chair from one County to another. So we read that <hi>Frederique Barbarossa</hi> made <hi>Hermannus,</hi> Count <hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> and ten Counts more, to carry Doggs above a whole <hi>German</hi> mile, for the praedations and insolencies they had committed, while he was in <hi>Italy.</hi> But whereas this kind of punishment is grown obsolet, I could wish it were still in force, we should not then have so many treasons, and transgressions of Imperiall sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Majesty of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the balance of Dollars, the decrees of Diets would be more regarded, and Justice would not be so frequently baffled, and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>It is an odd character that <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> gives of our Countreymen; <hi>Esse Homines qui nihil praeter vocem et membra haberent hominum, in summa feritate versutissimi, natumque mendacio genus.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> were men who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the voices, and Members of men, yet they had a great deale of wili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in their wildnes, a Race born for lies. Witnes their perfidious carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in Great <hi>Britany</hi> towards the old Inhabitants therof, when at a solemn mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Treaty they carried Knifes hid in their Stockins, wherwith in the midst of their salutations they murthered the ancient nobility of the <hi>Britons,</hi> who had come armeles into the field according to the Capitulations of agreement between them, that none should bring with him any offensive or defensive Weapon. Then when those <hi>Saxons,</hi> which were tru <hi>Germans,</hi> for they came from the lower circuit of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and to this day are calld <hi>Saxons</hi> by the Welsh and Irish, had taken firm footing in <hi>Britain,</hi> what a World of spoiles and devastations did they commit both by Land and Sea: In so much that <hi>Sidonius</hi> complaines of them, <hi>Quot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miges videris Saxones, totidem decernere putes Archipiratas, Ita simul omnes impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, parent, docent, discunt latrocinari. Hostis est omni hoste truculentior; est ijs quaedam cum discriminibus pelagi non notitia solum, sed familiaritas</hi>—As many <hi>Rowers</hi> you see of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> you discern so many Rovers and Arch-pirats: They all command, and obey, they learn, and teach how to robb; An enemy more truculent then any enemy, They have not only knowledg, but a familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the sea &amp;c. I beleeve ther is none here who is ignorant of the story of <hi>Hatto</hi> the first Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who so basely betrayed <hi>Albertus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> who had casually slain <hi>Conradus</hi> the Emperours brother, who having besiegd him in <hi>Therussa</hi> castle, the sayed <hi>Albert</hi> was perswaded by <hi>Hatto</hi> to go and submitt himself to the Emperour, and he promised to bring him safe back to his Castle, which he did: but <hi>Albert</hi> had his hand tied behinde, and so as soon as he returnd his head was chopd off; but <hi>Hatto</hi> sayed, to excuse himself, that he had only promisd to bring him back to the place from which he had fetchd him, and no more. What a horrible story is there of another <hi>Hatto,</hi> an Archbishop also of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who was devoured and eaten up alive by rats for his uncharitablenesse to the poor in a yeer of famine, whom he had lodgd in a great barne, and putting fyre therunto in the dead of night he burnt them all, saying, that those were the rats which devourd his corn; And that this story may be upon perpetuall record, the castle where he was eaten, is called <hi>Rat</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to this day, being scituated in the middle of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> whither the Rats swomm after him, and never left him till they had bin the executioners of divine vengeance upon him.</p>
            <p>Another such a horrid story as this was that of the devill who appeerd at <hi>Hamelen</hi> in the shape of pied piper, which towne being very much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with rats, the sayed piper did covenant with the Burgers to free them of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95159:23"/>
that Vermin for such a reward, which he was to receave a yeer after they saw themselfs freed; Hereupon the Piper playing upon a kind of bagpipes that he had, all the rats followed him to a great lough hard by, where he drownd them all: but returning at the yeers end for his reward, the Burgers wold put him off with a small matter; thereupon playing upon his pipes one evening, all the children of the town followed him to the mouth of a hill, where he and the children vanished; There is a great stone piller stands in that place, whereon there is mention hereof, and the people of the town to this day in all their publick writings draw their Epoches and computation of yeers from the going out of their children. And as the devill appeerd here in the shape of a piper; so nere <hi>Bremen</hi> he gott into a Butcher, who being inraged one day with his wife that was bigg with childe, he took her into a stable and ripping up hir belly took out the embryon; &amp; ther being a sow hard by big with pigs, he killd the sow also, and taking out the piggs, he sowed them up in his wifes belly, and the childe in the sow's. Can the witt of man run upon a more nefandous thing? But <hi>Germany</hi> is full of these bloody stories. And whereas you know we have a custom when any notorious theef is hangd to stick so many pegs in the gibbet as he had killd men, it is ordinary to finde in <hi>Moravia,</hi> and other places such gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets som with twenty, som with thirty, and I heard lately of one that had sixty three peggs stuck into it, denoting so many murthers by one man. Now, if we descend to Low <hi>Germany,</hi> we shall find hir litle inferiour to the Higher in strange kindes of immanities. What an inhuman thing was that in <hi>Gant,</hi> when the father and the son being condemnd to die for one Fact, it was adjudged they shold draw lotts whither the father should hang the son, or the son the father, and it fell to the son, who accordingly thrust out of the world him who brought him in. But now I speake of the Citty of <hi>Gant,</hi> which is held to bee one of the most mutinous and inconstant Cities of Christendom (and therfore no wonder that she hath so many windmills within her walls) what nation, I say, hath shewd more arguments of instability then <hi>Allmain;</hi> Go first to Religion, since that Shaveling Monke <hi>Luther</hi> fell in love with the Abadesse, to enjoy which he made Religion his bawd, I pray you how many new Sects have crept in since? <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> came apace after him, he usherd in the Anabaptists, then what a swarm of <hi>Swenkfeldians, Osiandrians, Huberians, Oecolampadians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> have we; and if you desire more, you may go to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> Where you shall find as many sorts as ther be of <hi>Venice</hi> glasses in <hi>Murano.</hi> What a scandall to the <hi>German</hi> Nation was <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> that frantique Rascall? what an opprobry to Christianity is that <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> wher such a confusion of Religions is allowed! &amp; no wonder, for she is one of the nearest to Hell of any town upon earth. And as in the reign of <hi>Nimrod</hi> there fell a curse upon those that would dwel so high by a confusion of tongues, so a confusion of beliefs is fallen upon these men by dwelling too low, and cosen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fish of their inheritance, for indeed the Fish shold inhabit that Countrey which they have forced out of the jawes of the Sea, and thereby may be called tru Usurpers.</p>
            <p>But touching religion, the French fancy was never so greedy after new fashions in apparrell, as we Germans high and low do thirst after new fangling opinions in matters appertaining to Christian Doctrin and discipline: It was a notable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Queen Katherin <hi>de Medici</hi> when she was Regent of France, that the two greatest Heretiques which Europe produced were <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Machiavil</hi> (hir Countrey man) the one in matters of piety, the other of policy. But we Germans being commonly of a higher stature then other Nations, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard to Houses of five or sixe stories high, wherein the upper rooms are worst furnished, meaning the cells of our brains; as if the largenes of members shold lessen the strength of the mind, according to that of <hi>Seneca, Nimio robore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum vigor mentis hebescit, quasi abnuente naturâ vtriusque boni largitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>

Nay, as they say, the <hi>English</hi> are good <hi>Inventis addere,</hi> to improve any new Invention, so they go beyond us; for whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> doth pelt the brain with small shot, the Englishman doth storm it with whole canons and huge carowses; for he when he is at it doth not sipp and drink by halfs, or demurr upon it by som discourse as the <hi>German</hi> doth, or eat some salt quelchose between, but he deals in shire liquor, and is quickly at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his cupp without any intervening discourse.

I heard of four old men in the upper <hi>Saxony,</hi> that having mett at a clubb, they did not stir til they had drunk as many healths as they had yeers betwixt them; all which came to above three hundred.

            <p>Now, to draw towards a conclusion, it cannot be denied but heretofore the <hi>Germans</hi> were appoved men for military glory, but, <hi>Helas,</hi> they are now much eclipsd; The knights of <hi>Rhodes</hi> disswading <hi>Soliman</hi> the Great Turk to warr against <hi>Europe,</hi> especially against <hi>Germany,</hi> He answerd, I esteem the armes of the <hi>Germans</hi> lesse, then of any others, and that for four cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. <hi>Quia sunt discordes, et quemadmodum sui quinque digiti, it a illi nanquam in unum coalescant; Quia laborum sunt impatientes, et prae aliis Germani sunt helluones, Potatores, qui in castris scortorum turbam foveant, Ducesque belli plumis potius, quam armis militaribus gaudeant, quia temere.</hi>—I value not the <hi>Germans</hi> much, because they are at discord, nor can they be ever made one, no more then my five fingers; They are impatient of labour, and above all others they are gluttons, and drinkers, fit to march in a Field of Whores, and they take more pride in their feathers then their armes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Germany</hi> glorieth much that she was the first Inventresse of gunpowder, and printing, of Artillery &amp; Typography; whereof, contrary to the Genius and function of the men, a Fryer found out the first, and a soldier the second; But if we may give credit to <hi>Maffeius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Iovius,</hi> and <hi>Boterus,</hi> three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and sober Authors, They will tell you the contrary; and they were first invented and practised in <hi>China,</hi> the most Orientall Countrey upon this part of the Hemisphear.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Emperour Maximilian the first, who may be said to have deserved that <hi>name</hi> for the magnitude of his merits, his singular wisedom, his incomparable spirit, as well as from the sacred Font of Regeneration, in some familiar discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with his Domestique Lords about the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> is said to have broken out into this high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof. <hi>If it could stand with the order of Nature that any mortal man might be a God here among the Elements, and I were Hee, I would so dispose in my Will (quantum ad familiae herciscundae judicium) touching the division of my estate, that my eldest son should be God after me, (absit proptana mens) but my second should be King of France.</hi> This saying or excesse of speech must be interpreted with a sane judgment; for hereby the noble Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour meant nothing els then to intimate his opinion touching that potent, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and opulent Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and that no one Countrey under the Sun is preferrable to it. I use this preface, most excellent Princes, for preparing your attentions; and if peradventure I be transported too far with the elogie of <hi>France,</hi> I may have the suffrage of so noble an Emperour and a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our own, to apologize for me; And truly though I owe my vitals to <hi>Germany</hi> and all that I have, being my most dear native soyl, yet let me not be thought to degenerate a jot from the nature of a <hi>German,</hi> if in my subsequent discourse I hold <hi>France</hi> to have the advantage of <hi>Germany</hi> in divers things; as also of any <hi>Europaean</hi> Country besides; which while I endeavour to assert and prove, I humbly desire this most Noble Auditory that the same gale of favor and candor may blow upon me all along as I go, which did on that Illustrious Prince who spoke before me.</p>
            <p>And now will I endeavour to take a survey of <hi>France,</hi> which noble Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy whosoever will behold with a judicious and impartial eye, will acknowledg that first for her position and site she hath the advantage of any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being placed in the Center of <hi>Europe,</hi> having <hi>Italy, Spain, Germany,</hi> and Great Britain round about Her; She enjoyes a most delicate temper of clime, for she needs not either the stoves of <hi>Germany</hi> to preserve her children from the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95159:27"/>
inclemency of the Heavens in point of cold, or the subterranean caves in other Countries to refresh her in point of heat, nor is she much infected with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsom aguish and infectious aires which in other Countreys produce such a legion of diseases. Now, that which adds much to the advantage of her situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that she lieth accessible and open to all mankind for Commerce and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation both by Land and Sea, and being seated so in the midst she is the fittest to be Arbitresse, and to give law to the rest of Christendom, as being able to divide, hinder, or unite the Forces of <hi>Europe</hi> when she pleaseth; She stands commodiously to restrain the growing and unproportionable greatnes of some, as also to releeve the weaker, that they be not oppressed by the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: She bridles Great <hi>Britany</hi> backward; On the right hand she checks <hi>Spain,</hi> on the left hand <hi>Germany</hi> both high and low. The <hi>Ocean</hi> and <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi> wash both her sides, the <hi>Alps</hi> fence her from <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains from <hi>Spain,</hi> those huge hills serving her as trenches of Circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations against both; And where nature fayles, she secures her self by art, by Fortresses, Cittadels, and Castles.</p>
            <p>To this Strength of hers may be added her plenty, and indeed she may be call'd a <hi>Copia Cornu,</hi> or a <hi>Pandora's</hi> box of all things for necessity or pleasure, and she useth to give such largesse of her luxuriant fortune abroad, that she is a Creditor to all other peeple, but a Debtor to none; Those commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which use to enrich other Countreys singly are here all conjunct, and what is exotique or strange in other Countreys is here domestique &amp; common; Which <hi>Italy,</hi> who useth to be sparing of other's praises, and prodigal of her own, doth acknowledg, for <hi>Boterus</hi> saith, that those things which are found but in some places of <hi>Italy,</hi> are found every where in <hi>France.</hi> Therefore the character which <hi>Pliny</hi> gave in times past to <hi>Province,</hi> and <hi>Salvianus</hi> gave to <hi>Aquitania</hi> in particular, may be applyed to <hi>France</hi> in general. <hi>Narbonensis Provincia agrorum cultu, &amp;c.</hi> The Countrey of <hi>Narbon</hi> saith <hi>Pliny</hi> is not to be postpos'd to any other either for Agriculture, for foecundity of soyl, for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of wealth, for Nobles and Gentry, &amp;c. And <hi>Salvianus</hi> saith, that <hi>Aquitania</hi> is not only a fat Countrey, and full of marrow, but she hath as much jucundity as fertility, as much real pleasure as outward beauty: <hi>Nam Illic omnis admodum Regio aut intertexta est Vineis, aut florulenta pratis, aut irrigata fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, aut interfusa fluminibus, aut distincta culturis, aut consita pomis, aut amaenata lucis, aut crinita messibus, Ut verè possessores ac Domini illius terrae non tam soli istius portionem quàm Paradisi imaginem possidere Videantur.</hi> There every place is either interwoven with Vines, or flowr'd with Medowes, or set with Orchards, or cut by Corn fields, or peepled with Trees, and Woods, or refresh'd with Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or inchanel'd with Rivers, or periwigg'd with all sorts of grain; In so much that the Inhabitants of that Countrey may be sayed to have a peece of Paradise rather then a portion of the Common Earth.</p>
            <p>But the four Cardinal Commodities of <hi>France</hi> may be said to be <hi>Corn, Wine, Hemp,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> which <hi>Boterus</hi> calls <hi>Galliae Magnetes,</hi> the four Loadstones of <hi>France:</hi> For as the loadstone, especially the blew and Ethiopian, is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in weight then silver, and hath an attractive Vertu to draw, and embrace iron with other mettals, so these <hi>French</hi> Loadstones which are so far more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the Ethiopians, as the climes are in temper, and noblenesse, do draw unto them all the silver and gold of their neighbours; so that <hi>France</hi> may be call'd the Exchequer of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching <hi>French</hi> Corn ther's no question but it is the perfect'st of all other, <hi>Solinus,</hi> and <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> expatiate themselves very far in the <hi>French</hi> fields, and speak much of their fatnesse and foecundity; Nor was <hi>Cicero</hi> himself si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but he speaks of vast proportions of Corn which were exported from the Gaules of <hi>France;</hi> And <hi>Pliny,</hi> one of Natures Protonotaries, bears witnesse that the Gallic corn was <hi>nitidissimi grani. &amp; plus panis reddere quàm far aliud;</hi> it was of a neat grain, and yeelded more bread then other Wheat: Who knowes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95159:27"/>
not but <hi>Spain</hi> might starve without <hi>French</hi> Corn, which is transmuted to Indian silver and gold; Insomuch that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> may be said to have the <hi>dominion</hi> of the Mines of <hi>Mexico,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> reap the <hi>benefit</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Now, touching the <hi>French</hi> Wines we may well say they need no bush; for by bartring of useful rich Commodities, and great summes of Money, the <hi>English, the Scots, the Flemins, Hollanders, Germans, Danes, Swedes,</hi> and other bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacious Northern Nations fetch away Vast quantities by Sea, and by Land; <hi>Bodin</hi> speaks of one <hi>Laud</hi> a Marchant of <hi>Cambray</hi> who bought and brought in Carts 33000. barrels of <hi>French</hi> Wines in one yeer. Now, as the grape <hi>streptos</hi> according to <hi>Pliny</hi> doth turn about with the Sun, so the <hi>French</hi> nectar confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it self to the course of the Sun, doth refresh as it were with a golden showr all the circumjacent Countreys. What shall I say of the excellent stomack Wines of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the full bodied Wines of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which by an expresse Edict are prohibited from the Kings Cellers by reason of their strength; the neat Whites of <hi>Aix,</hi> the rich <hi>Frontiniak</hi> and most pleasant Wines of <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> fit to feast the gods withal? In some places of <hi>Burgundy</hi> there are Wine Vessels as big as some Houses in altitude, little inferior to the Vast vessels of <hi>Heydel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>erg, Tubinga</hi> and <hi>Groninghen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to <hi>Hemp</hi> the third loadstone of <hi>France,</hi> and indeed it is more precious then any Gem or jewel: who would think that such a contemptible Vegetal scarce a yard high should be able to remove <hi>Egipt to Italy?</hi> for we read that <hi>Galerius</hi> in 6. daies sayl'd from <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Alexandria, Babilius</hi> in <hi>six,</hi> that can bring <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Hercules</hi> pillers, and the Baltic Sea to the Hellespont: a poor Vegetal that can remove this upper part of the Hemisphere to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes,</hi> for the Navigators into the <hi>East Indies</hi> do so. A vegetal that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <hi>Eolus,</hi> and overmaster <hi>Neptune</hi> himself both winds and waves, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the impetuous whirlwinds of the one, and the tumblings of the other; a Vegetal that can joyn East and West, North and South together, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange mutual offices of humanity and frendship. Now where doth this so useful Vegetal grow more copiously then in <hi>France?</hi> She furnisheth all her Neighbours with Sayles for their Ships, and shirts for their backs.</p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>Salt</hi> which savours all things, how much are all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys obliged to <hi>France</hi> for this wholsome commodity? I have heard there are rocks of Salt in <hi>Ormus,</hi> that in <hi>Carra</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> they make walls and houses of <hi>massy salt.</hi> In <hi>Hungary</hi> they have Mines of Salt, but both Sea and Land makes <hi>France</hi> abound with Salt wherewith she preserves from stinking, those huge Regions of the North, where, as <hi>Catullus</hi> saith,</p>

            <p>What millions of bushels of Salt are expended, and exported out of <hi>France</hi> ev'ry yeer? how doth salt fill the Kings Coffers with treasure? In so much that in the last computation that was made, it appeer'd that the <hi>French</hi> King had 20. millions of Franks from this sole commodity which is two millions of pounds sterling.</p>
            <p>'Tis tru, <hi>Spain</hi> hath Salt, but it is more corroding, and acrimonious; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifths time, when for the vent of the Spanish Salt he had put out a Placart prohibiting that no <hi>French</hi> salt should be us'd in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> the Countrey was like to mutiny for this tart proclamation, because the Spanish salt was nothing so vigorous and sweet as the <hi>French.</hi>

Ther are great number of large deep ponds. The Countrey is cover'd in many places with delightful Woods and Lawnes, which, besides the pleasure the Gentry are permitted to have without injury done to the peason, afford not only fire for the Kitchin, but instruments for war by Sea and land: <hi>Pliny</hi> was not deceiv'd when he said that <hi>France</hi> was full of yew Trees, which though it be poysonous if one sleeps or eats under them, (whence may be inferr'd that <hi>toxica</hi> came first from <hi>taxica</hi> or <hi>taxus,</hi>) yet there is a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found out, that if one doth beat into the yew a brasse nayl, it takes away the force of any poyson.</p>

And nature hath furnish'd the bowels of <hi>France</hi> with this mettal more then ordinary that she might defend herself, and arm her couragious sons: There is good store also of other mettals, and although <hi>Diodorus</hi> seems to undervalue <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she hath no Mines of silver, he is deceiv'd; for though by a casual fire that happen'd among the Shepherds on the <hi>Pyreney</hi> hills, which search'd the very bowels of the Earth, and melted the Mines of gold and silver; yet <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus Bertinus</hi> affirmeth, that if we would go to the pains, there might be as much gold dig'd out of that part of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> hills which look upon <hi>France,</hi> as is found in <hi>Peru.</hi> But the vertu of <hi>France</hi> looks upward towards heaven; for since the upper parts of her earth affords all things that may satisfie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane desire and appetite, even <hi>Apidicus</hi> himself, why should we tear the bowels of so kind and benigne a Mother?

            <p>Moreover in the Constitutions of the Emperours <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Gratianus</hi> ther is mention made that <hi>France</hi> was full of Philosophers, Rhetoricians, and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians, who excell'd both in the <hi>Attique</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Learning. To this tribe of learned men are to be refer'd the <hi>Druyds,</hi> the <hi>Eubages</hi> and <hi>Bards,</hi> among whom <hi>Votienus Montanus, Domitius, After, Gabinianus, M. Aper, Iul. Florus, Iul.

            <p>Now touching the <hi>Lutetian</hi> Academy in <hi>Paris,</hi> she is acknowledg'd to be the Mother of all the rest, one of the brightest eyes of all <hi>Europe,</hi> the great nomber of Masters in all faculties there make all the World to make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses thither for instruction. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third gave this character of <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Studium Parisiense erat fundamentum Ecclesiae.</hi> Ther have bin known to be in <hi>Paris</hi> at one time 20000. Students, and somtimes 30000. until the Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the Roman Capitol, the <hi>Iesuits</hi> did draw away and allure the chief flower of our youth to their Colleges. What a brave masculin spirit was <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> a man of high reason, and an invincible Disputant, who was born in a convenient time to vindicat his Countrey from the Encroachments of the Papall power, and keep it within its own channel so that it shold not mound, and overwhelm the Prerogatives of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Monarchy, whereof the Colledg of <hi>Sorbon</hi> may be sayed to be one of the chiefest props. Besides <hi>Paris</hi> ther are 15. great Seminaries of learning, and seates of Muses, whence as from never drieng sources all scientifical knowledg do flow, and disperse it self every where. What great lights of Learning were <hi>Io. Gerson, Peter Lombard, Gentianus Hervetus,</hi> who was so much admir'd in the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councel; What Giants of Erudition were <hi>Vatablus, Io.

            <p>Now, let it be observ'd that the <hi>French</hi> toung hath a great advantage in couching any kind of knowledg as well for the copiousnesse, as the lenity and smoothnesse of speech, wherein neither her mother the Latin, or her two sisters the Italian and Spanish can contend with her, nor our Teutonique also which is so sinewy and masculine a language being so knotted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nor is ther any kind of science or knowledg but you shall find it in the <hi>French</hi> toung, so that if all other toungs were perish'd, ther might be an instauration, and consummation made of all arts and learning in the <hi>French</hi> alone; Therfore <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour the compleatest Prince of his time was overheard to tell his Son <hi>Philip</hi> in a privat discourse that he held it a signal honor, that by his grandmother <hi>Mary of Valois</hi> he was extracted of the illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous progeny of <hi>France,</hi> and that he could speak that language, which was very frequent in his Court among his domestiques. Now, it cannot be denied but this <hi>French</hi> toung hath many Dialects, and in these dialects ther are as is found in all other languages certain <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Now for <hi>language, vertu</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have perfected all three with a marvailous dexterity and promptitude of nature, and a rare vigor of all the senses inward and outward; which makes <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> to break out thus into their praises. <hi>I find there is a fiery kind of vigor, and mature celerity in the French which other Nations have not: To whatsoever they apply themselves they become nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proficients, and arrive to a perfection in a short time, whether it be in the mystery of Marchandising, in letters, armes or Arts; Paulus Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For they who have had intimacy with the <hi>French</hi> and studied the nation in general, will say otherwise of them.</p>
            <p>But that which is most noble in <hi>France,</hi> and which elevats Her above all other Empires is the Majesty of her Kings, wherof ther have bin so many brave heroique Monarks who have don such exploits, that one may speak more of them in telling <hi>truth,</hi> then can be spoken of Others in vapouring out <hi>hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles and lies.</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> writing to <hi>Childebert</hi> King of France, <hi>Quantò cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros homines Regia dignitas antecellit, tantò caeterarum gentium regna Regni vestri culmen excellit.</hi> As much as Kings excel other men, so far doth the glory of yours exceed the Kingdomes of other Nations. <hi>Honorius</hi> the third said, that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was the unexpugnable wall of Christendom. <hi>Urban</hi> the fourth saith, that the King of <hi>France</hi> is the morning Star in the midst of the Western clowds, He is an Earthly God in his own Kingdom, he is above all Kings; <hi>Ejús<expan>

The same <hi>Maximilian</hi> also in the Councel of <hi>Constance</hi> protested that he had rais'd 100. tonnes of gold out of his own patrimonial demeanes to support the sacred Roman Empire, and all that while he had not receiv'd from the States of the Empire 40000. flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins.</p>
            <p>Now, because my discourse hath transported me so far, I cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely groan, and deplore the state of the Empire, and to what a pitiful low ebb 'tis fallen unto; For wheras in the time of <hi>Frederic</hi> the first, (and the strength of the Empire was then much attenuated) the annual revenues came to 60000. tonnes of gold, which amounts to about 6. millions sterling, the exility of the rents of <hi>Caesar</hi> which he gets by the Empire are scarce able, as <hi>Schneiderin</hi> a famous Civil Lawyer doth assert, to maintain the domestic expences of the Imperial Court, nor those neither unlesse <hi>Caesar</hi> did contribut much therunto out of his own patrimonial inheritances, which made Cardinal <hi>Granvil</hi> to affirm aloud in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. <hi>ex Imperio ne tantillum Emolumenti habere Caesarem,</hi> that <hi>Caesar</hi> had no Emolument at all from the Empire, and we know no King in Christendom was reduc'd to that tenuity.</p>
            <p>But <hi>France</hi> is not subject to those <hi>Comitial</hi> diseases or <hi>Diets</hi> of the Empire, being secure by the succession and prerogatives of her Kings, who have a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent and absolut authority not derived at all from their subjects; wherby <hi>Caesar</hi> himself may be sayed to be inferior in point of power, though not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, though as <hi>Bartolus</hi> averrs, <hi>Haeretici sunt pronunciandi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>

Herupon <hi>Hospitalius Charles</hi> the ninth's Chancelor in presence of the King himself and the assembly of the three Estates procur'd it to be enacted, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> the very same moment that they entred into the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeer of their age shold be pronounc'd capable to raign, and to be out of his <hi>minority,</hi> and so govern <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choativè.</hi> Now for the Imperial Lawes, their reason and equity may be haply made use of in other Dominions, but not their authority and sanction; No more could the <hi>Romans</hi> in times past be sayed to be any way under the <hi>Greeks,</hi> because they borrowed, and made use of som Lawes of theirs. No more can

the <hi>Turks</hi> be sayed to be any way subject to the <hi>Romans</hi> because they have the <hi>Iustinian Code</hi> translated into their vulgar language, and that their <hi>Cadies</hi> make use of them to rectifie somtimes natural reason.</p>
            <p>Furthermore the supereminent royalties of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> appeer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, in that they have the sole power to indict war, or establish peace, to make leagues and confederacies, to enact Lawes, to creat Magistrates of the gown and the sword, to give pardon for lives, to stamp money, to give letters of denization, to impose taxes, and make pecuniary levies at pleasure. Now, the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> is like a most fertile and florishing medow, wheron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit flocks of sheep do feed and bear golden fleeces, which may be shorn when the shepherd pleaseth; yet I will except here the province of <hi>Languedoc</hi> wher the King cannot exact any subsidiary contributions, without the expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the <hi>three Estates</hi> of that Countrey.</p>
            <p>For administration of Civil Justice, <hi>France</hi> comes short of no other Region, whose charge it is to preserve the Kings prerogatives, as well as the priviledg of the subject; To which end ther be 8. Courts of Parlement whose names are known to any that have travel'd <hi>France;</hi> Among these that of <hi>Paris</hi> is the most praedominant in regard the Parlament of Peers is alwayes there residing, which high Court useth to <hi>verifie</hi> (not <hi>confirm</hi>) all the Kings Edicts to make them the more plausible, and for <hi>form</hi> sake only. Now, as <hi>France</hi> is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Europe,</hi> so that Parlement is the eye of <hi>France,</hi> and the Parlement of Peers is the apple of that eye; Nor do ther want examples how other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Kings and Princes have refer'd themselves to this Court of Parlement, as a high consistory of reason, and Justice, as being <hi>Astrea's</hi> noblest tribunal. The Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the second refer'd the controversies 'twixt him and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, touching the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the decision of this Court: So the Count of <hi>Namur</hi> in a difference 'twixt <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> and him touching the County of <hi>Namur</hi> put himself upon the verdict of this Court, and he therby carried his businesse. <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Tarentum</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in this Court, touching som expences made in recovering the Greek Empire; The Dukes of <hi>Lorain</hi> have in divers things refer'd themselves to the judgment of this Court; They of <hi>Cambray</hi> who are a free peeple have bin willing to be tryed by it: The confederacy also 'twixt the Kingdom of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> were confirm'd by this Court, Nor is ther any admitted to this Soverain Court but persons either priviledg'd by their birth, or men of exquisit knowledg, erudition, and integrity. When <hi>Henry</hi> the second King of <hi>France</hi> by the eager importunity of a great Princesse had recommended one of the long Robe to this Court, and being rejected, he spoke merrily, <hi>je pensois que parmy tant de chevaux d'espagne vn asne pourroit bien passer,</hi> I thought that among so many Spanish <hi>ginets</hi> one <hi>Asse</hi> might have well pass'd.</p>
            <p>Now for the Oppidan Government of <hi>Paris</hi> ther is such special circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection had, that never any is intrusted with the chiefest office in the Citty call'd the <hi>Provost of the Marchants,</hi> unlesse he be a man of eminent parts, probity and prudence, and generally esteemed so; so that it is us'd as a common saying to their Children if they commit any absurd or base thing, <hi>Tu ne seras point prevost des Marchands,</hi> Thou shalt never be Provost of the Marchants.</p>
            <p>And among others the providence and prudence of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth was notable, who had alwayes by him a catalogue of the discreetest, and best qualified Cittizens upon whom he us'd to confer offices of Magistracy accordingly.</p>
            <p>And the time was when the Kings of <hi>France</hi> us'd to sit upon the tribunal themselves to determine causes, <hi>Charles</hi> the eight devoted two daies every week to that purpose, and St. <hi>Lewis</hi> three; Nor are there any Kings so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95159:33"/>
obvious and accessible as those of <hi>France.</hi> For as the Sun when he is up in the Orient displayes his beames upon all alike, upon the Prince as well as the peasan, upon the shrub as well as the Cedar; so the Kings of <hi>France</hi> behold all their Subjects with like humanity and grace; They are benigne and affable to all both in speech, countenance and gesture, and seldom are any of them revengeful.</p>
            <p>As ther is a memorable passage of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, who while he was Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> fell in some disgrace with <hi>Charles</hi> the eight; herupon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers great men and others seeing him clowded in the Kings favour, did him sundry ill offices, <hi>Charles</hi> being dead and he succeeding in the throne, a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to get som boon of him, told him of such and such who had bin no frends of his in his predecessors time, and so wish'd his Majestie to question, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them; The King answered, <hi>Tu vero aliud a me pete, &amp; meritis tuis gratia erit, Nam Rex Galliae non exequitur injurias Ducis Aurelianensis:</hi> Propose som other thing unto me, and I will prefer thee, for the King of <hi>France</hi> is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries of the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Kings of <hi>France</hi> are remarkable for their freedom, mildnesse and mansuetude to their subjects, so is the affection of the <hi>French</hi> alwayes in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense degree towards their King.</p>
            <p>Nor was ther ever a more pregnant example hereof then at the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the report wher of struck such an Earthquake into the hearts of many thousands, that som Ladies miscarried in childbirth before their time, others died suddenly upon the newes: Every one up and down the streets both men, women and children damn'd the Assassin to a thousand hells both his soul and body; Every one scruing up his witt how to devise som exquisit lasting torment for <hi>Ravillac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if all matters were weigh'd in an impartial balance of justice, who can deny but the most Christian King of <hi>France</hi> is preferrable before all other Earthly Potentates: For although the Emperour by an old custom be the Prime of Princes, yet the King of <hi>France</hi> appeers in more glorious Robes then He, He hath a far more numerous guard then He; The King of <hi>France</hi> is the first Son of the holy Church; and well they may deserve it for their sanctity, and munificence to the Temple of God; and so many Voyages they made abroad to redeem the Sepulcher of Christ, and the Countrey which he did blesse with his feet, from the slavery of Infidels.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are call'd The Poets <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by Excellency; As the Pope is call'd <hi>the</hi> Bishop; so is the King of France <hi>The</hi> King: 'Tis he that by a special benediction from Heaven doth cure the <hi>Struma</hi> or the Kings Evil, and to that end His Court is frequently strew'd with sick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients of all Nations, and with <hi>Spaniards</hi> as much as any other who clammer over the <hi>Pyreneans</hi> Hills, and make a kind of pilgrimage unto him, and he doth it with that modesty that he alwayes entitles the cure upon God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his speech in performance of the Act, <hi>Le Roy te touche, Dieu te guerisse.</hi> The King toucheth thee, God heal thee.</p>

Crowns upon the <hi>Reformists,</hi> it was discover'd that he had levied 300 thousand crowns in lieu of the 30.</p>
            <p>But among other ocasions and bayts of Injustice in <hi>France,</hi> the nundination and sale of Judiciary offices which lye prostant for him who gives most, is one of the greatest and dishonorablest, for it is lawful for him who buyes to sell again, Insomuch that it often falls out that they who buy by detayl do sell again in grosse: Others clean contrary do buy in grosse and sell by detayl, as But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers use to do in buying a beast for the slaughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom they afterwards cut into parts, and haply make one quarter to pay for the whole. It is recorded by a modest Author, that in the compasse of 20. yeers ther came to the Kings coffers above 26. millions of crownes this way; And they wold justifie this by the example of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who to support the war they had against <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, they rais'd 5. millions by selling Offices by outcry under a spear to the highest bidder, and by this way they were said to have levied 100. millions since to preserve S. <hi>Marks</hi> bank from breaking: But the rate of Offices in <hi>France</hi> is mounted now to its highest pitch, <hi>La vente des Offices aujourdhuy est montés a sa periode.</hi> A President's or Attorney Generals place is valued at about 20000. franks, 2000. l. sterling, which the poor client in a short time payes treble again.</p>
            <p>It was a brave law of <hi>Theodosius and Valentinian,</hi> that none shold be promoted to publique honors, or Magistracies for money, but for merit, and that the party advanc'd shold be liable to an oath that he came to his place with clean hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without gratuity, price or compromise directly or indirectly.

they either give the more at first, or they give an annual pension wherby most of the places of Judicature in <hi>France</hi> are not onely vendible, but hereditary.

            </p>
            <p>Besides this institory and marchandising way of handling Justice, 'tis incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible what multitudes of gown'd cormorants ther are in <hi>France,</hi> as Advocates, Proctors, Scribes, Clerks, Solliciters, who prey upon the poor Client, and suck his vital spirits, they are call'd the <hi>souris de Palais,</hi> the <hi>mice</hi> of the Court, and the Judges the <hi>ratts,</hi> they are as thick as gnats, and able to corrupt ten worlds: <hi>Stephen Paschasius</hi> recordeth, and he was a man of great ingenuity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, that the King of France might raise an Army of 200 thousand Scribes or Chicanears as they term common Barretors, and Clerks, and <hi>VVolfangas Prisbachius</hi> thinks ther are more of those in <hi>Paris</hi> alone, then in all <hi>Germany,</hi> which is estimated to be two parts in three larger then <hi>France:</hi> ther's not a word, syllable, or letter of the Law, but they will draw you arguments of strife from them, for the propagation of Pleas.</p>
            <p>Nor is Justice lesse abus'd there by the multitude of Lawes which is beyond belief, which the subtile capacities and working brains of that peeple use to wrest, and distort as they please, making therof a nose of wax; As also the revocation of Ordinances and Arrests, which is so frequent among them; In so much that as <hi>Baudius</hi> observes, the high supreme Court of <hi>France</hi> whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was held so sacred, doth retain little of its pristin ancient Majesty, the King Edicts which they verifie being so commonly repeal'd.</p>
            <p>Now, as in a working tempestuous Sea ther is not a drop of water stable and quiet, but one wave struggles, and thrusts one another forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Or as a Shipp under sayl wrestleth as she makes her way with the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling billowes, so <hi>France</hi> may be sayed to be over-whelm'd with an Ocean of confusion.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>France</hi> at home is so subject to acts of oppression and injustice, so whensoever she hath taken footing in any Countrey abroad, her children shew themselves what they are, and who was their mother, by ther insolencies, and extortions; They corrupt the manners of all Nations where they com, with their fashions and levity; They do not only corrupt the mind, but they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the body with their foul disease, and leave stigmatizations behind them.</p>

            <p>Ther is another pregnant example how the State of the United Provinces having made a voluntary election of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> for their Governor, being induc'd therunto by the Letters of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> how unjustly, perfidiously, and ingratefully the said Duke did carry himself with his train of ruffling <hi>French,</hi> by attempting in a proditorious way to make himself absolute and independent, but the cocatrice was crush'd in the shell, and his design fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, yet for his person and domestiques he was suffer'd to depart civilly, and peaceably, though ingloriously in point of reputation to himself and his Countrey; This was the reward the <hi>French</hi> gave the <hi>Belgians,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that among many other demonstrations of confidence, affection and trust, they had made him <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and given him the title of Governor, which titles he wold not desert, but wold have them to his death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a little after; such are the humors, such the ambition of the <hi>French,</hi> which made <hi>Henry Fits Allen</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who first introduc'd the use of Coaches into <hi>England,</hi> disswade Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from matching with the said Duke of <hi>Alençon,</hi> because he had had sufficient experience of the inconstancy, arrogance and levity of the <hi>French,</hi> and that few of them had upright and just hearts.</p>
            <p>Nor do the Kings of <hi>France</hi> pay the debts, or hold themselves bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the promises of their immediat predecessors, for they say that they come to the Crown not as much by <hi>Hereditary</hi> as <hi>Kingly</hi> right; as appeers by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. gave the <hi>Parisians,</hi> who humbly petitioning for som Armes and Canons which they had lent <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. he told them that he was not <hi>Charles his Heir, much lesse his Administrator:</hi> So the <hi>Swisses</hi> demanding of <hi>Francis</hi> the second, a return of those large sommes which they had lent his father, receiv'd this short injust answer, that he <hi>was not tied to the solution of any mans debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do the <hi>French</hi> wher they com bestow the Indian disease, and infect the bloud of their Neighbours; but in one part of <hi>France</hi> they have another disease as bad and more ugly, which is the leprosie, for in the South parts towards the <hi>Pyrency</hi> Hills in the Countrey of <hi>Bearn</hi> and other places, ther is a despicable kind of peeple call'd the <hi>Capots;</hi> and in another dialect <hi>Gahets,</hi> most of them being Carpenters, Coupers, Tinkers, or of such mean mechanique trades, whose society all men do shun and abominat, because they use to infect others with their leprosie, therfore they are not permitted to enter into any Towns, and hardly to live in the Suburbs, they have distinct stations apart in Churches; when any dye they can leave no lands but only their moveables to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, scarce having the same priviledges in their own Countrey, that <hi>Iewes</hi> have in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to resume the threed of my discourse a little before, if the Kings of <hi>France</hi> be not tied to pay the debts and legacies of their parents and predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, what law of honesty do we think can bind the vassals of <hi>France</hi> to do so? <hi>Caesar and Tacitus</hi> had felt the pulse of this Nation sufficiently, when they call them <hi>Levissimum hominum genus,</hi> a most light race of peeple, that they have more of <hi>imagination</hi> then <hi>judgment,</hi> more words then common honesty. Yet <hi>Francis</hi> the first could vapour, as <hi>Lipsius</hi> hath it of him, <hi>Etiamsi fides toto Orbe exularet</hi>—although Faith shold be banish'd from among mortals, yet she shold be found among Kings, who shold be tied to performance by her alone, and not by fear. You pleas'd to say, Noble Cosen <hi>Ernest,</hi> that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> never die; shall they be eternal, and their faith so mortal? I am not ignorant that <hi>Bodin</hi> goes very far in the commendation of the <hi>French,</hi> being transported with passion more then judgment, and therin he shewes himself to be of a tru <hi>French</hi> humor; And he thinks to do her right by wronging her

            <p>The third <hi>Furie</hi> which possesseth <hi>France</hi> is her <hi>temerity</hi> and unadvisednesse most commonly seen in her Actions, which as <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was not only a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellor, but a Conquerour, and dweller there, saith, <hi>Gallorum Genti temeritas est innata,</hi> Rashnes is innated in the <hi>French</hi> Nation: And as we read of moving Ilands, so the <hi>French</hi> is not only stirr'd, but toss'd perpetually with the waves of Temerity and lightnes; especially when the Circian or Southern wind blowes; <hi>Augustus</hi> made his vow unto the Gods that it should not blow upon them; For the <hi>French</hi> have a whirlwind in their brains, they have quicksands in their breasts, which tosseth their Councels, and cogitations to and fro.</p>
            <p>The Physitians dispute whether the Worms that are engendred in man out of putrefaction proceed from the stomack or the belly; but I am of opinion that in <hi>French</hi> bodies those Magotts are generated in the brain, rather then any place of the microcosm besides.

In fine, 'tis he who can hold excellent discourse, yet he is the by-word of the peeple, the pity of honest men, and the reproach of his family: Doth he march in the streets, he scarce makes two steps, but he looks back to behold his Laquay strutting behind him, he hath his hands often upon his locks, and his eyes upon his shooes; O poor sot, fit to be pray'd for in all Churches that he recover his wits.</p>

Nay of late yeers in the siege hefore <hi>Amiens</hi> it was so bitterly cold, that the wines did freeze in the cask, and was sold in cakes and by weight unto the Soldiers.</p>
            <p>And for the wholsomnesse of that clime, sure it cannot be so far, it is found by experience, that the <hi>French</hi> both men and women are more subject to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, to the itch and scabs then any other peeple.</p>
            <p>But the greatest thing they glory of, is, that <hi>France</hi> is so fertile and exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a soyle that it may be call'd a <hi>Copia Cornu</hi> of all things (I confesse indeed ther are in <hi>France</hi> of <hi>horns</hi>) and that ther is not any part that is altogether barren; but in point of fertility. This cannot be so generally tru; for in <hi>Burgundy</hi> not far off, ther is a Town call'd <hi>Orgelet,</hi> wherof ther is a proverb, that ther are there fields without grasse, rivers without fish, and hills without groves: betwixt <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Bayon</hi> you traverse such a tract of sandy ground, that one wold think he passeth through the deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> when he goeth over <hi>les landes de Gascoigne,</hi> for so they are call'd vulgarly; ther are divers large tracts of gronnd which are as bad, In so much that <hi>Bodin</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confesseth, <hi>Exploratum est deserta et inculta loca si aquas et vias iis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungamus duos Galliae trientes auferre;</hi> It is is found and explor'd, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and untill'd places, if we add to them waters and wayes, make up two thirds of <hi>France;</hi> Then he confesseth that ther is such a scarcity of great timber trees, that not only for building of Ships, but for erecting of ordinary houses they must be beholden to other Nations.</p>
            <p>Is this that incomparable fertility of <hi>France</hi> you speak of, Cosen? is this that land of promise? what a bragging do the <hi>Bourdelois</hi> keep of their grove of Cypres for the honor of which it was a custome that no ship shold go out of the Port with wine till the Magistrat had given him a branch of Cypres tree, for which he was to pay such a gabel; yet this Grove wherof they vaunt is scarce seven acres in all.</p>

            <p>Our Ancestors made Salt with much profit, not of Sea water crusted by the heat of the Sun and so obdurated, such as is brought us from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but out of maritime glebes burnt, and reduc'd to Cindres, which powring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into a small portion of water by drops, they brought to be splendid and pure Salt, nor did all <hi>Belgium</hi> use any other Salt until our memory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which mode of making when it grew out of use, a new extern way being introduc'd, ther was another no lesse gainful way invented; Which was that a rude and blackish sordid kind of salt being brought over from <hi>Spain,</hi> or Aquitane Coasts, the dreggs and filth being excocted, we brought it by our art and industry to be candid and beautiful, and most fit to conserve things; but the t'other way may be revived again very easily, if forren salt shold be denied us in case of enmity or otherwise.</p>
            <p>Now although 'tis confess'd, that <hi>France</hi> abounds with <hi>Salt,</hi> and in that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95159:41"/>
point may be sayed to be a <hi>sweet</hi> Countrey, yet the Inhabitants pay dear for it, for the King makes neer upon 20. millions of Franks ev'ry yeer of the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel of salt (as it was spoken before) which are two millions sterling; In so much that although <hi>France</hi> have such plenty of Salt, yet it is cheaper in any other Countrey. For it is found that the Marchant hath it at lower rates on the Sea side then the Peasan in the Countrey, which makes the <hi>Hollander</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring thither <hi>French</hi> Salt back again and gain by it. One shall see som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the poor Roturier or yeoman to go from the market with his pockets cram'd with salt to avoid paying the gabel, and women steal it home in their purses.</p>
            <p>Now touching such an affluence of all things in <hi>France,</hi> besides which you insist upon, my Noble Cosen, it may be so, but then surely ther is the worst kind of government there upon earth, and the most unproportionablest divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made of that plenty, for I dare avouch <hi>France</hi> doth abound with beggars more then any Countrey under the Sun. One cannot ride upon the high way but he shall have swarmes of little mendicants sing before his horse head, as also when he remounts the next day; The poor Vigneron, and Husbandman go in their wooden shooes and canvas breeches to Church upon Sundayes, and if their wifes have a buckram petticot she is brave. Therfore wheras you say that <hi>France</hi> is the freest and <hi>frankest</hi> Countrey in the World, and that she draws her etymology thence, she may be so to strangers and passengers, but for the Natives I beleeve they are the arrand'st slaves upon earth, they are of a meer <hi>asinin</hi> condition, not only in relation to the King who so grinds their faces with taxes, but they are villains also to their Lords: I will produce one example for all; The Lord of <hi>Chasteauroux</hi> or red Castle in <hi>Berry</hi> had a Tenant, that by his industry became Bourgesse of <hi>Paris, Le seigneur vendica son serf, qui s'estoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> retiré et obtint la provision,</hi> the Lord in open Court demands his slave, which the Court could not deny, and so pass'd sentence accordingly.</p>
            <p>You say, noble Cosen, that <hi>France</hi> is adorn'd with all vertues, truly I do not see how vertue can cohabit where such furies do tyrannize; I am sure that <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks of som parts of <hi>France, quae ab omni humanita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Touching the magnanimity and prwoesse of the <hi>French,</hi> 'tis tru they did achieve som brave things while the <hi>German</hi> bloud continued fresh in them, and untainted; <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, that <hi>Caius Marius</hi> by his divine vertu and valour, <hi>influentes in Italiam Gallorum Copias repressit,</hi> that he repress'd those swarmes of <hi>French</hi> who rush'd into <hi>Italie,</hi> but <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was a better Historian then <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, they were <hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Teutones</hi> both which are High Dutch, as also those which <hi>Brennus</hi> brought to sack <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards took <hi>Delphos</hi> from the Greeks.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>French</hi> courage we know the trite proverb, that the <hi>French</hi> are at the first onset more then men, and afterwards les then women; Indeed <hi>Florus</hi> sayeth, <hi>Habent eorum corpora quiddam simile cum suis nivibus, quae mox vt caluêrs pugnâ statim in sudorem eunt, et levi motu quasi sole laxantur;</hi> The <hi>French</hi> bodies bear some analogy with their snowes, for as soon as they are heated in fight they vapour into sweat, and they are as it were thaw'd by the Sun at the least motion.</p>
            <p>But your Highnesse seems to extol mightily the power of the <hi>French</hi> King, indeed 'tis an old saying, that Gallum <hi>in suo sterquilinio plurimum posse,</hi> The cock (<hi>Gallus</hi>) can do much upon his own dunghill. But this power is not so superlatif if we descend into the truth of things, for touching the demeanes of the Crown, the King cannot alienat one acre therof without the consent of the <hi>three Estates,</hi> as ther is a pregnant example herof in the Assembly of <hi>Blois,</hi> where <hi>Bodin</hi> lost the favour of <hi>Henry</hi> the third about this debate: For the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95159:41"/>
               <hi>French</hi> King is by the law but an <hi>Usufructuary of the Crown possession;</hi> nor could any of them be sold for the redemption of King <hi>Iohn</hi> in England though it was then propos'd, nor of King <hi>Francis</hi> in Spain, though this was the greatest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that could be. We well know how often the Parlement of <hi>Paris</hi> hath clash'd with the King, and rejected his Edicts; Nor is the single testimony of the King valid enough in <hi>France</hi> to take away any ones life, ther was a notable example herof in <hi>Henry</hi> the seconds raign, who when he had commanded an <hi>Italian</hi> servant to be clap'd in prison, and had solemnly sworn that he had found him in a most foul offence, yet the Kings affidavit could not prevail with the Judges, but they releas'd the prisoner. But now the integrity and stoutnesse of those brave ancient Legislators and Judges in times past is much diminish'd, because Kings do use to lend their eares to Parasits, Sycophants, and Buffons rather then to <hi>Helvidius Priscus, Monsieur Lavacre,</hi> or such Sages. Ther is a tale of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the first, that he had an Ethiop born in <hi>India</hi> about him, and having upon a march one day his tent pitch'd nere a high tree, he call'd the <hi>Ethiop</hi> and sayed, <hi>Dre Areb,</hi> if thou lov'st me go up to the top of that tree, the <hi>Indian</hi> scambled up presently, so the Emperour sent presently for som to hew down the tree, the poor Ethiop begging his life all the while, and that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors wold intercede for him, but nothing prevailing, the Ethiop pull'd down his breeches, and with his Excrements and Urine did so beray the hewers, that they gave over work, and in the interim the Ethiop gets down, telling the <hi>Turks</hi> Counsellors, <hi>Wold all such Privy Counsellors as you were so beray'd, whose oouncel cannot do as much as my Excrements.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Kings use to have many such weak Councellors.</p>
            <p>Touching the unlimited power the <hi>French</hi> Kings have to make pecuniary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies and lay taxes, I pray hear what <hi>Philip Comines</hi> sayeth, one of <hi>Lewis</hi> the xi. chiefest Councellors of State, and whom he employ'd in the most intricat and arduous ocasions, <hi>Nemo omnium est Principum qui jus habeat vel teruncium vnum exigendi a suis praeter constitutum annuum censum nisi populus assentiatur, sunt quidem principes quibus hoc frequens est in Sermone vt dicant habere se privilegia vt quantum velint exigant a populo, Galliarum vero Rex omnium minimè causam habet vt istud de se jactet, nec enim vel ipsi vel cui vis alii licet.</hi> Ther is no Prince that hath right to raise the least farthing of his subjects besides his settled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, without the peeples consent; 'Tis tru, ther are som Kings who have it frequently in their mouthes, that they have such praerogatives to impose what they please, but the King of <hi>France</hi> hath the least cause to vaunt thus of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>The Exorbitancies of the <hi>French</hi> Kings this way hath bin the ground of all the warrs that were wag'd <hi>pour le Bien public,</hi> for the common good which have harass'd <hi>France</hi> so often; <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Grosse</hi> herby came to such an extreme exigence that being overcom by <hi>Arnosplus</hi> he begg'd his bread of him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him from starving, and so obtain'd of him a small pension in <hi>Germany.</hi> Neverthelesse, though a clowd of examples of this kind could be produc'd, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> do still use to <hi>flay</hi> their sheep, insteed of <hi>shearing</hi> them; witnesse the last King who assum'd to himself the Epithet of <hi>Iust,</hi> and God knowes he least deserv'd it of any, having exacted more of his people by extrajudicial wayes then any of his predecessors ever did, to maintain a groundlesse warr against the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by the advice of an ambitious and bloudy Cardinal, whose <hi>heart</hi> was as red as his <hi>habit,</hi> and of a deeper sanguine die.

               <hi>Spain</hi> hath bin reputed from the beginning a most considerable Countrey, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Roman by whom she was <hi>prima tentata,</hi> and <hi>ultima subacta;</hi> first attempted, and last subdued: For the old Romans, as now the Ecclesiastique Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> sought most after those places where the plenty and pleasure of the soyl might strive with their desire to make them happy, as it is now the humor of our new <hi>Iasons</hi> (the <hi>Iesuits</hi>) to plant themselfs there wher ther are fat and golden returns. But ther be other extraordinary conveniences in <hi>Spain,</hi> the subtile and cleer temper of the air, the salubrity of the soyle, and the constancy of one sort of weather a long time, in so much that <hi>Homer</hi> and other Authors have plac'd there the Elisian Fields.</p>
            <p>Ther are no grosse caliginous vapours rising up there out of any Fenns, gorsy grounds or loughs. Ther are most delicat breezes that blow from the Sea, and penetrating the circumambient Air, use to refresh both man, and all sorts of brute animalls, attenuating and chasing away all dull terrestriall meteors; Nay, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators when they sayle along the Sea, do come to know when they are nere the coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the fragrant odor which Rosemary and other aromatique Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getalls, that grow there up and down the fields do usually transmit and cast into the Air; <hi>Spain</hi> is neither parch'd with so violent a Sun as <hi>Afrique</hi> is, nor disquietted with such impetuous winds as <hi>France,</hi> or shaken with such Earthquakes as <hi>Italy,</hi> or benum'd with excessive cold as other Regions are, but she partakes of all these in a middle kind of temperature. <hi>Spain</hi> doth not only furnish Europe, but the <hi>Indian</hi> also with most generous Wines, most perfect Oil, most pure Salt, excellent gaules, the best fruits, as Almonds, Figgs, Raisins, Orenges, Lemons, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grannets; and all other kind of Vegitals, as Roots, Herbs and flowers, which are there in a greater perfection then in other Countreys.</p>
            <p>The bowells of <hi>Spain</hi> abound also with excellent mettalls, what Iron, what Steel goes beyond that of <hi>Biscay?</hi> What Quicksilver comparable to that of <hi>Medina?</hi> What gold purer then that which is found in <hi>Tagus?</hi> What Silke better then that of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Valentia?</hi> What Flax so good as that of <hi>Murcia?</hi> What wool primer then that of <hi>Segovia?</hi> witnes the testimony of <hi>Martial,</hi>

'Tis incredible to think how many hundred weight the very keyes of the Monastery weigh. For delicate Orchyards, curious Aqueducts and Fountains, for Grotts and Groves, for Galleries and Ambulatories, for neatnes and amaenity of all things, you wold be so transported, that you wold think your self to be in som earthly Paradis.

Nere <hi>Corunna</hi> ther be quarrys whence Jaspers are hewn out; But I will passe now to Minneralls, <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural History affirms that <hi>Spain</hi> had great plenty of Lead, Iron, Brasse, Silver, Gold, Marble, and of <hi>speculares lapides,</hi> a certain kind of specular stones which being cut thin will be as cleer as Crystall, wherwith in former times windows were usd to be glazed; In so much that <hi>Possidonius</hi> saith, <hi>Pluto</hi> the God of riches dwelt in som of the subteranean parts of <hi>Spain.</hi> Moreover <hi>George Agricola</hi> avers, that among those Regions where mettals were digged, <hi>Spain</hi> was the first, <hi>Thrace</hi> the second, Great <hi>Brittain</hi> the third, <hi>France</hi> the fourth, <hi>Greece</hi> the fifth.

            <q>Auro Bilbilis, &amp; superba ferro.</q>
            <p>'Tis wonderful what is read in the <hi>Roman</hi> story, that about <hi>Carthagena</hi> ther were 40. thousand Men that digged in the Mines of Silver, which affoorded 25000. Drachmas every day, amounting according to <hi>Budaeus</hi> his calcule to 2500. Crowns; This no meaner man then <hi>Strabo</hi> affirmes: He goes further and saith, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had begun a mine which affoorded 3000. Crownes every day. It is well known what <hi>Diodorus</hi> writes of the <hi>Pyreny</hi> mountains, that they were once very thick of Gold and Silver mines, that the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> the first traders by Sea of any people upon earth came often thither for tresure; If we will give credit to <hi>Livie</hi> (and what Historian I pray is more Magisteriall?) He will tell us, that the spoils which the <hi>Romans</hi> in a few yeers brought from <hi>Spain</hi> came to 600. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand weight of Silver, and 10000. of Gold; so that <hi>Spain</hi> was then to <hi>Rome,</hi> what <hi>America</hi> is now to <hi>Spain.</hi> Nay, som are of opinion that <hi>Tortosa</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> was that <hi>Tharsis</hi> whether <hi>Salomon</hi> sent his fleet for treasure, and they ground the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this opinion upon the frequent Navigation of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Phenicians</hi> then into <hi>Spain.</hi>

Besides these various Seas that like so many Laundresses wash the skirts of <hi>Spain,</hi> there are 150. Rivers that water the Continent up and down, and upon those Rivers ther are about 600.

It was the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navigation, who first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed that grosse opinion and hereticall tenet (for there was a Bishop imprisoned in <hi>Rome</hi> for holding the contrary) that ther were no <hi>Antipodes;</hi> Therfore the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> and indeed of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Afrique</hi> also shold vayle unto the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and respect him more then any Nation for this blessing of discovery, which it seems the God of Nature had reserved for him from the beginning; and a mighty blessing it was, and we must needs acknowledg it so, if we descend into the tru speculation of the thing, for therby ther was as much of the terrestriall globe discovered, as for extent and amplitude did equall the old world. But what a world of dangers and difficulties did they overcom? on the one side the incertitude of the thing, and the perills of the vast confused Ocean did offer themselfs, on the other the expences of the voyage, and the despair of more provision when the old store was spent, and in case they shold discover and take footing on a new Earth, the Savages might prove stranger then they. 'Tis tru, that such thoughts as these did possesse and puzzle them a while, but at last their courage and magnanimity was such, that it broak through all these difficulties: and as a wild Boar being taken within the toyles doth try all wayes, turn about and struggle how to get out, at last when all will not serve, he lyes down betwixt quietness and despair, putting himself upon the mercy of the Huntsman, so that <hi>American</hi> fortune being tyed to that fear which possess'd it, at last doth prostrat her self at the feet of the <hi>Spanish</hi> vertu, tying her self therunto by a perpetuall tribut; she brings her afterwards golden mines, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, yea Rivers running with gold, Seas full of Perl, som parts of the earth labouring with gems with all kind of arromatick Spices, sweet woods, with new Species of birds, beasts, plants and fishes; All these things did <hi>India</hi> afford the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for a gratefull return of his indefatigable and hazardous pains in coming to visit her: The mines of <hi>Potosi</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> yeeld 30000.

            <p>Most Illustrious Auditors, you have hitherto heard the magnitude of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, but that which tends most to the glory of <hi>Spain,</hi> is her policy and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in governing so many distinct Regions, so many squandred Kingdoms, so many millions of people of differing humours, customes and constitutions. To be able to Rule so many Nations is more then to raign over them; the one is imputed to the outward strength of bodies, the other to the Sagacity of the brain; but for <hi>Spain</hi> her self ther is that sweet harmony twixt the Prince and peeple, the one in <hi>obeying,</hi> the other in <hi>bearing rule,</hi> that it is admirable, and here the <hi>Spanish</hi> King hath the advantage of all other <hi>Imperando &amp; parendo.</hi> He is neither King of <hi>Asses</hi> as the French is, nor the King of <hi>Devills</hi> as the English is, nor the King of <hi>Kings</hi> as the Emperour glories to be, but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is <hi>Rex Hominum,</hi> the King of Men: he may also be termed the King of Princes, according to the Character which <hi>Claudian</hi> gives <hi>Spain,</hi> that she was <hi>Principibus faecunda piis</hi>—</p>

            <p>Therfore let <hi>Candy</hi> the Cradle of <hi>Iove,</hi> let <hi>Thebes</hi> the Mother of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Delos</hi> the nurse of two Gods yeeld to <hi>Spain.</hi> It was she who brought forth <hi>Trajan</hi> to the world, who was as <hi>good</hi> as <hi>Augustus</hi> was <hi>happie;</hi> she gave <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, she gave <hi>Theodosius</hi> the first, and the <hi>first</hi> of Emperours for Morality and Vertue, who rays'd and rear'd up again the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy when she was tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the first, who was an Infant of <hi>Spain,</hi> a Prince who for liberty and justice, for mansuetude and munificence, for assiduity and vigilance, for piety and peace was inferiour to none of his progenitors, and to this day they keep in <hi>Spain</hi> the Cradle, and Rattles he us'd when he was a child in <hi>Complutum</hi> where he was born, which Town enjoyes to this day some speciall immunities for his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity there.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Spain</hi> gave all these Princes to other Nations; how many hath she affoorded her self? she gave <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> a Prince of incomparable piety and prowesse who first lay'd the foundation of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, by matching with <hi>Donam Isabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> a heavenly Princesse, she gave <hi>Philip</hi> the second, call'd the <hi>prudent,</hi> and so he was, to a proverb; how cautious was he in administration of Justice? how circumspect in distribution of Offices? how judicious in rewarding of Men? &amp;c. how wary in conferring of honors? for he was us'd to say, <hi>that honors conferred upon an unworthy man, was like sound Meat cast into a corrupt Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack;</hi> What a great example of Parsimony was he? yet Magnificent to a miracle, witnes the eighth wonder of the world, the <hi>Escuriall,</hi> which stupendous fabrick he not only saw all finished before his death, though the building continued many yeers, but he enjoy'd it himself twelve yeers, and carried his own bones to be buried in the <hi>Pantheon</hi> he had built there. He was so choyce in the election of his Servants, that he had no Barber for his <hi>Ambassador,</hi> nor <hi>Taylor</hi> for his Herald, nor <hi>Physition</hi> for his Chancellor, as we read of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. of <hi>France,</hi> nor a <hi>Faukner</hi> to his chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorit as the last French King had.

When he found his glasse almost run out, he sent for his Son and Daughter, and upon his death-bed told them, <hi>In this small afflicted body you see to how small a threed the pomp and splendor of all Earthly Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude doth hang, my Mortall life is upon departing, the care of my Sepulchre, and rites of exequies, I commend unto you with my blessing.</hi> Among many other ther is one remarkable passage in this Kings life; when the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was upon point of going to <hi>Portugall,</hi> he had a great desire to kisse the Kings hand, but to the amazement of all the world, he was denyed at that time, which made the Duke to say, <hi>that his Master had sent him to conquer Kingdoms, being tyed with chains and fetters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Son <hi>Philip</hi> the second, did equall him in Piety, and in nothing els, we know what a Saint-like man he was, having his Beads alwayes either about his neck, or in his hands.</p>
            <p>I will hold you no longer, only I will tell you that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> more then any other have don miraculous and immortall things; For as God almighty when he builds, creates no lesse then a world, When he is angry, sends no lesse then an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall deluge; When he conferrs grace to mankind, sends no lesse then his own Son; When he rewards, gives no lesse then Paradise; when he warrs, employs no lesse then Legions of Angells and makes the Elements to fight, the Sea to open, and the Sun to stand; so if finite things may beare any proportion with infinity, the Kings of Spain are borne to do no petty things, but mighty matters; When they build; they erect no lesse then an <hi>Escuriall;</hi> If they are angry, they drive forth whole Nations, as the <hi>Moores</hi> and the <hi>Iews;</hi> If they reflect upon the publique good, they sacrifice no lesse then their own Sons; If they desire to oblige any, they restore Kings as <hi>Muleasses</hi> to <hi>Tunis,</hi> and make <hi>Popes</hi> of their Schoolmasters; when they take armes, then they conquer not only whole Kingdoms, but new Worlds.</p>
            <p>Therfore my dearest Brother, <hi>Frederique Achilles,</hi> and you most Illustrious Cosens and Auditors, I think I shall derogat from no other Region, if taking King and Countrey together, I preferr the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for glory and amplitude of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for fulgor of Majesty, for the longest arm'd Monark, for Men and Mines, for Iles and Continents, I say I do no wrong to any, if I prefer him before any other Prince or Potentat upon the earthly Globe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have hitherto delivered sundry opinions, wheron ther have been many learned and Rhetoricall descants; I observe allso ther are som divorcements and discrepancies in the said opinions; But for my particular suffrage, I will preferr <hi>France</hi> before any Province of the <hi>Europaean</hi> world; and if I shold attempt to speak more then hath bin presented by that high-born Prince Duke <hi>Ioachim Ernest</hi> upon this subject, it wold be an argument of rashnes in me, and so I shold incurr no small hazard of my reputation: Me thinks I see <hi>Ciceno</hi> before me, and saying, <hi>Illam O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem solùm populus Gallicus parem Imperio suo habet, France</hi> hath that Oration alone, equall to her Empire. But though ther was much spoken of <hi>Spain</hi> by that noble <hi>Prince, Duke Magnus of Wirtemberg,</hi> yet I will endeavour to shew that <hi>Spain</hi> doth not deserve either the <hi>Elogium</hi> or love of so great a Prince in so high a degree; For as shadows use to make bodies bigger then they are really in bulk, so it seemes his affection hath made <hi>Spain</hi> more then she is in intrinsique value. For truly unlesse I be stark blind, I find <hi>Spain</hi> to be the most unhusbanded, and the sterillest Country of <hi>Europe,</hi> the thinnest of peeple, the fullest of fruitlesse Hills, which they call <hi>Sierras,</hi> and are indeed no better then Wildernesses: In so much that though she be so scant of Inhabitants, yet hath she not Bread enough to put into the mouths of the sixt part of them: So that unlesse she be very ingratefull and impudent, she must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to be her Nources, and <hi>Sicily</hi> her Barn, as she was somtimes to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And among these ther was a computation made once of foure millions of tresure that <hi>France</hi> receav'd that yeer from <hi>Spain</hi> for Corn in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolls and Patacoons, which made <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth say that the great store of tresure which <hi>Spain</hi> hath, <hi>discovers her necessity as well as her plenty, because she cannot keep her money at home, which she might well do, if she had</hi> Corn <hi>as well as</hi> Wine. <hi>For our Wheat is scarce grown ripe, but the Spaniard is gaping for it at our Ports, or some other Nation for them.</hi>

rough Craggs which could not be eaten with Verjuyce, a feverish Air, troubled Waters, indigent peeple, nasty and ill cloath'd. But ther is no man can judge of <hi>Spain</hi> but he who hath travell'd the Countrey, where his Mule and he must lodg to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in som places, and haply the Mule may fare better then the Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ther is not any that can dissemble Saturity as much as the Spaniard, who useth to stroake his beard and breast from crumms, and pick his teeth with that state, as if he had bin at a feast in <hi>Germany.</hi> Therfore it was charitably spoken by one, <hi>Beati qui sterilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non viderunt, sed crediderunt,</hi> They are happy who have not seen the sterility of <hi>Spain,</hi> but beleeve it. For whosoever doth purpose to see <hi>Spain,</hi> must resolve before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to undergo hardshipps of all sorts, to have oftentimes the lower Region of the Air for his Canopie, Hunger for his food, and Thirst for his drink; he must resolve to fast perpetually, and if he lights by chance upon som edible things, as root, fruit, an ounce of flesh, or the like, tis a question whether he eats or fasts; yet one shalbe sure to stay there as much for such little modicums, as one shold do in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maay</hi> at a Crown Ordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederique</hi> the II. Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine</hi> going to <hi>Spain</hi> to visit the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. came to a Town call'd <hi>Cervera</hi> upon <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Eve, and thinking to rest there the next day being a Holy-day for the refreshment of himselfe, his Train and Horses, the <hi>Corregidor</hi> or chief Magistrat of the Town sent to him, desiring him to depart the place, for fear of enhancing the rates of things. The next day going to <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> a Town of the second Classis in <hi>Spain,</hi> and sending his Caterer to market to buy som Butter, where being asked how much he wold have? answered twenty or thirty pound: the Shop-keeper cross'd himself, and said, You cannot find such a proportion in all this Town, you must go to <hi>Estremadura,</hi> where ther is good store of Oxen and Cowes. At last he brought him a Kids blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der full of Butter, as if he went to grease the wheele of a Cart.</p>
            <p>But this scarcity brings one comodity with it, that <hi>Spain</hi> is not so subject to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run by any forren force, for an Army wold quickly starve there for want of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which inconvenience diverted <hi>Murat</hi> the great Turk once from invading <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet of late yeers ther is a better accommonation for passengers in som of the chief Towns, but they are strangers that do it. Most of their Opificers are also Forre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, specially <hi>French,</hi> insomuch that in <hi>Valentia</hi> alone ther were reckond at one time above ten thousand Artists. For indeed the Spaniard himself is of a flothfull, and stately nature; he puts his Sword by his side, his great Ruff about his neck, and only goes with his Asse to the market to buy him bread, with other necessities, which strangers use to provide for him.</p>
            <p>Now, since the expulsion of the <hi>Moriscos,</hi> which were a laborious peeple, and wold grubb up Corn from among those craggy hills, <hi>Spain</hi> is poorer then she was, and wold be more poor, were it not for those swarmes of <hi>Gascons</hi> that crosse the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneys thither for love of their money.</p>
            <p>And as the Countrey of <hi>Spain</hi> is so <hi>indigent,</hi> so the Inhabitants are poor in point of Vertu, but rich for sundry sorts of Vices. They use to make use of Religion for a mantle to palliat their designs; They rap out somtimes horrid blasphemies, and ther is an Author (but he is a Frenchman) who relates that a King of <hi>Spain</hi> having had divers ill successes, fell into that impatience, that he swore he wold be reveng'd, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comanded that none of his Subjects shold adore God, or beleeve in him, or speak of him for so long a time. What shall I say of the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> which are calld the <hi>new</hi> Christians, whereas they are for the most part <hi>Iewes</hi> in their hearts. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that in the battaile where Don <hi>Sebastian</hi> was killd in <hi>Barbary,</hi> ther were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1500. Renegado Christians of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> that were in the Army of <hi>Moley Molue</hi> King of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis tru, that they have planted Christianity in both the Indies, raysd up the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Crosse, and taught Sauvages the way to heaven; But those Pagans may say as <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> said when he was going to the holy Sepulcher, who being met by one of his own Subjects, as he was mounted upon <hi>a great Sarracens backe,</hi> &amp; being much tyrd, he said, <hi>Commend me to all in Normandy, &amp; tell them I am</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95159:50"/>
               <hi>going to Heaven upon the Devills back.</hi> So the converted Infidels may be said to goe to Heaven upon the Spanish <hi>Iesuitts</hi> backs.</p>
            <p>But now that I have touch'd upon the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who are a tru Spanish ospring, and the most intimat Confidents of the Catholic King, I will enlarge my self a little on this subject, for by laying open these men, you will better discover the humor of the Spaniard. It was the saying of a Burgundian Nobleman, That <hi>a Spaniard without his Iesuit, is like a Partridg without an Orenge. Un Espagnol sans son Iesuite, est come un Perdrix sans Orenge.</hi> These Jesuitts have turnd all the world topsitervy; they have bin the Inceadiaries of all the differences, the fire-brands of all the Warrs, the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of all the Rebellions that have bin in Christendom ever since they had a <hi>Bull</hi> to establish their Society by Pope <hi>Teatin</hi> from whom they bear the name. And indeed it must be confessd, that they have bin very thankfull to the Pope for it, for they have bin the greatest supporters of his Chair ever since: in regard that all their consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tend principally to depresse the power of Kings, and enhance the prerogative of the Pope, whom they hold to be the universall Lord Paramount of the Universe among men, and the highest Vice-roy of God Allmighty in this elementary world. They take him for a <hi>speaking Scripture,</hi> and that Heresie is nothing else but <hi>a Tenet in the points of Faith, contrary to the decision of the Pope.</hi> They hold he can absolve any from his Allegeance and fidelity to his naturall lawfull Prince, excommunicat any earthly Monark, and not only so, but tumble him out of his throne, yea into hell both Soul and Body by the thunderbolts of Excommunication.

            <p>Moreover 'tis their tenet that the holy Father cannot only depose any earthly potentat, but dispose of his dominions to any other. And if a new Countrey be discover'd, the party cannot possesse it, till he receive it as a gift from him, wherin the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did so far comply with him, that as soon as he had discover'd and conquer'd <hi>America,</hi> the first thing he thought upon, was to make his humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to his Holines for investiture.</p>
            <p>But the sages of the Parlement of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the most acute learned Doctors of the <hi>Colledg</hi> of <hi>Sorbon</hi> detested such Doctrines, therfore by a solemn arrest of that high Court abetted by those great Divines, caus'd the Institutions of <hi>Mariana</hi> the Arch-Jesuit, who broach'd such tenets and expos'd them to the world, to be made a Sacrifice to <hi>Vulcan</hi> by the hand of the common Executioner, with another intitled <hi>de temporali potestate Papae adversus Gulielmum Barclaium,</hi> and that under pain of committing High-Treason, none should keep, communicat, print or vend any of those damnable bookes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> the prudentst and politiquest Republic that ever was, as we may infer by the constancy of her goverment, and longaevity, did shew <hi>France</hi> the way of using the Jesuits in this manner, but that grave Senat went a rounder way to worke, for they did not only burn their <hi>pages,</hi> but banish their <hi>persons</hi> eternally from the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> and all her Territories. And although <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. did earnestly mediat for their readmission, yet all wold not do, for ther was a double inconvenience in it, first, a hazard of disreputation, and opinion of rashnes upon the <hi>Senat</hi> for revoking so solemn a <hi>Decree,</hi> which was debated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with such mature deliberation contrary to their custom; And secondly, ther wold be a continuall encrease of danger to the Republique, for admitting such strangers into her bosome, For they were not ignorant that whersoever they live, or what Countrey soever they are in, They are the Subjects of another Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> the Popes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95159:50"/>Furthermore the <hi>Iesuits</hi> have another dangerous doctrine prejudiciall to all soveraign Princes, <hi>de confessione non detegenda, ne in causa quidem Majestatis, &amp; presenti Regis ac regni periculo,</hi> That the confession of a penitentiary must not be reveal'd, no though it reflect upon Majesty, and to the danger both of King and Kingdom; this is an Appendix of the <hi>Hildebrandine Iesuiticall Doctrine.</hi> The English Cronicle makes mention that Father <hi>Garnet</hi> the Jesuit being interrogated by the Earl of <hi>Notingham</hi> if any one wold confesse unto him in the morning, that he had a purpose to murther the King the next evening, whether he was bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to reveale it? <hi>Garnet</hi> answer'd no. Which opinion <hi>Binetus</hi> the Jesuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to <hi>Causabon</hi> in these words, <hi>praestare Reges omnes perire quam si vel semel Confessionis Sigillum violaretur, Regem enim ait humani juris Imperium esse, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessionem Iuris divini;</hi> It were better that Kings should perish then that the seal of confession should be broken, for the power of Kings is by <hi>humane</hi> right, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> by <hi>Divine.</hi> Moreover another Jesuit in <hi>France</hi> did dare openly to affirm, <hi>si Dominus noster Iesus Christus in terris versaretur morti obnoxius, &amp; aliquis sibi in confessione dixisset velle se illum occidere prius quam confessionem revelaret, passu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum se ut Christus occidatur,</hi> If our Lord Jesus Christ were himself again upon Earth subject to death, and one under the seal of confession should tell him that he had a purpose to kill him, before he would reveale the confession he wold suffer that Christ shold be slain. <hi>Henricus Henriques</hi> also another furious Jesuit averrs that the Holy seal of Confession must not be broken for any cause whatsoever; and the said <hi>Spanish</hi> Jesuit saith thus, <hi>Quamvis se ageretur totius Orbis salus; aut ipsius paenitentis utilitas, nec pro vitando ullo damno gravissimo Innocentis, aut quod esset totius orbis conflagratio, aut perversio Religionis; &amp; omnium sacramentorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentata demolitio.</hi> Although it tended to the salvation of the whole world, or the utility of the penitentiary, or that som Innocent might escape som grievous dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or that the conflagration of the whole world depended upon it, or the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Religion, and the utter overthrow of all the Sacraments, All these wold not be causes sufficient to impell the Ghostly Father to break the seal of Confession. All this <hi>Isaac Cansabon</hi> doth averr to be tru in his works to <hi>Fronton Pucaeus,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Perronius.</hi> For such a high and most venerable opinion they have of <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular</hi> Confession, that what the penitentiary poures in the Priests breast, is put up in the Closet of God Almighty, and so it must be kept with sacred silence. This may be one of the reasons that more penitentiaries make their addresses to the Jesuits then to any other Order, and it may be a reason also why other Monasticalls do so much <hi>Envie</hi> them, som <hi>Malign</hi> them, others <hi>detest</hi> them. Those which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were mentioned, are the tenets of the Jesuits, touching privat Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, if <hi>Causabon</hi> may be believed, who ('tis tru) was a profess'd enemy of theirs, yet the positions are maintained but by the rigidst sort of <hi>Teatins</hi> not generally as som affirm; By these meanes of Confession, they open the Cabinets of Princes, and know more of State-matters then any: For ther are none who have sooner and surer intelligence then they from all parts, and their correspondencie is admirable for the punctuality of it. Ther are no Ecclesiastiques so frequent in Princes Courts, and Noble mens Palaces, then they, which makes them have more Legacies given them then any other.</p>
            <p>They have also another way besides secrecy of confession to oblige the Nobility by instructing their Children <hi>gratis,</hi> and they have a rare method of Education that way, it cannot be denied. But in <hi>Spain</hi> her self, though the Jesuits have a powerfull hand over the King himself, and in the Councell of the Inquisition, as also a great stroak among the Nobility and Gentry, yet the common peeple malign and hate them generally, as appeers by the Libel which was made in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> which I think worthy the relating here.</p>

            <p>When they were first to be introduc'd to <hi>France,</hi> the Parlement of <hi>Paris</hi> desir'd the opinion of <hi>Sorbon</hi> Colledg compos'd of the acutest Theologues in <hi>France,</hi> which they deliver'd thus as it stands upon Record. <hi>Novem hanc societatem appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione insolita Iesus nomen sibi vindicantem praebere occasionem</hi>—This new society arrogating to themselfs by an unusuall appellation, the name of Jesus, doth admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster occasion of Schisme in the Church, they subtract the obedience that is due to Prelates, they deprive Ecclesiastic Lords and others of their rights, They induce much perturbation both in civill and sacred administrations, they usher in quarrells, contentions, debates, emulations, and divers scissures into the Church, therfore they held them to be dangerous instruments in the busines of Religion, as such that wold disturb the peace of the Church, overthrow Monasticall Discipline, and that their Order tended more to Destruction then Edification; yet by the power of the <hi>Guysian</hi> faction, they were admitted, but the Parlement wold demur upon it a little before, Herupon <hi>Stephen Paschasius</hi> an eminent Doctor, did sharply argue against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>sectam eam ambitiosam &amp; fucatae Religionis plebem appellans, in Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia natam</hi>—He call'd them an ambitious sect, fellowes of a counterfet Religion, born in <hi>Spain,</hi> but foster'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> strengthned in <hi>Rome,</hi> who under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious shew of a gratuitous institution of children, cheat and exhaust many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, infusing pernicious principles into the brains of youths—Then he went on with high exaggerations, and said, that their Provinciall was alwayes chosen by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which Provinciall, they yeeld an unquestionable blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,—Therefore he concludes, that if these new sectaries were admitted, they wold introduce a <hi>Trojan</hi> horse into the bowels of the Kingdome full of armed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that <hi>France</hi> shold repent her of her credulity when it would be too late, for these men by their subtilties, and superstition, by their praestigiatiory kind of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, would distract the settlement and tranquility of the whole Kingdome. Herupon while this busines was in agitation, King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. was thrust in lieu of his breast into the Mouth by a yong Jesuit, with the losse of one tooth, the King having escap'd so great danger, sayed pleasingly; <hi>falloit il que les Iesuites fussent convaincus par ma bouche?</hi> Was it needfull then that the Jesuits shold be convinced by my mouth? Herupon by a solemn arrest of the Court of Parlement, they were utterly exterminated, and commanded to quit the Kingdome by such a day under great penalties; Ther was also in the sentence an interdictory clause, that none shold send their children abroad to be instructed by the Jesuits under pain of trea son.</p>
            <p>Herupon ther was a new Gallowes of Stone erected before the Pallace gate, to execute the transgressors of this decree; But the King finding that his life could never be safe while he stood out with the Jesuits, rather out of fear then affection, connived for the non-execution of the Sentence, causing the said Gallowes to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, herupon one sung wittily to the King,</p>

            <p>Sir, If you will for the future extinguish the remembrance of <hi>Chastel,</hi> take down the Jesuits Pyramid and Sentence, then let them put in a new tooth into your mouth. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> had so ill a conceit of this order, that by the credit the great Turk gave to her Embassador, and by her advise he banished them out of <hi>Pera</hi> on the <hi>Asian</hi> shore, over against <hi>Constantinople</hi> where he had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them formerly to reside.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95159:52"/>But you will say <hi>Iesuits</hi> are a great advantage to a State, because they propagate learning, and instruct youth so dexterously; 'tis tru, they instruct them, but they infuse into them besides, most dangerous principles of equivocation and cunnning, you will say they are the greatest and most masculine propugnators of the Roman Church; 'tis tru, but they are great weakners of the power of temporall Princes; They have planted the standard of the Cross in the Indies, and are the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagators of Christian Faith among Infidells. 'Tis tru, but they do it as much for extending the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy; for as they are the chiefest Agents of the Pope's where e're they come, so are they Factors also for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the bent of all their projects being to enlarge the power of the one, and establish the omnipotency of the other; That Prince or peeple are in a dangerous condition, when any censures from <hi>Rome</hi> come against them, if ther be Jesuits there, who are the punctuallest executioners of the Papall excommunication; such respects the <hi>Spaniards</hi> give them, that they are called <hi>Apostles</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> in <hi>Portugall;</hi> But finding at first that they were malign'd for assuming the name of Jesuits, they did moderat it, and cal'd themselfs <hi>socios Iesu,</hi> the companions of Jesus: Now, in the Holy Scriptures we read but of one that was cal'd the companion of Christ, and that was <hi>Iudas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, most Noble Princes, be pleased to excuse me that I have bin so tedious and tart in displaying this new <hi>Ignatian</hi> Order, the reason is, that being to speak of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was pertinent to speak also of them, who are so great Votaries of that Crown.</p>
            <p>I will give you now a little touch of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, which is, that if any be found to doubt or dispute any thing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he is answered with a syllogisme of fire or hemp, which concludes more strongly then a syllogisme in <hi>Barbara.</hi> But such kind of arguing is fitter for Butchers, Hangmen and Devils, then for the Doctors of the Christian Church. Now, as we read that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> the scandall of Emperours, wold have had the Vestall fyres extinguished, with all religious invocations and victimes, and the name of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> to be only ador'd, so the <hi>Spaniard</hi> endeavours to extinguish all other orders and government, to set up the <hi>Iesuit</hi> (his chief chaplain) and the Inquisition.</p>
            <p>Now this proceeds from the ignorance of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who reads no Authors commonly but his own Countrey-men, because he understands no Language but his own, which in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Academies and Schools, sways more then Latin, though the fourth part of the Language be meer <hi>Morisco,</hi> and patched up of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> words.</p>
            <p>But I wonder, my noble Cosen <hi>Magnus,</hi> that in the Catalog you give of the learned men of <hi>Spain,</hi> you extoll <hi>Raymundus Lullius</hi> so much, a man foolishly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, who scarce understanding the Latine tongue, which he mingled with his own, yet he dared expose som things to the world, but involv'd in darknes, such obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that few of his Readers understand him. For my part, I hold his <hi>Philosophers stone;</hi> and his <hi>Learning</hi> to be all one, but meer imaginary things, in so much that one may say;</p>

            <p>Now for the nature of the Spaniards, they are most made up of Imagination, and a kind of fantastique gravity, under which is cloak'd a great deale of pride: They beleeve more what they fancie, then what they do. Nor doth the Portugais deny it, when he confesseth that he acts according to that which he thinks himself to be, then what he really is. <hi>Portugalli dictitant se niti eo potius quod se esse putant, quam eo quod reverasunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Portugall,</hi> it is made up most of Slaves, for the nomber of them in som pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are allmost equall to the Inhabitants; and ther are few Countreys where ther is lesse distinction made twixt men and beasts, for they are both sold in the market for money alike.

            <p>Now as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are bladder'd up generally with this arrogance, and altitude of mind, so they care not how they com by their wealth though they take it from another by violence to support it; nor how little they worke to get a subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for they are sloathfull and idle to a proverb, unlesse it be in the Warrs; This makes them to be cryed up for such theeves, Herupon <hi>Charles</hi> the V. their own King, being accompanied with many <hi>Spanish</hi> Dons, as he pass'd in <hi>Germany</hi> by a great Inne, where divers were a drinking and merry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he asked his Dons, are not the <hi>Germans</hi> personable proper men, well complexion'd and limm'd? This cannot be deny'd, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> answer'd, but they are excessively given to drinking; the Emperour replyed, 'tis tru, but do you know what vices the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are guilty of? for as these are greedy of Wine, so are the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greedy of another mans wealth, and so to interdict the <hi>German</hi> his wine were the same as to prohibit the <hi>Spaniard</hi> he shold not robb, which was one of the ten Commandements of God Almighty, where you shall not find any against drinking.</p>
            <p>And as the peeple of <hi>Spain</hi> are such robbers, so the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all; They are Robbers of whole Kingdoms, and Countreys, they are the Harpies of the earth, for whersoever they confine, they cast about how to devoure their Neighbours, using all artifices, and picking any quarrell to that end, in so much that those <hi>Virgilian</hi> Verses may very well quadrat with their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

            <p>The greatnes of this Nation is but Modern and upstart, when the fortune of <hi>France</hi> was a little wayning, <hi>Spain</hi> began to shine, first under <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Charles</hi> the V. so that as one sayd, <hi>Ubi Galli desierunt Rerum potiri, ibi Hispani inceperunt.</hi> This <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the first Catholique King, vail'd and varnish'd all his Enprizes with the plausible pretext of advancing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet were his pen and his tongue double in doing this, he carryed oftentimes two faces under one hood, and played with a staff of two ends in his greatest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, specially in the performance of Articles 'twixt him and the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. about the division of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he shold have <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laba</hi> and <hi>Apulia,</hi> and the <hi>French Naples,</hi> and <hi>Campania;</hi> But afterwards he sent his great Captain <hi>Gonsalvo</hi> who conquer'd both.

And to make his cause more specious, and pretend som right, he insisted upon the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Pope, saying, That they who were enemies to the Holy Father, might be assaulted by any Christian King, and that his Holines was to give the Countrey to the <hi>first Conquerour.</hi>

            <p>Now touching the East and West Indies, the Spanish title is unquestionable there you will say, but let us examin the busines a little. The right which the Spaniards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to these two Indies, is Right of Discovery; For the East Indies, it hath been so celebrated by ancient Pagan Writers, that to hold the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to be the first De tector therof, were to maintain the grossest paradox that ever was; For <hi>Pliny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates how <hi>Hanno</hi> the Carthaginian being carryed about from the feet of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> to the farthest end of <hi>Arabia</hi> was the first discoverer of <hi>India,</hi> by twice crossing the <hi>Equinoctiall;</hi> And 'tis easie to finde in antient Authors, that <hi>Malacca</hi> was call'd <hi>Aurea Cherchonesus,</hi> and that huge Iland <hi>Sumatra</hi> was known formerly by the name of <hi>Tatrobana;</hi> what is he who is never so little vers'd in Antiquity but hath read the Orientall <hi>Brachman</hi> Philosophers, and of the <hi>Sinenses</hi> the peeple of <hi>China?</hi> Touching the <hi>West Indies,</hi> they were not unknown to <hi>Plato,</hi> for whereas he placeth <hi>Atlantidis</hi> at the mouth of the <hi>Gaditan</hi> Frete, which is the mouth of the Mediterranean, he sayeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Ther is from <hi>Atlantidis</hi> a passage to other Ilands, and from them to a great opposit <hi>Continent</hi>—What doth he intimat herby but the great Canarie with other Ilands in the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Sea, and by the other Ilands <hi>Cuba,</hi> and <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> &amp; by the opposit Continent <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico.</hi> Moreover the Spaniards themselfs confesse that in a valley call'd <hi>Cautis</hi> in the Province of <hi>Chyli,</hi> they found among the Sauvages many pictures and formes of two-headed Eagles in midst of their houses, therfore the Spaniards call that part of AMERICA <hi>The Imperiall Province</hi> to this day, because the Armes of the Roman Empire were found there.</p>
            <p>There is a greater evidence then this that the Spaniards were not the first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of <hi>America,</hi> for ther was a Welsh Epitaph found there upon <hi>Madoc</hi> a British Prince, who it seems flying from the fury of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> put himself in som Bark to the fortune of the Sea, and landed in <hi>America.</hi> And that the old Britains or Welsh were there, it may be confirmd further, in regard ther are divers British words found amongst them to this day.</p>
            <p>But what shall we wander so far in the Indies? We will come neerer home. We know well that <hi>Solyman</hi> the Turk denied <hi>Charles</hi> the V. the title of <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95159:53"/>
alledging that he himself was the tru successor of <hi>Constantin</hi> the Great, who was Emperour of East and West; And that consequently the City of <hi>Rome</hi> belongd to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and <hi>Selim, Solymans</hi> son urgd such an argument when he took <hi>Cypres</hi> from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for he sayed that the sayed Ile appertained to the <hi>Soldans</hi> of <hi>Egipt</hi> which was now under his dominion.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Apostolicall</hi> concession and bounty of Pope <hi>Alexandor</hi> the VI. entitles the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America;</hi> touching that I pray here what <hi>Attabalipa</hi> a wild <hi>Pagan</hi> King sayd, when he heard that his Kingdome was given by the Pope, to the <hi>Spanish</hi> King; surely, said he, that <hi>Pope must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is covetous, so is he extreamly cruell, for how many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men hath he made away in <hi>America? Bartholome de Casa</hi> affirmes, that in 45. yeers, there were above ten millions of humane soules (though Savage) kill'd in the <hi>new world</hi> as they call it, in so much that the <hi>Indian</hi> Husbands forbore to lye with their wives for fear they should prove with child, and bring more slaves for the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> These millions before mention'd were kill'd out right, and if we add to them those who have died of working in the mines, of doing the offices of Asses, Oxen, and Mules, to what a number do you thinke will they accrew? som of them carry burdens upon their back of 160. pound weight, and that above 300. Miles. How many of these poor wretches have perished by water as well as by land, being forc'd to dive so many fadomes deep for the fishing of Perl, and to stay there som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times halfe an houre under water panting and drawing in the same breath all the while, and being fed of purpose with corse bisket and dry things to be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded for that work. And if what is reported be tru, they hunt the poor <hi>Indians</hi> with doggs to find them sport: wherupon ther goes a tale of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who to exercise his dog and make himself some sport with an old Woman, made shew as if he sent her with a letter to the Governor of the next town hard by, the poor woman being gone a flight shot off, he let slip his dog after her, which being com neer, she fell down on her knees, saying, Senior dog, Senior dog, do not kill me, for I am going with letters from your Master to the Governour: the dog it seems was mov'd with compassion, and so only lift up his legg and piss'd upon her.</p>
            <p>One may easily imagine how detestable the <hi>Spaniards</hi> became to these poor <hi>Pagans</hi> for these cruelties, there is a tale of <hi>Hathu Cacico</hi> a stout <hi>Indian,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>This <hi>Indian</hi> tresure hath wrought another disadvantage to the Spanish King, for it hath puff'd him up with a pride and an ambition that hath no horizon, it makes him flatter himself that he shall be at last Monark of the Western world, which drawes upon him not onely the Emulation, but the hatred of all his Neighbours, who are ready ever and anon to confederat and bandy against him, for fear he shold swallow them up one after another to satiat his ambition; It was a witty say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of King <hi>Iames,</hi> when he was only King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he receav'd a caveat from his Godmother Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to take heed of the <hi>Spanish</hi> fleet, He answer'd, <hi>Se non aliud ab Hispano beneficium expectare quam quod Ulyssi Polyphemus promiserat, scilicit ut aliis devoratis postremus degluriretur,</hi> For his part he desir'd but one request of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> such a one that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyphemus</hi> had promis'd <hi>Ulysses,</hi> that when he had devour'd others, he wold swallow him last of all.</p>
            <p>Now as among those poor <hi>Pagan Indians,</hi> the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was so much discover'd, so was it here in <hi>Europe</hi> among Christians, witnes els the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who may be call'd the sponge of <hi>Belgian</hi> bloud, for he bragg'd that he had dispatch'd to the other world above 18000. <hi>Belgians,</hi> either by Fire, Water, the Rack, or the Axe, his principles being, <hi>that a Rebell must be us'd like a madd dogg, for whom ther is no cure but to be knock'd in the head, and we know</hi> mortui non mordent.</p>
            <p>Now touching the <hi>Gigantik</hi> power of the Catholique King, if it be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance of a knowing judgment, is not so great as we conceive it to be, the unsociable distance of his territories, the infinit sommes he owes to the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> and others, the vigilance and Emulation, with the apprehensions they have of his still growing greatnes; the Universall dis-affection, and a kind of antipathy that all Nations have to the peeple themselfs, is a great weaknes to him one way, as his riches and power another way; For matter of Justice, who is the Queen of Vertues, I beleeve she raigns as little in <hi>Spain</hi> as among any peeple, unlesse it be among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs, nor universally among themselfs, but only the <hi>Castilians</hi> may have her with more ease, and lesse expences then their <hi>Conterraneans</hi> and the rest of their

Fellow-subjects; I will produce an example of an <hi>Arragonez</hi> who having a sute there long depending which put him to mighty expence and attendance, at last he came to the King himself, <hi>Philip</hi> the second, who, opening his businesse unto him, gave him this absolute Answer, Ther's nothing that you have propos'd can be granted; Sir, answer'd the <hi>Aragones, I thank you, that you have refuted the lies of threescore Ministers of yours in so few words, who with much expence of time and tresure did put me still in hopes that my busines was just, and it wold take effect, but had I known it, I wold have come to your Majestie at first, and then I had been wiser then I was, and a better Husband;</hi> Now for Forreners it is as easie to redeem a damn'd soul out of Hell as almost to recover any thing if they have got it once among their clutches: did not <hi>Philip</hi> the second break, and make himself an absolute bankrupt with many thousand besides, when he alter'd the intrinseque value of coines and hois'd it higher, and found out som Puntillios to pay the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noways</hi> their interest, which was cryed up to be a high point of injustice: How many hundred sutes have strangers had there, wherein the processall charges countervail oft times the value of the thing?</p>
            <p>Now for the power of the Spanish Monarchy, I must tell you that her <hi>Castillia</hi> her <hi>head</hi> is grown almost bald; <hi>Portugall</hi> which was no other then a waxen <hi>Nose</hi> to her is melted off; her <hi>Aragonian eyes</hi> have still som defluctions falling into them for their priviledges; <hi>Navarr</hi> one of her <hi>Armes</hi> begins to have a Gangreen, which none but <hi>French</hi> Surgeons can cure; her <hi>golden</hi> bowels of <hi>Peru</hi> begin to be exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and so doth the <hi>Duodenum</hi> of <hi>Mexico:</hi> Her <hi>hipps</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> feare they have a symptome of the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and her <hi>feet</hi> in <hi>Belgium</hi> are pittifully sick of the Gout, to cure which, she hath often applyed Playsters made over with <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Indian</hi> Gold, which hath cost her more then <hi>Belgium</hi> is worth ten times over, if it were to be sold in the Market.</p>
            <p>Now for tru reall innated and personall valour, how few <hi>Spaniards</hi> shall you find indu'd with it! It is a rare thing to heare of a Duell in an age there, though every Cobbler weare a Sword by his side; If they have receav'd affronts by any, they use to shew their courage, and draw their Swords one upon another in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, where they are sure to be parted, and commonly the Minister of Justice takes away both their weapons for the time, and so makes them friends; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a saying of the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>al primer impetu son mas que hombres, y de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises menos que mugeres,</hi> The <hi>French</hi> at first is more then a man, and afterwards lesse then a woman; but the <hi>French</hi> have an illfavour'd saying of them, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in point of tru active courage are <hi>bearded Women.</hi> 'Tis tru in the conquest of the new world, they did exploits, but it was against men who had scarce any defensive Armes, they had neither Horse, Steele, Iron or Gun-powder, they had no coats of Males, they were poor naked <hi>inermous</hi> creatures, and so simple that they thought the horse and the man was but one animall, and a kind of Monster or Devill, therefore 10. Horsemen only were able to profligat, and make their party good against many thousand <hi>Indians,</hi> for they thought they had a conceit they were not borne after the ordinary cours of humane nature, but rather of som infernall fiends, which bugbeare opinion scar'd the ignorant <hi>American</hi> away more then the <hi>Spanish</hi> valour.</p>
            <p>Where was the <hi>Spanish</hi> manhood in <hi>Afrique,</hi> when <hi>Sebastian</hi> was slain, and the <hi>Moor</hi> got so signall a victory?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Oration of the excellent Baron of <hi>Limburg,</hi> though flowing with powerful eloquence, hath not, under favour, wrought so much in me, as that gallant Encomium of yours, <hi>Prince Magnus,</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Spain,</hi> therfore I concurr still with you in opinion that she may deserve the <hi>primacy,</hi> and if the comparison that <hi>Strabo</hi> makes be admitted, that <hi>Europe</hi> is like <hi>an Eagle whose head is Spain, the neck France, Germany the back and breast, Italy and England the two Armes, the thighs and leggs those huge tracts of Earth Northward,</hi> I say if this Simile be allow'd, ther is no question but <hi>Spain</hi> may challenge the priority and head-ship. But my noble Cofen of <hi>Limburg,</hi> I much wonder what came into your mind, to throw so much dirt into the face of <hi>Spain</hi> and her children; If you were now in the <hi>Escuriall,</hi> and made such a speech before <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, I believe we shold heare no more of you, but you shold be buried alive in the <hi>Inquisition</hi> all your life time.</p>
            <p>But is <hi>Spain</hi> so hungry as you say, that she must eat grasse? Is she so weak that she needs Crutches? Is she so abandond to Vice, that she hath quite shaken off all Vertu, and a good Conscience? Surely no; Touching the first, she may be call'd the Exchequer of all Christendom for Money, and I pray what can he want who hath Money? unlesse he make such a foolish wish as <hi>Mydas</hi> did, that whatsoever he touch'd might turn to gold, for so he might starve <hi>medias inter opes inops.</hi> Ther is a proverb in <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Don sin dinero, no es Don si no Donayre,</hi> A man without money, is no man but a bable, but a man with money commands the world, according to those witty verses of <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi>

allwayes his Sword drawn, and being in perpetuall hostility with the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Christendom (to his great glory) as also in actuall Warr with some of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who if they wold let him be quiet, he might quickly subdue all <hi>Mauritania</hi> the opposit shore to <hi>Spain,</hi> yet for all ther is never any the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of want in the <hi>Catholique</hi> Court, nor the least shew that <hi>Spain</hi> is in warr or want, but all things flourish as if he did not ow peny, or as if he were in peace with all the world. It makes me think upon <hi>Glareanus</hi> a great learned man but much in debt, who being asked by a friend of his how he liv'd? He answer'd, <hi>I lead the life of Kings and Princes, for I drink, I eet, and indulge my genius, I game and have money always in my purse,</hi> yet I am in arrears to all; so it may be said of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> But it is brave security the <hi>Spanish</hi> King gives to his Creditors, no lesse then assignments upon his occidentall Fleet, which weigh all circumstances well, is one of the greatest glories that ever Monarch had.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any one of this Illustrious convention would set forth the glory of some great <hi>City,</hi> which flow'd with plenty of all things that were requisit, either for necessity or pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exceeding therein the very wishes of the Inhabitants, a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which had also impregnable fortifications, and strength both by art and nature, with armes of all kinds, such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnacles, such advantages by land and water both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her self, and destroy the enemy; Who had a grave way of administration of Justice, whose Inhabitants did florish with all sorts of manufactures, with all kind of vertu, invention, and elegance, and shining with all kind of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude, I believe there is not any of this Princely Assembly but would pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionatly desire to see that rare renowned City; But, most excellent President, I have taken in hand to describe unto you not such a narrow thing as one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or one Countrey either, but a little world of it self, wherein many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are conjoind in one, and under one Monarch, which little world doth swell with affluence of all things desirable; those blessings which are found single in other parts of Europe are found conjunctly here; yet this is no other portion of the earth then an Iland, but such an Iland that before I have done with you, you will acknowledg that this Iland may stand in competition for preheminence with any of those noble Regions that you have displayed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in most learned and eloquent Orations; And this is <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of Iles, the <hi>minion of Neptun,</hi> the darling of <hi>Ceres,</hi> Incomparable Britain; for so the Greek Poet will tell you;</p>

bosome by way of <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Negotiation</hi> the wealth of all the world, and to make others happy with Hers; she lies very apposit to comfort, and relieve those that come neer her coasts, if they be in any danger by distresse of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or want of any thing that is needfull for vessell or men.</p>
            <p>The aire is there so temperat that a well disposed body may passe there without either stoves in Winter, or shades in Sommer; There be gentle breezes that blow from the circumjacent Sea, which refresh all kind of animalls both brute, and rationall, the clowds there drop fatnes, dissolving into silver wholsom showers to soften and fertilize her glebes; she useth to have in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi> frost enough to knit the joints of the earth, and so corroborat them; in <hi>February</hi> she hath snow enough to fill her dikes, and like a coverlet to keep her plowd fields warm. And whereas the seas of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> are barren of fish, Hers have them by whole shoales, and in such variety that it is incredible. Her Forests and woods have no birds or beasts of rapine, and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous animalls, but harmeles (though wild) creatures, as the Stagg, the Hind, and the Hart, which serve for pleasure and hospitality. The bowells of her soyl, and hills are pregnant with mineralls, or fuell; The Sun which scorcheth <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> doth gently warm <hi>Britain</hi> with his rayes; The air is nothing so thick and dull as in other climes, but attenuated and cleerd with refreshing and gentle blasts ever and anone; nor is her earth subject to agues, to quaking and trepidation as other places are, but alwayes firme and sure. For store and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of corn, in the <hi>Romans</hi> time she was call'd the barn and granary of the western part of the Empire, in so much that <hi>Zosimus</hi> reports, that they us'd to lade eight hundred vessells with <hi>British</hi> corn for many yeers to supply their army upon the frontiers of <hi>Germany.</hi> These ensueing verses of a Forrener do hint a little upon the happines of this Countrey.</p>

delightfullnesse or life, thy daies are very long, and no night but hath some glimpses of light. The glorious Sun which sets and goes down in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, seemes onely but to passe by the Coasts. That salt ditch which girds <hi>Britain</hi> about, renders her invincible; I meane the circumambient sea, which opens and shuts, and embosoms himself into her at divers commodious creeks. This Sea is so high and turgid oftentimes, that some Authors record it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth 80. Fadoms at a spring-tide in divers places. He sometimes salutes and covers the inviting soyle, then he departs, but to come again. He doth cast up sometimes and leaves upon the shore huge fishes, of strange shapes, as the <hi>Lyric</hi> sings.</p>

            <p>Rejoyce therefore O <hi>Britain,</hi> and triumph, that Dame Nature hath cast such a mote about thee, which no Engine of Man can choake, no reach of wit or labour can dry up. Let the <hi>Flemish</hi> secure <hi>Ostend</hi> with new dikes, <hi>Anwerp</hi> with a strong Cittadel, let <hi>Milan</hi> glory for her inexpugnable Castle, let the <hi>Venetians</hi> bragg of their <hi>Palma,</hi> The <hi>Hungarians</hi> of <hi>Iavarin</hi> and <hi>Comorra,</hi> The <hi>Turkes</hi> theirs of <hi>Goleta, Savoy</hi> hers of <hi>Monmelian,</hi> The <hi>French</hi> theirs of <hi>Baion,</hi> where none must enter but the King himself, or the blood Royal; Let the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> bragge of his <hi>Havana,</hi> the <hi>Pole</hi> of <hi>Smolenksco,</hi> The <hi>Austrian</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> The <hi>Bavarian</hi> of <hi>Ingolstad,</hi> The <hi>Dane</hi> of <hi>Croneburg,</hi> Let <hi>Brandeburg</hi> bragge of <hi>Castreni, Silesia</hi> of <hi>Breslaw,</hi> the <hi>Franconians</hi> of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> the <hi>Swed</hi> of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> and let other Kings and Countries glory never so much of their strong holds, Motes and Fortifications; but to compare them to that Dike which is cast about great <hi>Britain,</hi> were to compare a purl, or small rivulet of water to the Archipelago, or a small tuft of Earth to Mount <hi>Adrian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth this huge Mote give security alone to the Inhabitants, but it brings them many other inestimable benefits; it animates by vertue of the salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters the heat of the contiguous Earth, it nourisheth the air with pregnant vapours, to make wholsom showres for the irrigation and refreshment of the Earth; it takes in and lets out many brave Rivers for navigation, which are replenished with all store of Fish. Among other kind, the benefit that is made of Herrings is beyond belief, which swimme in huge shoales like Mountains about the Iland. Towards the Summer Solstice, they seek the Coasts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> then towards <hi>Autumne</hi> they retire to the <hi>English,</hi> and it is incredible what huge quantities are taken twixt <hi>Scarborough</hi> and the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth from the month of <hi>August</hi> to <hi>September:</hi> then they move more Southward to the <hi>British</hi> Sea, and find matter for fishing till <hi>Christmas;</hi> then having as it were fetch'd a compasse about <hi>Britain,</hi> they seek the <hi>Western</hi> Sea, and the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast, where they keep till <hi>Iune,</hi> and then set forward for <hi>Britain</hi> again, when they are grown fat, and numerous by multiplication.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Britany,</hi> like a Microcosm of her selfe, is seated in the midst of a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and working Sea; yet she within is still quiet, serene and safe. And now I will take a survay of this Noble Iland, as one would doe of some stately Castle: and to do that exactly, one must not onely view the Trenches and outworks which are about, but pry into the recesses and roomes within, and observe what fashion of men they are that keep it; therefore I will make a progresse into the Center and bowells of <hi>Britain.</hi> Touching the people who inhabit Her, they are the wellfavourdest, and best complexion'd people of any upon the surface of the Earth: they have excellent Intellectuals, sucking Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and spacious Understandings; they add unto, and perfect any inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is brought them. And truly, wee <hi>Germans</hi> should be very ingrateful, unlesse we should acknowledge to have receiv'd great benefit by them: for in point of Religion and literature they have been Doctors and Parents unto us.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95159:60"/>
They brought Christ and the Standard of the Crosse first amongst us, they dispell'd the black clouds of Faganism and ignorance from amongst us, and let in the sweet raies of piety and knowledge to enlighten us. This, unlesse wee brand our selfs with the ugly mark of ingratitude, we must ingeniously confesse.</p>
            <p>Now, it is observ'd that the <hi>Britans</hi> were alwaies by a special instinct very much addicted to Religion; And as in the Discipline of the <hi>Druyds,</hi> whose founders they are held to be, they antecell'd all others, (for <hi>Caesar</hi> records that the <hi>Gaules</hi> went over to be instructed by the <hi>British Druyds</hi>) so when the name of <hi>Christ</hi> was known among them, with flagrant desires, and fervent affections they embrac'd that beliefe with a wonderful ready devotion; and as the glorious Sun when he culminates and appears in the <hi>East,</hi> doth as it were in a moment illustrate the whole Hemisphear; so the beames of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity displayed themselves with marvellous celerity all the Hand over. But this had very good helps to advance this work, for in the infancy of the Church, as <hi>Baronius</hi> doth assert, <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> a Noble <hi>Decurion</hi> arrived there, and <hi>Claudia Rufina,</hi> Wife to <hi>Aulus Pudens</hi> the <hi>Roman;</hi> of whom the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et <hi>Martial,</hi> nay Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself makes honorable mention. <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> having made a hot progresse through <hi>Barbary,</hi> died in <hi>Britain.</hi> Nay, some say that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being freed from <hi>Nero</hi>'s shackles, encreas'd the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace there.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Britains</hi> having had the advantage of such great lights, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themselves to erect Oratories and Churches for the publique exercise of devotion; wherein they grew so zealous, that <hi>Lucius</hi> a <hi>British</hi> King left his Crown, with all earthly pomp, and made a spontaneous pilgrimage to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> the year 150. after the Incarnation, and spent the rest of his life in holy Meditations, and practices of piety. Now, what a glory it is for <hi>Britain</hi> to have had the first Christian King that ever was; Nay, the first Christian Emperor, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. And to speak truth, no Region produc'd more constant professors of Christianity then <hi>Britain</hi> did, and more fincere Propagators thereof, which will appear if we look into the Catologe of Saints, Martyrs, and Confessors. In so much that in lieu of that malitious character which <hi>Porphyrie</hi> gives of her (who hated her for being such a zealous Christian) by calling her <hi>feracem tyrannorum provinciam,</hi> a Country fruitful for Tyrants; she may more deservedly be call'd <hi>Regio sanctorum faecundissima,</hi> a Region most abounding with Saints. Nor were the <hi>Britans</hi> such Zelots only at home, but they cross'd the Seas to disperse the beams of Christian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge abroad; and their paines prov'd very successful herein. <hi>Germany</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to <hi>Winfridus,</hi> and <hi>Willebrod</hi> that she was converted. <hi>France</hi> was behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to <hi>Alcuin</hi> for establishing the Academy of <hi>Paris,</hi> though <hi>Paschasius,</hi> a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing Author, denies it. Touching us <hi>Germans,</hi> among other testimonies of gratitude to <hi>Britain,</hi> let this of an excellent <hi>Almain</hi> Poet serve for one.</p>

What a bold <hi>Britain</hi> was <hi>Brennus</hi> (who liv'd long before the <hi>English</hi> took footing there) what notable feates did he perform in <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia?</hi> so that the old <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> in honor of that Heroe call a King after his name to this day <hi>viz. Brennin,</hi> and there is a Castle in <hi>Wales</hi> of his name to this day. How manfully did the ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> tugg with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who receav'd fowler defeats there then in any other Region? which one of their Poets seemes to confesse, when he saith,</p>
            <q>—Invictos Romano Marte Britannos.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Silures</hi> who are a peeple but of a few small shires in Wales, <hi>viz. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Brecknock</hi> and others, being animated by the courage of their King <hi>Cataracus,</hi> and provok'd by the menaces of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> who threatned to extinguish the very names of them, met his army in open field, and cutting off an auxiliary Regiment which was going to recreut the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour under <hi>Marius Valens,</hi> they utterly routed him: In so much that <hi>Ostorius</hi> the propraetor of <hi>Britanny</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> resenting this dishonor died out of a sense of grief. <hi>Charles the Great</hi> had to doe with them in three battailes, wherein there was such a slaughter of his men, that he cryed, <hi>Si vel semel tantùm cum il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>

            <p>For how often have the <hi>French</hi> Kings with their Nobles been routed, defeated and discomfited by the <hi>English Gray-goose-wing?</hi> how often hath it pierc'd the very center of the Kingdom? what notable rich returnes have the <hi>English</hi> made from <hi>France?</hi> And what pittifull looks must <hi>France</hi> have, when <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth got such a glorious victory at <hi>Cressy,</hi> where above thirty thousand pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd, among whom the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was found among the dead bodies, ten Princes, eighty Barons, twelve hundred Gentlemen, and the flower of the <hi>French</hi> fell that day, and King <hi>Philip of Valois</hi> did hardly escape himself to a small town, which being ask'd at the gate who he was, <hi>qui va la?</hi> answer'd, <hi>la Fortune de France,</hi> the Fortune of France. This made <hi>France</hi> weare black a long time. But in another battail she had as ill luck, wherein her King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> where taken prisoners, and attended the prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>England:</hi> yet such was the modesty of that prince, though conquerour, that he waited upon King <hi>Iohn</hi> bareheaded at table; this was such a passage as happen'd in King <hi>Edgars</hi> raign, who had foure Kings to row him upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Dee</hi> hard by <hi>Westchester, viz. Kennad</hi> Kind of the <hi>Scots, Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Cumberland; Maconus</hi> King of <hi>Man,</hi> and another <hi>Welsh</hi> King. The <hi>English</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>France</hi> to such a poverty at that time, that she was forc'd to coin leather money. In divers other battailes in the raignes of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, sixt, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the elevenths time, the <hi>English</hi> did often foyl the <hi>French,</hi> untill the war <hi>pour le bien public</hi> begun by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Such a large livery and seifin the <hi>English</hi> had taken in <hi>France,</hi> that for three hundred and fifty years they were masters of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> Nay <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt of <hi>England</hi> was crowned King of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> And so formidable were the <hi>English,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> when he was to encounter the <hi>French</hi> army in the field, thought it a policy to cloth a whole Regiment of his soldiers after the <hi>English</hi> mode, to make them more terrible to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall I say of that notable Virago Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who did such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits again <hi>Spain,</hi> by taking the united provinces of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> under her protection? How did she ply the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and bayt him by Sea and Land, how did she in a manner make him a Bankrupt, by making him lose his credit in all the banks of Europe! And all that while <hi>Spain</hi> could do <hi>England</hi> no harme at all; touching the strength of which Kingdom you may please to hear what a judicious <hi>Italian</hi> speaks of it, <hi>Il Regno d'Ingliterra non há bisogno d'altri per la propria difesa, anzi non solo é difficile, mà si può dir impossible se non é divisione nel Regno che per via de force possa esser conquistato.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> stands in no need of any other for her own defense; so that it is not only difficult, but a thing impossible, unlesse there be some intestin division, to make a conquest of that Countrey. <hi>Philip</hi> offer'd very fairly for her in the year eighty eight, when he thought to have swallowed her with his Invincible Fleet, which was a preparing three yeers: she consisted of above 150. saile, 8000. Mariners, 20000. foot, besides voluntiers, she carried 1600. Canons of brasse, 1000. of iron, and a hundred and twenty thousand granados of all sorts. The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95159:61"/>
Fleet stood the King in every day thirty thousand Duckets; insomuch that <hi>Bernardin Mendoza,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour in <hi>France,</hi> being in a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference one day with King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, assured him, that <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> that Fleet had stood his Master in above tenne Millions first and last, from the time that she set sayl from <hi>Lisbon.</hi> This Fleet look'd like a huge Forrest at Sea as she made her way. Good Lord how notably did that Masculine Queen bestirre her self, in viewing her Armies, in visiting her Men of Warre, and Ships Royall, in having her Castles and Ports well fortified, in riding about, and in the head of the Army her self, in discharging the Office of a true <hi>Pallas,</hi> wearing a Hat and Feather in lieu of a Helmet. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> sent her seasonable notice hereof, so that most of the Roman Catholiques up and down were commanded to retire to the Ile of <hi>Ely,</hi> a fenney place; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were secured in Bishops houses till this horrid cloud which did threaten the destruction of <hi>England</hi> should be overblown. But this prodigious Fleet being come to the <hi>British</hi> seas, how did the little English vessels pelt those huge Gigantick Galeons of <hi>Spain?</hi> whereof those few which were left (for all the rest perisht) were forc'd to fetch a compass almost as far as <hi>Norway</hi> in 62. degrees, and so got to <hi>Spain</hi> to bring the sad tidings what became of the rest.</p>
            <p>There were Triumphs for this not onely in <hi>England,</hi> but all the United Provinces over, where a Medal was coyn'd bearing this Inscription on the one side, <hi>Classis Hispanica,</hi> The Spanish Fleet; on the other side, <hi>Venit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How gallantly did the <hi>English</hi> take <hi>Cales,</hi> the Key of <hi>Spain,</hi> and brought home such rich plunder? How did they infest the <hi>Indies,</hi> and what a masse of Treasure did <hi>Drake</hi> (that English Dragon) bring home thence? he made his Sailes of Silk, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors of Silver.</p>
            <p>Most noble Princes, you have heard something, though not the tyth that might be said of the early Piety and Devotion, of the exquisite Knowledge, and Learning, of the Manhood and Prowesse of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> but these praises that I give her is but a bucket of water cast into her Seas. Now touching both King and people, it is observ'd that there is such a reciprocation of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that it is wonderfull; the one swayes, the other submits, obeyes, and contributes to the necessities and preservation of the honour and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the King, for which he receives protection and security.</p>
            <p>Touching the Regall Authority, and absolute Power and Prerogatives of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> it is as high and supreame as any Monarchs upon Earth: They acknowledge no Superior but God himself, they are not feudetary or homageable to any, they admit no forraign jurisdiction within the bounds of their Kingdomes, and herein they have the advantage of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> yea of the Emperour himself, who is in a kind of vassalage to the Pope, and may be said to divide authority with him in their own Dominions. No, they have long time shaken off that servitude, and manumitted the Crown from those immense sums which were erogated and ported from <hi>England</hi> to pay for First fruits, for Indulgences, for Appeales, Palls, and Dispensations, and such merchandises of <hi>Rome.</hi> How many hundred of years did <hi>England</hi> pay Tribute, though it went under the name of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> think you? no less than near upon a thousand, from the reign of King <hi>Inas</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</p>
            <p>From the Power of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> let us goe to their Justice, let us descend from the Throne to the Tribunall. Now, such is the Divinitie of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that they cannot doe any Injustice; it is a Canon of their Common Law that the King can doe no wrong; if any be done, it is the Kings Minister, the Judge, Magistrate, or Officer doth doe it, and so is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95159:62"/>
accordingly: such a high regard the <hi>English</hi> have of the honour of their King; and such a speciall care the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have us'd to take for punishing of Injustice and corruption; such a care as King <hi>Edgar</hi> had to free the Iland from Wolves (and corrupt Officers are no better than Wolves) which he did by a Tribute that he impos'd upon a <hi>Welsh</hi> Prince for his ranson, which was, to bring him in three hundred skinnes of Wolves every year: this produced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o good effects, that the whole race of Wolves was extirpated in a short time, so that it is as rare a thing to see a Wolf now in <hi>England,</hi> as a Horse in <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the care that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> us'd to have to enrich their subjects, hath been us'd to be very great, and to improve the common stock: <hi>Edward</hi> the third (that <hi>Gallorum malleus,</hi> the hammer of the <hi>French,</hi> he quell'd them so) was the first who introduced the art of making of Cloth into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereby the Exchequer, with the publique and private wealth of the Kingdome did receive a mighty increment; for Wooll is the Golden Fleece of <hi>England,</hi> and the prime Staple-commodity, which is the cause, that by an old custome, the Judges, Masters of the Rolls, and Secretaries of State in Parliament time doe use to sit upon Woolsacks in the House, that <hi>commodum lanarum &amp; ovium non negligendum esse, Parliamentum moneatur,</hi> that they put the Parliament in mind that the commodity of Wool and Sheep be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. The <hi>Swede,</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>German,</hi> the <hi>Russe,</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all Nations doe highly esteem the English cloth. The time was that <hi>Antwerp</hi> her self did buy and vend two hundred thousand English cloths yearly, as <hi>Camden</hi> hath it. And great and antient are the priviledges that the <hi>English</hi> have in <hi>Belgium;</hi> for since the year 1338, which is above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares agoe, when <hi>Lewis Malan</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> gave them very ample immunities in the Town of <hi>Bruges,</hi> since which time it is incredible how all kind of commerce and merchantile affaire did flourish among the <hi>Flemins,</hi> for which they were first obliged to the <hi>English;</hi> for the English Wooll hath been a Golden Fleece also to the <hi>Flemins,</hi> as well as the <hi>English</hi> themselves, because it was one of the principal causes of enlarging their Trade, whereunto the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> related, when he established the order of the Golden Fleece <hi>Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin</hi> makes a computation, that the Traffique and Intercourse betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> amounted to twelve millions yearly, where of five was for woollen manufactures.</p>
            <p>What an Heroique incomparable Princesse was Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who wore the English Crown, and sway'd the Scepter as politiquely, prudently, and stoutly as any of those Kings which wore swords before her, or after her; she raigned four and forty years in a marvellous course of prosperity, and all the world, yea her enemies did confesse that there was never such a Virgin and a Virago upon earth. Her subjects lov'd her as their most indulgent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her foes fear'd her as a just Revengresse; her Neighbour Princes and States did attribute their safety to her, and all <hi>Europe,</hi> yea the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and the Emperour of <hi>Russia</hi> (to whom she first open'd the way of commerce) did behold her, though a far off, with the eyes of admiration. They esteem'd her as a great Heroina, and the Arbitresse of Christendome; for she might as well as her Father have taken that Motto, <hi>cui adhaereo, praeest;</hi> He, whom I sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>k to, prevailes. Nay, she did more truly verifie that saying of her Father's, <hi>Galliam &amp; Hispaniam esse quasi lances in Europae libra, &amp; Angliam esse lingula<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sive libripendem;</hi> That <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were like the Beams of the great balance of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>England</hi> was the handle of that balance.</p>
            <p>Touching the observance and fidelity which the English us'd to bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Soveraign Prince, it hath been us'd to be rare and exemplary. They reverence him in his absence, as wel as when he is present; for whersoever the <hi>Chaire</hi> of State stands, all goe uncover'd, they honour his very shadow, they serve him upon the knee. The Preacher makes three profound reverences in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95159:62"/>
the Pulpit before he beginnes his Sermon. They pray for him five times in the publique Liturgy, and for his Queen, the Heir apparent, by name, with the rest of his children; which I beleeve is not done so often to any Christian Prince. Their fidelity, and affectionate Allegiance is also very remarkable, and may serve for a pattern to all subjects; when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by internunciall nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and secret practises did treat with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> that the one in <hi>England,</hi> the other in <hi>Ireland,</hi> should rise against Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the people were so eager in the cause, especially on the Sea side, that it is wonderfull how they flocked to all the Ports voluntarily of themselves, to prevent an Invasion, insomuch that there came a command to restrain such confluences of people, and that every one should retire home to his dwelling and business till there were occasion.</p>
            <p>When Prince <hi>Charles</hi> return'd from <hi>Spain</hi> in safety, what exultations of joy was in every corner of the Kingdome, specially in the great City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> what huge Bonefires, some of big massy timber, were up and down streets, which made them as lightsome in the night as if it had been noon; insomuch, as one said, the flames of the fires might be seen as far as <hi>Spain;</hi> what barrels of Beer, Ale, and Wine were brought out to drink carouses to his health?</p>
            <p>But most Illustrious Princes, in regard this Iland is so delicate a peece of Earth, I'le take her into parcels, and present her to your view. I will beginne with the <hi>Southernst</hi> part, with <hi>Cornwall,</hi> a Province which abounds with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of necessary commodities, whereof <hi>Spain</hi> hath every year a good share, being the nearest part of the Iland towards Her; here besides Gold and Silver, and Marble, there is great store of Tinne digg'd out, which is so pure and white, that it may passe for Silver when it is hammer'd into Vessells. This commodity is transported and dispers'd into all parts of the World, &amp; rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes made of it. Then they have a savory Fish call'd <hi>Pilchards,</hi> which <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> call <hi>Sardinas,</hi> which is found in incredible quantities in the Sea near that Coast; whereof there be huge Cargasars carried to <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> every year, and for barter they will give you Silke, Wine, Oyle, Cotton, and the best Commodities they have. About <hi>November</hi> this Fish is taken, and they shape the course of their Voyages so, that they may be in <hi>Spain</hi> &amp; <hi>Italie</hi> a little before <hi>Lent,</hi> which is the convenientest for their Market, because in those Catholick Countries, that season is observ'd so strictly. There is in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Cornwall</hi> a wonderfull thing, and it is a great famous Stone call'd <hi>Mainamber,</hi> a little distant from a small Market Town call'd <hi>Pensans.</hi> That stone though it be as bigg as a little Rock, and that a multitude of men cannot carry it away, yet you may stirre and move it sensibly with your little finger. Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> one of the 9. Worthies, was born there, who is so much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the World, and by such a number of Authors, among other things, for his round Table which was made of stone, about which a selected number of Chivalrous Kinghts were us'd to sit with him, and they had special Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Lawes made among themselves, which they were bound to observe punctually. Good Lord, what a <hi>Heroe</hi> was this <hi>Arthur,</hi> being an old <hi>Britain</hi> born! he overcame the <hi>Saxons</hi> in twelve several battells. In so much that an ingenious Poet sung of him thus.</p>

large, and wil go to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a most comodious and safe well frequented Port.

He gave part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> a new name, call'd new <hi>Albion.</hi> Among other prizes he tooke from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the Shippe <hi>Caga fuego</hi> was one, which had seventy pound weight of Gold in her, thirteen great Chests cramm'd with Patacoons, and a huge quantity of barrs and sowes of silver which serv'd for Ballast.

               <hi>Hampshire</hi> is remarkable for many things, specially for the pretty Port Town <hi>Southhampton,</hi> where King <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> did a memorable Act: for one day having many Parasits and Temporizers about him, who did magnifie his Power, and in a manner Idolize, by calling him Great Monarch of Land, of Sea, and men; The King listning unto them with silence upon the Sea-shore, caus'd his Chair of state to be brought thither, wherein being sate in Majesty upon the Sands, it being flowing water, he made a speech unto the Sea, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Tu meae ditionis es, &amp; Terra in qua sedeo mea est; nec fuit qui meo resisteret Imperio. Impero igitur tibi ne in Terram meam ascendas, nec vestes, nec membra Dominatoris tui madefacias. Mare verò de more conscendens Pedes Regis sine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia madefecit, Ille igitur resiliens ait, sciant omnes habitantes Orbem, vanam &amp; frivolam esse Regum potentiam, nec Regis quempiam nomine dignum praeter eum cujus nutui Caelum, Terram, Mare legibus obediunt aeternis: nec unquam postea co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronam sibi imposuit.</hi> O Sea thou belongst to my dominions, and the Earth whereon I sit is mine, nor hath there any yet resisted my commands unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I command thee therefore that thou come not up to my ground, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to wet the Vest, members of thy Lord. But the Sea still rising, began to bespatter and wet the Kings feet, which making him recoyl backward. He said again, <hi>Know yee all the Inhabitants of the Earth, that the power of Kings is vaine and frivolous, and none deserves the name of a King, but he at whose nod Heaven, Earth, and Sea obey his eternal Lawes.</hi> So <hi>Canutus</hi> would never wear the Crown again. <hi>Odia</hi> must not be pass'd over with silence, proud for a Royal Palace, where <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> King pass'd some part of his Captivity. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>English</hi> defended this place against <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> most couragiously for 15. daies. How many memorable things occur in <hi>Barkshire; Reading</hi> can shew the ashes of <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. and <hi>Matilda</hi> his Queen, Daughter to the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. This witty Epitaph is put upon Her.</p>

            <p>She was Daughter, Wife and Mother to three <hi>Henries.</hi> But the most stately Castle of <hi>Winsore</hi> deserves a kind of admiration; a most delicate and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Palace, which hath been the cradle and Sepulchre of many Kings. Among others; <hi>Edward</hi> the third (that thunderbolt of Warre) was born there, who to excite military vertue with splendor and rewards, erected a noble society of Knights call'd the Knights of Saint <hi>George;</hi> Whereinto many Emperors, Kings, and forren Princes held it a great honor to be coopted. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Surrey</hi> there be many Royal Palaces, there is <hi>Nonsuch</hi> house, where the amaenity and sweetnesse of the soyl and fite doth contend with the rare artifice and curiosity of the structure for priority.</p>
            <p>

            <p>I come now to <hi>Kent,</hi> a very noble portion of Great <hi>Britany,</hi> abounding with Pasturage, with Medowes and fields of extraordinary fatnesse and fertility; for any kind of cattle, though never so meager, do thrive when they come to feed on Kentish Grasse. This County is very plentiful for all sorts of fruit, specially for Cherries, and 'tis a pleasure to behold the Orchards when they are ripe. This delicate fruit was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Lucullus</hi> from <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 600. years after the founding of the City, and by the <hi>Romans</hi> brought to <hi>Britany,</hi> and 'tis remarkable how the vein of Earth and genius of that soyle doth agree with that fruit. This Noble County enjoyes greater priviledges then any other, for <hi>Kent</hi> was never conquer'd by the <hi>Norman,</hi> but by way of treaty; she conform'd upon such conditions: By her shores lie all the Arsenals, and Docks, where the royal Shipps are built. There is <hi>Canterbury</hi> an antient City, the Metropolitan seat of the Archbishop and primate of all <hi>England;</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:95159:64"/>
call'd by <hi>Urban</hi> the 2. the Patriarch of the other World. There stands <hi>Dover</hi> with a stupendous high Castle, which seems to menace <hi>France,</hi> that stands op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and in sight of it. We will leave <hi>Kent</hi> and go to the <hi>Severn,</hi> on whose banks the gentle City of <hi>Glocester,</hi> built first by <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> doth stand, with divers other very jolly rich Towns, as <hi>Worcester, Shrewsbury, Bridgnorth, Teuxbury;</hi> and that Noble River of <hi>Severn</hi> doth part <hi>England</hi> from the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Country of <hi>Wales.</hi> In so much that He, who is master of the <hi>Severn,</hi> may be said to be master of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. part of <hi>England</hi> in point of Power. I have a great mind now to come to <hi>Oxford,</hi> a little Earthly Paradise for situation, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrity of air, and sweetnesse of soyl, most daintily watered, and crested about with hills a convenient distance off; because she might have a freer respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the prime thing which graceth this delightful City, is, that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed University which is founded there: she is rank'd among the 4. principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies of <hi>Europe</hi> for antiquity, for number of Colledges, for large exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to students; for a Library they may compare with the <hi>Vatican.</hi> The story relates that in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, there were thirty thousand stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which did homage to the <hi>Muses.</hi> Hear what <hi>Lipsius</hi> saith, <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Oxoniense Collegium decem Belgica:</hi> One <hi>Oxford</hi> Colledge is worth ten <hi>Flemish. Richard</hi> the first, call'd the Lionhearted, for the vastnesse of his spirit, was born here, He who built the walls of <hi>Vienna</hi> at his Victorious return from <hi>Palestine:</hi> It is a great pleasure to passe from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> to see those numerous heards of sheep which graze there, and bear excellent Wooll. <hi>Bedfordshire</hi> among other things hath such large fieldes of Beanes and Pease, that it is a great delight to behold them, for they make the very air redolent, and perfume it with a kind of fragrancy. The County of <hi>Hartford</hi> hath all Commodities in it. <hi>Verolam</hi> stands there, famous for the Protomartyr of <hi>Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Saint <hi>Albons. Middlesex</hi> comes next, wherein there are many memorable places, but that which illustrates all the rest, and indeed the whole Iland, is the potent, and populous vast city of <hi>London, Englands</hi> Imperial Chamber; one of the greatest eyes of Christendom. There you have as proud, and as deep a Navigable River as ever made her bed between banks, you have an antient inexpugnable Tower, you have two exchanges, old and new, of most curious structure, you have the largest Hall at <hi>Westminster</hi> for tribunals of Justice of any in the World. The King hath divers Royal Palaces there: There is a Bridge of ninteen large high Arches over the rapid profound River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which would astonish you to behold, and indeed it may be called one of the wonders of the World, all circumstances considered; you have in the heart of the City, and the highest peece of ground, the antient Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> one of the stateliest piles of stone that ever was reard: this stately Temple is founded upon <hi>Faith;</hi> for underneath there is another subterranean Parish Church, which is a rarity that no other I know of hath through all the Christian World. There is <hi>Westward</hi> a large Abbey, the sight whereof would strike devotion into the beholder, and a most curious Chappel annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, call'd <hi>Henry</hi> the sevenths Chappel, which, as <hi>Leland</hi> saith, may be call'd <hi>Orbis miraculum.</hi> And judge you if <hi>London</hi> in the time of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror could send out forty thousand foot, and twenty thousand horse, as the Annals have it, how many would she be able to set forth now that she is more opulent, more peopled, and greater in all dimensions by the 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. part; for her Suburbs are of more extent then her self, so that some have compar'd her to a narrow crown'd hat with broad brimms. There are more parish Churches there then in <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> 122. There are divers Hospitals, both for Orphans, which come to above 600. and other poor people of both sexes above 1200. in so much that one may say that poverty is no where better hous'd and fed then there.</p>
            <p>I goe now from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Essex,</hi> a most fruitfull and well hedg'd Country: among other things she is famous for <hi>Iohn Hawknood,</hi> whom the <hi>Italians,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95159:64"/>
among whom he was so well known, call <hi>Aucutho;</hi> nor was he more known than honour'd by them; for in regard of the rare documents he gave for Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary discipline, the Senate of <hi>Florence</hi> rays'd a Statue and Tomb for him. There is old <hi>Walden</hi> in that Country, where excellent Saffron growes; there is <hi>Colchester,</hi> where the best Oysters are, and <hi>Dunmow,</hi> which hath the proverb for the best Bacon. I pass to <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a spritefull pleasant Country; and Doctor <hi>Despotino,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Physitian, affirm'd that the healthfullest air under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is that which moves over Saint <hi>Edmondsberry.</hi> That famous Navigator, Sir <hi>Thomas Cavendish,</hi> who sailed about the World, makes this Country famous for his Nativity there. <hi>Norfolk</hi> lies next, a County full of acute wits, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with Lawyers; <hi>Norwich</hi> is the Metropolis, a large City, and full of Artisans; for there are hardly found so many Loomes any where. Now comes in <hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> a self-sufficient County, where the antient Academy of <hi>Cambridge</hi> stands still flourishing with scientificall wits, and rare acute capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in all professions, in all faculties and knowledge, and reputed all the world over for a most learned University: and she must needs be so, being so near allyed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as to be her only Sister, and having such stately seats for the Muses, though the circumjacent soyl, and site on <hi>Camus</hi> banks be not so pleasant as that which stands on <hi>Isis. Huntingdonshire</hi> her neighbour is famous for rurall Philosophy; upon a time the Town of <hi>Gormonchester</hi> entertain'd the King, in a kinde of pomp, with ninescore Ploughs. <hi>Northampton</hi> is full of noble Townes, Villages, and Churches, whereof most are of a <hi>Danish</hi> built; for you shall behold at once in some places, thirty holy Pyramids or Steeples as you pass along, and the field cover'd all over with sheep. <hi>Leicestershire</hi> doth benefit all her neighbours, and warm them with her Cole-mines, which she distributes up and down. <hi>Lincoln</hi> was us'd to be a well devoted County; for in her chief Town there are half a hundred of Churches, wherof the Minster or Cathedrall Church is one of the most conspicuous and visiblest Church in the World. <hi>Notingham</hi> for delightfull prospects hath not her fellow; there you have true <hi>Troglodits,</hi> as on the Mountaines of the Moon in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that hew their houses out of Rocks. This Country is singular for Liquorish. <hi>Derby</hi> lies next, famous for the best Ale; on the West parts her bowels are pregnant with excellent lead, in somuch that the Chymists say that the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> who presides over Lead, is more benign to the English than to the French. <hi>Warwick</hi> excels for Fabrarian inventions, for Smiths work. <hi>Worcester</hi> for Salt-pits, and delicate Sider; for Pears and Apples grow there, as also in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> up and down the Hedges and Highwayes. Among other Fish which the <hi>Severn,</hi> which waters her soyl, doth afford, Salmon is one, and 'tis the best in the world, which the <hi>Romans</hi> confessed. The <hi>Trent,</hi> called so for thirty species of Fishes that shee breeds, doth make <hi>Staffordshire</hi> of extraordinary account; others will have that River called so, because that thirty other Rivers do pay her tribute, and disemboke into her. There is in this County a Lake of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable nature, that no beast will enter into, though pursued never so close by dogges; for they will rather dye than goe in: and as <hi>Necham</hi> hath it, this Lake is Prophetique; for when her waters roare, it is a presage of some ill.</p>

Then you have <hi>Pembrockshire,</hi> where there are many Families of the <hi>Flemish</hi> race, that were sent to colonize there by King <hi>Henry,</hi> for bridling of the <hi>Welsh.</hi> This Country is call'd <hi>little England beyond Wales,</hi> because the English tongue is so frequent among them: This County is also celebrous for <hi>Milford</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the most comodious and capacious Port in the world; for a thousand sayles of Ships may ride at Anchor there in severall Creeks, and one not in sight of the other; and from hence she takes her denomination. She hath also an ancient stately Temple at Saint <hi>Davids,</hi> call'd <hi>Menevia,</hi> the seat of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop in times past: it stands in a solitary by-corner of the whole Isle, a place fittest for contemplation, and for sequestring the spirits for holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of any upon the earth. Next is <hi>Cardiganshire,</hi> which hath the River <hi>Towy,</hi> that affords rare Salmon, which fish thirsting after fresh water, doth use to put himself in a circle, and by a naturall slight taking his tayle in his mouth, will spring and leap up three cubits high over Wears into the fresh water, whence he cannot goe back, as <hi>Ausonius</hi> hath very elegantly.</p>

There is <hi>Rippon</hi> Temple, famous for Saint <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frids</hi> Needle, which is a hole to try the chastity of woemen, and onely the honest can passe through it: There is <hi>Halifax,</hi> who hath a peculiar mode of punishment, which is an axe tied to a pulley, which falls down upon the neck of the Malefactor, and chops it off in a trice, and heretofore they were us'd to punish first, and examine the cause afterward.

            <p>This <hi>Northern</hi> Kingdome is fenc'd with the same salt ditch as <hi>England</hi> is. It is much longer then it is in latitude, in so much that there is never a house there that is much above twenty miles distant from the Sea. There is plenty of Fish, Foule and Flesh there. In <hi>Sutherland</hi> there are Mountaines that afford fair white Marble, and among the craggs of <hi>Craford</hi> there was a Gold Mine discover'd in the time of <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth.

There are cattle there in an incredible abundance; In so much that in one of the four Provinces alone, there were reckon'd there hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand head of cattle at one time. Bees do thrive and swarm there infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely in hollow trees up and downe, as well as in hives. They were Christians with the first, for Saint <hi>Patrik,</hi> a <hi>Britain</hi> born, did convert them, where he did many miracles. They so adore the memory of him, that it is a common saying among them, <hi>That if Christ had not been Christ when he was Christ, Saint</hi> Patrik <hi>had been Christ.</hi> Hereupon many famous men flourished in <hi>Ireland,</hi> both for sanctitie of the life and Doctrine, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastic history speakes of, as <hi>Caelius Sedulius</hi> the Priest, <hi>Columba, Colmannus, Aidanus, Gallus Kilianus, Maydulphus, Brendanus,</hi> and divers of a holy and austere Monastique life, who contemned the World, with the vanity and riches thereof. For it is recorded of <hi>Columbanus,</hi> who being offered great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by one of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>) if he would not depart the Country, (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> writes also of <hi>Thaddeus,</hi> he answer'd, <hi>non decere videlicet ut alienas divitias amplecterentur, qui Christi nomine suas dereliquissent,</hi> It was not fitting that any should embrace other mens riches, who for Christ's sake had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their own. Nay, it is recorded in good story, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> (now English) cross'd over those stormy Seas to the mart of learning, which was then famous in <hi>Ireland,</hi> so that you shall find it often mentioned in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Annalls, how such a one <hi>amandatus est in Hyberniam ad disciplinam,</hi> he was sent to <hi>Ireland</hi> to be taught, and in the life of <hi>Sulgenus,</hi> who lived neere upon 700. years since, these verses are found.</p>

It is wonderfull what huge confluences of birds do flutter about the shores of this Iland, as also of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which offuscate the broad face of Heaven sometimes, and likewise such huge shoales of Fish. A thousand things more might be spoken of these Ilands which are fitter for a <hi>Volume</hi> then a <hi>Panegyrical</hi> Oration.

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow, that I am to speak of the <hi>Britains,</hi> I will begin my Oration with that of <hi>Ausonius, Nemo bonus Britto est</hi>—No good man is a Britain, which ever since grew to be a Proverb. God forbid this should be verified of all, but I believe I shal rectify the judgment of those noble princes who spoak before me, that (as I observ'd when I so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd there) neither the Countrey of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> nor her Inhabitants are <hi>generally</hi> so good as they by their perswasive and powerfull Oratory would induce you to give credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For as the <hi>English</hi> sea is unfaithfull, and from <hi>Beerfleet</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> almost to the midst of the chanell is full of rocks and illfavourd ragged places (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in prince <hi>VVilliam,</hi> son to <hi>Henry</hi> the first, and Heir apparant to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> was cast away by shipwrack, together with his sister, and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble personages besides) so the nature of the <hi>Britains</hi> may be said to be full of craggs and shelfs of sands, that vertue cannot sayle safely among them without hazarding a wreck. <hi>England</hi> is not such a paradis, nor the <hi>Angli</hi> such <hi>Angeli</hi> (though styld so by a Popes mouth) which you make them to be, most Illustrious <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Ewbeswald.</hi> First, for the Countrey it self it is not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited, notwithstanding there be some Colonies of <hi>Walloons</hi> &amp; <hi>Hollanders</hi> among them. The earth doth witnes this, which wants culture, and the sea is a greater witnes that wants fishermen; Touching the first, it is a meere desert in some places, having no kind of agriculture, though she be capable of it; And for the other, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> make more benefit upon their coasts then they themselves, and which is a very reproachfull thing, they use to buy their own fish of them. 'Tis incredible how many hundreds of Busses they of <hi>Holland</hi> put forth every yeer, and what infinit benefit they make thereof. Therefore Gount <hi>Gondamar</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador had some reason to say, that the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> had a richer mine upon his coasts (meaning fishing) then his Master had, either at <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Peru,</hi> if he knew how to make right use of them; some of the <hi>Charibbi</hi> Ilands also, which the <hi>English</hi> have as <hi>Antego, Mevis,</hi> and others, which have not neer the number of men which should colonize them, shew the <hi>scarcity</hi> of the peeple of <hi>Britain,</hi> or which is worse, their <hi>sloth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, touching the Inhabitants of Great <hi>Britain</hi> 'tis well known, as the sea tumbleth perpetually about the Countrey, so their braines do fluctuat in their

noddles, which makes them so variable and unsteady; And herein they are little inferior to their next transmarin neighbours the <hi>French,</hi> only they use to come short of them in point of counsell and policy, wherein the <hi>French</hi> hath been too hard for them in all Treaties. But they exceed the <hi>French</hi> in superstitious kinds of vanities, specially, (as many writers brand them) with prophecies, and old <hi>Milesian</hi> tales, being very apt in arduous &amp; important businesses to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their belief to be transported that way; and as <hi>Tages</hi> was to the <hi>Hetrus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>

            <p>But in point of solid learning the <hi>English</hi> are much degenerated from what they were, they are grown more flashy, and superficiall, and nothing so pious as they us'd to be; where shall we find now among them a <hi>Winfred,</hi> an <hi>Alcuin,</hi> a <hi>Bede,</hi> men that converted whole Nations? Yet this must be imputed to their supinesse and sloth, rather then to decay of Nature in their intellectualls.

There cannot be found now among them such a woman as Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was, daughter to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, married to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the second, who first reform'd that wanton, unseemly fashion of riding astride on horseback. Their men of late yeers are arrand pirats; one of them, call'd captain <hi>Ward,</hi> did do Christendom one of the greatest mischiefs that ever was done, by teaching the Art of piracy, and a better way of building shipps to the picaroons of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis.</hi> They go roving abroad to other seas, when their <hi>own</hi> might find them work enough, if they would make use of the comodities they affoord. They are but dull for invention, whereas 'tis true they use to add something when they have seene a thing; For matter of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of cloth, and Kersies with other woollen stuffs, they were <hi>Flemmins</hi> that taught them first, as also all goldsmiths work, and argentry, with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Jewells. Add hereunto that it is the proper humor of the <hi>English</hi> to be arrogant, high minded and proud, yea in forren Countreys; where if they have a little language, they will keep such a magnifying of their own Iland, that it is fastidious to hear them. Nor of any other Nation can they agree among themselves when they are abroad, specially the Marchants, who are envious, and repine at one anothers profit; and so ready to cut one anothers throat. When the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was in <hi>Spain,</hi> thinking to have the <hi>Infanta</hi> for his wife, it was observ'd that the cariage of the <hi>English</hi> was very insolent there; for some of them being dieted in the Kings House, they would fall a vilifying the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> fare, extolling ever and anon the good beef of <hi>England;</hi> which was so much taken notice of, that it did much hurt to the treaty of the match.</p>
            <p>There is a saying, and 'tis a true one, That <hi>England</hi> may be call'd the <hi>Hell of Horses,</hi> the <hi>Purgatory of servánts, and the Paradis of Women.</hi> Touching the first, the <hi>English</hi> take a great pride in galloping, and post it on the high way, as if they were going for a ghostly father, a midwife, or a physician for one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally

sick, though indeed there be no cause of any hast at all; and then the poor beast is thrust into some cold corner, all in a water, where he commonly contracts some distemper. Then have you huge long Races, whereof there are many hundreds in <hi>England,</hi> wherein a poor sprightfull horse is rid off his legges, and made to spend his very lungs, having holes in his flank that will hide rowell and beame. And in this kinde of pastime, there is more cunning, and rooking then in Cardes and Dice, or any other sport. Then for their Carrs and Carts they are so unmeasurably loaden, that the track doth not only spoil the pavements of the streets and highwaies as they passe, but oftentimes it seems to break the very heart-strings of the poor passive animall; insomuch that of any Nation that holy Text is least observed by the English, <hi>A good man is mercifull to his beast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>Purgatory of Servants;</hi> for they live no where in so much sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: the poor Footman must keep pace with his Master when he gallops in Hunting, they are sent upon arrands forty, fifty miles a day. The Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, though Gentlemens sonnes of good extraction, sometimes are put to fetch tankards of water, carry coales, to sweep the gutters, and doe other as servile offices, as slaves doe in other Countries; and Servingmen must not offer to put on their hats, though it rain, or the weather be never so cold, standing before their Master; which makes me think on a facetious tale of a <hi>German</hi> Gentleman, who having entertain'd an English servant, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before him through a rough foard, where the horses stayed to drink, and the servant keeping his hat in his hand, though the winde blew hard, his Master smil'd upon him saying, <hi>Put on thy hat fool; for our horses drink no healths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say that <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>Paradise of Women:</hi> then it is either for the extraordinary respect the husbands bear them by permitting them to be alwayes at the upper end of the Table (whither their lightnesse carries them sometimes) or for their extraordinary beauty. To the first I have nothing to say; but for the second, 'tis true, they are moulded commonly of good flesh and blood, and have sanguine clear complexions, but they are withall fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and dull, and many thousands of them are so massie and big, that they seem men rather than women, unlesse they were distinguished by their clothes.</p>
            <p>Now touching the haughtinesse of minde that is naturall in the English, there is one notable example in the person of <hi>Nicolas Breakspeare,</hi> born at <hi>Langley</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> who, being elevated to the Popedome by the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, came to such a height of arrogance, that he rebuked the Emperour for writing his name before him in a certain Instrument. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hold the stirrup while that <hi>Adrian</hi> mounted, he took hold of the wrong; but a little flie cur'd in him this humour of pride, who getting into his throat choakt him, and so made him low enough. With such a spirit of pride was <hi>Thomas Wolsey</hi> possessed, who was at once Chancellor, Archbishop, and Cardinall, though a Butchers Son of <hi>Ipswich</hi> by blood. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift in his Letters subscrib'd himself his <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Cosen;</hi> for indeed he had a designe for the advantage of his affairs, as they stood then, to advance him to the Popedom after the decease of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth; but when the Emperour had exalted <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the sixth, a Brewers sonne, his Tutor, in lieu of the Butcher his Cosen, to the Chair, and having denied him also the Archbishoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he grew so implacable to the Emperour, that he set all wheeles a going to make both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to bandy against him. He therefore began to whisper some surmises into <hi>Henry</hi>'s eare touching <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> his Queen, <hi>VVhether the match was consonant to the holy Scriptures, she having been his eldest brothers wife before;</hi> and he raised this doubt the rather, because the said Queen had miscarried so often in Childbirth of Male Princes. The Cardinal knowing his Masters humor, might well think that this would make impressions within
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95159:70"/>
him, and so recommended unto him the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Sister to the King of <hi>France;</hi> but when this scruple was thrust into the Kings thoughts, and that a Divorce was procurable, he did not look towards <hi>France,</hi> but he cast his eyes upon <hi>Anne,</hi> daughter to Sir <hi>Thomas Bolen,</hi> having no regard to Majesty, but beauty and lust. This cool'd <hi>Wolsey</hi> from negotiating the said Divorce, and made him spinne out the time by tergiversations and delayes; which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster perceiving, his favour began to decline towards him, and so he died, some say, out of apprehension of grief, others say by poyson. This <hi>Wolsey</hi> was a man of a notable high spirit, and vast designes, and among other passages which discovered it, one was, that having built a Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he put his own Armes before the Kings, with this <hi>Motto, Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> I and my King: which, as one wittily said, might be true by the rule of Grammar, which tels us that the first person is more worthy than the third, but the Moral rule tels us otherwise. He had such a splendid magnificent Family, than an Earl, nine Barons, and I cannot tell how many Knights and Squires, with near upon four hundred were his domestique servants; there were all likewise choice personable men whom he entertain'd, so that after his fall, divers of them came to be the Kings servants.</p>
            <p>After Pride comes in the Lust and Luxury of the English; It stands upon good record how Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> writ to King <hi>Etheobald</hi> in these words, <hi>Gentes Anglorum spretis legalibus connubiis adulterando &amp; luxuriando ad instar Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticae gentis faedam vitam ducere;</hi> The English Nation forsook their lawfull Wives, and like a Sodomiticall people spent their lives in Adultery and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury. There was one of the <hi>Henries</hi> left thirteen Bastards behinde him, as some write; and it was more than probable that <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bolen</hi> (who was call'd in <hi>France, La Mule du Roy, &amp; l'haquenée d'Angleterre,</hi> The Kings Mule, and the English hackney) I say, according to some Writers, it was more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that she was both Daughter and Wife to the eighth <hi>Henry:</hi> Among others, one inference was, that when Sir <hi>Francis Brian,</hi> who was a facetious Knight, asked the King what it was to lie with the Daughter and the Mother, <hi>It was no more,</hi> said he, <hi>than to eat the hen first, and the chicken after.</hi> This King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried six several Wives, whereof the second and the fift he chopt off their heads with an Axe; the first and fourth he repudiated; the third was destroyed in childbearing; the sixt he left behind him. This was that mercilesse Prince who sign'd a Warrant for beheading some Noblemen upon his very death-bed, and being much troubled in conscience, as he was taking his farewell of the world, the last word he breathed out to the Bishop by him, was, <hi>All is lost, all is lost,</hi> and so expir'd, to go before the Tribunall of Heaven to give account of his life, wherein he had confessed before, that <hi>He had never spar'd man in his rage, nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you say that the English are strenuous and stout: they might be such in former ages, but now they are much degenerated, their warrs are now in Tap-houses and Tobacco-shops; for since <hi>Drake</hi> brought that inchanting <hi>Nicotian</hi> Drugge from the <hi>Indies</hi> against crudities and rheums, the use thereof is so frequent in <hi>England,</hi> that it is incredible; the very Impost of that Indian smoak alone amounting to more than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> received in custom for all commodities whatsoever. In <hi>Ireland</hi> also this Weed is taken excessively in sneezing, which the Husbandman at the Plough-taile, and the servant mayd at the washing block doe use to suck into their nostrils to beget new spirits in them when they are tyr'd with labour. King <hi>Iames</hi> was a great enemy to this smoak, and when he was a Hunting if any fogge or mist would rise up to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his sport, he would swear that <hi>Belzebub was then taking Tobacco;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once surprised with a great showre of rain, and forced to goe to a Pigstie for shelter, he caused a pipe of Tobacco to be taken, that one stink, as extremes use to doe, might drive out another. Moreover since the English have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to have <hi>Beer</hi> for their beverage so much, not using so universally
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95159:70"/>
the old drink of <hi>England,</hi> which is <hi>Ale;</hi> the Hop by its inflammation hath made them more subject to diseases, fill'd them with gravell, and so troubled them with the Stone, Strangury, and Coliques. These with drinking such sophisticated Wines, hath much enervated the English Nation in point of strength, which in former times was such, that they could draw an arrow of an Ell long, and make the Gray-goose-wing fly through the heart of <hi>France.</hi> And now that I speak of Wine, it is so adulterated in <hi>England,</hi> that it drinks in some places like a Potion; and I beleeve as many dye there by drinking bad Wines, as of any other disease; for indeed all Vintners are Brewers in <hi>England,</hi> they mixe <hi>French</hi> Wines with Syder, the <hi>Spanish</hi> with milk, and feed other Wines with flesh very frequently.</p>
            <p>Now for the Valour of the English in <hi>France,</hi> whereof the noble Baron hath spoken so much, they were very valiant indeed, when a silly Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, <hi>Anne d' Arc</hi> did beat them away from before <hi>Orleans,</hi> pursued them to <hi>Paris,</hi> and so drive them over the <hi>Seine</hi> to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and when they could not be reveng'd of this Mayd in the Field, being taken by a Stratageme, they cut her off by a forged accusation, that she was a Sorceresse forsooth. Then was the time, if the English had comported themselves like men of prowesse and policy, to have reduc'd all <hi>France</hi> under a perpetuall subjection, <hi>King Charles</hi> the seventh being driven to such streights, that he was constrain'd to fly to <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and so for the time was in a jeering way call'd King of <hi>Berry.</hi> But that notable mayd at her execution being tied to the stake was nothing daunted, but left prosperity and victory for a legacy to her Countrey men, till the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> should be beaten quite out of <hi>France,</hi> as they were afterwards; for being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and dogg'd as far as <hi>Calais,</hi> they kept that a while, but afterwards they were by a writ of ejectment publish'd by sound of drum and trumpet, as also by the Canon &amp; Musket of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> thrust out of <hi>Calais,</hi> and so casheer'd quite out of <hi>France;</hi> which sunck so deep, and made such black impressions of sorrow upon the heart of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that she would often say, if <hi>she were open'd after death, the town of Calais would be found Engraven in her heart.</hi> Now for the piety, goodnes and vertu of the <hi>English,</hi> which the noble <hi>Baron</hi> did so much magnifie, you may judge what it was in those dayes by the ingenuous confession of an <hi>English</hi> Captain, who when he had truss'd up his bagg and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to go for <hi>England,</hi> as he was going out of the gate he in a geering way was ask'd, <hi>O Englishmen, when will you back again to France?</hi> The Captain with a sad serious countenance answer'd, <hi>When the sinns of France are greater then the sinns of England, then will the English return to France.</hi> Nor indeed had the <hi>French</hi> much cause to affect the <hi>English,</hi> in regard of their insolence and cruelty, wherof there be divers examples: for in some good successes they had, the <hi>victory</hi> was more bloody then the <hi>battaill,</hi> cutting of prisoners off in cold blood for their greater security. But the <hi>English</hi> must needs be cruell in a Forren Countrey, when they use to be so in their own. What a barbarous act was that of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, to clapp up his own brother, <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> in prison, and afterwards to drown him in a butt of <hi>Muscadin,</hi> by a new invention of death. But to descend to neerer times, what an act of immanity and ignoblenes was that in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when she promis'd safety &amp; welcom to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotts,</hi> and Dowager of <hi>France,</hi> if she came to <hi>England,</hi> for preventing the machinations of her rebellious subjects against her, and afterwards to suffer her to be hurried from one prison to another for twenty yeares, and then to suffer her head to be chop'd off, and by a cunning kind of dissimulation to lay the fault upon <hi>Davison</hi> her secretary, and throw the bloud into his face, under pretence that he sent the warrant for her execution without her knowledge? Truly this was a most inglorious act, and the reproach of it will never be worn out, but will stick as a black spot to <hi>England</hi> while she is an <hi>Iland,</hi> nor can all the water of the Sea about her wash off the stain, but it wil continue still indelible. But 'tis the more strange, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should doe this, a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95159:71"/>
Queen that had been herself bred up a good while in the school of affliction, and might be said to have come from the <hi>Scaffold</hi> to the <hi>Throne,</hi> I say 'tis strange that she should not be more sensible of anothers calamity. <hi>Dido</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Queen out of a sweet tendernes could say, <hi>Non ignara mali miseris succur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere disco,</hi> and it had more becom'd Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to have said so, being a Christian Queen. That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should do this to her own Cosen, and sister Queen, one as good as herself, who after an invitation to <hi>England</hi> would never suffer her to have the comfort of her presence all the while; That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who was cryed up and down the world to be so just, so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, so full of clemency should do this, it doth aggravat the fact much more then if another had done it. I must confesse she lost much repute abroad for it; Satyres, pasquills, and invectives being made in every corner of Christendom: among others I will recite unto you one that was belch'd out in <hi>France,</hi> which was thus,</p>

            <p>Among other Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> the example of this Queen and her Father may serve to verifie the saying of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> which you alledg'd, most noble Baron, <hi>Britannia fertilis Provincia Tyrannorum;</hi> That Great Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is a province fruitfull for Tyrants. Now <hi>Nimrod</hi> was call'd the <hi>Robustus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi> the strong Hunter, which the Divines do interpret to be a mighty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; And certainly the chasing and hunting of beasts, the killing of them, the washing of the Kings hands in their blood, and feasting with them afterwards, must needs make the minds of princes more ferocious, and lesse inclinable to clemency; wherefore they have a wholsom law in <hi>England,</hi> that no Butcher who is habituated to blood may be capable to be a Juryman to give verdit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any mans life. The Nobles of <hi>England</hi> may in some kind be call'd Carnificers of some sorts of beasts, as the buck, and the doe; with other such poor harmeles creatures, whereof some have no gall in them: for having wounded them first, and then worried them down with their doggs, at last as a signall of victory they bath their fingers in the blood of the poor animall, which they call to <hi>take the essay;</hi> but certainly this must conduce to obdurat human hearts, and as it were flesh them in blood. Now 'tis well known there are no Kings on earth such great hunters as the <hi>English,</hi> and who have more of variety of sport in that kind then any, for there are more Forests, Chaces, and Parks (besides va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Royall palaces) annexed to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> then to any other of <hi>Europe,</hi> which might make the Countrey far more copious of corn, fuller of cattle, and have fewer beggars, if they were made arable grounds, or turn'd to pasturage. Moreover the <hi>English</hi> Kings may not improperly be call'd <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods,</hi> as <hi>Bodin</hi> hath it herein, considering what rigorous punishments use to be inflicted upon the poor peeple, by vertu of the <hi>Forest</hi> lawes. In the book call'd <hi>Liber Rufus,</hi> there was one law enacted in <hi>Canutus</hi> time, <hi>Omnis homo abstineat a Venerijs meis super poenam vitae,</hi> Upon pain of life let every man refrain from my deer and my hunting places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swainmote</hi> Courts have harsh punishments and amercements, and for the poor Husbandman ther's no remedy for him against the Kings dear, though they lye all night in his corn, and spoile it; <hi>Sarisburiensis,</hi> a reverend and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Author, comprehends all this in a few words, when he speaks of the

            <p>But the <hi>English</hi> tyranny doth not terminat onely in the King, but it difuseth it selfe further among the Nobles; In so much that as <hi>Camden</hi> relates there were in King <hi>Stephens</hi> raigne as many tyrants in <hi>England</hi> as there were Castellans, or Governors of Castles; <hi>Stephani Regis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus tot erant in Anglia tyranni, quot Castellorum Domini;</hi> Who arrogated to themselves regall rights and prerogatives, as coyning of money, marshall law, and the like; For now, there is no Kingdom on earth (<hi>Naples</hi> excepted) where there have been more frequent insurrections then in <hi>England:</hi> for as the Kings have been noted to be Tyrants, so the subjects are branded for devills. In the Civill warrs that happen'd in <hi>Comines</hi> time there were above fourescore that were slain by the fortune of war, and otherwise, of the blood Royall, besides the Kings themselves that perish'd; Whereupon when the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> heard of the fatall sentence that was pronounc'd against her, with an intrepid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted heart she said, as an Author of credit hath it, <hi>Angli in suos Reges sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde caedibus saevierunt, ut neutiquam novum sit si etiam in me ex eorum sanguine natam itidem saevierint,</hi> If the <hi>English</hi> have been often so cruell in the slaughter of their own Kings, it is no new thing then, that they have grown so cruell to me that am descended of their blood. What a horrid and destructive conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was that subterranean plot of the Gunpowder Treason? so bloody a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe no age can parallell. It was like the wish of <hi>Caligula,</hi> who wish'd the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> had had but one neck, that he might cut it off at one blow; He had it onely in wish, but these had a reall attempt to blow up not onely the blood Royall, but all the Nobility and chief Gentry of the Kingdom: And <hi>Guido Faux</hi> who was to set fire to the powder, did shew so little sign of feare and repentance, that he boldly said, <hi>It was none but the great Devill of Hell who had discovered the plot, and hindred him from the execution of it; that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty had no hand in the discovery and prevention of that meritorious work,</hi> Which if it had taken effect, one of the Conspirators sayd, <hi>it would have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all the sins of his whole life, had he liv'd a thousand yeers after.</hi>

            <p>And whereas, my Noble Baron, you travelled in your highstrain'd and smooth Oration through all the Shires of <hi>England,</hi> and pointed at some things extraordinary in every one of them; you shall find that they have as many <hi>blemishes</hi> as they have <hi>blessings.</hi> When you extoll the Province of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> so much, you should also have made mention of their Pyrrhocora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, their Sea-theeves and Pirates, which are so thick as choughes among them. And whereas you magnifie <hi>Drake</hi> so much, he was no better then a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95159:72"/>
or a Skimmer of the Seas, and an Archpyrate, who, notwithstanding there was an Ambassador here resident from <hi>Spain,</hi> and a firm peace twixt the two Crownes; yet was he permitted to steal and robb by land as well as by Sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the subjects of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Nor did he exercise cruelty on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> only, but upon his own Countrymen; as for example, when he landed at Port <hi>San Iulian,</hi> and finding a Gallowes there, set up by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan,</hi> he hang'd up by his own power a gentleman better then himself, which was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Doughty,</hi> meerly out of envy, because he might not partake of the honor of his Expeditions. You praise <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> especially, about which there growes nothing but thin Oates, and eares without grains in many places; but you should have remembred, that whereas <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of that City had married <hi>Edward</hi> the fourths Sister, yet in tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered raggs, and barefooted, he was forc'd to begge his bread up and down in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Whereas you speak also of <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> you should have call'd to mind the tyranny of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, against <hi>de Linde,</hi> for killing one of his Dear, which was made a Hart in <hi>White Forrest;</hi> for which he was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amerc'd in a great sum of money, but the Tenants of those Gentlemen that hunted with him were condemn'd to pay every year such a tax call'd <hi>White heart Silver,</hi> every year to the Exchequer. You passe also over <hi>Portland,</hi> a poor naked Iland without Woods or any kind of Fuel, but the ordure of beasts, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they use for fyring. For <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> what huge tracts of wast grounds are found there up and down without Inhabitants, which makes it so subject to theeves and Robbers? Touching <hi>Hampshire,</hi> what a large act of sacriledge did King <hi>William</hi> commit there, by demolishing divers Churches, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Glebes from God and men the space of thirty miles and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, making it a wild Forrest, to plant and people the Country with bruite beasts useful only for his hunting, venery and pleasure. But the judgements of Heaven fell visibly upon his Children; for <hi>Richard</hi> his second Son died of a Pestilential air in the same Forest. <hi>William Rufus,</hi> another Son of his, succeeding him in the Kingdome, was kill'd there also by the glance of an arrow from Sir <hi>Walter Terrell: Henry</hi> also his Granchild, Sonne to <hi>Robert</hi> his first begotten, breath'd his last there like <hi>Absolon,</hi> hanging at a bow while he was a hunting. 'Tis true that <hi>Barkshire</hi> hath one goodly structure, which is <hi>Winsor</hi> Castle; but most of the Country about is inhabited by savage beasts, who may be said to live better then the people thereabouts. For <hi>Surrey,</hi> you should have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what a perfidious act <hi>Godwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> perform'd at <hi>Guilford;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying to <hi>Harald</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> a young Prince, that was sent from <hi>Normandy</hi> to receive the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> was delivered to <hi>Harald</hi> the <hi>Dane. Sussex</hi> is infamous for the murther of King <hi>Sigebert</hi> by a Swineheard. And the Province of <hi>Kent</hi> will never wash away the foul stain she received for the sacrilegious murther of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> a Saintlike man; which assassinate was perpetrated in the very Church near the high Altar: for which crying and flagitious deed, they say, that the race of the murtherers have ever have since a white tuffe of hair in their heads, and the wind blowing in their faces whersoever they go. For <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> her inhabitants there are worthy of reproach, that by idlenesse and ignorance they would suffer the Vineyards there to decay ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and in lieu of Wine be content with windy Sider. In <hi>Oxfordshire</hi> was that lustful Labarynth made at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> the second kept <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> his Concubine, whom the revengful Queen poysoned. Now touching the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Metropolis of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> she may be well call'd a Monster, for she being the head, bears no proportion with the rest of the body, but is farre too bigge for it, and might serve a Kingdom thrice as bigge; but what Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> spoake of <hi>Constantinople, Eam nuditate omnium civitatum constructam fuisse,</hi> that she was made up of the nakednesse (and ruine) of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, so may <hi>London</hi> be said to grow rich out of the poverty of other Towns. She is like the <hi>Spleen</hi> in the natural body, by whose swelling the rest
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95159:72"/>
of the members pine away. And herein let me observe the poor policy of the fatheaded English, who suffer this one Town to be pamperd up, while other places though situated in as convenient places for Navigation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ready to starve for want of trade. 'Tis true that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> his Son, did put forth Proclamations for restraint of building in <hi>London,</hi> and that all the gentry should retire to their Country dwellings in the Vacation time, and at <hi>Christmas;</hi> but these Proclamations were like a fire put under a green wood, which did flash a little, but suffer'd presently to go again; so those Royal Proclamations were put in hot execution for a while, yet they quickly grew cold again. But indeed such is the crossgrain'd and contumacious perverse nature of the Londoners, specially the schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part, that they suspect, or repine at any new command that comes from authority. For whereas there was a secure and comely durable way of structure inordred them, that every one should build for the future with stone or brick, and not with lath and wood; and that they should build regularly for the beauty, prospect and evennesse of the streets, as also that the Houses might not be subject to firing; Yet this obstinate selfwitted people do stand still in their own light, and fall againe to build with lath and lime, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that they know well enough the great advantages that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the City by the other mode of Edifice: In so much that in <hi>England</hi> ther's not near that Elegance of building generally as in other Cities, nor are their streetes so streight and lightsome; by reason the Houses paunch out, and are not so uniform as else where.</p>
            <p>I could condescend to the praises you give of <hi>Essex</hi> &amp; <hi>Suffolk,</hi> were it not that in the one, at Saint <hi>Edmunds Berry,</hi> there have happened so many popular tumults twixt the Monks and Citizens. And were it not for a sordid tenure that lands are held by them of <hi>Hemingstone,</hi> where <hi>Baldwin</hi> call'd <hi>le Petteur,</hi> held lands from the Crown by <hi>sarieanty, pro quibus debuit Die Natali Domini singulis annis coram Domino Rege Angliae unum saltum, unum suflatum &amp; unum bumbulum,</hi> for which lands he was to pay one leap, one puff, and one crack of the taile, before the King upon <hi>Christmas</hi> day, every yeare under paine of forfeiting his Tenure! O brave Knight service! O Noble homage! O brave devotion upon the birth day of <hi>Christ.</hi>

            <p>Touching the <hi>Norfolk</hi> men, they are naturally wranglers and Cavillers. The Fenny situation of <hi>Cambridge</hi> is such, that I cannot wonder sufficiently how that place should be chosen out to be made a seat for the Muses. <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtonshire</hi> Countrymen have such a rustiquenesse, that hardly admits any civility. <hi>Northhampton,</hi> and <hi>Leicestershire</hi> are so bald, that you can hardly see a tree as you passe through them. The people of <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> are infested with the affrightments of <hi>Crowlands</hi> Daemonical spirits. <hi>Notinghamshire</hi> doth delude the labour of the husbandman with the <hi>Sandinesse</hi> of their soyl. God deliver us from the Devills Posteriors at the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Darbishire; War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wik</hi> is choaked up with wood, there, as well as in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi>

            <p>I should like <hi>Worcester</hi> but for cold flatulent Perry. <hi>Stafford</hi> relates many odde fables of her Lake, and the River of <hi>Trent.</hi> In <hi>Shropshire</hi> the sweating sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse took its first rise, which dispers'd it self not onely all <hi>England</hi> over, but cross'd the Seas, found out and infested English bodies in other Regions. <hi>Chest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> complaines for want of corn to make her bread. In <hi>Herefordshire</hi> there are walking Mountains; for in the year 1571. about 6. of the clock in the evening, there was a hill with a Rock underneath, did rise up as if she were awaken
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95159:73"/>
out of a long sleep, and changing her old bed, did remove herself to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place, carrying with her trees, and folds of sheep, she left a gap behinde of forty foot broad, and eighty ells long, the whole peece of earth was above twenty Acres, and the motion lasted above a natural day, that the sayd Moantain was in travell. <hi>Radnor</hi> with her crags would frighten one; for the rest of <hi>Wales,</hi> though the inhabitants be courteous and antient, yet the country swels with such a conglobation of Mountains, that strangers would be hardly invited to visit her; which Mountaines in some places are so high, and yet so near one to another, that Shepheards may talk one to another from the tops of them, and not be able to meet one another in a whole day, by traversing from one Mountain to the other, through the valley, and precipices under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</p>
            <p>Touching the large Province of <hi>York,</hi> whereas you averre that <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Mother <hi>Helen</hi> were <hi>Britaines,</hi> and born there, <hi>Nicephorus</hi> makes a question of it, and would have them to be of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> Towards <hi>Richmond</hi> there are such squalid uncouth places, and horrid Mountaines, that the English themselves call them the <hi>Northern Alpes,</hi> and there be such roaring streames of water which rush out of them, that the inhabitants name them <hi>Hell-becks,</hi> that is, Infernal, or Stygian Rivers.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Scotland,</hi> Good Lord what a pittifull poor Country is it! It were no petty kinde of punishment to be banisht thither, for it is a Country onely for those to dwell in that want a Country, and have no part of the earth besides to dwell upon. In some parts the soyl is such, that it turns trees to stones, and wheat to oats; apples to crabbs, and melons to pumpions. In some places as you pass along, you shall see neither bird in the aire, nor beast on the earth, or worm creeping on the ground, nor scarce any vegetall, but a black gorsie soyl, a raw rheumatique air, or some craggy and squalid wild disconselate hils: And touching Woods, Groves, or Trees, as <hi>Stephen</hi> might have scap'd stoning in <hi>Holland</hi> for want of stones, so if <hi>Iudas</hi> had betrayed Christ in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he might (as one sayd) have repented before he could have found out a tree to have hang'd himself upon. And most noble Auditors, you may make easie conjectures of the poverty of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the demeans of the Crown, which scarce amount to a hundred thousand Dollars a year, which you know is the ordinary Income of a <hi>German</hi> Prince, and this both <hi>Boterus</hi> and <hi>Bodin</hi> do testifie, who were Eagle-ey'd Inspectors into the Revenues of all Kingdomes and States. And the answer which the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> made Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> when she reprehended him for his presumption to marry the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> doth verifie this; <hi>Madam,</hi> said he, <hi>it is no great presumption in me to attempt this, for my Revenues are not much inferiour to the King of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. This induced the Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to give King <hi>Iames,</hi> her Godsonne, and Successor, a Pension every year. Nor were the Revenues of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> any thing considerable, till of late years that Trade began to encrease so infinitely, and consequently the Customes, with Suits in Law since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molition of Abbeyes, and the alienation of Church-Lands to the Crowne with the First-fruits, Fines, and other perquisites by Offices, and Courts of, Justice, I say before these additions to the Crown, the Revenue of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was but very contemptible in comparison of other Princes. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse indeed that in these late Wars, the Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Strength thereof, hath wonderfully appear'd; for I believe on both sides there hath been above two hundred Millions consum'd. And there is now coming into this new Republique, I beleeve, above twelve Millions of Crownes every year. And for her Strength, one may say, <hi>England</hi> was like a Horse, she knew not her own strength till now; for who would have thought that <hi>England</hi> could have put forth a hundred thousand foot, and forty thousand horse, all arm'd, besides her power at Sea? I say, who could have thought it?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95159:73"/>
Yet there were so many in number at least, betwixt King and Parliament at one time.</p>
            <p>But to reflect again upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Country is pittifully barren, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that <hi>long Keale</hi> and <hi>short Keale,</hi> which is a kind of Cabbidge, that they can dress twenty sorts of wayes, is one of their principall food, besides fish, and some odde fowle, as the <hi>Solan Goose,</hi> which is their greatest <hi>Regalo,</hi> yet the Eater must stop his nose when he takes a bit into his mouth, the smell is so rank and strong. I say, as the Country is so steril, so is the people sordid, and subject to vermine. Good Lord what nasty little huts, and holes shall you finde there up and down; what dirty courts, and stables above the anckle deep cramm'd with dung. The sight of an ordinary <hi>Scots</hi> woman is a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Lust; for they are as big as Cows in the middle: Nature seems to make no distinction there between the two sexes, but the women commonly are as bigge limb'd as the men. These short commons at home drive the men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abroad to seek their fortunes in <hi>Swethland, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> where they are in such multitudes, that in case of necessity, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> might put in the field thirty thousand <hi>Scots</hi> Pedlars, though they passe by the name of Merchants; for if one can come up to a horse and a pair of panniers, he presently assumes that name unto him. Now, though abroad the <hi>Scots</hi> are kept under a strict discipline that they cannot steal, yet at home they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table theeves, and indeed the <hi>Caledonians</hi> were ever so to a proverb, they goe now under the names of Mossetroupers.

            <p>For the Learning of the <hi>Scots,</hi> once in an age haply they produce a Wit, but tentimes they prove pestiferous; witness <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knocks,</hi> which two villaines were <hi>fratres in malum,</hi> what a world of troubles have they rais'd? what a distraction did they bring on mens braines? what proud rascals were they in their own conceit? how they would vapour and raunt (an humor that is more the <hi>Scotchmans</hi> own than any) nay what a malitious and ingratefull monster was one of them?

            <p>I will now by the continuance of the sweet gale of your Noble favours cross over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> another rough hewn Country, and crosse graind peope too; and indeed the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> are originally but birds of one feather, the same tongue being maternal to both. Yet for the soyl and the climes, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> much exceeds <hi>Scotland;</hi> Nevertheless, the Country is full of boggs, of squalid and unfrequented places, of loughs and rude Fenns, of huge craggs and stony fruitlesse hills; the air is rhumatique, and the Inhabitants odiously nasty, sluggish and lowsie. Nay, some of them are Pagans to this day, and worship the new moon, for the kerns will pray unto her, that she would be pleas'd to leave them in as good health as she found them. For all the paines the English have taken to civilize them, yet they have many savage customes among them to this day; they plow their ground by tying their tacklings to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Et quanquam omnes lupi &amp; Oves nullae, stetit in medio luporum pastor intrepidus, omnimodo argumentosus quomodo faceret oves de lupis. Malachias,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Barnard,</hi> in the 33. year of his age, was consecrated Bishop of <hi>Conereth,</hi> but when he began to officiate, and to exercise his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly function, he found that he had to deal with beasts rather then with men, for he never met with the like among any <hi>Barbarians,</hi> He never found any so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docil for manners, so savage in customes, so impious in their faith, so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in their lawes, so stiffnecked for discipline, so sordid in their carriage. They were Christians in name, but Pagans in deed. There were none found that would pay tiths or first fruits, that would confine themselves to lawfull wedlock, that would confesse, or doe any acts of penitence: For there were very few Ministers of the altar, and those few did live licentiously among the Laiques; Neither the voice of the Preacher or singing man was heard in the Church: Now, what should the Champion of God do? He must recede with shame, or strive with danger, but knowing that he was a true Pastor and not a hireling, he chose to stay rather then flye, being ready to sacrifice his life for his sheep. And though they were all Wolfs, and no sheep, yet the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful shepheard stood fearlesse in the midst of them, debating with himself how he might turn them from Wolfes to sheep.</p>
            <p>It seems this holy Father <hi>S. Bernard</hi> was well acquainted with <hi>Ireland</hi> by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95159:75"/>
this relation; for ther's no Countrey so wolvish: they are in up and down heards in some places, and devoure multitudes not only of cattle but men. In deed of late yeers <hi>Ireland,</hi> I must confesse, was much improv'd both in point of civility as also in wealth and commerce; Their mud cottages up and down, specially in <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Court was, turnd to fair brick or free-stone-houses; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was made to stand upon her own leggs, and not onely to pay the standing <hi>English</hi> army which was there, and us'd to be payd out of the Exchequer at <hi>Westminster,</hi> but to maintain the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> with all the Officers besides of her self, and to affoord the King of <hi>England</hi> a considerable revenu every yeer; and this was done by the management and activity of the last Lord Deputy, after whose arrivall the Countrey did thrive wonderfully in traffic (which is the great artery of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>land) and in all bravery besides. In so much that the Court of <hi>Dublin</hi> in point of splendidnes might compare with that of <hi>England;</hi> But that refractory haf-witted peeple did not know when they were well.</p>
            <p>But now I will leave the <hi>Irish</hi> to his <hi>Bony clabber,</hi> and the <hi>Scot</hi> to his long <hi>Keall,</hi> and short <hi>Keall,</hi> being loth to make your eares do penance in listning to so harsh discourses. Therefore to conclude, most noble Princes, I conceave it a high presumption in Great <hi>Britain</hi> to stand for the principality of <hi>Europe,</hi> considering how many inconveniences attend her: for first though she be most of all potent at sea, yet she cannot set a ship under sayle in perfect equipage without the help of other Countreys, she hath her cordage, pitch and tarr, she hath her masts, and brasse Canons from abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely she hath indeed incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Oke, and knee timber of her own; she abounds 'tis true with many commodities, but they are rustic and coorse things in comparison of other Kingdoms, who have <hi>silk</hi> for her wooll, <hi>wine</hi> for her <hi>beer, gold</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> for <hi>lead</hi> and <hi>tinne.</hi> For arts and sciences, for invention, and all kind of civilities she hath it from the Continent; Nay the language she speaks, her very accents and words she borroweth els where, being but a dialect of ours. She hath a vast quantity of wast grounds, she hath barren, bad mountains, uncouth uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable heaths, she hath many places subject to Agues and diseases, witnes your <hi>Kentish</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi> Agues; what a base jeer, as their own Poet <hi>Skelton</hi> hath it, have other Nations of the <hi>English,</hi> by calling them <hi>Stert men</hi> with long tailes, according to the verse,</p>
            <q>Anglicus a tergo caudam gerit, ergo caveto.</q>
            <p>What huge proportions of good ground lieth untill'd in regard of the sloth of her Inhabitants? she suffers her neighbours to eat her out of trade in her own commodities, she buyeth her own fish of them, They carry away her gammons of bacon, and by their art having made it harder and blacker, they sell it her againe for <hi>Westphalia,</hi> at thrice the rate; she hath affronted, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sond, deposd, and destroyd many of her Kings; of late yeers she hath been baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> she made a dishonorable return from <hi>Cales,</hi> she was fowly beaten at the Ile of <hi>Rè,</hi> the small handfulls of men she sent hither to <hi>Germany,</hi> in the behalfe of the Daughter of <hi>England,</hi> did her more discredit then honor. And her two lasts Kings were overreach'd in the Treaty touching the match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the restitution of the Palatinate. She hath been a long time in a declining condition; her common people are grown <hi>insolent,</hi> her Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity degenerous, her Gentry effeminate and <hi>fantasticall,</hi> they have brought down their wasts to the knees, where the points hang dangling, which were us'd to tie the middle, they weare Episcopal sleeves upon their leggs, and though they are farre from observing any rites of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, yet they seem to keep <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

their cloakes; and the time was not many yeers since that they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ridiculous to all the world by a sluttish yellow kind of starch, which was a pure invention of their own, and not an imitation of others, whereunto they are very subject; specially of the <hi>French,</hi> in so much that they may be said to be scarce <hi>men</hi> of themselves, but other mens Apes.

But I being to speak for the Noble King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Poland,</hi> need no such trick of wit to procure your consent that it may have the Principality of the rest of the Provinces of <hi>Europe;</hi> Nor confiding so much in your judgements need I any Rhetorical florishes, or force of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to induce you thereunto, for the argument hath strength enough of it self, to do the businesse. <hi>Poland</hi> needs no artifice, she needs no Mountibank to set forth her riches, which nature hath scattered in every corner with a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hand; It is a high and very Noble peece of the Continent, she abounds with Mines of Iron, Lead and Sulphureous Mettals, and with <hi>Lazurium,</hi> a kinde of stone of a blew caerulean colour, which God himself pleas'd to make use of for the Adorning of his own Palace. <hi>Lituania</hi> may be said to be <hi>Ceres Barn,</hi> and <hi>Russia her Haggard:</hi> for there if a field be sowd, it will be the year following, without necessity of throwing any new seed. In <hi>Podolia</hi> there be grounds that return 100. graines for one, besides there be Pasturages there that the horns of the Oxen feeding therein can hardly be seen. The salt pits of <hi>Cracovia</hi> may compare with any on Earth, there are such concamerations in them that make a little Town supported by great Pillars of Salt; and the entrance is so high, that you need not stoop your head to go in; There is no where better Hony, and mix'd with lesser Wax, or whiter then that which is found in <hi>Samogitia;</hi> The trunks of trees are full of their hives. There is such abundance of Pears, Apples, Plumms, Cherries, and Nuts, and these in such variety, that no Country can produce more in every one of the 32 County Palatines of <hi>Poland,</hi> whence huge quantities of Wheat, Barley, and Oates, with other Grains, as also Hopps, Hides, Tallow, Allum, Hony, Wax, Pitch, Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Masts, and Hemp are exported to other Countries: The number of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Horses are infinite. Now for the Wealth of the Subject, and private men I will produce you one stupendous Example. In the year 1363. about the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Shrovetide the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. his Nuptials were to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at <hi>Cracovia</hi> w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Neece of <hi>Casimir</hi> the Great King of <hi>Poland;</hi> the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Denmark, Peter</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and a great number of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Princes were present; <hi>Vernicus Germanus,</hi> being then Consul of <hi>Craco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> entertain'd all these Kings and Princes in his own Houses, and feasted them for many daies, dismissing them with presents, whereof that which he bestowed upon <hi>Casimir</hi> was valued at 100 thousand Florins; This <hi>Vernicus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely rich, exhausted his wealth in such publique Gallantries, yet he looked to the main chance, that he left himself a competence to live well and honestly: <hi>a small pittance will suffice nature, when immense possessions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not satisfie opinion.</hi> The <hi>Pole</hi> doth not glory much in high ostentous buildings, measuring the vanities thereof by the frailty of his own body, which is subject to decay in so short a time; So he falls into contemplation that the proudest Fabriques will dissolve and crumble to dust at last. What shall wee think of the Pyramides of <hi>Egipt,</hi> towards the rearing thereof, there were nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Talents erogated out of Garlike, Leeks and Onions alone; there were three hundred and sixty thousand opificers and labourers imployed for twenty years together in the work; but whats become now of those 4. Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids? They are all turn'd to rubbish. But observable it is, that one of them was reard by <hi>Rhodope</hi> a Courtisan, who was grown so infinitly rich by the publique use of her own. The Temple of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was no lesse then 220. years a building, to which all <hi>Asia</hi> did contribute, the stupendous length whereof was 425 paces, the Latitude 220. It had 120 columnes, 60. foot in Altitude. The Tomb of King <hi>Mausolus</hi> was an admirable thing, and the love of <hi>Artemisia</hi> his Wife was more admirable in erecting such a Tomb; and not onely so, but taking some of the powder of her husbands body and drinking it in little doses next her heart, saying, <hi>that her body was the fittest Tomb for her dear Husband.</hi> Now come in the Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> 200 foot high, and 60 miles compasse; to finish which there came three Millions of people together. I will now fix my eyes upon the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Colosse, which did bear the image of the Sun in that glory; It was 70 Cubits high, the thumb of the Image could not be embrac'd with both the armes, and so you may guesse at the vast proportion of the rest; The statue of <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> compos'd of Ivory and Gold by <hi>Phidias</hi> was a work of wonder. I will conclude with Old <hi>Rome,</hi> wherin there were in the Pagans time 420<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Temples; The very roof of the Capitol stood in 12 Talents; she was once above 30 miles about: She had in one Cense that was made above 25 hundred thousand souls in her, but now in point of people she is but a Wildernesse, and but a Village in comparison of what a City she was; being spacious once to hold all mankind, all her amphitheaters, her baths, Statues and Temples are mouldred away, and scarce any remnant left, together with her vast Palaces which aemulate Cities. The serious, wise <hi>Pole</hi> considering the small duration, and great charge, with the vanity of such things, measures his House by his own body, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do; it is sufficient if it last him for his own life, let his Sonne build for himself.

Cromerus, Herbortus, Varsevicius, Bzovius, Lascius, Vaporius, Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus, Herbestus, Sternaus, Lumbostus, Cichocius,</hi> with multitudes more of Authors, were men of sublime and celestial soules. The times are much altered now from what they were, when Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> the fourth Bishop from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle did write, <hi>In Sarmatia extremam Germaniam contingente, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Geometram, vel Poetam Pictoremve, aut Trapezitam esse,</hi> In <hi>Poland</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the furthest parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> there was neither Geometrician, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, Painter, or Trapezit, <hi>viz.</hi> an exchanger of Monies, or Banker. There is a strange Vicissitude since; for all <hi>Poland</hi> now is a most litterated Country, as if <hi>Athens</hi> had transported herself thither; There is Religion, and Piety also there in the highest degree, since Paganisme was expell'd thence by <hi>Mieczis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> and established Christianity, which they maintain still with that stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and fervencie, that when the Apostolical Creed is read in the Churches, every man stands up and drawes out his sword, which he holds naked in his hand till the Creed be read, intimating thereby that they will uphold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it with all the strength that God and Nature hath given them: a solemnity which is observ'd by no other Nation so much. And it seems that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath plac'd Religion thus under the Clientele of <hi>Poland,</hi> because that she confining upon divers ferocious and wild Nations, which are capital Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the name of Christ, at least wise dissociated and cut off from the

Latine Church, she by the valour and virility of her Inhabitants might be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnacle and rampart to the Holy Church, and by her fulminating legions, and armes, might be able to repel, and frustrate any attempt of theirs. The <hi>Muscovit</hi> her confining neighbour, distant from her in Faith, though not in territory, serves as a Whetstone to sharpen the Polonian courage, least by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetude it should grow dull and rusty; The Mahumetan is also her limitane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Neighbour, but a sorer and more formidable foe then the other: for there is a saying, <hi>ubicunque equus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Turcicus ungulam impresserit, ibi gramen non cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> Wheresoever the Turks horse doth once plant his hoof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no grasse grows there any more: Yet of late years he bears up notably against that huge Giant, and apprehends no great fear of him; As it appears by the magnanimous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which King <hi>Stephen</hi> gave the Sultan, who having sent to him for some auxiliar forces against the <hi>Persian,</hi> under pretext of an antient Custom, he sent him word, <hi>candidam Polonorum Aquilam antea implumem, &amp; viribus suis destitutam, nunc rejuvenescere, pennas recepisse, ungues &amp; rostrum exacuisse</hi> The white Eagle of <hi>Poland</hi> which was thin of feathers before, had now renewed her strength, recovered her quills, and sharpned her pounces and bill. For the <hi>Pole</hi> is naturally a stout man, that will neither be softned with pleasure, nor dismay'd by danger; a death bravely purchas'd he holds to be an immortality, and a life disgracefully preserv'd to be worse then any death. He is more careful to keep his Honor, then life; &amp; as, according to <hi>Cromers</hi> testimony, near the Town of <hi>Streme,</hi> there is a hill, where Pots, Caudrons, and other Vessells are found naturally so shapen, though they be soft within the Earth, but being digged out, they quickly incrustrate and grow hard when they are expos'd to the cold air; so the <hi>Pole</hi> is naturally shap'd for a soldier in his Mothers womb, but confirm'd afterwards by the severe discipline of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; He feares the clashing of armes no more then the wagging of oken leaves, or the bubbling of waters; And herein they retain still the genius of the Great <hi>Piastus,</hi> who as by probity and justice he got the Kingdom at first, so his Ospring conserv'd it by succession for 500. years. The women there also are indued with a masculine courage, for by the old constitution of <hi>Poland,</hi> no maiden was to marry, till she had kill'd three enemies in the field; but <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astus</hi> abolished this custom, and commanded women to exercise themselves in matters more consentaneous to their sex.

            <p>Good Lord, what Victorious Kings hath <hi>Poland</hi> had? <hi>Ziemovit</hi> did debell the <hi>Hungarians, Bohemians, Pomeranians,</hi> and made them all tributary; <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leslaus Chrobri</hi> subdued the <hi>Russe,</hi> bridled the <hi>Prusse,</hi> chastised the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and upon the frontires of his Dominions erected brazen Pillars: after his death all <hi>Poland</hi> mourned a whole year, all which time there was neither feasting nor dancing. What shall I say of <hi>Boleslaus</hi> the third, who fought 50. battailes, and was Victor in all? In his time the Emperor <hi>Otto</hi> the third, made a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to <hi>Poland</hi> to visit the body of Saint <hi>Adalbertus</hi> (which <hi>Boleslaus</hi> had redeem'd from <hi>Prusse Pagans</hi>) and it was to expiate a crying sin that he had committed, which was thus. The Empresse being light, she caressed an <hi>Italian</hi> Count so farre, that she offered him the use of her body, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, out of a malitious indignation, like <hi>Pharo's</hi> Wife, she accus'd the said Count that he would have forc'd her; whereupon he was arraigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed, but before his death he discoverd the whole series of the businesse to his Wife. A little after a great Sessions in <hi>Roncalias,</hi> appointed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95159:78"/>
to right Orphans and Widdows, the Countess came before the tribunal, and brought her husbands head under her vest, so desiring leave of <hi>Caesar</hi> to speak, she ask'd what punishment did he deserve that took away another mans life? <hi>Otto</hi> answered, no lesse then death. <hi>Then O Emperor you have condemned your self, who have taken away my guiltlesse husband, and behold here his head;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there wants proof in so private a cause, I will undergoe the Ordeal, the fyrie tryal; which the Countesse having perform'd without any hurt, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>Maria Augusta,</hi> who had accus'd the Count was brought, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be burnt, which was done accordingly. And the Emperor gave the Countesse <hi>Dowager</hi> 4. Castles in fuller satisfaction. To make further atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this offence, the said Emperor <hi>Otto</hi> came to <hi>Poland</hi> upon a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and <hi>Boleslaus</hi> came 7. miles to meet him, the way being cover'd with cloth of divers colours all along. Hereupon the Emperor for so Signal a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, did solemnly create <hi>Boleslaus</hi> King, and his Companion, and a friend of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, declaring him free from all tribute and jurisdiction for ever.</p>
            <p>But to come to more Modern times. What a man of men was <hi>Sigismund</hi> the first? you know, most noble Princes, that, the <hi>Persians</hi> doe cry up <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians, Alexander</hi> the Great; The <hi>Germans, Charlemagne,</hi> for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roique and valiant Kings. The <hi>Athenians</hi> cry up <hi>Miltiades, Cimon, Alcibiades, Thrasybulus, Phocio</hi> and others. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> their <hi>Pausanias, Lysander,</hi> and <hi>Agesilaus.</hi> The <hi>Thebans, Epaminondas,</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cry up <hi>Hamilcar, Hannibal,</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> do celebrate their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bios,</hi> their <hi>Scipios, Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> for strenuous and incomparable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. 'Tis true, they might be so, but they had to deal with soft effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people. But the <hi>Polonian Sigismund</hi> had to doe with the toughest, the most intrepid and fiercest Nations of the Earth, and a most favourable gale of fortune did blow upon him, throughout the whole Progresse of his life and actions. He tugg'd with <hi>Mechmet</hi> the <hi>Moscovian</hi> Emperor, whom <hi>Amurath</hi> the 3. acknowledg'd to be one of the greatest Warriers in the World, and got the better of him. He wrastled with the grim <hi>Tartars,</hi> with the furious <hi>Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians,</hi> and layed them on their backs. He cop'd with the Great <hi>Turk</hi> (who glories in a perpetuity of Victorship) and foild him more then once. Nay, he had divers Praeliations with us <hi>Germans,</hi> and took from us the spacious Provinces of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and <hi>Prussia,</hi> which, not without a foule blemish to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> he added to the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> And although the people of those Countries have often solicited our Diets, and put the <hi>German</hi> Emperors in mind of the avulsion, and losse of those Countries, yet we have thought it better to leave the quarrel alone, because there is nothing to be got by the <hi>Pole</hi> but knocks, for the Poleax is a terrible weapon. Now, touching the strength of the King of <hi>Poland;</hi> you know that for Cavalry, he is the potentest Prince of <hi>Europe. Thuanus</hi> the Frenchman confesseth that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> can bring to the field in Noble men and Gentry alone, which are bound to serve him so long time upon their own charge, above a hundred and fifty thousand men of all sorts of Arms. The name of <hi>Cosacks</hi> is formidable all the World over; And although they are cryed up to be freebooters, fighting onely for plunder, I will rectifie your opinion in that, by a late pregnant example in the <hi>Ivonic</hi> War: for having taken the General of the Enemie Prisoner, although there was offer'd 6. times his weight, twice in Gold, thrice in Silver, and once in Jewells, yet this would nothing at all move the valiant <hi>Cosacks.</hi>

            <p>Now, for the Nobility of <hi>Poland,</hi> it is numerous and antient, nay, there be good Authors affirm that the great families <hi>of Italy,</hi> the <hi>Ursins,</hi> the <hi>Colonni,</hi> the <hi>Ialians,</hi> the <hi>Gastaldi</hi> are originally of a <hi>Lituanian</hi> race.

               </gap>hearts, for that heresie reignes no where more in <hi>Europe;</hi> there are other among them, but this is the greatest: and can there be a greater heresie among Christians?</p>
            <p>Now for Religion, and all kind of civilities, the <hi>Pole</hi> is oblig'd to the <hi>German,</hi> who was their first introducer and instructer; as is evident by those reliques of the <hi>German</hi> tongue, which are yet found among them, which the <hi>Slavonique</hi> did shoulder out. Now the <hi>Slavonique</hi> is the most spacious vulgar language upon Earth, it extends as far as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> one way, and <hi>Mosco</hi> another way; for above twenty severall Nations speak it for their Vernacular tongue.</p>
            <p>Now touching the naturall disposition of the <hi>Pole,</hi> it is as savage and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary as of any Nation. Among a cloud of horrid examples which could be produc'd, that of King <hi>Popiel</hi> the 2. is remarkable; Who finding himself to be illbeloved by his Subjects, and suspecting that his brothers and uncles did goe to undermine him, He counterfeited himself to be sick, and so sent for them as it were upon his death-bed to take his farewell of them, committing his wife and children to their care, and speaking unto them faintly and with much tenderness; he calls for a boul of wine to drink unto them, which he scarce touch'd with his lipps; but they pledging him freely, were all poyson'd, and died soon after. Hereupon the cunning Queen crying out that they had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to poyson the King her Husband, their bodies were depriv'd of Christian buriall, and thrown into the lake <hi>Goplus:</hi> but mark the judgements of Heaven. Out of the putrified bodies, there were such ratts engendred, more bigg then ordinary, that first devoured all <hi>Popiells</hi> children, and then his Queen, and lastly himself in <hi>Crusvicia</hi> Castle, in a most disastrous manner, to the astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all mankind.</p>
            <p>Moreover touching the perfidiousnesse of the <hi>Polish</hi> Nation; there be as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pregnant examples as can be produc'd among any people; but not to detain your ears long with such harsh notes, let this one serve. When <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> the Son and rightfull Heir of King <hi>Albertus</hi> was put by, and <hi>Uladislaus</hi> the 5. made King of <hi>Poland,</hi> God Allmighty having respect to the innocence of young <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> powr'd his judgement upon the <hi>Pole</hi> in the <hi>Varvensian</hi> Battaile, wherein besides the loss of many thousand soules, Christianity receiv'd the fowlest blemish that ever she did from her infancie to that day. For this usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Uladislaus,</hi> having agreed upon Articles of peace with <hi>Sultan Amurath,</hi> and given him the holy host for caution in point of performance, The said <hi>Uladislaus</hi> breaking the Capitulations, caus'd <hi>Amurath</hi> to rush into <hi>Poland</hi> with a fearfull army, and as both were to close, the <hi>Turk</hi> drew out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some the host, and the Articles which <hi>Uladislaus</hi> had sworn unto, crying out, <hi>O thou Crucified, O thou crucified, look upon thy perfidious people who have pawn'd thee unto me, yet in a most scelestous and perjurious manner have infring'd their vow: if thou art some God, let perjury be vindicated.</hi> Hereupon there was a generall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow given to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army, and <hi>Uladislaus</hi> himself slain; In so much that <hi>Poland</hi> grew so despicable, that scarce any would undertake the title of her King.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Cosacks</hi> which were so much applauded in the preceding O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Truly, most noble Princes, let me tell you, that they are a race of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95159:80"/>
people of the same trade the wild <hi>Arabs</hi> are of, who live by robberies and plunder; and I had almost said they are as wild as they, for they feede upon raw flesh, which they put sometimes upon their horses back under the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to warm a little, and so they devoure it. They are farre worse then the <hi>Mosstroupers</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Tories</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> or the <hi>Bandoleros</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> which lurk among the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> hills for rapine and spoil.</p>
            <p>To draw to a conclusion, as the genius and naturall disposition of the <hi>Pole</hi> is rough, fierce and unpolish'd, so is their speech, which is a most abrupt and craggy kind of language, in so much that in some words you have <hi>ten conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> and but <hi>one vowell;</hi> the words of the <hi>Pole</hi> when he speakes high, are as so many stones thrown at a mans braines that heares him, they have such pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating harsh sounds and accents. The teeth of a Wolf, <hi>dentes lupini,</hi> are the of <hi>Poland,</hi> I arms wil not say their nature doth sympathize with that rapacious beast, but me thinks the Latine tongue whereof they bragge so much in point of vulgarity, should sound but very harshly among such teeth.</p>
            <p>For conclusion, I will relate unto you the character which one of <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds Secretaries, when he was then attending the King, gives of <hi>Poland</hi> and the people, which stands upon record in an Authentique peece of story. <hi>Quant a moy qui ne puis mentir je vous diray fort librement que je ne vis iamais un si mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pays, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ant de pouvre Noblesse, touts brutals &amp; sauuage, mais toutesfois si pleins d' arrogance qu' elle n'estime ancune Nation. Ces sont choses difficiles a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter par escrit, &amp; du tout impossibles a croire que par ceux qui les auroient veu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> For my part, saith the French Secretary, who cannot lie, I will tell you freely that I never saw in the whole course of my life so miserable a Country; so indigent a Gentry, so brutish, and savage a Commonalty, but nevertheless so full of arrogance that they esteem no other Nation. These are things which are difficult to be represented by writing, and impossible to be believ'd but by them who have been <hi>Eyewitnesses hereof, as I have been too long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely it must be imputed to this arrogant nature of theirs, that they think no man worthy to be their King by birth, but by Election. Nature is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and wise enough to give them a King, but they must choose one them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And it is observable that they are the only people among Mortals, who fetch their Kings from far, and admit Forreners to rule over them, and one reason may be, that they who are acquainted with the squalidness of the Country, will not take upon them such a spendid slavery. But the truth is, that <hi>Poland</hi> hath neither King nor Kingdom, but it is a kind of confus'd <hi>Oligarchycall kind</hi> of Government; which made the Lady <hi>Christina, Caesars</hi> Daughter, and Wife to <hi>Uladislaus</hi> the 5. so say, <hi>summum illud jus, &amp; authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Monarchiae in Polonia esse vmbratilem.</hi> That the highest power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Polish</hi> Monarchy is meerly umbraticall, 'tis but a shadow of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for neither in the OEconomicall Government of his domestick family, nor in choosing himself a Wife, much lesse in the senate hath he any power of free will.</p>
            <p>Therefore most excellent and judicious Princes, for to make <hi>Poland</hi> to have a precedence of the rest of the Provinces of <hi>Europe</hi> is the same, as when the Bramble, according to the holy text, was made the King of <hi>Trees.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile we are in so serious a debate touching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and which of them may deserve the principality; truly me thinks that we are ingratefull to <hi>Hungary,</hi> that we have deferr'd so long to speak of the stoutest people that march under the standard of the Crosse, and by whose valour the peace and incolumity of the Christian World hath hitherto stood. We should have been more mindfull of the memory of our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. But as the <hi>Roman</hi> Respublique is oftentimes tax'd to have sinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her best and most devoted Cittizens, as when <hi>Camillus</hi> was <hi>ostracis'd</hi> and banish'd, <hi>Scipio</hi> dismiss'd, <hi>Cicero</hi> after <hi>Catiline</hi> undervalued, <hi>Rutilius</hi> hurried o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Smyrna, Cato</hi> was denied the Praetorship, <hi>Vatinius</hi> the basest of men being preferr'd before him; so truly it may be said that we have misdemean'd our selves towards <hi>Hungary.</hi> Now if <hi>Hungary</hi> could transplant her self hither before us, she would sharply rebuke us for this preterition and neglect; but because that cannot be, I will adventure to be Advocate for that most Noble Kingdom. But as in a vast Forrest full of Trees, one intending to fell down one for Timber, and building, but having such choise about him, is puzzled which to single out; so am I at a stand being entred into this large Forrest of matter, where or how to begin.</p>
            <p>Will an inestimable treasure of all Wealth delight you? I pray where hath nature endeavoured with more industry to enrich a Country? If the amaenity of soyl, the marvellous clemencie of the air, the faecundity of ground can ennoble a Country, I pray hath not <hi>Hungary</hi> all these qualities? such is the fertility of fields there, that grain growes no where so kindly and copiously as there. There are such Vineyards up and down, that you will hardly find any where such generous and strong Wines. The Medows are there so luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that one Cart cannot see one another though at a small distance. For
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95159:81"/>
numerous heards of Cattle where can we find the like? How many thousand heads of fat cattell doe the Graziers fetch thence for the supply of all the neighbouring Provinces? <hi>Vienna</hi> her self, the <hi>Caesarean</hi> Court, spends above 80. thousand of them. Such is the felicity of Woods and Groves, that they are full of fruit trees as well as timber, as Chessnuts, Walnuts, Acrons, Plumms, and Apples; besides they abound with wild beasts, and Foul, as Boares, Hares, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans, Partridges, which is the familiar food of the Peasans.</p>
            <p>For stately deep Rivers <hi>Europe</hi> hath not greater, and more commodious and navigable for commerce, and the easie conveyance of all necessaries to and fro. They are quickned with abundance of Fish, great and small; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the River <hi>Tibisco</hi> is said by a proverb of the circumiacent Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants <hi>to have two parts water, and the third fish,</hi> so that <hi>Wernherus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> affirmes that 100. Carpes taken out <hi>Tibisco</hi> were sold for one <hi>Hungary</hi> ducket.</p>
            <p>What shall I say of the Richnesse of Mines up and down, wherein there are precious ores of Gold and Silver, the purest that is in the World. In a mine of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which is no ignoble part of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Empire, there have been digg'd out 500. pound of Gold in one day, out of a Mine in the Principality of <hi>Nero</hi> as they call it. There be some Rivers in <hi>Transyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There is a very credible report, that <hi>Sigismund Chanzares</hi> Bishop of the five Churches, was so rich in Gold, in the memory of man, that he could entertain an army upon his own pay.

We are going now to make inspection into the heroique vertue of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> in point of Valour and Courage. And first we could nominate eight Emperors, which under a benign and happy star were born in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> In the Emperor <hi>Decius,</hi> his vertues kept touch with his age, and grew up together. He came to the <hi>Caesarian</hi> dignity, neither by ambition, by bought suffrages, nor canvasing and corrupting of friends; but as his Election was fair, so his Government was so exemplary and glorious, that he was adjudg'd to deserve the character of <hi>Optimus Princeps</hi> by the unanimous judgement of the Senate; had he not been given so much to Pagan superstition, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd Christianity by such cruentous persecutions. <hi>Aurelianus</hi> is cryed up to have kept the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire three years without the least invasion, or noise of Warre; he augmented the bounds of it, and enhanc'd the glory of it all his life time; but he was tainted with the same stain as <hi>Decius</hi> was. He was of a tall stature, but of a sinewy constitution, and robust; In so much that it is recorded how in the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> War he slew with his own hand 48 in one day, but in all above 950. In so much that children and boyes us'd to sing up and down the streets on festivall daies. <hi>Mille, mille, mille, mille, mille, mille decollavimus, unus homo, mille, mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus, mille, mille vivat, qui mille, mille occidit:</hi> What shall I say of <hi>Probus</hi> the Emperor, who for his meer vertue and valor was hois'd up to the transcendent dignity of an Emperor, though descended of very mean Parents, of a Gardiner; his name suted with his nature, for he was a man of punctuall probity.

He never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqu'd himself in any businesse but he arriv'd at his wished Port; he never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any businesse though never so arduous, but he compas'd it, being most constant and thorough in all his resolutions, and in the prosecution of them; who had such a dextrous and moving way to incite his souldiers, <hi>that he made hope of Victory to serve for pay.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first, when he took the City <hi>Alba,</hi> when he triumphantly entred the City, the first thing he enquired after was Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church, where the body of <hi>Sanctus Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi> was interr'd; but spying the Armes and Ensignes of <hi>Matthias Corvinus,</hi> being neerly fix'd and pendant upon the walls with this Inscription, <hi>Sub mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more hoc Matthias situs est, quem facta Deum ostendunt, Fata fuisse hominem:</hi> Here lieth <hi>Matthias</hi> under this Marble, whom his feats shewed to be a God, but his fate a man, having I say spied and read this, he burst into teares, so highly did <hi>Maximilian</hi> esteem <hi>Matthias;</hi> and indeed the perfections and prosperity of such a man, whom would it not ravish? For <hi>Matthias</hi> in his time was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man who was said to bear armes. He subdued the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> he orecame the <hi>Valachians,</hi> he afflicted the <hi>Pole,</hi> he tam'd the Rebells of <hi>Hungary,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>Austria</hi> under his Dominion, he extended the limits of his Possessions to the shores of the Adriatique Sea; he rais'd the seige of <hi>Otranto;</hi> He dissipated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable swarmes of <hi>Turkes,</hi> and so abated the spirit of the great Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who in 32. years had acquir'd two Empires, had got 12. Kingdoms, and taken 200. Cities; I say he so handled this <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he and <hi>Bajazet</hi> his Sonne desir'd peace. Besides, this <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> when he gloried of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that he had conquer'd and quell'd all the Kings round about him, he used to except alwaies King <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was call'd by him <hi>strenuus Princeps,</hi> the strenuous Prince.</p>
            <p>But that which adds much to the renown of this notable King, was that he joyn'd Arts with Armes, that he contracted a kind of Matrimony twixt <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Muses;</hi> to whom he was much devoted in his private retirements. At dinner and supper he had alwaies some book or other read unto him, or some Doctors discoursing by learned altercations: He would alwaies say that 'twas impossible for any to be a Generall, and to deserve the name of a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, unlesse he were vers'd in the institution of Warre among our Ancestors, and observ'd their discipline of Warre and Stratagems. He made <hi>Buda</hi> the Domicile and rendevous of all kind of Vertue and Knowledge; For he was very liberall and munificent to all learned men as well as Military, and his reign florished with both. Earl <hi>Emericus</hi> was another <hi>Ulisses,</hi> his brother <hi>Stephen</hi> an <hi>Agamemnon, Paul Cinisius</hi> another <hi>Aiax, Micolas Cyupor</hi> a <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Michael Palatine</hi> a <hi>Nestor, Blasius Magerus</hi> (who was of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

was another <hi>Hercules,</hi> and King <hi>Matthias</hi> himself was a true <hi>Achilles.</hi> In his happy reign, <hi>Hungary</hi> was no other then an Academy of brave men in all faculties. He boar up most magnanimously against the whole power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, who denounced Warre so often against him; That fresh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which florisheth with such incredible Wealth, most spacious and variety of Dominions, with such veteran Captains and exact discipline and exercised souldiery; flesh'd so often with blood and a continuall course of conquering, having their courage elevated with the conceit of the puissance and large ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of their Emperor, with divers other advantages which the soft. <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean</hi> Princes have not, among whom either want of mony, the mutining of souldiers, the covetousnesse of Commanders, the carriage of so much lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and amunition for the mouth, the luxury, and excesses of the common souldier is so frequent. In so much that as an <hi>Italian</hi> Author hath it, it is a harder matter to take the smallest cottage from the <hi>Turke,</hi> then it were to take <hi>Calais</hi> or <hi>Bayon</hi> from the <hi>French. Hungary</hi> is the greatest rampart of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome against that <hi>Gigantique</hi> Enemy, who magnifieth and esteems the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and slightes all other <hi>Europaeans,</hi> confessing that when he comes to the field against them, he is sure to meet with men. Nay the women of <hi>Hungary</hi> have such masculine spirits, that it is admirable. Among many other instances which might be made, I will produce a late one. When <hi>Mahomet</hi> had closely begirt <hi>Agria</hi> by a pertinacious siege, and that the <hi>Praesidiaries</hi> being summon'd to make a rendition of the place upon very fair termes; for answer they set up a Mortuary with a death's head upon it on the top of one of their turrets, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death before a dedition. Hereupon the next day he made a furious storm, and brought his scaling ladders round about the walls, but he was notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd twice by the Inhabitants. Wherein the virility and valour of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was much seen, whereof one having her husband kill'd before her face, her mother being by, the mother said that she should have a care of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands body to give him buriall. God forbid, O mother, that my husband should go unreveng'd to his grave, <hi>pugnas hoc tempus, non exequias poscit,</hi> this is a time of fighting not burying, and so taking up her husbands sword and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, she rush'd in among the throng of the Enemies, and never left till she had kill'd three <hi>Turks</hi> with her own hands, as they were scaling a wall, and so offer'd them for a Victime to her spouse, to whom she afterward gave the rites of buriall. Another following her Mother, who carried upon her head a great stone to throw down upon the scaling Enemy, and being shot by a bullet and kill'd; the daughter takes up the same stone and went furiously to the walls, where she made so happy a throw, that she knock'd down dead two huge <hi>Turks</hi> as they were climing up a ladder. This female courage did much heighten the spirits of the men, who behav'd themselves so manfully, that the gran Signior was constrain'd to raise his seige most ingloriously, and so trusse up his bagage and be gone. <hi>Bonfinius</hi> hath another story of a valiant <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who at the seige of <hi>Iayza,</hi> clim'd up a Turret where the <hi>Turk</hi> had set up his colours, which he pull'd down, and fell down with the colours, and so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd his life. What shall I say of the portentous courage of <hi>Nicolas Iurischy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> who kept <hi>Gunzium</hi> a small City against <hi>Solyman,</hi> maugre his Army of 300. thousand men. What stupendous exploits did <hi>Nicolas Serinius</hi> perform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Necessity is vertues occasion, and it is the property of a man truly valiant to make use of it, and turn it to vertue. Now vertue hath many

waies to try the valour of her children. She tries the courage of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> by fire, of <hi>Rutilius</hi> by banishment, of <hi>Socrates</hi> by poyson, of <hi>Cato</hi> by his self-necion; And of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> by these and many other waies: Thus she tryed <hi>Serinius, Iurischyzius, Georgius Thurius,</hi> and <hi>Nadastus,</hi> who have got themselves high seates in the Temple of immortality.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Hungary</hi> that is the <hi>Antemurale,</hi> the true Propugnacle of all <hi>Europe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that prodigious huge Tyrant the <hi>Musulmans</hi> Emperor. The <hi>Germans</hi> grow rich by the <hi>Hungarian</hi> armes, the <hi>Italians</hi> live by their <hi>Funeralls,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> sleep quietly by their <hi>Calamities,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is at leisure to Warre else where by their <hi>Perills,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> made the more safe for their <hi>Power,</hi> The <hi>Pole</hi> followes his spotes by their labour. And Christians in generall live securely through their perpetual and contiguous dangers. So that Noble <hi>Hungary</hi> is not onely the inexpugnable rampart, but the buckler of Christendom.</p>
            <p>Therefore, most Noble Princes, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> without much propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may be call'd the Patrons and Tutelar Angells of <hi>Europe.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Pole,</hi> when the <hi>French Henry</hi> had stole away from them, made no ill choice when they reflected upon <hi>Stephen Bartorius</hi> to be their King. What an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roique Expedition did he engage himself in against the <hi>Moscovite;</hi> what an immense tract of ground was he to traverse, what thick endlesse woods, what huge Rivers, what fenns and loughs with other horrid uncouth places was he to meet withal! The <hi>Turks</hi> expeditions to <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> the expeditions which were made in former ages to the holy Land, come short of this difficult march which <hi>Bartorius</hi> made. But what did he doe by this tedious and venturous march? when he had gone from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risthenes</hi> to <hi>Cerinova,</hi> from <hi>Staricia,</hi> and <hi>Novogard,</hi> as farre as the lake <hi>Lohod;</hi> depopulating all before him, and taking all the youth of the Country Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he constrain'd the <hi>Sudari</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Mosco,</hi> to refrain from all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation in the <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> and all the Ports of the Baltique Sea, and confin'd him to the interior <hi>Russia,</hi> that he should wander no further. This <hi>Bartorius</hi> extended his arme from the <hi>Danube,</hi> the <hi>Titisco,</hi> the <hi>Dravo,</hi> and the River <hi>Marossa</hi> to the furthest parts of the Northern World. When the <hi>Turk</hi> besieg'd <hi>Plescovia,</hi> there came an Ambassador from him into <hi>Bartorius</hi> his Army, where they were put in battalion. The Ambassador beholding the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the men, their postures, and regular discipline, with the splendor of their armes, and richnesse thereof, together with their horses and Canons, he fel into a kind of astonishment, breaking out into these passionate words, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret Deus ut isti Principes</hi>—would God were pleas'd that these Princes, meaning his Master the Great <hi>Turk, Amurath</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and King <hi>Stephen Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi> were conjoin'd in a league, and they might subdue all the World. I will conclude with a brave Character that <hi>Vanotius</hi> gave of <hi>Stephen Bartorius.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Noble <hi>Henricus Albertus,</hi> Baron of <hi>Limburg,</hi> hath detained your attentions a good while in setting forth the praises of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and so to make her capable of the principality of <hi>Europe;</hi> but therein he hath labour'd to put a <hi>Giants head upon a</hi> Pygimes <hi>shoulders, or Hercules Buskins upon a Childs leggs.</hi> For, as by unanswerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I shall endeavour to prove, she hath no reason in the World to aim at such a Prerogative.</p>
            <p>For the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> although it enjoy a fat and fertile soil, and almost every where Productive, yet by the fury of <hi>Mars,</hi> and neighbourhood of the common Enemy, her agriculture and Mines have extremely suffer'd for many Ages. Besides, her air is found unwholsom, and disagreeable to all strangers, for the <hi>grossnesse</hi> of it in some seasons, and the <hi>tenuity</hi> of it in others. Therefore they cannot continue in one place above a month without danger, least the <hi>languor Hungaricus,</hi> the <hi>Hungarian</hi> faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse seize upon them; which is prevented by frequent remove of stations; that disease of the <hi>Hungarian languor</hi> or <hi>lithernes,</hi> having begun in the army at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morra,</hi> dispers'd it self to <hi>Iavarin,</hi> and so the contagion did expand it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Germans, Bohemians, Belgians, French,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> where it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely raged for a while. And as at <hi>Buda</hi> (then which besides <hi>Possonium</hi> there is scarce a City worthy the view of a stranger in all the Kingdom) there be some sulphureous Waters of such an intense heat, that will singe hoggs if they be thrown into them, yet there are peculiar sorts of fish that are there generated, with certain kinds of froggs, but if you throw other Rivers fish or froggs into them, they presently die and turn up their bellies. So the air of <hi>Hungary</hi> agrees by decree of nature with the inhabitants themselves, but it is averse, pestilentiall and intollerable to other people. What shall I say of those kinds of lice, which are the ofspring of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> air, which much infest all people? for it is found there by experience, that if one take a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin and wash it there in pond water, and expos'd to drying in the Sun, it will be presently full of Vermine. Nay, if one sweat never so little, the moisture of his body will turn to lice by the pravity of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> air. Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that besides the Malignity of the air, the waters are also there of an ill quality both Fountaines and Rivers, all for the most part except the <hi>Danube,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95159:85"/>
whose streames are wholsom and potable: The River <hi>Rabniza</hi> which ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with the <hi>Danube</hi> about <hi>Iavarin,</hi> runns with such unwholsome waters, that the fish and crabbs which are caught there do cast an ill sent, yea, after they are boyl'd. But as Parents, if they have a child either crump-shoulderd, hopperhipp'd, bleareyd, or mark'd with any other deformity, do make her a compensation for it in an extraordinary Dowry, which is able to make a sow appear like <hi>Susanna;</hi> So Nature and Fortune have made <hi>Hungary</hi> some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for these her imperfections, and furnished her with patches to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Moles.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Inhabitants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> I pray be pleas'd to hear what <hi>Otto</hi> a grave Bishop of <hi>Frisinghen</hi> saith of them. <hi>Hungari sunt facie tetri, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundis oculis, statura humiles, moribus &amp; linguâ barbari &amp; feroces, ut jure fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na culpanda, vel potius divina patientia sit admiranda, quae ne dicam hominibus, sed talibus hominum monstris tam delectabilem exposuit terram.</hi> The <hi>Hungarians</hi> saith the Bishop (and Bishops should not lie) are commonly of a tetrique countenance, hollow eyd, low statur'd, barbarous and fierce in their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and speech; That either Fortune may be justly blam'd, or the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence admir'd, that such a delightfull Country should be expos'd to such men, or rather Monsters of men. The <hi>Hunns,</hi> which are birds of a feather with the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> if antient writers may be believ'd, had their Originall from a sort of <hi>Demons.</hi> For, as not only tradition, but the story goes, <hi>Filimer</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> having in his army a huge vast-bodied woman which was accus'd of impudicity; he banish'd her to a Wilderness beyond the <hi>Maeotis,</hi> where meeting with <hi>Satyres</hi> and <hi>Demons,</hi> she coupled with them and brought forth a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous issue, which were afterwards call'd <hi>Hunns.</hi> But certain it is that both <hi>Hunns</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> came at first from the extremest parts of the <hi>North,</hi> out of a Province call'd <hi>Iuharia,</hi> or <hi>Iurha,</hi> which were subject to the <hi>Moscovite;</hi> who in quest of a hotter clime came as farre as the banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> to that part of the Continent now call'd <hi>Ungaria,</hi> which took its name from <hi>Iuharia;</hi> for in that Province of <hi>Iuharia,</hi> they speak to this day the same lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as the <hi>Hungars</hi> do: of these <hi>Iuharians Claudian</hi> speakes.</p>

               <hi>Medes, Gothes, Dacians,</hi> the scourge of God, the terror and hammer of the World. He had an Army of 700<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thousand men, yet fearing to be taken once, by <hi>Aëtius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall, he had caus'd many saddles to be put in a place, that if need were, a fire might be made of them to burn him: but it pleas'd God to throw away this iron rodd in the height of his pride; for being to be married to the daughter of the King of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> this bloody Tyrant was choak'd in his bed the night before by a sudden flux of blood.</p>
            <p>You well know, my Noble Princes, how these <hi>Hungarians</hi> were for many ages like <hi>Goads</hi> in our Ancestors sides; how prone they have alwaies been to rush into <hi>Germany</hi> to breath better air; but stories tell how magnanimously our Emperors have repell'd and routed them. Among others, how did <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Auceps,</hi> and <hi>Otto</hi> the great trounce them? They grew so insolent as to demand tribute of the Emperor, who in disdain of them, sent them a lame old scabby dogg; whereupon they came into the field with a formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but Heaven was so auspicious to <hi>Henricus Auceps,</hi> that he utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited them with the death of 150. thousand, and 50. thousand taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners; yet they made head again, and invaded the confines of <hi>Germany</hi> by the incitement of <hi>Horoldus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisburg,</hi> with such a numerous Army, that they vapour'd in these words, <hi>nisi Caelum cadens nos obruat, aut Terra de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiscens nos absorbeat, nulla vis humana tanta erit quae vel aspectum nostrum susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere possit:</hi> Unlesse the Heaven fall down and overwhelm us, or the Earth gape and swallow us, there is no humane power never so great dare look us in the face. But <hi>Otto</hi> the Great pricked the Tympany of their pride, utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew them, took their King <hi>Bultzko</hi> prisoner, with their 4. chief Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, <hi>Lelius, Sura, Toxus</hi> and <hi>Schaba.</hi> This Signall and mighty victory did so abate their spirits, that they could never since be elevated to that height a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Germany;</hi> but that which confounded them most, was, that their <hi>But sco</hi> should be hang'd before that Gate in <hi>Ratisbone</hi> which looks towards <hi>Hungary.</hi> There is a proverb that <hi>Hungarus multum lupi in se habet,</hi> The <hi>Hungarian</hi> hath much of the Wolf in him: this alludes to his immanity, fiercnesse and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore one gave <hi>Uladislaus</hi> this advice, as <hi>Bonfinius</hi> hath it; <hi>Hungaros non clementia &amp; impunitate, sed ferrea virga continendos esse,</hi> The <hi>Hungarian</hi> was to be kept in aw, not by mildnesse and impunity, but with an Iron rodd. Much more might be spoken of the odd humors of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> but I will here cut off the thred of my discourse, for feare I should abuse the ears of so gentle an Auditory with such abrupt matter. And, most Noble Baron of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> this presumption of <hi>Hungary</hi> in demanding the precedence of other Kingdoms, is like that of <hi>Weiderad</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Fuldo,</hi> when in a Diet at <hi>Mentz,</hi> he demanded Priority of the Archbishop of <hi>Colen,</hi> who answered, <hi>sure this Imperiall Councell will not think it fitting, that an Archbishop should give the place to an Abbot, nor a Prince Elector to a Monk.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is recorded of the <hi>Macedonian Alexander,</hi> that when he fell a reading those verses of <hi>Homer,</hi> wherein the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Hector</hi> challeng'd any of the nine greatest Captaines of <hi>Greece</hi> to combat, and that the army thereupon put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to a sortilegious chance or lot, with trembling vows, so <hi>Iupiter</hi> wish'd that he might be <hi>Aiax,</hi> or <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; Alexander</hi> broak out into a sudden passion and said, <hi>Occiderem qui me Tertium nominasset:</hi> I would kill him who should name me the <hi>third,</hi> intimating thereby that he scorn'd to be the third in chief among nine, though thereby he might have more under him then above him. But, most excellent Princes, put case any were at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the presence of <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi> should offer to range <hi>Italy</hi> in the third place among the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> I believe an ordinary death should not serve his turn, or such as <hi>Alexander</hi> threatned, but he should be presently snatched to the <hi>Gemonian scales,</hi> hurld into <hi>Tyber,</hi> or praecipitated down the <hi>Tarpeian Rock.</hi>

            <p>For indeed <hi>Italy,</hi> fair <hi>Italy</hi> is the most precious gemme of <hi>Europe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces are but <hi>Bristoll</hi> stones in comparison.

Italy</hi> is the nurse and Parent of all things, she is the Elect of the Gods, as she who should make the Heavens more clear, who should congregate scatter'd Empires, and mollifie their customes: 'tis she that's cut out by nature, to draw unto her by sweet comerce of language the most discordant and fiercest people, yea, to give humanity to man. And lastly, 'tis she who is fittest to be the common Country of all Nations. Therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but wonder, and not injustly, that she should be pretermitted all this while in so Judicious an assembly; but the same fortune befalls <hi>Italy</hi> here, as doth commonly fall upon the most precious jewells expos'd in some Cabinet to be sold, where the richest are shewn last: For if the praises of <hi>Italy</hi> had been first dilated, the elogiums of all other Countries had prov'd insipid and tedious. Now as the glorious Sun, when he culminates and toucheth

the <hi>Meridian</hi> Circle doth cast a lesser shadow, then when he declines towards our horizon <hi>Westward;</hi> so the perfections of <hi>Italy</hi> which are so high, that they may be said to be in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and the Verticall point over all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If I should undertake to speake of them, and draw them down to the horizon of humane understanding, I should shadow and obscure them the more. There is in <hi>Italy</hi> such an harmonious concent of all creatures, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements can afford, and those in such a perfection, that as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith again, <hi>quicquid est quo carere vita non debeat nusquam est praestantius.</hi> Whatsoever is, that life ought not to want, is no where more excelling. The terroir or soil is gentle, copious and cheerfull, it returnes more profit to the husbandman then he sometimes expects, being at no great charge of culture, for the land doth not struggle there with her Lord, but is gentle and complying with his desires. The <hi>Italian</hi> Wheat for whitenesse and weight is distinguish'd from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Countries; the <hi>Boetian</hi> is next, then <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Wheat is the fourth in goodnesse. Here I pray what an Emperor (<hi>Constanstin Paleolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>) speakes of her, <hi>Nisi scirem a sanctissimis viris in Oriente Paradisum esse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meo judicio non alibi posse reperiri quam in persuavi Patavina amaenitate.</hi> If I did not know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith the Emperor, by the affirmation of most Holy men, that <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> were <hi>Eastward,</hi> it could be found no where else but in the most sweet amae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <hi>Padua;</hi> whence sprung the proverb, <hi>Bologna la grassa, Padoua la passa.</hi> There be some soyles in <hi>Italy</hi> that afford four lattermaths of Hay &amp; grass; there are Cheeses made there in many places of a hundred poundweight.

At <hi>Papia</hi> there grow most fragrant Grapes which perfume one's mouth as he eates them.

Ther's nothing more gentle then her air, more luxuriant then her soyl. <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> strive here for the mastery. There is no Sea so hospitable, here are the Noble Ports of <hi>Caieta,</hi> and <hi>Misenum, Lucrinus</hi> and <hi>Avernus</hi> are as two Gates to let in <hi>Neptune;</hi> here are Baths fedd with tepid Fountaines, here are hills clad with Vines, <hi>Gaurus, Falernus, Massicus,</hi> and the fairest of all <hi>Vesuvius, Aetna's Ape.

Horace, Livy, Statius, Pampinius, Claudian, Anneius Seneca, Agellius, Petrarca, Panormitanus, Laurentius Valla, Porcellius, Blondus, Facius</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent writers. For the lustre and number of Nobility, there is not such a concourse upon Earth of Princes, Dukes, Marquises, and Counts. Who then, that hath the least ambition to vertue, but would be transported with a violent desire to visit <hi>Italy,</hi> who hath Cities that shine in her like so many constellations in the Firmament? Those of the first magnitude are <hi>Rome,</hi> holy and magnificent <hi>Rome,</hi> wise, rich and Lordly <hi>Venice,</hi> gentile, and odoriferous <hi>Naples,</hi> beautifull <hi>Florence,</hi> a City, as <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor said, to be seen only on Festivall daies, <hi>Milan</hi> the spacious, <hi>Bolonia</hi> the fat, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> the civill, <hi>Padoua</hi> the strong, <hi>Bergamo</hi> the subtle, <hi>Genoa</hi> the proud, <hi>Verona</hi> the worthy, <hi>Brescia</hi> the fortified, <hi>Mantoua</hi> the glorious, <hi>Rimini</hi> the good, <hi>Siena</hi> the studious, <hi>Luca</hi> the industrious, <hi>Furli</hi> the wanton, <hi>Ravenna</hi> the mild, <hi>Capoua</hi> the amorous, <hi>Urbin</hi> the loyall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with divers renouned Cities more that have their peculiar Epithets.</p>
            <p>The Divine ingenie, and inventive brain of the <hi>Italian,</hi> is well known all the Earth over, for all Countries have reap'd the benefit thereof. There are not such Opificers and Artists in the World; if you respect Limmers, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects, Painters, Weavers, and such like; who are not only imitated, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by the rest of the <hi>Europaeans.</hi> What a rare Chymicall invention was that

            <p>Moreover for all other Speculative and Theorical Knowledge, the <hi>Italian</hi> brain transcends all other in the study of the Sciences. <hi>Rome</hi> had but short skirts before litterature was introduc'd, which happen'd a little after the first <hi>Punique</hi> Warre, then she began to be another <hi>Athens.</hi> O immortall Gods, how did she expand her self afterwards, how violently did she thrive and augment her Dominions? what rare wits did she produce, as <hi>Ennius Rudinus, Accius Plautus, Lucretius, Catullus, Statius, Horatius, Persius,</hi> and <hi>Valerius Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Iuvenal, Porpertius, Ovid, &amp; Virgil;</hi> all heavenly Poets. For <hi>Prose, Porcius Cato Censorinus, Q.

Alchmen,</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Crotonians, Vitruvius</hi> of <hi>Verona;</hi> The Mysteries of Greek Philosophy were open'd to us by <hi>Papirius,</hi> and <hi>Sempronius.</hi> For the <hi>Pandects</hi> of the Law we are beholden to <hi>Papinianus, Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Ulpian.</hi> What shall I say of those <hi>Hero's</hi> of Eloquence, <hi>Cornelius Cethegus, Appius Caecus, Q. Metellus, C. Laelius, P. Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus, Ser. Galba, Aemilius Lepidus, C. Gracchus, Q. Catulus, Herennius, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and the great Standardbearer of Orators, of <hi>Tullius Cicero.</hi> What were found single in all the other, met all in him together. His Orations had the gravity of <hi>Cato,</hi> the lenity of <hi>Laelius,</hi> he had neither the boysterousnesse of <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> nor the heat of <hi>Caesar,</hi> nor the confus'd distributions of <hi>Hortensius,</hi> nor the sophisms of <hi>Calvus,</hi> nor the niggardnesse of <hi>Salust.</hi> There could nothing imaginable be either added, spar'd or alter'd in his Orations. And what a powerfull stroak did the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Eloquence carry with it against <hi>Catiline?</hi> what a virtue it had to preserve <hi>Rome? Romulus</hi> did not so great an act to build <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> did to defend it. It was a great trophy that <hi>Scipio</hi> carried away from <hi>Hannibal, Fabricius</hi> from <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the other <hi>Scipio</hi> from <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Crassus</hi> from <hi>Spartacus, Pompey</hi> from <hi>Sertorius</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but it was a more wholsome Victory for <hi>Rome</hi> which <hi>Cicero</hi> had of <hi>Catiline.</hi>

            <p>But after these glorious Lamps of learning, there happen'd afterward dark times, by the irruption of many barbarous Nations into <hi>Italy,</hi> who ravish'd <hi>Rome</hi> so often, overwhelm'd all <hi>Italy</hi> with ignorance.

After <hi>Urban, Clement</hi> the 5. in the Councell of <hi>Vienna</hi> made a Decree, that at <hi>Rome,</hi> or wheresoever the Pontifical Court should reside, the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldaic,</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> should be read by publique Professors.

               <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was a man born for the reparation of Letters, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of knowing men; from his time it is incredible how all kind of Sciences did reflourish in <hi>Italy,</hi> and consequently in all Countries else; for <hi>Italy</hi> may be call'd the <hi>Source</hi> or great <hi>Cestern,</hi> whence all kind of Vertues flow to the <hi>Europaean</hi> World.

In matter of Treaty there is no Nation ever went beyond the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> he was never cosend that way, wherein he useth to shew resolution as well as reservednesse; there is a memorable example of that, when <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. came into <hi>Italy,</hi> he advanc'd as farre as <hi>Florence,</hi> where entring into a Treaty with the Duke, he employed 4. Commissiones to the Emperors Camp, whereof <hi>Caponi</hi> was one, who hearing the propositions read by the Kings Secretary,

I should tire your patience too much if I should give a Cataloge here of all the great Captaines of <hi>Italy,</hi> therefore I will instance but in few.

Thus as provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would have <hi>Columba,</hi> a Dove first to discover dry Earth after the Deluge; so <hi>Columbus</hi> first discover'd this new peece of Earth to the Inhabitants of the old World.

But <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> chancing to be one time unkown among some <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this discovery, and slighting it, saying it might have beeen feasable by

any Navigator, he calls for an Egge, and laying a wager that none could make that Egge to stand at an end upon a smooth table, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> trying many wayes to doe it, and missing, <hi>Columbo</hi> took the egge, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>uising the shell at one end, made it stand upright; then every one could doe it after him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he told them, just so when an <hi>Italian</hi> had shewed you the way, 'twas easie for you <hi>Spaniards</hi> to goe to the new World. Yet that brave Queen <hi>Isabella</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with their Successors did nobly reward <hi>Columbo,</hi> though <hi>Genoa</hi> his own native town was ingratefull unto him, for having left her a mighty Legacy at his death, she did not raise any monument, much lesse any brass Statue to his memoey, which he so much deserved. But herein <hi>Genoa</hi> carried her self towards <hi>Columbo,</hi> as <hi>London</hi> in <hi>England</hi> did towards Cavalier <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who fell upon a brave wholsome invention of bringing a fresh River fifty miles about, to runne through her streets to her infinite advantage for many uses.</p>
            <p>Touching the noble virtue of Friendship, she reigns no where so strongly as among the <hi>Italians,</hi> who are naturally of a most humane and mansuete dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, not onely among themselves but to strangers. There was a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof in <hi>Alostio Priuli,</hi> a Gentleman who had contracted a strict league of love with Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> an English man, which lasted many years, so that there was much notice taken at <hi>Rome,</hi> of that conformity of manners, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of affection, and sweet sympathy which were between them. This friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship continued in the same strain of strength for twenty six years; all which time <hi>Priuli</hi> could not be wrought upon to enter into the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, though often invited by <hi>Iulius</hi> the third. Cardinal <hi>Pole</hi> falling at last sick of a lingring disease, Signior <hi>Priuli</hi> never stirred from his side all the while: at last, the Physitians telling him he had not long to live, he sent for a Notary, and made <hi>Priuli</hi> Heire of all he had; but such was the generosity of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> that he made not a penny benefit of it, but gave it all among his English kindred; being twenty moneths in perpetual agitation for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the estate.</p>
            <p>Nor are there any people so naturally addicted to Charity as the <hi>Italians:</hi> Cardinal <hi>Atestino</hi> was a great example hereof, of whom there was a kind of Proverb in <hi>Rome,</hi> That his House was an Exchequer to the rich, an Hospitall to the poor; his Person was the splendour of the sacred Colledge, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the <hi>Roman</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>I passe now to the Nobility of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is very numerous; there is no clime under Heaven, where Virtue is more rewarded, good qualities more pryed into, and Industry higher advanced. <hi>Rome</hi> is the Common-countrey of all Nations, it is the rendevous of all Ingenious spirits; and its impossible for any person of Merit to be there long, but he is sought after, and advanced. This makes <hi>Italy</hi> so abound with Nobles of all Nations. For the generous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of riding great Horses, they goe beyond all, and it is wonderfull to see, what a docible creature they bring those fiery mettall'd animals to be; they use to make them dance, and keep touch with the musique, by a rare art, and do strange feats besides. What a famous Master in this art was <hi>Sigismondo Loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello</hi> of <hi>Ferrara? Grisonio</hi> was no lesse rare in point of Horsmanship.</p>
            <p>Among other compleat and gallant spirits which <hi>Italy</hi> produced these latter Ages, <hi>Cosmo de Medici</hi> was one of the most admired all the world over: 'Twas He that did first found the grandeur of the <hi>Medicean</hi> Family; 'twas He brought his <hi>Hetruscan</hi> Countrey to such a civility; 'twas He who taught Soveraigne Princes first, to look to the encroaching power of their Neighbours, and to keep them in aequilibrio; therefore <hi>Apollo</hi> made fit choice of him to hold the Balance, when all the Kingdoms and States of <hi>Europe</hi> were weighed before him at <hi>Delphos.</hi> He was a man of an exquisite temper in his behaviour, of a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reach of understanding, of a marvailous forecasting head, a subtile cleare brain, quick apprehension and profound judgement. He was munificent to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95159:89"/>
strangers, liberal to his domestiques, and extreamly charitable to the poor, a mighty restaurator of Gods Houses. In all these acts he was equal to Kings, he exceeded ordinary Princes, and went far beyond all private men. Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though out of the largeness of his heart, and piety of his soul, he had expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Kings Ransom in Hospitals, Monasteries, and Churches, yet he was used to say, <hi>Non potuisse se in suis accepti &amp; expensi codicibus unquam reperire Deum Debitorem:</hi> When he went to look into his Leger book of Account what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys he had received and issued, he could never find God his Debter. Yet this mighty man was, when Auditor <hi>Cossa</hi> did audit his expenses, 'twas found, that he had spent forty millions in publique and private Fabriques, and tenne millions in private acts of munificence, and charity. He was such a Lover of his Country, so mighty a Patriot, that having lived above seventy yeares, this modest, but well merited Epitaph was engraven upon his tomb, <hi>Cosmus Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>What shall I say of the state of <hi>Genoa?</hi> who among the Records of her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, can glory, that she took and possessed once, <hi>Sardinia, Cyprus, Lesbos,</hi> and <hi>Chio,</hi> as also <hi>Pera</hi> opposite to <hi>Constantinople</hi> on the <hi>Asian</hi> shore; she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so mistris of <hi>Theodosia,</hi> or <hi>Caffa,</hi> insomuch that her dominions extended as far as the banks of <hi>Tanais:</hi> And to this day there be some Christian Rites, and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Families in that part of <hi>Tartary.</hi> What tough wrestling, and terrible Wars continued 'twixt her and <hi>Venice</hi> for two or three Ages together? and we may easily conjecture how potent she was, when she could tugge with <hi>Venice</hi> so long.</p>

In so much that <hi>Vopiscus</hi> affirmes, she fed at one time foure millions of men in City and Suburbs. <hi>Seneca</hi> left se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and five hundred thousand philippicos, or crowns behind him; <hi>Caecilius Claudius Isidorus,</hi> although he had lost much by the civill warrs, yet he left 4117. slaves, 3060. yoke of Oxen; and of other cattle two hundred and fifty seven thousand: <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports the first, and <hi>Plinie</hi> the second. There were at one time in <hi>Rome</hi> five hundred Gladiators or Fencers, a thousand Beares, one hundred Lions; which were kept in divers denns. The high way of <hi>Appia</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended three hundred and fifty miles, the <hi>Flaminian</hi> more. Touching the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queducts and fountaines, the baths, and the waters of <hi>Rome,</hi> there were at once five hundred men hired to look to them, and the channells were so broad, that a horseman might foord over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What art was used to furnish the seven hills

with conduits and cesternes. When <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Ambassador of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> and was brought about to view the City, he was asked what he thought of her? He answered (looking upon her foure hundred Churches) he thought, said he, that all <hi>Rome</hi> was but one Temple, her Senat is an assembly of Kings, she is yet to this day the flower of the whole earth, and the better part of mankind. Now <hi>Rome</hi> came to this vast magnitude by her parsimony, by her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and industry; she had her legions alwayes well trained, and never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to be idle, nor did she pamper them with too much pay; The Senators were more carefull for the discipline of the soldiers, then of the education of their children; They used to inure and habituat them to armes before they sent them abroad; And certainly the <hi>Romans</hi> must needs be very valiant men naturally; besides so many victories did heighten their courage; Among thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of examples which I could produce, let <hi>Licinius Dentatus</hi> serve for one, who as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> avoucheth, had receaved forty and five severall wounds and never a one backward, he had been in above one hundred bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, and brought home thirty and foure spoiles. What notable great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls did she breed of divers tempers; <hi>Marcellus</hi> was of a fiery spirit, <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was politiquely slow, <hi>Pompey</hi> was daring, The <hi>Scipios</hi> were patient, <hi>Caesar</hi> for expedition, for martiall knowledge, and magnitude of mind was unparalleld. When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> came with a new race of men, and horrible Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants into <hi>Italy,</hi> and was advanced within thirty miles of <hi>Rome;</hi> He sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her if she would parly, word was sent <hi>Pyrrhus, Italiâ cum copijs excedito, ubi excesserit, de pace si volet agito; ni excesserit, Arma &amp; viros &amp; acie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But new <hi>Rome</hi> after so many assaults, and sackings of divers barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as she fell in glory, so she also fell lower in situation, for she removed from the seven Hills to the plaine of <hi>Campus Martius</hi> where she is seated now, having lost the fift part of her circumference, and magnitude, and being not the sixt part so populous; yet a notable providence hath attended this City, that she florisheth still, and though she be not so bigg as she was', yet she is <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> since the standard of the Crosse was planted there by a speciall benignity of heaven; she hath the <hi>Law</hi> of Christ insteed of her <hi>Legions,</hi> As she was before the chiefest City in the world for armes, so she is now for Religion; she is the Court of the Chief Pastor, and the common Countrey of all Christians, she is the gnomon of the great Diall of saving Faith, <hi>Romana Ecclesia est illa quae non modo tot principum &amp; Imperatorum, sed quod longè praeclarius est, omnium san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum Catholicamater, &amp; in cujus gremio mori faelicius est, quàm ab initio nasci, cùm non nasci satius sit, quàm in hac non mori.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Church is she who is not onely the Catholique universall mother of Princes and Emperours, but of Saints, in whose lapp it is more happy to die, then to have been born, it being better not to be born at all, then not to die in Her; as <hi>Montanus</hi> saith. This makes her so refulgent for so many prerogatives, that the greatest part of the <hi>European</hi> world, as also all the new Converts in the <hi>American</hi> new world doe acknowledge her the Chief seat of the Oracles of God, and her Bishop the chiefest ministeriall head of the holy Church: and to deny this, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe <hi>Stapleton, summae impietatis vel praecipitis arrogantiae est:</hi> It is either the highest impiety, or the desperatest arrogance; He is the universall Shepheard,

For which respect (such an humiliation and reverence Religion strikes into the Soul of man) all Emperors and most Kings doe willingly give not onely precedence, but perform Offices of service unto him, as, among a world of instances that could be produc'd besides, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, did at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the first at <hi>Marseilles.</hi> How many Emperors have held the bason while he wash'd his hands, how many Kings have held his stirrop while he mounted and descended off his Mule, how many have lead his horse by the bridle. How many thousand Princes have kiss'd his Pantouffle, and carried him in a Chair upon their shoulders, and gloried in all these acts of submission; such a Power Christian Religion hath to humble the hearts of the greatest Princes, and make all temporall greatnesse stoop to the spiritual hopes of Heaven.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Rome</hi> from her very infancy, when she was a <hi>Pagan,</hi> was much given to the reverence of the Gods. Her <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> was then in high adoration, she had magnificent, and costly Temples, Altars and Fanes which had singular immunities and prerogatives, the Temple was then an <hi>Asylum</hi> and <hi>Sanctuarium,</hi> a refuge and sanctuary from all violence; and of these Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Temples <hi>Rome</hi> had 4. times more then she hath now of Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. She had then her Nunneries and Vestall fires, her <hi>Flamins</hi> and <hi>Archfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> more in number then any other City; when she had conquer'd any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Nation, their Gods were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and they were ascited among hers, &amp; admitted; alledging that there could not be too many Gods to preserve so great a City. Yet there was violence laid then upon the conscience in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, nor did the Ecclesiastick Power, and <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> ever clash with the temporal for Superiority, but alwaies yeilding unto it, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Protection, Meanes and Maintenance from it. This was the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of old <hi>Rome,</hi> but new <hi>Rome</hi> came to be so high in her devotions, that she came at last to give more alleageance to the <hi>Pontifical</hi> Power then to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial.</hi> Nor were the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors ever in that adoration in old <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Pope is now in the new, whom she holds to be so farre above the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power as the Soul is above the body. 'Tis true, there was much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence given to the chief <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrate and Senate, from all times. <hi>Adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> King of <hi>Numidia</hi> call'd himself <hi>Romanorum Procuratorem,</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> Procter. <hi>Eumenes</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and pulling of his Capp, offer'd it to the Senate, confessing he receiv'd his liberty from <hi>Rome. Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> when he came to the Senate, he us'd to kisse the threshal of the door, acknowledging himself <hi>Mancipium Senatus,</hi> a slave unto the Senate. <hi>Tiridates,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> bowd himself to <hi>Nero</hi>'s knees. But there was never such low submission done to any Pagan Governor, as is now done to the Pope, whom the <hi>Turkes</hi> call <hi>Rumbeg,</hi> that is Prince or Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Persian Rumschah,</hi> King of <hi>Rome;</hi> for we never read that the <hi>Ethniques</hi> ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended so low as to Foot-Osculation, which is a reverence peculiar and due only to the Pope; the Emperor and other Kings being contented only that the Vassall kisse their hands, or hem of their Garment. Nor doth the Pope return reverence to any other potentate by rising up, bowing his head, or uncovering his head to any, onely to the Emperor after he hath kiss'd his feet, he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards admitted to kisse his hand, and then he riseth a little and giveth him a mutuall kisse of Charity with an Embracement. There is a cloud of examples, how diver Emperors and Kings came to <hi>Rome</hi> to do their filial duty to the Holy Father, and to have their Coronations confirm'd by him. <hi>Iustinian,</hi> did so to <hi>Constantine, Pipin</hi> to <hi>Stephen</hi> the second, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great to <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. <hi>Lodovicus pins</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Sergius</hi> the 2. the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95159:91"/>
forth to <hi>Paschall</hi> the 2. <hi>Frederic</hi> the first to <hi>Adrian</hi> the 4. But that was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Signal reverence which <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>England</hi> did to <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. Who came both together, and jointly attended the Pope a good way to his lodging, he being on horsback, and they both a foot. Now it is one of the high Tenets of the Catholiques, That the Pope is the only Free independent Prince upon Earth; not accountable to any for his actions, but unto Christ himself whose Vicegerent he is. He cannot onely command, but make Kings, at least confirm them. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> did not hold himself perfectly established King of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> till the Holy Father pleas'd to allow of it, and confirm him. Now touching the Title of Emperor, there is a notable letter upon record, which <hi>Adrian</hi> the 4. writ to the three Ecclesiastic Electors of <hi>Germany. Romanum Imperium a Graecis translatum est ad Alemannos, ut Rex Teutonicorum non ante quam ab Apostolica manu coronaretur Imperator vocaretur; ante consecrationem Rex, post Imperator. Unde igitur habet Imperium, nisi a nobis? ex electione principum suorum habet nomen Regis, ex consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione nostra habet, nomen Imperatoris, Augusti &amp; Caesaris.

            </p>
            <p>Nor can the Holy Father entitle Emperors, and make Kings and Gran-Dukes; but he can, as he alledgeth, depose them if they degenerate to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants or Heretiques; he can absolve their subjects from all ties of allegeance. As among other examples <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. did to <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi> did to Queen <hi>Elizabeth. Innocent</hi> the 1. did not onely thrust <hi>Arcadius</hi> out of his Throne, but out of the society of Christians. <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Emperor was excommunicated by <hi>Anastasius</hi> the 2. Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> anathematiz'd the Emperor <hi>Philippicus, Gregory</hi> the third delivered over to <hi>Satan</hi> Pope <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> and took from him all <hi>Italy. Gregory</hi> the 7. excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. and <hi>Boleslaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Lewis</hi> the 4. was barr'd to come to Church by <hi>Benedict</hi> the 12. <hi>Otho</hi> by <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. <hi>Frederic</hi> the 2. by <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. and <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Castile</hi> was quite thrust out both of his Throne and the holy Church by <hi>Vrban</hi> the 5. who made <hi>Henry</hi> the bastard capable to succeed him by a bull of legitimation; and indeed that <hi>Peter</hi> was a hatefull Tyrant, having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therd

many of his own Subjects, and his Queen or the house of <hi>Bourbon</hi> with his own hands.</p>
            <p>There is another high prerogative which the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop claimes, which is to summon Generall Councells, which <hi>Montanus,</hi> who was presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> from the Pope, did avouch in open assembly upon a design of removing the Councell to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> where he among other things did positively assert and pronounce, <hi>Caesarem nempe non Dominum a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Moreover the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a great stroake in preserving the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal peace of Christendom, and keeping Earthly Potentates from clashing one with another. In so much that the Pope may be compar'd to that Isthmos of land which runns twixt the <hi>Ionian</hi> and <hi>Aegaean</hi> Seas, keeping their waters from jusling one with another. Nor is the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> thus powerfull only by his spirituall Authority, by vertue whereof, besides Patriark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, and a world of Bishops, he hath 70. Cardinalls, who are accounted equal to Princes, and who, as they are all of his making, so are they at his devotion; which number of 70. was limited by a solomn diploma, or Bull of <hi>Sixtus Quintus;</hi> and the election to be alwaies in <hi>December,</hi> so many daies before <hi>Christmas;</hi> which is a general Jubile of rejoycing for the Nativity of our Saviour. And as these Cardinals are Princes Companions, so have they revenues accordingly from the Common aerarium, or Treasury of the Church, which is an unknown thing and inexhaustible. For as long as men have soules within them, and believe there is a Heaven or Hell, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church can never want Mony. There is a proverbe in <hi>Italy, Al papa non mancano maj da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari quando non manca la mano &amp; la penna.</hi> The Pope can never want Money as long as he hath fingers to write. In so much that when a league was struck twixt <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. <hi>Phillip</hi> the 2. and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> whereas the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was to be at half the charge, the <hi>Venetians</hi> two thirds of the other half, &amp; the Pope the sixth part of a third; The <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador took him up somewhat short, telling him, <hi>that his Holinesse quill might command all the Wealth of</hi> Europe. In that age there were 130. Archbishopricks, and a thousand and seventeene Bishopricks that the Pope had the confirmation of, besides those of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies.</hi> Touching Monasteries and Religious Claustral Houses, there were in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifths time, and <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. which was 60. years before, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred and 44. thousand; of Parishes two hundred and fourscore eight thousand, which the Pope had influence upon. In so much that when there was an ouverture of a league twixt <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor and the <hi>French</hi> King, for a conjunction against the <hi>Turk;</hi> there was a proposition made, that every Monastery should contribute 6. Crownes yearly, and every Parish 52. Crownes towards the support of the Warre, which would have amounted to near upon 16. Millions <hi>per ann.</hi> And for men, if there had been 10 cull'd out of every Monastery, it would have made an Army of fourteen hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand men: Nor should so much regard be had to the number, as to the quality of the men, who having been accustomed to penances, to fasting, and watchings, could endure more hardship then other men. Add hitherto the zeal they would have to the Cause, being Votaries and Religious persons; holding the Pope to be an Earthly God, and that those who lose their lifes in any service or expedition warranted by his Cruzada, deserve a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of beatitude in Heaven. Such an Army as this the Pope can raise, which no Mundan Potentate can do, or ever could do; Who out of a conceit of the Holinesse they bear to his Function, and power of his Commission, would

runne through fire and water, to serve him with their Soule, as well as with their bodies.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Pope thus potent among the Ecclesiastiques, for spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and perquisits, but he is also a Great Temporal Prince: witness the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and <hi>Bolonia;</hi> Each whereof singly is able to support a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Soveraign Prince, besides other signories which he hath. Wherefore it was well express'd by the Poet, speaking of the Pope.</p>

            <p>This is the largest field for matter that possibly an Orator can run in, me thinks it hath no Horison.

Therefore most noble Princes, I hold it safer to strike saile, and launch out no further into this Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of matter: Wherefore I will bid a farewell for this time to fair <hi>Italy,</hi> and conclude with three several Characters, which three famous Authors gives her. <hi>Mamertinus</hi> the Panegyrist calls her <hi>Gentium Dominam,</hi> The Lady of all Nations. <hi>Rutilius Numatianus</hi> calls her <hi>Caelestem, mundi<expan>

            <p>But to revert a little, touching the older sect of <hi>Italians,</hi> Authors, there is more vice then vertu to be found in most of them; witnes those triumvirs of wanton love, <hi>Catullus, Tibullus,</hi> and <hi>Propertius; Ovid</hi> might be called a pander

to <hi>Venus</hi> in some of his works; what spurcidicall and obscene things doe we read in <hi>Martiall,</hi> and <hi>Iuvenall?</hi> what a foolish humor was that in <hi>Persius</hi> to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obscurity so much?

Now <hi>Cicero</hi> whom we magnifie above all, if we well observe him, we shall find that he sate often upon two stooles. <hi>Petrus Bembus</hi> was such a slave to <hi>Cicero,</hi> and so sworn to his words, that he infected <hi>Longolius</hi> with the same humor, who would use no other <hi>Latin</hi> words but what he found in <hi>Cicero;</hi> Therefore the Senat of <hi>Venice</hi> is alwayes call'd by him <hi>Patres Conscripti;</hi> Dukes and Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>Reges &amp; Regna;</hi> The sophy of <hi>Persia,</hi> and Gran Turk, <hi>Reges Armeniae &amp; Thracum; Faith</hi> is call'd by him <hi>persuasion; Excommunication, Interdiction of fire and water;</hi> Nunns are call'd <hi>Vestalls,</hi> The Pope <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> The Emperour <hi>Caesar,</hi> &amp;c. In so much that he holds any word barbarous that is not found in <hi>Cicero;</hi> But touching learning and eloquence we well know that <hi>Greece</hi> hath been the true source of both, whence the <hi>Romans</hi> have fill'd their cisterns; Nay, for the <hi>Latin</hi> toung herself we know she is two thirds <hi>Greek,</hi> all her scientificall words, and tearms of art are deriv'd from the <hi>Greek:</hi> In so much that it is impossible for any to be a perfect <hi>Latinist,</hi> unlesse he understand the <hi>Greek</hi> also.</p>
            <p>I will go a little back to <hi>Bembo</hi> again, who as you have heard was so fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, that he would use no words but pure <hi>Ciceronian;</hi> but this fancy drew him to a pure prophanes, for it brought him to contemne the Epistles of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and in a kind of slighting way to call them <hi>Epistolaccias,</hi> disswading his friends from reading them, least they should corrupt their eloquence. What shall I say of <hi>Sanazarius,</hi> that in three books he writ of Jesus Christ, he hath not the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> through the whole work? and the reason one gave was, that they were not <hi>Latin</hi> words; he puts the <hi>Sibylls</hi> works in the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins hands, and making no use of <hi>Esay</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> he makes use of pagan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to prove the coming of Christ.</p>
            <p>But to leave these santastiques, I will now be more serious, and pry a little into the <hi>Canon-law,</hi> which hath such a vogue in <hi>Italy;</hi> It makes the Crown a slave to the Miter, and the scepter to the crosier, and the Emperours <hi>throne</hi> to the Popes <hi>chair;</hi> Nay it lessens and distracts the allegeance of the subject to his natural rightfull prince; For it is the concordant opinion of all the Canonists; <hi>Imperij vasallos criminis Rebellionis, &amp; Majestatis haud esse reos, si pro Pontifice Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano adversus Imperatorem ipsum pugnent;</hi> The vassalls of the Empire cannot be guilty of the crime of Rebellion, if they take armes for the Roman Bishop against the Emperour; And <hi>Bartolus</hi> himself, who by <hi>Schurfius</hi> is called <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster veritatis,</hi> the Master of truth, by <hi>Menochius, Iurisconsultorum signifer,</hi> the standard-bearer of Reason, by <hi>Natta, Excellentissimus Doctor,</hi> by others the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Law,</hi> the <hi>Guide of the Blind,</hi> the <hi>Mirroir and Father of verity;</hi> holding that his works are worthy to be bound with the <hi>Sacred Code,</hi> averres the same in favour of the Pope, though he poorely excuseth it, that he held these te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, when he was engaged in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>Moreover, these <hi>Canonists</hi> are not only content to give his Holines the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, but also of the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and indeed of all the Kingdoms upon earth: There are some think there are Kingdoms likewise in the <hi>Air,</hi> and he may as well pretend a power para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount over them also.

His first rise was when <hi>Constantin</hi> gave him <hi>Rome,</hi> and it was a notable rise; yet all others, the Canonists excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do question the validity of this donation, and <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> himself did so before he was Pope: for said he, <hi>Callidè id provisum a Pontifice;</hi> It was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously provided by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that this should be alwayes under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,

whether that donation of <hi>Constantine</hi> was valid or not valid, that such a donation might be presumed still to have been; so the Popes are not much displeased that another question should be still litigated, and that the Schools should ring with the debate, <hi>Whether that power which the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath over Princes in</hi> temporalibus <hi>be directly, or indirectly;</hi> for the stating of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion it self presupposeth that he hath a power. But many Princes, not only those who have quite shaken off his yoke; but others who still adhere to <hi>Rome,</hi> have quite freed themselves of this servitude; <hi>France</hi> did it long since in the clash that happen'd 'twixt <hi>Philip le bell</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, claiming a jurisdiction in <hi>Gallia</hi> over Temporals; but the King wrote to him in these tart words, <hi>Que ta tres-grande sottise scache</hi>—Let thy great foolishnes know, that in Temporals we are subject to none but to God himself, and they who think otherwise are sots—.</p>
            <p>And Monsieur <hi>Nogaret</hi> going afterwards to <hi>Rome</hi> in quality of Ambassador, and using some bold termes at his Audience, the Pope upbraided him that his Father had been burnt for a Heretique; thereupon <hi>Nogaret</hi> tooke him, with a Gantlet, which hee had on his hand, such a cuffe under the eare, that fell'd him.</p>
            <p>It is memorable also in what termes the Greek Churches writ to <hi>Iohn</hi> the third, who demanding plenitude of power over the Church universall, sent him word, <hi>Potentiam tuam summam circa tuos subditos firmiter credimus, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiam tuam summam tollerare non possumus, avaritiam satiare non valemus. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus tecum, Dominus nobiscum.</hi> We firmely beleeve thy supreme power over thy own subjects, but we cannot endure thy pride, nor are we able to satiate thy covetousnesse. The Devill be with thee, and God with us. It was an odde farewell.</p>
            <p>Nor of late years touching the right to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> would <hi>Philip</hi> the second, though extremely devoted to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> stand to the decision of the Pope after the death of <hi>Henry,</hi> of whom it is very memorable, that he died the Moon being in an Eclipse, and the very same day and hour that he had been born 68 years before. No, King <hi>Philip</hi> thought that the Sword was fittest to be Umpire in that business, which he made accordingly. Of such an opinion was <hi>Paul</hi> the third also for maintainance of his power; for he was us'd to laugh at those who would make use of arguments to maintain the Pontifical power; no, he was us'd to say, It is not the <hi>Word</hi> only, but the <hi>Sword</hi> which must defend that; good Garrisons, Castles, and Bastions must do it, as well as Excomunications and Buls.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> of late years gave a shrewd wound to the Papal power through the sides of <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth; when he had threatned them with spiritual Armes, <hi>Nicolao Pontano</hi> the <hi>Doge,</hi> or Duke, a man of a free soul, answered the Nuncio, <hi>That if Rome would dart her thunderbolts so rashly,</hi> verendum esse, ne qui Graeci olim fuissent, è Latio in Graeciam migrâssent, <hi>it was to be feared that they who were Greeks of old, might goe again from Italy to Greece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> meaning to the Greek Church. In this quarrel the Pope had recourse to <hi>Spain</hi> for to appear in it, and thereupon did much complement with the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> but a little under the dignity of a Pope: He termed him, <hi>Basin Hispanicae coronae, super qua acquiescat Monarchia Catholica, unicum Ecclesiae fundamentum.</hi> He writ, that <hi>Lerma</hi> was the support of the Spanish Crown, upon which the Catholique Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy did rest, the onely prop of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the year 1337. <hi>Lodovicus Bavarus</hi> being Emperour, there happen'd some contrasts 'twixt the Emperour and the Pope, who alledged that the Electors made him King onely, but he made him Emperour. Hereupon at a solemn Diet this notable Sanction was enacted. <hi>Sacrosanctum Imperium, summa in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris potestas, coeleste donum est; Imperator enim primus ante omnes, secundus post Deum est, per quem, leges, jura, regna humanae genti largitur aeterna Majestas, &amp; tam grande nomen à solo Deo traditur, cui soli me Reipub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> administrandae ratione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendam</hi>

By the election of the Heptarchicall Electors, according to the custome of our Ancestors, and by the Law of Nations he is King, and call'd so: For him to send Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the Priest of Rome, that he would authorize him, and give him leave to administer, is against the Majesty of the Empire; but to binde himself unto him by oath, and seek of him the use of the royal Diadem, is Religion. The Pastor hath no right to any of these things, who is servant to his sheep, and serves the flock in consecrating the Lord: For by right of suffrage, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Electors and people, every one reignes. That these things are true, is well known to all those that are vers'd in Antiquity never so little, where they shall finde this Doctrine confirm'd not onely by Caesarean, but Pontificial testimonies themselves. Yet neverthelesse some Sciolists, or little modern Saints doe not blush to teach the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord is a Beneficiary to the Shepheard, and that the Emperour may not be call'd Prince of Princes, till he receive his authority from <hi>servus servorum,</hi> from the servant of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as the Pope stiles himself to be. But this cannot be without much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Christian Commonwealth, and without the utter overthrow of the Imperial Majesty, on which so many Princes and Potentates depend. Therefore it may be called a Doctrin suggested by the <hi>Stygian</hi> Prince, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth out of hell.</p>
            <p>Therefore we decree and divulge it for an everlasting Sanction, that the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarean Majesty is derived from the power of Election, and not from any sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, consent, or confirmation of Pontificall authority. And whosoever shall maintain, publish, or teach otherwise, we pronounce him criminall of High Treason, a professed Enemy to the Imperial Commonwealth, and worthy of capitall punishment, or Proscription, that the property of his goods be altered and confiscated.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding this solemn Sanction, how hath the <hi>Papal</hi> power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd upon the <hi>Imperial</hi> of late times? <hi>Caesar</hi> was us'd to summon universal Councells. It was <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who call'd the <hi>Nicene</hi> Counsel. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> the <hi>Constantinopolitan: Theodosius Iunior</hi> the <hi>Ephesian. Martianus</hi> that of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95159:96"/>
               <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which four Councels are next in authority to the 4. Evangelists, they are like the 4. Rivers that ran through <hi>Paradis.</hi> Besides how many other General Councels were indicted by Emperors. Besides it was their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to institute Popes. <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. created <hi>Clement</hi> the 2. <hi>Damasus</hi> the 2. <hi>Leo</hi> 9. and <hi>Victor</hi> the 2. Nay <hi>Caesar</hi> was us'd to punish the contumacies, and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances of the Pope. So did <hi>Otto</hi> the 1. chastice Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Benedict. Henry</hi> the 3. <hi>Sylvester</hi> and <hi>Gregory. Henry</hi> the 5. depos'd Pope <hi>Paschal.</hi> There is a cloud of examples to prove this. The summons of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. to <hi>Gregory Hildebrand,</hi> that Satanical St. as <hi>Damianus</hi> stiles him, are very remarkable. <hi>Tu Hildebrande, non jam Apostolice, sed false Monache descende, vendicatam tibi sedem Apostolicam relinque. Alius sedem B. Petri ascendet, qui nulla violentiam Religione palliet, sed Beati Petri doctrinam doceat. Ego Henricus Rex dei gratiâ cum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Episcopis nostris tibi dicimus descende, descende.</hi> Thou <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who art no apostolical, but a false Monk, descend; leave the Apostolical seat which thou claimst, another shall ascend blessed <hi>Peters</hi> Throne, who will not palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate violence with Religion, but teach <hi>Peters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> pure Doctrine. <hi>I Henry by the grace of God King, with all our Bishops do tell thee, descend, descend.</hi> I do not see but the Emperor is <hi>Caesar</hi> still, and endow'd with the same power.</p>
            <p>Now, touching the oth which the Pope exhibits to the Emperor, it is not an Oth of alleageance or fidelity, but that Oth relates to the protection, and defence which he is bound thereby to give the Holy Church, which Lords use to promise ordinarily to their Vassalls, and temporal Princes to their subjects. And whereas of old, the Emperor out of a pious reverence to the Church, did use to calculate the time of his reign from the day of his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the Pope, we know well that that custom is grown obsolet, and antiquated by a long desuetude; In so much that the <hi>German</hi> or Electorian Coronation is now as valid as the other. And I pray how many Emperors have omitted the Papal Coronation, and neglected those superfluous forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and ceremonies? The Emperor <hi>Henricus Auceps,</hi> being invited by the Pope to be crown'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> answered, It was sufficient for him to be King of the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> and so oblig'd to protect <hi>Germany</hi> from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion of infidells. <hi>Rodolph</hi> the 1. gave such an other answer, being advis'd to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to be crown'd. <hi>Italy said he, I know, hath consum'd many Alman Kings, I will not to</hi> Rome, <hi>I am already King, I am already an Emperor, and I hope I shall be able to act for the Christian Common-wealth, as if I had perform'd that ceremony at</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>The Canonists, whose main endeavours are to elevate the Popes Miter above the Imperial Majesty, would have it; <hi>that when</hi> Caesar <hi>dies, the Right is devolv'd to the Pope, till a new Election.</hi> But we well know, most noble Princes, that by our Golden bull it is ordain'd otherwise, &amp; that during the Vacancy of the Empire, the right of Administration appertains to the <hi>Electors of the Rhine and Saxony.</hi> It is well known how <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. would have molested <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 1. by his <hi>Caraffical Canons,</hi> but to little purpose. For as Serpents do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally retain a poyson still in them, though they do not alwaies vent it; so the <hi>Roman</hi> seaven headed <hi>Beast</hi> doth still keep within him that malignant humor towards the Emperor; which may chance be his own destruction at last: as we read of <hi>Iohn Baptista</hi> Bishop of <hi>Concordia,</hi> who at a <hi>Ducal</hi> feast in <hi>Venice,</hi> kept in his gutts that Wind which should have found vent backward, so long, that he died of it. Now touching the Right that his Holinesse hath to <hi>Rome</hi> by the donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> it is the same that <hi>Venice</hi> hath to the Dominion of the Adriatique Gulph; they are both of them no other then Titles of <hi>Straw:</hi> yet that of <hi>Rome</hi> doth produce the Pope much grain. And as that vainglorious Citty was first founded by Fugitives and Robbers, and afterwards patched up an Empire of <hi>varia magna latrocinia,</hi> of divers great Theeveries (for King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are little better) which shee got by oppression, tyranny, and rapine;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95159:97"/>
so the same genius remaines still in <hi>Rome,</hi> for she may be sayed to be a Harpye still, and to robbe all the Christian World that's subject to her by her merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pardons, Buls, and Indulgences: She seldome takes the <hi>Lamb</hi> without his <hi>Fleece:</hi> Lord, how is she degenerated from her self when she was a Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christian! in those times there were golden Priests, and wooden Chal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Indeed the <hi>Italians</hi> are generally covetous, and it is to foment their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, whereof they are the greatest embracers of any people. About the precincts of <hi>Padoa,</hi> there were two brothers that in a cleer shine night were walking in the fields, and one of them casting his eyes up to the Firmament, wished that he had as many fat Oxen as there were Starres in the Heavens. The other presently wished, that he had a Field as large as the Firmament; the other replying, what he would doe with it? he answered, To feed your Oxen. But the judgement of Heaven is observable herein; for as they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied discourse about these prophane wishes, they fell a quarrelling, and so slew one another in the place.</p>
            <p>And now, I pray, what Nation is more vindicative than the <hi>Italian?</hi> How many have been murther'd for casting but a few glances upon another mans wife out of a window? What various inventions have they of poysoning, sometimes by the smoak of a candle, sometimes by the suavity of a flower, sometimes by a poyson'd glove or handkerchief, sometimes by small crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes with poyson'd needles instead of arrowes. What an inhumane horrid revenge did a <hi>Millanez</hi> take of an old friend of his, to whom having been reconciled after some quarrell, he bore still a black rancor in his breast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and having surpris'd him in a convenient place, he put a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his throat, vowing that if hee would not doe one thing, hee was a dead man, which was <hi>to abjure God Almighty,</hi> the infortunate man did it thrice, and the third time as he was pronouncing the words, he stabb'd him to the heart, and so dispatcht him, glorying afterwards of the fulnesse of his revenge; for hee had destroyed his <hi>body and soul?</hi> And now that I am in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> me-thinkes I see that glorious Empresse <hi>Beatrix, Barbarossa</hi>'s wife, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the streets upon a Mule, with her face towards the posteriors of her, and holding the tayle in her hand for a bridle; O most unmanly, and base unparallell'd peece of barbarism; but the Emperour was soundly quit with them; for besides those whom he put to death for this affront, he caus'd the chiefest of the Town to lick out figges being stuck in a Mules Fundament, whence proceeded that proverbiall Jeere which continues to this day in <hi>Italy, Ecco la fico; Lo here the figge:</hi> For when they would mock any, they use to put the thumb betwixt the two forefingers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce those words.</p>
            <p>And, to draw to a period, I pray hear what that noble <hi>French</hi> personage, <hi>Alexander de Pontaymery,</hi> a man of a candid and clear judgement, speakes of this wanton Countrey of <hi>Italy, Nous allons,</hi> saith he, <hi>en Italie auec une despense incroyable achepter la seule ombre de la civitité, &amp; nous en rapportons la masse entiere de vices; ceux de Milan nous apprenment la tromperie, le Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en nous rend Hypocrites, le Romain nous plonge en un Ocean d' Atheisme &amp; d' impieté, &amp; le Neapolitain nous change en satyre, où plustost nous fait un es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goust, &amp; un cloaque de tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which yet in som respect turn'd mightily to their advantage, for it fil'd <hi>Belgium</hi> with wealth and tresure; In regard the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being of so haughty an humor, that he wold not relinquish his right to those Provinces, he employ'd so much Indian Gold and Silver to reduce them that countervayl'd the price of the Countrey forty times over; And had it not been for those unhappy Warrs, the Catholique King might by this time have pav'd all his Churches and palaces with <hi>Peru</hi> Ingots, and <hi>Mezican</hi> Patacoons.</p>

And for them of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> as they were in former ages much renoun'd for their trophies and feats abroad, (for one of them built the walls of our <hi>Vienna</hi> returning from the Holy land, which, to confesse the truth, was more honor to <hi>him</hi> then to the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> who articled with him to do it) I say as some ages since, the <hi>English</hi> were famous, so of late yeers they were <hi>envied</hi> by all Nations for their mighty encrease of wealth and commerce, with peace and afluence of all felicity; Untill these late intestine Warrs happen'd, which makes them now to be rather pittied then Envied, to be rather scorned then respected; yet they have discover'd that the same spirit of magnanimity and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse remaines still in the hearts of the peeple, as appear'd by those sundry battails, sieges and Skirmishings they had, which were more then happen'd in any Countrey for the time, considering the extent of ground; But that addition of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> was unhappy and fatall to her, for from that cold Northern dore blew all her troubles.</p>
            <p>And now do I much admire what came into that Prince his mind, who spoke of <hi>Germany,</hi> to be so tart against her, and to throw so much dirt into the face of his own Countrey; surely as I beleeve he took those taunts and contumelies out of som forr ein Author, who was no great friend to <hi>Germany;</hi> but 'tis as easie for Her to shake them off, as feathers off a Cloak, or small flies when they infest us in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but as <hi>Tiberius</hi> answer'd one, who told him of som aspersions that were cast abroad upon him, <hi>Non indignamur aliquos esse qui nobis male dicat, satis est si hoc habemus ne quis nobis malè faciat;</hi> We are not angry that ther are some who <hi>speak</hi> ill of us, It is enough that we are in such a condition, that no body can <hi>do</hi> us any ill; so may <hi>Germany</hi> say of her self. 'Tis too tru, that <hi>Caesar</hi> hath receiv'd some demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution in point of power, but though som Countreys which seem to have revolted from him seem to usurp his rights, yet he still claims them, and they acknowledg fealty; We know that <hi>Frederique</hi> the second writ to the Pope, <hi>Italia haereditas est mea, &amp; hoc notum est toti orbi;</hi> you know <hi>Italy</hi> is my inheritance, and this is known to all the world, therfore when <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth wold have made <hi>Cosmo</hi> of <hi>Medici King</hi> of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> the Emperour did countermand it; And afterwards when <hi>Pius</hi> the fift created him, <hi>Gran Duke of Toscany, Caesar</hi> did protest against it, as an invasion of his imperiall prerogative; though that title was afterwards confirm'd to <hi>Francis</hi> his Son by the Emperors special charter, and intercession of friends, yet with this proviso, that he shold acknowledg himself <hi>Beneficiary</hi> of the Empire. Moreover it continueth to this day that when any difference happen twixt any of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes about extent of Territory, the decision herof belongs to the Imperiall Court; Ther is a late pregnant example herof, for when the <hi>Genoways</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon the Marquis of <hi>Final,</hi> and had in a manner exterminated him from House and home, the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did summon them to answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs, with this menacing addition, <hi>Nisi Feciali suo parerent urbem &amp; agrum Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensem</hi>

Touching the Pope, all the world know that he is no other <hi>de Iure</hi> but a Vassall or Chaplain to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who gave him the praefecture of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Countrey adjacent; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation wherof, he solemnly seeks of every new Emperour: Therfore <hi>Caesar</hi> is not fallen from his property and Imperiall Right to <hi>Rome</hi> to this day; Nor is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary for him to make his personall residence in <hi>Rome,</hi> it being a Rule, <hi>Ibi est Roma, ubi est Imperator,</hi> Ther <hi>Rome</hi> is, where the Emperour is; We know that when <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, did first transferr his Court to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and fixed there, she being the fittest Citty to rule the world by reason of her situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, yet he and his successors did still entitle themselfs Roman Emperours, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving still their first rights; as the <hi>Athenians</hi> were sayed, notwithstanding that they had relinquished the Citty to conserve <hi>Athens</hi> still in their Ships; So that it may be sayd without much impropriety of speech, that <hi>Rome</hi> is now at <hi>Vienna,</hi> or <hi>Prague,</hi> or <hi>Norimberg,</hi> whersoever the imperiall person of <hi>Caesar</hi> is: All the Hans Towns, though they have made use of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and procur'd large priviledges for som pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary contributions, yet they acknowledg him still their supreme liege Lord; Adde herunto that <hi>Savoy, Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> are members of the Empire to this day; as also the <hi>Neitherlands</hi> or <hi>Belgium,</hi> therfore when the confederat Provinces having revolted from <hi>Spain,</hi> had sent a splendid legation to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to take them under her protection, the just and wise Princesse put it to deliberation of Councell, as it appears yet upon Record, <hi>An cum alterius principis subditis protectionis faedus inire liceret, &amp; an Belgae faederati offerre jure possent sine Caesaris consensu qui supremus Feudi Dominus erat;</hi> I say the said prudent Queen put it to debate, whether it was lawfull to enter into a league with the Subjects of another Prince, and whether those confederated Provinces could make such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall with the consent of <hi>Caesar</hi> who was Soveraign Lord of the <hi>Fee:</hi> Wherupon the first answer she sent them was, <hi>Nihil sibi antiquius esse quam fidem cum honore con, unctam tueri, nec dum sibi liquere, quomodo salvo honore, &amp; conscientia integrâ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincias illas oblatas in protectionem multo minus in possessione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accipere posset,</hi> Nothing, sayd Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was of more Religion to her, then to conserve her Faith conjoyn'd with an honor worthy of a Prince, and that it did not yet appear unto her how with safety of her honor and integrity of Conscience, she cold undertake the protection, much more the possession of those Provinces: Yet afterwards som darknesses and jealousies encreasing 'twixt her and <hi>Spain,</hi> she undertook the protection. And she prov'd a brave Auxiliary unto them, both for men and Money, in so much that the foundation of that Free State may be sayd to be cimented with English blood; 'Tis tru, that <hi>France</hi> concurr'd with her for pure politicall respects, for they were both as Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras to the Spanish greatnes; Therfore although those sixe Fugitive Provinces which have revolted from <hi>Spain</hi> have been strangers to the Empire ever since, yet all the rest of the Provinces acknowledg their old homage to <hi>Caesar.</hi>

            <p>Lastly, touching ITALY, Renowned and Triumphant <hi>Italy,</hi> that Noble Prince who declaim'd in her praise spoke too sparingly, and he who pleaded against her, spoke too much, he rubb'd her sores with too rigid a hand, specially the imperiall seven-hill'd City, glorious and immortall <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom it seems that Providence hath a peculiar and more speciall care then ordinary, for although she hath bin so often ravish'd by such swarmes of barbarous peeple, yet she still-holds up her head; and though so many <hi>Crowns</hi> &amp; <hi>Scepters</hi> have forsaken her, yet the <hi>Crosier</hi> bears still up her aged limbs, and keeps her from falling. She, who in former ages preserved her self by <hi>Prowesse,</hi> doth do it now by <hi>piety.</hi> Touching her Bishops, that saying of <hi>Guicciardin</hi>'s was a little too virulent, wherin he tells us, <hi>Hodie tam depravati sunt mores, ut in Pontifice laudetur probitas cum caeterorum hominum nequitiam non excedit:</hi> Ther is such a deprivation of manners now a dayes crept into <hi>Rome,</hi> that if the Popes vices do not exceed those of an ordinary man, he is accounted vertuous. Touching the wealth of the Church, and the bounty of our Pious progenitors, I am none of those that repine at it, and I wold be loath to deprive Saint <hi>Peter</hi> of his patrimony, or have any of his lands to mingle with mine, for fear they shold prove as a Canker in my Estate, I wold be loath to exchange Souls with any of those that robb the Church, I would not fill my Chests with such <hi>Aurum Tholosanum:</hi> Ther was a remarkable thing happen'd in the time of <hi>Frederique</hi> the second, who being extremely incenc'd against <hi>Peter de Vineis</hi> his Secretary, caus'd him to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated; yet though he had so lost his eyes, the Emperour readmitted him to his Councel, because he was an extraordinary wise man: The Secretary was very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the losse of his eyes, and therfor studyed how to be reveng'd. Herupon ther being a Warre twixt the Emperour and the Pope, the Secretary <hi>de Vineis</hi> told him, <hi>Vires Ecclesiae suismet opibus esse conterendas,</hi> The power of the Church is to be quell'd by her own wealth: Herupon he advised the Emperour to sell som of the Church goods, which he did in <hi>Pisa</hi> and other places, which being done, the Secretary told him boldly, <hi>Imperator, injuriam mihi à te illatam ultus sum,</hi>—O Emperor I have now reveng'd my self of the injury that was done me, Thou hast drawn upon thy self already the hatred of <hi>men,</hi> and now I have drawn upon thee the hatred of <hi>God</hi> by this act of Sacrilege, therfor all things shall fare ill with thee hereafter, which proved accordingly as the History plainly tells us.</p>
            <p>Touching the excesses of some Popes, which <hi>Poggio</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> ripp up, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but among so many som must be bad; In the first Election that our Saviour himself made of his twelve Apostles, we know ther was <hi>one</hi> naught, But let it not be forgotten that the first 33.

            <p>And now me thinks, you expect with earnestnes, and a kind of impatience that I shold deliver my opinion touching the question which hath bin controverted so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, and canvas'd to an fro, with such high straines of Rhetoric and Energie of wit in so many fluent Orations swelling with such high tides of Eloquence, and learning; But I humbly desire to be excus'd herein, you know 'tis a rule of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity all the world over, <hi>that Comparisons are odious;</hi> Besides, under favour, neither the <hi>place</hi> nor <hi>persons</hi> of this Assembly, are fit to passe a definitive sentence hereof; We are all <hi>Germans,</hi> and do what we can, we must be a little indulgent to our own Countrey by an irresistible instinct of Nature: All Regions have som ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or other to make them lift up their crests. Let <hi>Germany</hi> glory that she hath the Prince Paramount of Christendom for her perpetuall guest, that <hi>Caesar</hi> keeps his Court in her. Let <hi>Spain</hi> be the Queen of <hi>Mines, France</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> let Great <hi>Britain</hi> be the Queen of <hi>Iles, Italy</hi> the Queen of Policy, with all sorts of Elegancies; let it be granted that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Pole</hi> are best a Horseback, the <hi>Englishman</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> upon a deck, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at a siege, the <hi>Italian</hi> in a Treaty, the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> upon a rampart, &amp;c. Every Nation hath a particular aptitude to somthing more then another, and this by the common decree of Nature, who useth to disperse her benefits, and not powre them all together upon any one peeple.</p>
            <p>And now, most splendid and magnificent Princes, my most dear Cosens and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriots, how shall I pay that due tribut of gratitude, which I confesse to have made my self liable unto, for this noble and vertuous <hi>Congress?</hi> truly, no words are strong enough to expresse my self herin, unlesse they were couch'd in such pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and gallant Orations which have bin formerly framd; All that I can say and desire for the present is, that you would please to accept of a <hi>lipp</hi>-payment only, (which yet is <hi>cordiall</hi>) untill som happy encounter may afford me an opportunity to return som reall acknowledgment: In the interim, most noble and hopefull Princes, well may your <hi>Soules</hi> fare, may your <hi>Vertues</hi> encrease, and your <hi>Fame</hi> flourish to all posterity.</p>
