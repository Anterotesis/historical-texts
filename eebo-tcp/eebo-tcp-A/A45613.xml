            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>OCeana</hi> is saluted by the Panegyrist after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plinie's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Oceana</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>O the most blessed and fortunate of all Countreys</hi> Oceana! <hi>How deservedly hath Nature with the bounties of Heaven and Earth endued thee? thy ever fruitfull womb not closed with<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Ice, nor dissolved by the raging Star; where</hi> Ceres <hi>and</hi> Bacchus <hi>are perpetuall Twins. Thy Woods are not the harbour of devouring beasts; nor thy continuall Verdure, the ambush of Serpents: but the food of innumerable herds and flocks presenting thee their Shepherdesse with distended dugs or golden Fleeces. The Wings of thy Night involve thee not in the horrour of darknesse, but have still some white feather, and thy Day is that for which we esteem life, the longest.</hi> But this Extasie of <hi>Plinie</hi>'s (as is observed by <hi>Bertius</hi>) seemeth to allude as well unto <hi>Marpesia</hi> and <hi>Panopea,</hi> now Provinces of this Common-Wealth as unto <hi>Oceana</hi> her self.</p>
            <p>To speak of the people in each of these Countreys, this of <hi>Oceana</hi> for so soft an one,<note place="margin">The Nature of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Essay 29.</note> is the most martiall in the whole World. <hi>Let States that aym at greatnesse (saith</hi> Verulamius) <hi>take heed how their Nobility and Gentlemen do multiply too fast, for that maketh the common Subject grow to be a Peasant and base Swain driven out of heart, and in effect but a Gentlemans labourer: Even as you may see in Coppice Woods, if you leave the Staddles too thick, you shall never have clean underwood, but shrubbs and bushes: So in Countries, if the Gentlemen be too many, the Commons will be base; and you will bring it to that, that not the hundredth pole will be fit for an Helmet; especially as to the Infantry which is the nerve of an Army, and so there will be great population and little strength. This which I speak of hath been no where better seen then by comparing of</hi> Oceana <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>whereof</hi> Oceana <hi>though far lesse in territory and population hath been neverthelesse an overmatch! in regard the middle people of</hi> Oceana <hi>make good Souldiers, which the Peasants in</hi> France <hi>do not.</hi> In which words, <hi>Verulamius</hi> (as Machiavill hath done before him) harps much upon a string which he hath not perfectly tuned, and that is the <hi>ballance of Dominion or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi>: as it followeth more plainly in his praise <hi>of the profound and admirable device of</hi> Panurgus <hi>King of</hi> Oceana, <hi>in making Farms and houses of Husbandry of a Standard, that is, maintained with such a proportion of Land unto them, as may breed a Subject to live in convenient plenty, and no servile condition, and to keep the Plough in the hand of the owners, and not meer hirelings: and thus
<pb facs="tcp:56348:6"/>
indeed (saith he) you shall attain unto</hi> Virgil's <hi>Character which he gives of ancient</hi> Italy:
<q>Terra potens armis at<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>

            </p>
            <p>But the Tillage bringing up a good Souldiery, bringeth up a good Common-Wealth: which the Author in the praise of <hi>Panurgus</hi> did not mind, nor <hi>Panurgus</hi> in deserving that praise; for where the owner of the Plough comes to have the Sword too, he will use it in defence of his own; whence it hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the people of <hi>Oceana</hi> in proportion unto their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety have been alwaies free: and the Genius of this Nation hath ever had some resemblance with that of antient <hi>Italy,</hi> which was wholly addicted unto Common-Wealths, and where <hi>Rome</hi> came to make the greatest accompt of her Rustick Tribes, and to call her Consuls from the Plough; for in the way of Parliaments, which was the Government of this Realm, men of Country Lives have been still intrusted with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test affairs, and the people have constantly had an aversion from the wayes of the Court, Ambition loving to be gay, and to fawn, hath been a gallantry looked upon as having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it of the Livery; and Husbandry or the Country way of life, though of a grosser spinning, as the best stuffe of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth according unto <hi>Aristotle, (Agricolarum democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca respublica optima)</hi> such an one being the most obstinate asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse of her liberty, and the least subject unto innovation or turbulency: Wherefore till the foundations (as will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shewed) were removed, this people was observed to be the least subject unto shakings and turbulency of any: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Common-wealths, upon which the City life hath had the stronger influence, as <hi>Athens,</hi> have seldome or never been quiet, but at the best are found to have injured their own businesse by overdoing it. Whence the <hi>Urbane</hi> Tribes of <hi>Rome</hi> consisting of the <hi>Turbaforensis,</hi> Libertines that had received their freedom by manumission, were of no reputation in comparison of the Rusticks. It is true, that with <hi>Venice</hi> it may seem to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, in regard the Gentlemen (for so are all such called as have right unto the Government) are wholly addicted unto the City life<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but then the <hi>Turbaforensis,</hi> the Secretaries, <hi>cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadini,</hi> with the rest of the populacy are wholly excluded; otherwise a Common-wealth consisting but of one City, would doubtlesse be stormy, in regard that ambition would be every mans trade: but where it consisteth of a Country, the plough in the hands of the owner, findeth him a better calling, and produceth the most innocent and steddy Genius of a Common-wealth, such as is that of <hi>Oceana.</hi>

the dry nurse of a populous and hardy people; but where the Staddles have been formerly too thick: whence their courage answered not unto their hardinesse, except in the Nobility, who governed that Country much after the manner of <hi>Poland,</hi> save that the King was not elective, till the people received their liberty, the yoke of the Nobility being broken by the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> of <hi>Oceana:</hi> which in grateful return is thereby provided with an inexhaustible Magazeen of Auxiliaries: <hi>Panopea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The nature of the <hi>Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans.</hi>
               </note> the soft mother of a slothful and pusillanimous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is a neighbour Island, anciently subjected by the Arms of <hi>Oceana</hi>; since, almost depopulated for shaking off the Yoke, and at length replanted with a new Race. But (through what vertues of the soyl, or vice of the air soever it be) they come still to degenerate: wherefore seeing it is neither likely to yield men fit for Arms, nor necessary it should; it had been the interest of <hi>Oceana,</hi> so to have disposed of this Province, being both rich in the nature of the soyl, and full of commodious Ports for Trade, that it might have been ordered for the best in relation unto her purse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Which in my opinion (if it had been thought upon in time) might have been best done by planting it with Jewes, allowing them their own Rites and Lawes, for that would have brought them suddainly from all parts of the World, and in sufficient numbers; and though the Jews be now altogether for Merchandize, yet in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (since their exile from whence they have not been Landlords) they were altogether for agriculture; and there is no cause why a man should doubt, but having a fruitfull Country and good Ports too, they would be good at both. <hi>Panopea</hi> well peopled, would be worth a matter of four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions dry rents, that is, besides the advantage of the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Trade, which with a Nation of that industry comes at least unto as much more. Wherefore <hi>Panopea</hi> being farm'd out unto the Jews, and their heirs for ever, for the pay of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial-Army to protect them during the term of seven years, and for two millions annual revenue from that time forward; besides, the Customs, which would pay the Provincial Army, would have been a bargain of such advantage, both unto them and this <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> as is not to be found otherwise by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To receive the Jewes after any other manner into a Common-wealth, were to maim it: for they of all Nations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver incorporate, but taking up the room of a Limb, are of no use or office unto the body, while they suck the nourishment which would sustain a natural and useful member.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Panopea</hi> had been so disposed of, that Knapsack, with the <hi>Marpesian</hi> Auxilliary, had been an inestimable treasure; the situation of these Countries being Islands, (as appeaas by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> how advantagious such an one is to the like Government)

                  <hi>JAnotti,</hi> the most excellent describer of the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> divideth the whole Series of Government into two Times or Periods. The one ending with the liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the course or <hi>Empire,</hi> as I may call it, of <hi>antient prudence,</hi> first discovered unto mankind by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in the fabrick of the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward picked out of his footsteps in nature, and unanimously followed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> The other beginning with the Arms of <hi>Caesar</hi>; which extinguishing liberty were the Translation of <hi>ancient</hi> into <hi>modern prudence,</hi> introduced by those inundations of <hi>Huns, Goths, Vandalls, Lombards, Saxons,</hi> which breaking the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> deformed the whole face of the world, with those ill features of Government, which at this time are become far worse in these Western parts, except <hi>Venice,</hi> (which escaping the hands of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by vertue of her impregnable situation, hath had her eye fixed upon <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prudence</hi>: and is attained to a perfection even beyond her Copy.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56348:8"/>
                  <note place="margin">Definitions of Government.</note>Relation being had unto these two Times, Government (to define it (<hi>de jure</hi>) or according to <hi>ancient Prudence</hi>) is an Art whereby a Civil Society of men is instituted and preserved upon the foundation of common right or interest, or (to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi>) it is the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Lawes</hi> and not of <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Government (to define it (<hi>de facto</hi>) or according unto <hi>modern Prudence</hi>) is an Art whereby some man, or some few men, subject a City or a Nation, and rule it according unto his or their private interest<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which, because the Lawes in such cases are made according to the interest of a man, or of some few Families, may be said to be the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and not of <hi>Lawes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former kind is that which <hi>Machiavill</hi> (whose Books are neglected) is the <hi>onely Politician</hi> that hath gone about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treive:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 180.</note> and that, <hi>Leviathan (who would have his Book imposed upon the Universities</hi>) goes about to destroy. For, <hi>It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>another errour of</hi> Aristotle's <hi>Politicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 377.</note> 
                  <hi>that in a well ordered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, not Men should govern, but the Lawes: What man that hath his natural Senses, though he can neither write nor read, does not find himself governed by them he fears, and believes can kill or hurt him when he obeyeth not? or, who believes that the Law can hurt him, which is but words and paper, without the hands and swords of men?</hi> I confesse, that (<hi>Magistratus est lex armata</hi>) the Magistrate upon his Bench, is that unto the Law, which a Gunner upon his Platform is unto his Cannon. Neverthelesse I should not dare to argue with a man of any ingenuity, after this manner: An whole Army, though they can neither write nor read, are not afraid of a Platform, which they know is but Earth or Stone<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor of a Cannon, which without a hand to give fire unto it, is but cold Iron; therefore a whole Army is afraid of one man. But of this kind is the ratiocination of <hi>Leviathan</hi> (as I shall shew in divers places that come in my way) throughout his whole Politicks, or worse; as where he saith <hi>of</hi> Aristotle <hi>and of</hi> Cicero,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 111.</note> 
                  <hi>of the</hi> Greeks <hi>and of the</hi> Romans, <hi>who lived under popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar States, that they derived those rights not from the principles of Nature, but transcribed them into their books, out of the practice of their own Common-Wealths, as Grammarians describe the rules of Language out of Poets.</hi> Which is as if a man should tell famous <hi>Hervey,</hi> that he transcribed his <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>bloud,</hi> not out of the <hi>Principles of Nature,</hi> but out of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of this or that body.</p>
               <p>To go on therefore with this Preliminary Discourse: I shall divide it according unto the two definitions of Government relating unto <hi>Janotty's</hi> two Times), into two parts: the <hi>first</hi> treating of the Principles of Government in general, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancients; the <hi>second</hi> treating of the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments

of <hi>Oceana</hi> in particular, and in that of <hi>Modern Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Government, according to the Antients, and their learned Disciple <hi>Machiavill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Division of Government<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> (the onely Polititian of later Ages) is of three kinds; The Government of <hi>One man,</hi> or of the <hi>better sort,</hi> or of the <hi>whole people</hi>: which by their more learned names are called <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy</hi>; these they hold, through their pronenesse to degenerate, to be all <hi>evill.</hi> For whereas they that govern, should govern according to reason; if they govern according unto passion, they do that which they should not do: Wherefore as reason and passion are two things, so Government by Reason is one thing, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Government by Passion is another thing, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies another Government: as a body that is alive is one thing, and a body that is dead is another thing, but not alwaies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Creature, though the corruption of one come at length unto the generation of another. The corruption then of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> is called <hi>Tyranny</hi>; that of <hi>Aristocracy, Oligarchy</hi>; and that of <hi>Democracy, Anarchy.</hi> But <hi>Legislators</hi> having found these three Governments at the best to be naught, have invented an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other consisting of a mixture of them all, which onely is good; this is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Ancients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Leviathan</hi> is positive, that they are all deceived, and that there is no other Government in Nature then one of the three; as also that the flesh of them cannot stink, the names of their corruptions being but the names of mens phansies; which will be understood when we are shown which of them was <hi>Senatus Populus<expan>

               </p>
               <p>To go mine own way, and yet to follow the Ancients: The Principles of Governments are twofold, <hi>Internal,</hi> or the goods of the <hi>Mind</hi>; and <hi>External,</hi> or the goods of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Goods of the Mind and of Fortune.</note> The goods of the mind are natural or acquired virtues, as Wisdom, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Courage, &amp;c. The goods of Fortune are Riches. There be goods also of the Body, as Health, Beauty, Strength, but these are not to be brought unto account upon this score, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if a man or an Army acquire Victory or Empire, it is more from their Discipline, Arms, and Courage, then from their natural health, beauty, or strength, in regard that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conquered may have more of natural strength, beauty and health, and yet find little remedy. The Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then are in the goods of the <hi>mind,</hi> or in the goods of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> To the goods of the <hi>mind,</hi> answers <hi>Authority</hi>; to the goods of <hi>fortune, Power or Empire.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Empire and Authority.</note> though he be right where he saith, that <hi>Riches are Power</hi>; is mistaken where he saith, that <hi>Prudence, or the reputation of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is power</hi>: for the learning or prudence of a man is no more power, then the learning or prudence of a book or Authour,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56348:9"/>
which is properly Authority; a learned Writer may have authority though he have no power; and a foolish Magistrate may have power, though he have otherwise no esteem or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; the difference of these two is observed by <hi>Livy</hi> in <hi>Evander,</hi> of whom saith he, (<hi>regebat magis Authoritate quÃ m Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio</hi>) he ruled rather by authority then power.</p>
               <p>To begin with Riches, in regard that men are hung upon these,<note place="margin">

                  </note> not of choice as upon the other, but of necessity and by the teeth: for as much as he who wanteth bread, is his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that will feed him: if a man thus feed an whole people, they are under his Empire.</p>

               <p>But there be certain other confusions, which being rooted in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56348:9"/>
the ballance are of longer continuance, and of greater horror; as first, where a Nobility holdeth half the Property, or about that proportion, and the people the other half; in which case with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the ballance, there is no remedy but the one must eat out the other: as the people did the <hi>Nobility</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> and the <hi>Nobility</hi> the people in <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, when a Prince holdeth about half the Dominion, and the people the other half, which was the case of the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> planted part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their military Colonies, and partly upon the Senate and the people, the Government becometh a very shambles both of the Princes and the people. Somewhat of this nature are certain Governments at this day; which are said to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by confusion. In this case to fix the ballance is, to entail misery: But in the three former not to fix it is, to loose the Government. Wherefore it being unlawfull in <hi>Turky,</hi> that any should possesse Land but the Grand Signior, the ballance is fixed by the <hi>Law,</hi> and that <hi>Empire</hi> firm. Nor, though the Kings often fell, was the Throne of <hi>Oceana</hi> known to shake, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Statute of <hi>Alienations</hi> broke the pillars, by giving way unto the Nobility to sell their Estates, <hi>(Si terra recedat, Jonium Aegaeo frangat mare.) Lacedemon</hi> while she held unto her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Land made by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> was immoveable, but break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, could stand no longer. This kind of Law fixing the ballance in Lands is called <hi>Agrarian,</hi> and was first introduced by <hi>God himself,</hi> who divided the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Lots, and is of such virtue, that where ever it hath held, that Government hath not alter'd, except by consent: as in that unparallell'd example of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in liberty they would needs choose a King. But without an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> Government whether Monarchical, Aristocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Popular, hath no long Lease.</p>
               <p>For Dominion personal or in money, it may now and then stir up a <hi>Metius</hi> or a <hi>Manlius,</hi> which if the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> be not provided with some kind of <hi>Dictatorian</hi> power, may be dangerous, though it have been seldom or never successefull: because unto propriety producing Empire, it is required that it should have some certain root or foot-hold, which, except in Land, it cannot have, being otherwise as it were upon the wing.</p>

That the one Assembly was made Soveraign, whereas the people who onely were Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, were such from the beginning, as appears by the ancient style of their Covenants or Laws (<hi>censuere Patres, jussit Populus</hi>): That a Councill being made Soveraign, cannot be made such upon conditions; whereas<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the <hi>Decemviri</hi> being a Council that was made Soveraign, was made such upon conditions.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Machiavill</hi> hath missed it very narrowly and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, for not fully perceiving,<note place="margin">D. B. 1. C. 55.</note> that if a Common-wealth be galled by the Gentry, it is by their overballance; he speaks of the Gentry as hostile to popular Governments, and of popular Governments as hostile unto the Gentry; and makes us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the people in such are so enraged against them, that where they meet a Gentleman they kill him; which can never be proved by any one example, unlesse in civill Warr; seeing that even in <hi>Switz</hi> the Gentry are not onely safe, but in honour. But the ballance as I have laid it down, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen by <hi>Machiavill,</hi> is that which interpreteth him, and that which he confirmeth by his Judgment in many other as well as in this place, where he concludes, <hi>That he who will go about to make a Common-Wealth where there be many Gentlemen, unlesse he first destroy them, undertakes an impossibility: and that he who goes about to introduce Monarchy where the condition of the people is equal, shall never bring it to passe, unlesse he cull out such of them as are the most turbulent and ambitious, and make them Gentlemen or Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not in name but in effect, that is, by enriching them with Lands, Castles, and Treasures, that may gain them power amongst the rest, and bring in the rest unto dependence upon themselves, to the end that they maintaining their ambition by the Prince, the Prince may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his power by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore as in this place I agree with <hi>Machiavill,</hi> that a Nobility or Gentry overballancing a popular Government, is the utter bane and destruction of it; so I shall shew in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that a Nobility or Gentry in a popular Government not overballancing it, is the very life and soul of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The ballance of Forraign or Provincial Empire is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ballance of forraign Empire.</hi>
                  </note> A man may as well say that it is unlawfull for him who hath made a fair and honest purchase to have tenants, as for a Government that hath made a just progresse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of it self, to have Provinces. But how a Province may be justly acquired, appertaineth to another place; in this I am to shew no more, then how or upon what kind of ballance it is to be held; in order whereunto, I shall first shew upon what kind of ballance it is not to be held. It hath been said, that National or Independent <hi>Empire,</hi> of what kind soever, is to be exercised by them that have the proper <hi>ballance of Dominion</hi> in the Nation; wherefore Provincial or dependent Empire is not to be exercised by them that have the <hi>ballance of Dominion</hi> in the Province, because that would bring the Government from <hi>Provinciall</hi> and <hi>dependent,</hi> to <hi>National</hi> and <hi>independent.</hi> Absolute <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> neither planteth her people at home nor abroad, otherwise then as Tenants for life or at will; wherefore her <hi>National</hi> and her <hi>provincial</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is all one. But in Governments that admit the Citizen or Subject unto dominion in Lands, the richest are they that share most of the power at home: whereas the richest among the Provincials, though native Subjects, or Citizens that have been transplanted, are least admitted to the Government abroad: for men like flowers or roots being transplanted take after the soyl wherein they grow. Wherefore the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> by planting <hi>Colonies</hi> of her Citizens within the bound of <hi>Italy,</hi> took the best way of propagating her self, and naturalizing the Country; whereas if she had planted such Colonies without the bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> it would have alien'd the Citizens, and given a root unto liberty abroad, that might have sprung up forraign or savage and hostile to her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she never made any such dispersion of her self and her strength, till she was under the yoke of her <hi>Emperours,</hi> who disburdening themselves of the people, as having lesse appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of what they could do abroad then at home, took a contrary course.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mamaluc's,</hi> (which till any man shew me the contrary, I shall presume to have been a Common-wealth consisting of an Army, whereof the common Souldier was the People, the Commission-Officer the Senate, and the General the Prince) were forraigners, and by Nation <hi>Circussians,</hi> that govern'd <hi>Aegypt</hi>; wherefore these never durst plant themselves upon <hi>Dominion,</hi> which growing naturally up into the National in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56348:11"/>
must have dissolved the forraign yoke in that Province.</p>
               <p>The like in some sort may be said of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Government whereof is usually mistaken: for <hi>Venice,</hi> though she do not take in the people, never excluded them. This <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> the Orders whereof are the most <hi>Democratical</hi> or <hi>Popular</hi> of all others, in regard of the exquisite <hi>Rotation</hi> of the <hi>Senate,</hi> at the first institution took in the <hi>whole people</hi>; they that now live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Governments without participation of it, are such as have since either voluntarily chosen so to do, or were subdued by Arms. Wherefore the Subject of <hi>Venice</hi> is governed by <hi>Provinces,</hi> and the ballance of <hi>Dominion</hi> not standing, as hath been said, with Provincial Government: as the <hi>Mamaluc's</hi> durst not cast their Government upon this <hi>ballance</hi> in their <hi>Provinces,</hi> lest the <hi>National</hi> interest should have rooted out the <hi>forraign</hi>; so neither dare the <hi>Venetians</hi> take in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon this ballance, lest the <hi>forraign</hi> interest should root out the <hi>Nationall,</hi> which is that of the 3000 now governing; and by diffusing the Common-Wealth throughout her Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, lose the advantage of her <hi>situation,</hi> by which in a great part she subsisteth. And such also is the Government of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> unto which he deputeth Natives of his own Country, not admitting the <hi>Creolios</hi> unto the Government of those Provinces; though descended from <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a <hi>Prince</hi> or a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> may hold a Territory that is <hi>forraign</hi> in this, it may be asked, why he may not hold one that is <hi>Native</hi> in like manner? To which I answer, because he can hold a <hi>forreign</hi> by a <hi>Native</hi> territory, but not a <hi>Native</hi> by a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>; and as hitherto I have shewn what is not the <hi>Provinciall ballance,</hi> so by this answer it may appear what it is, namely the <hi>overballance</hi> of a native Territory to a forraign; for as one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ballanceth it self by the distribution of propriety according unto the proportion of the same, so one Country over ballanceth another, by advantage of divers kinds. For example, the <hi>Common-wealth of Rome overballanced her provinces</hi> by the <hi>vigour</hi> of a more excellent Government opposite unto a <hi>crazier,</hi> or by a more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Militia</hi> opposed unto one <hi>inferiour in Courage or discipline</hi>: The like was that of the <hi>Mamaluc's</hi> being an <hi>hardy,</hi> unto the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pgytians</hi> that were a <hi>soft people.</hi> And the <hi>ballance</hi> of a <hi>situation</hi> is in this kind, of wonderfull effect; seeing the <hi>King of Denmark,</hi> being <hi>none of the most potent Princes,</hi> is able at the <hi>Sound</hi> to take Tole of the <hi>greatest</hi>: and as this <hi>King</hi> by the advantage of the <hi>Land</hi> can make the <hi>Sea</hi> tributary; so <hi>Venice</hi>; by the advantage of the <hi>Sea,</hi> in whose arms she is impregnable, can make the <hi>Land</hi> to feed her <hi>Gulph.</hi> For the Colonies in the <hi>Indies,</hi> they are yet babes that cannot live without sucking the breasts of their mother-Cities, but such as, I mistake, if when they come of age they do not wean themselves: which causeth me to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at Princes that delight to be exhausted in that way. And

so much for the principles of power whether <hi>National or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, Domestick or Forraign</hi>; being such as are External, and founded in the goods of Fortune.</p>

Wherefore if we have any thing of Piety or of prudence, let us raise our selves out of the mire of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, unto the contemplation of Virtue, and put an hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the removal of <hi>this Evil from under the Sun</hi>; this evil against which no Government that is not secured, can be good; this evill from which the Government that is secure, must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that the cause of it is from the <hi>Ruler,</hi> from those principles of power which ballanced upon earthly trash, exclude the heavenly treasures of Virtue, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of it upon Government, which is <hi>Authority.</hi> We have wandered the Earth to find out the ballance of power: but to find out that of Authority, we must ascend, as I said, nearer Heaven, or to the Image of God, which is the Soul of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Soul of man</hi> (whose life or motion is perpetual <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or thought) is the <hi>Mistris</hi> of two potent <hi>rivalls,</hi> the one <hi>Reason,</hi> the other <hi>Passion,</hi> that are in continuall suit; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as she gives up her will to these or either of them, is the felicity or misery which man partakes in this mortall life.</p>
               <p>For as what ever was <hi>passion</hi> in the <hi>contemplation</hi> of a man, being brought forth by his will into <hi>action,</hi> is <hi>vice</hi> and the <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Sin</hi>; so what ever was <hi>reason</hi> in the <hi>contemplation</hi> of a man, being brought forth by his <hi>will</hi> into <hi>action,</hi> is <hi>virtue</hi> and the <hi>freedome of Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as those <hi>actions</hi> of a man that were <hi>sin,</hi> acquire unto himself <hi>repentance</hi> or <hi>shame,</hi> and affect others with <hi>scorn</hi> or <hi>pity</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56348:12"/>
so those <hi>actions</hi> of a man that are <hi>virtue,</hi> acquire unto himself <hi>Honour,</hi> and upon others <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Government is no other then the Soul of a Nation or City: wherefore that which was <hi>reason</hi> in the <hi>debate</hi> of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> being brought forth by the <hi>result,</hi> must be <hi>virtue</hi>; and for as much as the Soul of a City or Nation is the <hi>Soveraign power,</hi> her <hi>virtue</hi> must be <hi>Law.</hi> But the <hi>Government</hi> whose <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>virtue,</hi> and whose <hi>virtue</hi> is <hi>law,</hi> is the same, whose <hi>Empire</hi> is <hi>Authority,</hi> and whose <hi>Authority</hi> is <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if the liberty of a man consist in the <hi>Empire</hi> of his <hi>reason,</hi> the absence whereof would betray him unto the <hi>bondage</hi> of his <hi>passions:</hi> Then the <hi>liberty</hi> of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> consisteth in the <hi>Empire</hi> of her <hi>Lawes,</hi> the absence whereof would betray her unto the <hi>lasts</hi> of <hi>Tyrants:</hi> and these I conceive to be the <hi>principles,</hi> upon which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> (injuriously accused by <hi>Leviathan</hi> for not writing out of nature) have grounded their assertion, that <hi>a Common-wealth is an Empire of Lawes and not of Men.</hi> But they must not carry it so. For, saith he,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 110.</note> 
                  <hi>The liberty, whereof there is so frequent and honourable mention in the Histories and Philosophy of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and the Writings and Discourses of those that from them have received All their Learning in the Politicks, is not the liberty of particular men, but the liberty of the Common-wealth.</hi> He might as well have said, that the Estates of particular men in a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> are not the riches of particular men, but the riches of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>; for equality of estates causeth equality of power, and equality of power is the <hi>liberty</hi> not onely of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> but of every man. But sure a man would never be thus irreverent with the greatest Authors, and positive against all Antiquity, without some certain demonstration of truth; and, what is it? Why, <hi>there is written on the Turrets of the City of</hi> Luca <hi>in great Characters at this day the word</hi> LIBERTAS, <hi>yet no man can thence infer, that a particular man hath more liberty or immunity from the service of the Common-wealth there, then in</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople. <hi>Whether a Common-wealth be Monarchical or Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the freedom is the same.</hi> The Mountain hath brought forth, and we have a little equivocation! For to say, that a <hi>Luchese</hi> hath no more liberty or immunity <hi>from</hi> the Laws of <hi>Luca</hi>; then a <hi>Turk</hi> hath from those of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; and to say that a <hi>Luchese</hi> hath no more liberty or immunity <hi>by</hi> the Lawes of <hi>Luca,</hi> then a <hi>Turk</hi> hath by those of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> are pretty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent speeches: the first may be said of all Governments alike; the second scarse of any two; much lesse of these, seeing it is known, that whereas the greatest <hi>Bashaw</hi> is a Tenant as well of his head, as of his estate, at the will of his Lord; the <hi>meanest Luchese</hi> that hath Land, is a freeholder of both, and not to be controlled but by the Law, and that framed by every private
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56348:13"/>
man unto no other end, (or they may thank themselves) then to protect the liberty of every private man, which by that means comes to be the liberty of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>But seeing they that make the Lawes in <hi>Common-wealths</hi> are but men, the main question seems to be, how a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> comes to be an Empire of Lawes, and not of Men? or how the <hi>debate</hi> or <hi>result</hi> of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is so sure to be according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>reason</hi>; seeing they who <hi>debate,</hi> and they who <hi>resolve</hi> be but men. <hi>And as often as reason is against a man, so often will a man be against reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is thought to be a shrewd saying, but will do no harm; for be it so, that <hi>reason</hi> is nothing but <hi>interest,</hi> there be divers <hi>interests,</hi> and so divers <hi>reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As first, there is <hi>Private Reason,</hi> which is the <hi>interest</hi> of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Reason of State,</hi> which is the interest (or errour as was said by <hi>Solomon</hi>) of the <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Rulers,</hi> that is to say, of the <hi>Prince,</hi> of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> or of the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is that <hi>Reason</hi> which is the interest of mankind, or of the whole.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hooker.</hi> B. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Now if we see even in those natural agents that want sense, that as in themselves they have a Law which directeth them, in the means whereby they tend to their own perfection, so likewise that another Law there is, which toucheth them as they are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable parts united into one body, a Law which bindeth them each to serve unto others good, and all to prefer the good of the whole, before whatsoever their own particular; as when stones or heavy things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their ordinary wont or center, and fly upwards, as if they heard themselves commanded to let go the good they privately wish, and to relieve the present distresse of Nature in common.</hi> There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right, Law of Nature, or interest of the whole; which is more excellent, and so acknowledged to be by the agents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Grot.</hi>
                  </note> then the right or interest of the parts onely. <hi>Wherefore though it may be truly said, that the creatures are naturally carried forth, unto their proper utility or profit: that ought not to be taken in too general a sense; seeing divers of them abstain from their own profit, either in regard of those of the same kind, or at the least of their young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mankind</hi> then must either be lesse just then the <hi>creature,</hi> or acknowledge also his <hi>common interest</hi> to be <hi>common right.</hi> And if <hi>reason</hi> be nothing else but <hi>interest,</hi> and the <hi>interest of mankind</hi> be the <hi>right interest,</hi> then the <hi>reason of mankind</hi> must be <hi>right reason.</hi> Now compute well, for if the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> come the nearest unto the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> then the <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>popular Government</hi> must come the nearest unto <hi>right reason.</hi>
               </p>

look upon <hi>reason</hi> as it is <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> in it <hi>self,</hi> but as it makes for him or against him: wherefore unlesse you can shew such <hi>orders</hi> of a <hi>Government,</hi> as like those of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>nature</hi> shall be able to constrain this or that <hi>creature</hi> to shake off that <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which is more peculiar unto it, and take up that which regards the <hi>common good</hi> or <hi>interest</hi>; all this is to no more end, then to perswade every man in a <hi>popular Government,</hi> not to carve himself of that which he desires most, but to be manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the publick Table, and give the best from himself unto decency and the <hi>common interest.</hi> But that such <hi>orders</hi> may be established, as may, nay must give the upper hand in all cases unto <hi>common right</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> notwithstanding the nearnesse of that which sticks unto every man in private, and this in a way of equal certainty and facility, is known even unto <hi>girles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other then those that are of common practice with them in divers cases. For example, two of them have a Cake yet undivided, which was given between them, that each of them therefore may have that which is due: Divide, sayes one unto the other, and I will choose; or let me divide, and you shall choose: if this be but once agreed upon, it is enough: for the divident, dividing unequally loses, in regard that the other takes the better half; wherefore she divides equally, and so both have right. <hi>O the depth of the wisdom of God!</hi> and yet <hi>by the mouthes of babes and sucklings hath he set forth his strength</hi>; that which great <hi>Philosophers</hi> are disputing upon in vain, is brought unto light by two <hi>silly girles,</hi> even the whole <hi>mystery</hi> of a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi>: which lyes only in <hi>dividing and choosing</hi>: nor hath <hi>God</hi> (if his works in nature be understood) left so much unto <hi>mankind</hi> to dispute upon, as who shall divide, and who choose, but distributed them for ever into two <hi>orders,</hi> whereof the one hath the naturall right of dividing, and the other of choosing. For Example:</p>
               <p>A <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is but a civill Society of men: let us take any number of men (as twenty),<note place="margin">

                  <hi>young men and all others that are unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the antidote of solid reason, receiving a strong and delightfull impression of the great exploits of War, atchieved by the Conductors of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56348:17"/>
their Armies, receive withall a pleasing Idea of all they have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: and imagine their great prosperity, not to have proceeded from the emulation of particular men, but from the virtue of their popular form of Government: not considering the frequent seditions and Civil Wars produced by the imperfection of their Policy.</hi> Where first the blame he layes to the Heathen Authors, is in his sense laid unto the <hi>Scripture</hi>; and whereas he holds them to be <hi>young men,</hi> or men of no antidote that are of like opinions, it should seem that <hi>Machiavill</hi> the sole retreiver of this <hi>ancient Prudence,</hi> is to his solid reason a beardlesse boy that hath new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read <hi>Livy:</hi> and how solid his reason is, may appear; Where he grants the great prosperity of ancient <hi>Common-wealths:</hi> which is to give up the controversie: For such an effect must have some adequate cause; which to evade, he insinuates, that it was nothing else but the emulation of particular men; as if so great an emulation could have been generated without as great virtue; so great virtue without the best education; the best education without the best Lawes; or the best Lawes any otherwise then by the excellency of their policy.</p>
               <p>But if some of these <hi>Common-Wealths</hi> as being lesse perfect in their policy then others, have been more seditious, it is not more an argument of the infirmity of this or that <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in particular, then of the excellency of that kind of Policy in generall, which if they that have not altogether reached, have neverthelesse had greater prosperity; what would befall them that should reach?</p>
               <p>In answer to which question, let me invite <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who of all other Governments giveth the advantage unto Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy for perfection, to a better disquisition of it, by these three assertions:</p>
               <p>The first, That the perfection of Government lyeth upon such a libration in the frame of it, that no man or men, in or under it, can have the interest; or having the interest, can have the power to disturb it with sedition.</p>
               <p>The second, That Monarchy reaching the perfection of the kind, reacheth not unto the perfection of Government, but must have some dangerous flaw in it.</p>
               <p>The third, That Popular Government reaching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the kind, reacheth the perfection of Government; and hath no flaw in it.</p>
               <p>The first assertion requireth no proof.</p>
               <p>For the proof of the second; <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as hath been shewn, is of two kinds, the one by <hi>Arms,</hi> the other by a <hi>Nobility</hi>; and there is no other kind in art or nature: for if there have been anciently some Governments called <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> as one of the <hi>Gothes</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and another of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> ruled without a <hi>Nobility,</hi> and by a <hi>Council</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56348:17"/>
only; it is expresly said by the Authors that mention them, that the <hi>Kings</hi> were but the <hi>Captains,</hi> and that the people not onely gave them Lawes, but deposed them as often as they pleased; nor is it possible in reason that it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in like cases: wherefore these were either no <hi>Monarchies,</hi> or had greater flawes in them then any other.</p>
               <p>But for a <hi>Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Arms</hi> as that of the <hi>Turk,</hi> (which of all models that ever were cometh up unto the perfection of the kind) it is not in the wit or power of man to cure it of this dangerous flaw, That the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have frequent interest and perpetual power to raise <hi>sedition,</hi> and to tear the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> even the <hi>Prince</hi> himself, in pieces. Therefore the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Turky</hi> is no perfect <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for a <hi>Monarchy</hi> by a <hi>Nobility</hi> as of late in <hi>Oceana</hi> (which of all other models before the declination of it came up to the perfection in that kind) it was not in the power or wit of man to cure it of that dangerous flaw; That the <hi>Nobility</hi> had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>perpetuall power</hi> by their <hi>retainers</hi> and <hi>tenants</hi> to raise <hi>sedition,</hi> and (whereas the <hi>Janizaries</hi> occasion this kind of calamity, no sooner then they make an end of it) to levy a lasting War, unto the vast effusion of blood, and that even upon occasions wherein the people, but for their dependance upon their Lords had no concernment, as in the <hi>Fewd</hi> of the <hi>Red and White.</hi> The like hath been frequent in <hi>Spain, France, Germany,</hi> and other <hi>Monarchies</hi> of this kind; wherefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> by a <hi>Nobility</hi> is no perfect <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proof of the third Assertion, <hi>Leviathan</hi> yieldeth it unto me, that there is no other <hi>Common-wealth</hi> but <hi>Monarchical</hi> or <hi>Popular</hi>: wherefore if no <hi>Monarchy</hi> be a perfect <hi>Government,</hi> then either there is no perfect <hi>Government,</hi> or it must be <hi>popular</hi>; for which kind of constitution I have something more to say, then <hi>Leviathan</hi> hath said, or ever will be able to say for <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is the Government that was never conquered by any Monarch, from the beginning of the World unto this day: for if the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> came under the yoke of the Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> they were first broken by themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is the <hi>Government</hi> that hath frequently led migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Monarchs</hi> in Triumph.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is the <hi>Government,</hi> which if it have been <hi>Seditious,</hi> it hath not been from any imperfection in the <hi>kind,</hi> but in the <hi>particular constitution</hi>; which where ever the like hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, must have been unequall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is the <hi>Government,</hi> which if it have been any thing near <hi>equall,</hi> was never <hi>seditious</hi>; or let him shew me what <hi>sedition</hi> hath happened in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> or <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That it is the <hi>Government,</hi> which attaining unto perfect
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56348:18"/>
                  <hi>equality,</hi> hath such a <hi>libration</hi> in the frame of it, that no man living can shew which way any man or men in or under it, can contract any such <hi>interest</hi> or <hi>power</hi> as should be able to disturb the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> with <hi>sedition</hi>; wherefore an <hi>equal Common-wealth</hi> is that onely which is without flaw, and containeth in it the full perfection of Government. But to return.</p>
               <p>By what hath been shewn in <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> it may appear, that though <hi>Common-Wealths</hi> in generall be <hi>Governments</hi> of the <hi>Senate proposing, the people resolving, and the Magistracy executing</hi>; yet some are not so good at these <hi>orders</hi> as others, through some impediment or defect in the frame, ballance, or capacity of them, according unto which they are of divers kinds.</p>
               <p>The first division of them is into such as are single as <hi>Israel, Athens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Division of Common-Wealths.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Laecedemon,</hi> &amp;c. and such as are by <hi>leagues,</hi> as those of the <hi>Achaeans, Aetolians, Lyceans, Switz</hi> and <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second (being <hi>Machiavil's</hi>) is into such as are for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> as <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and such as are for <hi>encrease,</hi> as <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> in which I can see no more, then that the former taketh in no more Citizens then are necessary for <hi>defence,</hi> and the latter so many as are capable of <hi>encrease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third division (unseen hitherto) is into <hi>equall</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall,</hi> and this is the main point especially as to domestick peace and <hi>tranquillity</hi>; for to make a <hi>Common-wealth unequall,</hi> is to divide it into parties, which setteth them at perpetuall variance, the one party endeavouring to preserve their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and inequality, and the other to attain unto equality; whence the people of <hi>Rome</hi> derived their perpetuall strife with the <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Senate</hi>: but in an <hi>equal Common-wealth,</hi> there can be no more strife then there can be over-ballance in equall weights; wherefore the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> being that which of all others is the most <hi>equal</hi> in the constitution, is that wherein there never happen'd any strife between the Senate and the people.</p>
               <p>An equall <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is such an one, as is <hi>equall</hi> both in the <hi>ballance</hi> and <hi>foundation,</hi> and in the <hi>superstructions,</hi> that is to say, in her <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, and in her <hi>Rotation.</hi>

I have not stood upon a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular description of this <hi>Ballot,</hi> because that of <hi>Venice</hi> exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify'd in the modell is of all others the most perfect.</p>
               <p>An <hi>equal Common-wealth (by that which hath been said) is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment established upon an equall Agrarian,</hi>

               <p>Now having reason'd the principles of an equall <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> I should come to give an instance of such an one in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, if I could find it; but if this work be of any value, it lyeth in that it is the first example of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> that is perfectly equall. For <hi>Venice</hi> though she come the nearest, yet is a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> for <hi>preservation</hi>; and such an one, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>paucity</hi> of <hi>Citizens</hi> taken in, and the number not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, is externally <hi>unequal</hi>: and though every <hi>Common-wealth</hi> that holdeth <hi>Provinces</hi> must in that regard be such; yet not unto that <hi>degree.</hi> Neverthelesse <hi>Venice</hi> internally and for her <hi>capacity</hi> is by far the most <hi>equall</hi>; though she hath not in my judgment arrived at the full <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>equality</hi>; both because her <hi>Lawes</hi> supplying the defect of an <hi>Agrarian,</hi> are not so clear nor effectual at the <hi>foundation,</hi> nor her <hi>superstructures</hi> by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of her <hi>Ballot</hi> or <hi>Rotation</hi> exactly <hi>librated,</hi> in regard that through the <hi>paucity</hi> of her Citizens, her greater <hi>Magistracies</hi> are continually <hi>wheeled</hi> through a <hi>few hands.</hi> As is confessed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56348:19"/>
by <hi>Janotti,</hi> where he saith, that if a <hi>Gentleman</hi> come once to be <hi>Savio di terra ferma,</hi> it seldom happens that he faileth from thenceforward to be adorned with some one of the greater <hi>Magistracies,</hi> as <hi>Savi di mare, Savi di terra ferma, Savi Grandi, Counsellors,</hi> those of the Decemvirate or <hi>Dictatorian</hi> Council, the <hi>Aurogatori</hi> or Censors which require no <hi>vacation</hi> or <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>: wherefore if this in <hi>Venice,</hi> or that in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where the <hi>Kings</hi> were <hi>hereditary,</hi> and the <hi>Senators</hi> (though elected by the people) for life, cause no inequality (which is hard to be conceived) in a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> for <hi>preservation,</hi> or such an one as consisteth of a few Citizens; yet is it manifest, that it would cause a very great one in a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> for <hi>encrease,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the <hi>Many,</hi> which by the engrossing the <hi>Magistracies</hi> in a few hands, would be obstructed in their <hi>Rotation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there be that say, (and think it a strong Objection) let a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> be as <hi>equal</hi> as you can imagine, two or three men when all is done will govern it: and there is that in it, which notwithstanding the pretended sufficiency of a popular State, amounteth unto a plain confession of the imbecillity of that Policy, and of the prerogative of <hi>Monarchy</hi>; for as much as popular Governments in difficult cases have had recourse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dictatorian</hi> power, as in <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>To which I answer, That as truth is a Spark whereunto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are like bellowes; so, in this, our <hi>Common-wealth</hi> shines: for the eminence acquired by <hi>suffrage</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> in a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> especially if it be <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>equall,</hi> can be ascended by no other steps then the universall acknowledgment of <hi>virtue</hi>; and where men excell in <hi>Virtue,</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is stupid and unjust, if accordingly they do not excell in <hi>Authority</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is both the advantage of <hi>Virtue,</hi> which hath her due <hi>encouragement,</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> which hath her due ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.

And as a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lawes</hi> and not of <hi>Men</hi>; so is this the <hi>Principality</hi> of the <hi>Virtue,</hi> and not of the <hi>Man</hi>; if that fail or set in one, it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in another, which is created his immediate Successour.

               </p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> And if the conviction of a mans <hi>private conscience,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth his private Religion: the conviction of the <hi>national conscience,</hi> must produce a <hi>national Religion.</hi> Whether this be well reason'd, as also whether these two may stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will best be shewn by the examples of the ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths taken in their order.</p>

               <p>To proceed, <hi>Athens</hi> preserved her <hi>Religion,</hi> by the testimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> with great <hi>superstition</hi>: If <hi>Alcibiades</hi> that <hi>Atheistical</hi> fellow had not shew'd them a fair pair of heeles, they had sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven off his head for shaving their <hi>Mercuries,</hi> and making their <hi>Gods</hi> look <hi>ridiculously</hi> upon them without beards. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, if <hi>Paul</hi> reasoned with them, they loved news, for which he was the more welcome; and if he converted <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> that is, one of the <hi>Senators,</hi> there followed neither any hurt unto him, nor losse of honour to <hi>Dionysius.</hi> And for <hi>Rome,</hi> if <hi>Cicero</hi> in his most excellent book, <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi> overthrew the <hi>National Religion of</hi> that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> he was never the farther from being <hi>Consul.</hi> But there is a meannesse and poornesse in modern <hi>prudence,</hi> not only unto the damage of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> but of <hi>Religion</hi> it self: for whereas <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is the farthest of any from countenancing War, there never was <hi>a War of Religion</hi> but since <hi>Christianity.</hi> For which we are beholding unto the POPE; for the <hi>Pope</hi> not giving liberty of conscience unto <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> they cannot give that unto their Subjects which they have not: whence both <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> either through his instigation, or disputes among themselves, have introduced that <hi>execrable</hi> custome, never known in the world before, of <hi>fighting for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and denying the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to have any <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of it; whereas the <hi>Magistrates</hi> losing the power of <hi>Religion,</hi> loseth the

                  <hi>liberty of conscience</hi> which hath nothing to protect it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the people be otherwise taught, it concerns them to look about them, and to distinguish between the shreeking of the Lapwing, and the voice of the Turtle.</p>
               <p>To come unto <hi>Civil Lawes,</hi> if they stand one way, and the <hi>ballance</hi> another, it is the case of a <hi>Government</hi> which of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity must be new <hi>modell'd</hi>; wherefore the <hi>Lawyers</hi> advising you upon like occasions to fit the Government unto their Lawes, are no more to be regarded, then your <hi>Taylor</hi> if he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to fit your body unto his doublet; there is also danger in the plausible pretence of <hi>reforming</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> except the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> be good, in which case it is a good tree, and bringeth not forth evil fruit; otherwise, if the Tree be evill, you can never reform the fruit; begin with reformation of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by the <hi>Lawes,</hi> but first begin with <hi>reformation</hi> of the <hi>Lawes</hi> by the <hi>Government.</hi> The best <hi>rule</hi> as to the <hi>Lawes</hi> in general, is, that they be <hi>few.

               </p>
               <p>Of these there were three kinds or orders: The first,<note place="margin">

                  </note> of <hi>Nobility,</hi> distinguished by the Titles of <hi>Dukes, Marquesses, Earls,</hi> and these being gratify'd with Cities, Castles, and Villages, of the Conquered <hi>Italians,</hi> their <hi>Feuds</hi> participated of <hi>Royall dignity, and were called Regalia,</hi> by which they had right to coyn Mony, create Magistrates, take Tole, Customs, Confiscations, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feuds</hi> of the second order were such as with the consent of the <hi>King</hi> were bestowed by these <hi>Feudatory Princes</hi> upon men of inferiour Quality called their <hi>Barons,</hi> on condition that next unto the <hi>King</hi> they should defend the <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> of their <hi>Lords</hi> in <hi>Arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The lowest order of <hi>Feuds</hi> were such as being confer'd by those of the second Order upon private men, whether <hi>Noble,</hi> or not <hi>Noble,</hi> obliged them in the like duty unto their <hi>Superiors,</hi> these were called <hi>Vauosors: And this is the Gothick Ballance, by which all the Kingdoms this day in Christendome were at first erected</hi>; for which cause if I had time, I should open in this place the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdomes of France, Spain, and Poland</hi>; but so much as hath been said being sufficient for the discovery of the principles of <hi>Modern Prudence in general</hi>; I shall divide the remainder of my Discourse, which is more particular, into three parts.</p>
               <p>The first, shewing the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the late <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second, the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the same.</p>
               <p>And the third, the <hi>Generation</hi> of the present <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Constitution of the late <hi>Monarchy of Oceana,</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in relation unto the different <hi>Nations,</hi> by whom it hath been successively subdu'd and govern'd. The first of these were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56348:24"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> the second the <hi>Teutons,</hi> the third the <hi>Scandians,</hi> and the fourth the <hi>Neustrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who held it as a <hi>Province,</hi> I shall omit, because I am to speak of their <hi>Provincial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in another place, onely it is to be remembred in this, that if we have given over running up and down naked and with dappled hides, learn't to write and read, to be instructed with good Arts, for all these we are beholding to the <hi>Romans</hi> either <hi>immediately,</hi> or <hi>mediately</hi> the <hi>Teutons</hi>; for that the <hi>Teutons</hi> had the Arts from no other hand, is plain enough by their language, which hath yet no word to signifie either writing or reading, but what is derived from the <hi>Latine.</hi> Furthermore, by the help of these arts so learn't, we have been capable of that <hi>Religion</hi> which we have long since received; wherefore it seemeth unto me, that we ought not to detract from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Romans,</hi> by whose means we are as it were of <hi>Beasts</hi> become <hi>Men,</hi> and by whose means we might yet of obscure and Ignorant men (<hi>if we thought not too well of our selves</hi>) become a wise and a great <hi>People.</hi>

the obscurity of these times, in which there is little to be found of a <hi>Methodical constitution</hi> of this High Court; by the addition of an <hi>Argument,</hi> which I conceive to bear a strong testimony unto it self, though taken out of a late Writing that conceals the Authour.
<q>It is well known (saith he) that in every quarter of the Realm a great many Boroughs do yet send Burgesses unto the Parliament, which neverthelesse be so anciently and so long since decayed and gone to naught, that they cannot be shew'd to have been of any reputation since the Conquest, much lesse to have obtained any such priviledge by the grant of any succeeding King; wherefore these must have had this right by more ancient usuage, and before the Conquest; they being unable now to shew whence they derived it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> (though there be more) I shall pitch upon, as sufficient to prove; <hi>First,</hi> that the lower sort of the <hi>people</hi> had right unto Session in <hi>Parliament</hi> during the time of the <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</hi> Secondly, that they were qualify'd unto the same by election in their <hi>Boroughs</hi>; and (if <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shire</hi> (as no doubt they are) be as <hi>ancient</hi>) in the <hi>Countries: Thirdly,</hi> if it be a good <hi>Argument</hi> to say, that the <hi>Commons</hi> during the raign of the <hi>Teutons</hi> were elected into <hi>Parliament,</hi> because they are so now, and no man can shew when this custom began; I see not which way it should be an ill one to say, that the <hi>Commons</hi> during the reign of the <hi>Teutons</hi> constituted also a <hi>distinct house,</hi> because they do so now; unlesse any man can shew that they did ever sit in the same House with the <hi>Lords.</hi> Wherefore to conclude this part, I conceive for these, and other reasons to be mentioned hereafter, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>Teutons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> notwithstanding the style of divers <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>

Wherefore his secret jealousie lest the Dissention of the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as it brought him in, might throw him out, travelled in wayes undiscover'd by them, unto ends as little foreseen by himself: while to establish his own safety, he by mixing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their Wine, first began to open those <hi>Sluces</hi> that have since overwhelmed not the <hi>King</hi> onely, but the <hi>Throne</hi>: For whereas a <hi>Nobility</hi> striketh not at the <hi>Throne</hi> without which they cannot subsist, but at some <hi>King</hi> that they do not like; <hi>Popular power</hi> striketh through the <hi>King</hi> at the <hi>Throne,</hi> as that which is incompatible with it. Now that <hi>Panurgus</hi> in abating the power of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> was the cause whence it came to fall into the hands of the people, appears by those severall Statutes that were made in his raign; as that for <hi>Population</hi>; those against <hi>Retainers</hi>; and that for <hi>Alienations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Statute of <hi>Population,</hi> All houses of <hi>husbandry</hi> that were used with twenty Acres of ground and upwards, were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56348:27"/>
to be maintained, and kept up for ever with a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Land laid to them, and in no wise, as appears by a subsequent Statute to be severed. By which means the houses being kept up, did of necessity inforce dwellers; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Land to be tilled being kept up, did of necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the dweller not to be a <hi>beggar</hi> or <hi>Cottager,</hi> but a man of some substance that might keep friends and servants, and set the <hi>Plough</hi> on going: this did mightily concern (saith the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi> of that <hi>Prince</hi>) the might and manhood of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and in effect <hi>amortize</hi> a great part of the Lands unto the hold and possession of the <hi>Yeomanry,</hi> or <hi>middle people,</hi> who living not in a servile or indigent fashion, were much unlinked from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon their <hi>Lords,</hi> and living in a free and plentifull manner, became a more excellent <hi>Infantry</hi>; but such an one upon which the <hi>Lords</hi> had so little power, that from henceforth they may be computed to have been disarmed.</p>
               <p>And as they lost their <hi>Infantry</hi> after this manner, so their <hi>Cavalry</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> were cut off by the Statute of <hi>Retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; for whereas it was the Custome of the <hi>Nobility</hi> to have younger Brothers of good houses, <hi>metall'd fellows,</hi> and such as were knowing in the feats of Arms about them; they who were longer followed with so dangerous a train, escaped not such punishments, as made them take up.</p>
               <p>Henceforth the Country-lives, and great tables of the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> which no longer nourished veins that would bleed for them, were fruitlesse and loathsome till they changed the <hi>Air,</hi> and of <hi>Princes</hi> became <hi>Courtiers,</hi> where their <hi>Revenues,</hi> never to have been exhausted by <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Mutton,</hi> were found nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, whence followed <hi>wracking of Rents,</hi> and at length sale of <hi>Lands</hi>; the riddance through the Statute of <hi>Alienations</hi> being rendred far more quick and facile, than formerly it had been through the new invention of <hi>intails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it happened, that <hi>Coraunus</hi> the Successour of that <hi>King</hi> dissolving the <hi>Abbeys,</hi> brought with the declining estate of the <hi>Nobility</hi> so vast a prey unto the Industry of the people, that the <hi>Ballance</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> was too apparently in the <hi>Popular party,</hi> to be unseen by the wise Councel of <hi>Queen Parthenia,</hi> who converting her reign through the perpetuall Love-tricks that passed between her and her people into a kind of <hi>Romanze</hi>; wholly neglected the <hi>Nobility.</hi> And by these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees came the House of <hi>Commons</hi> to raise that head, which since hath been so high and formidable unto their <hi>Princes</hi>; that they have looked pale upon those assemblies. Nor was there any thing now wanting unto the destruction of the <hi>Throne,</hi> but that the <hi>people</hi> not apt to see their own strength, should be put to feel it; when a <hi>Prince,</hi> as stiffe in disputes as the nerve of <hi>Monarchy</hi> was grown slack, received that unhappy encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56348:27"/>
from his <hi>Clergy,</hi> which became his utter Ruine, while trusting more unto their <hi>Logick,</hi> than the rough <hi>Philosophy</hi> of his <hi>Parliament,</hi> it came unto an irreparable breach; for the house of <hi>Peers</hi> which alone had stood in this Gap, now sinking down between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Commons,</hi> shewed that <hi>Crassus</hi> was dead, and <hi>Isthmus</hi> broken. But a <hi>Monarchy</hi> divested of her <hi>Nobility,</hi> hath no refuge under Heaven, but an Army. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dissolution of this Government caused the War, not the War the dissolution of this Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Kings</hi> successe with his Arms it is not necessary to give any further account, than that they proved as ineffectuall as his <hi>Nobility</hi>; But without a <hi>Nobility</hi> or an <hi>Army</hi> (as hath been shew'd) there can be no <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Wherefore what is there in Nature, that can arise out of these ashes; but a <hi>Popular Government,</hi> or a new <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be erected by the victorious Army?</p>
               <p>To erect a <hi>Monarchy</hi> be it never so new, unlesse like <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> you can hang it (<hi>as the Country fellow speaks</hi>) by <hi>Geometry,</hi> (for what else is it to say, that every other man must give up his will unto the will of this one man without any other <hi>Foundation</hi>?) it must stand upon old principles, that is, upon <hi>Nobility</hi> or an <hi>Army</hi> planted upon a due <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Dominion.

Your <hi>Army</hi> must be planted in one of the wayes mentioned: To plant it in the way of absolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> that is upon <hi>feuds</hi> for life, such as the <hi>Timars,</hi> a Country as large and fruitfull as that of <hi>Greece,</hi> would afford you but <hi>sixteen thousand Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> for that is the most the <hi>Turk</hi> (being the best husband that ever was of this kind) that makes of it at this day: and if <hi>Oceana,</hi> which is lesse in fruitfulnesse by one half, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by three parts, should have no greater a force, whoever breaketh <hi>her</hi> in one battle, may be sure <hi>she</hi> shall never rise; for such (as was noted by <hi>Machiavill</hi>) is the Nature of the <hi>Turkish Monarchy,</hi> if you break <hi>her</hi> in two battles, you have destroyed <hi>her</hi> whole <hi>Militia</hi>; and the rest being all slaves, you hold her without any further resistance: Wherefore the erection of an absolute <hi>Monarchy in Oceana,</hi> or in any other Country that is no larger, without making it a certain prey unto the first invader, is altogether impossible.</p>
               <p>To plant by halves as the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> did their <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries,</hi> or <hi>military Colonies,</hi> it must be either for life; and this an <hi>Army of Oceaners</hi> in their own Country, (especially having states of inheritance) will never bear, because such an Army so planted is as well confiscated as the <hi>people,</hi> nor had the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malines</hi> been contented with such usage in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but that they were Forraigners, and daring nor to mix with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, it was of absolute necessity to their Being.</p>

               <p>It is true, that the <hi>Provincial Ballance</hi> being in Nature quite contrary unto the <hi>National,</hi> you are no wayes to plant a <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Army upon Dominion.</hi> But then you must have a native <hi>Territory</hi> in strength, <hi>Situation,</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> able to <hi>overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> the forreign, or you can never hold it.

               <p>A <hi>people</hi> (saith <hi>Machiavill</hi>) that is <hi>corrupt,</hi> is not capable of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi>: but in shewing what a <hi>corrupt people</hi> is, he hath either involved himself or me; nor can I otherwise come out of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> than by saying, that the <hi>Ballance</hi> altering a <hi>people</hi> as to the foregoing <hi>Government,</hi> must of necessity be <hi>corrupt</hi>; but <hi>corruption</hi> in this sense signifieth no more then that the <hi>corruption of one Government (as in natural bodies) is the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another</hi>: wherefore if the <hi>Ballance</hi> alter from <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> the <hi>corruption</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> in this case is that which maketh them capable of a <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> But whereas I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the <hi>corruption</hi> which he meaneth is in <hi>Manners,</hi> this also is from the <hi>Ballance.</hi> For the <hi>Ballance</hi> swaying from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical</hi> into <hi>Popular,</hi> abateth the Luxury of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and inriching the <hi>people,</hi> bringeth the <hi>Government</hi> from a more <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> unto a more <hi>publick</hi> interest, which coming nearer, as hath been shewn, unto Justice and right Reason, the <hi>people</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a like alteration is so far from such <hi>corruption of Manners,</hi> as should render them uncapable of a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity they must thereby contract such reformation of <hi>manners</hi> as will bear no other kind of <hi>Government.</hi> On the other side, where the <hi>Ballance</hi> changeth from <hi>Popular to Oligarchical,</hi> or <hi>Monarchical</hi>; the <hi>publick</hi> interest with the reason and justice included in the same, becometh more <hi>private, Luxury</hi> is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the place of <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Servitude</hi> in that of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>; which causeth such a <hi>corruption of manners</hi> both in the <hi>Nobility</hi> and the <hi>people,</hi> as by the <hi>Example of Rome</hi> in the time of the <hi>Triumvirs,</hi> is more at large discovered by the <hi>Author</hi> to have been altogether incapable of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>

               <p>But the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> changing quite contrary to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> the manners of the <hi>people</hi> were not thereby <hi>corrupted,</hi> but on the contrary <hi>fitted</hi> for a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> For differences of opinion in a <hi>people</hi> (not rightly informed of their <hi>Ballance,</hi>) or division into parties, while there is not any common <hi>liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of power sufficient to reconcile or hold them, is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof of <hi>corruption</hi> in a <hi>people</hi>: Neverthelesse, seeing this must needs be matter of <hi>Scandall</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> it will not be amisse in shewing what were the parties, to shew what were their errours.</p>

My <hi>Lord Generall</hi> (as it is said of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that he could not sleepe for the glory obteined by <hi>Miltiades</hi> at the battle of <hi>Maratho</hi>) took so new, and deepe impression at these words of the much greater glory of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that being on this side assaulted with the <hi>emulation</hi> of his illustrious object, on the other with the <hi>misery</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> which seemed, (as it were ruined by his <hi>Victory</hi>) to cast her selfe at his feete, he was almost wholly deprived of his naturall rest, untill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate he had within himselfe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> came to a firme resolution, that the greatest advantages of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> are, <hi>first</hi> that the <hi>Legislator</hi> should be one man: and <hi>secondly</hi> that the <hi>Government</hi> should be made altogether, or at once.

But when the <hi>Senate</hi> proposed unto the <hi>People,</hi> the horse onely whereof there were twelve Centuries, consisting of the Richest sort over and above those of the foot enumerated, were called with the first Classis of the foot unto the suffrage; or if these accorded not, then the second Classis was called to them, but seldom or never any of the rest. Wherefore the people after the expulsion of the Kings, growing impatient of this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, rested not till they had reduced the Suffrage as it had been in the <hi>Comitia Curiata</hi> to the whole People again; But in another way, that is to say, by the <hi>Comitia Tributa,</hi> which thereupon were instituted, being a <hi>Council</hi> where the <hi>People</hi> in Exigencies made Lawes without the <hi>Senate</hi>; which Lawes were called <hi>Plebiscita.</hi> This Councill is that in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Cicero</hi> and other great Wits so frequently inveigh against the People, and sometimes even <hi>Livy,</hi> as at the Institution: (<hi>Hunc Annum insignem maximÃ¨ Comitia Tributa efficiunt; res major victoriÃ¢ suscepti certaminis quam usu, plus enim dignitatis Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis ipsis detractum est, patribus ex Concilio submovendis, quam Virium aut plebi additum aut demptum patribus</hi>) To say truth, it was a kind of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> whereof the people could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, if there had not, through the Courses taken by the <hi>Senate,</hi> been otherwise a necessity that they must have seen the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> run into <hi>Oligarchy.</hi>

                     <p>The first and second in the List are OversÃ©ers by Consequence: the third is the Constable, and the fourth and fifth are Church-Wardens; the persons so chosen are Deputies of the Parish for the space of one year from their Election, and no longer, nor may they be Elected two years together. This List, being the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> or first mover of the Common-wealth, is to be Registred in a Book, diligently kept and preserved by the OversÃ©ers, who are Responsible in their places for these and other Duties to be hereafter mentioned, unto the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Tribe, and the Congregation is to observe the present Order, as they will Answer the contrary unto the <hi>Phylarch,</hi> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Troop of the Tribe; which, in case of failure in the whole or any part of it, have power to Fine them or any of them, at discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but under an Appeal unto the Parliament.</p>

               <p>For proof of this Order, in Reason: it is with all Polititians past dispute, that paternal power is in the right of nature; and this is no other then the derivation of power from Fathers of Families, as the naturall Root of a Common-wealth; and for Experience, if it be otherwise in that of <hi>Holland,</hi> I know
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56348:38"/>
no other Example of like kind. In <hi>Israel,</hi> the Soveraign power came clearly from the natural root, the Elders of the whole people, and <hi>Rome</hi> was born <hi>Comitiis Curiatis</hi> in her Parochial Congregations, out of which <hi>Romulus</hi> first raised her <hi>Senate,</hi> then all the rest of the Orders of that Common-wealth, which rose so high:<note place="margin">Jos. 24.1.</note> For the depth of a Common-wealth is the just height of it.</p>

               <p>And if the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> were born of thirty Parishes, this of <hi>Oceana</hi> was born of Ten thousand. But whereas mention in the Birth of this is made of an <hi>Equestrian</hi> Order, it may startle such as know that the division of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> at the Institution of that Common-wealth into Orders, was the occasion of her ruine. The distinction of the <hi>Patrician</hi> as an hereditary order from the very Institution, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossing all the Magistracies, was indeed the destruction of <hi>Rome</hi>; but to a Knight or one of the <hi>Equestrian</hi> Order, saith <hi>Horace.</hi>

               <q>Si quadringentis sex, septem millia desunt Plebs eris.</q>
               <p>By which it should seem that this order was no otherwise hereditary then a man's Estate, nor gave it any Claim to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy; wherefore you shall never find that it disquieted the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; nor doth the name denote any more in <hi>Oceana,</hi> then the Duty of such a mans Estate unto the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
               <p>But the Surveyors both in this place and in others, for as much as they could not observe all the circumstances of this Order, especially that of the time of Election, did for the first as well as they could; and the Elections being made and Registred, took each of them Copies of those Lists which were within their allotments; which done, they produced,
<q>The Sixth Order, directing, in case a Parson or Uicar of a Parish come to be removed by death, or by the Censors, that the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parish Assemble and depute one or two Elders of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, who upon the charge of the Parish shall repair unto one of the Universities of this Nation with a Certificate signed by the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sÃ©ers, and addressed unto the Uice-Chancellor; which Certificate gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

notice of the death or Removall of the Parson or Uicar, of the value of the Parsonage or Uicaridge, and of the desire of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to receive a Probationer from that University; the Uice-Chancellor upon the Receipt thereof shall call a Convocation, and having made choyce of a fit person, shall return him in due time unto the Parish, where the person so returned shall receive the full fruits of the Benefice or Uicaridge, and do the duty of the Parson or Uicar, for the space of one year, as Probationer; and the space of one year being expired, the Congregation of the Elders shall put their Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner to the Ballot; and if he attain not unto two parts in thrÃ©e of the Suffrage affirmative, he shall take his leave of the Parish, and they shall send in like manner for another Probationer: but if their Probationer attain unto two parts in thrÃ©e of the Suffrage affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he is the Pastor of that Parish. And the Pastour of the Parish shall pray with the Congregation, preach the Word, and administer the Sacraments unto the same, according unto the Directory to be hereafter appointed by, the Parliament. Neverthelesse such as are of gather'd Congregations, or from time to time shall joyn with any of them, are in no wise obliged to this way of Electing their Teachers, or to give their Uotes in this Case, but wholly left unto the liberty of their Conscience, and unto that way of worship which they shall choose, being not Popish, Iewish, nor Idolatrous and to the end that they may be the better protected by the State in the FrÃ©e Exercise of the same, they are desired to make choyce in such manner as they best like, of certain Magistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And such Auditors or Magistrates shall have power to examine the matter and inform themselves to the end that if they think it of sufficient weight they may acquaint the <hi>Phylarch,</hi> or introduce it into the Councill of Religion; where all such Causes as such Magistrates shall introduce, shall from time to time be heard and determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto such Lawes as are or shall hereafter be provided by the Parliament for the just defence of the Liberty of Conscience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Order consisteth of three parts, the first restoring the power of Ordination unto the people, which that it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally appertaineth unto them, is clear (though not in English, yet) in Scripture,<note place="margin">Act. 14.23.</note> where the Apostles <hi>ordained Elders by the holding up of hands in every Congregation,</hi> that is, by the suffrage
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56348:39"/>
of the people which was also given in some of those Cities by the Ballot; and though it may be shewn that the Apostles ordained some by the Laying on of hands, it will not be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that they did so in every congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Excommunication</hi> as not clearly proveable out of Scripture being omitted. The second part of the order implyes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisheth a nationall Religion; for there be degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Divine things, true Religion is not to be attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to without searching the Scriptures; the Scripture cannot be searched by us unlesse we have them to search; and if we have nothing else or (which is all one) understand nothing else but a translation we may be (as in the place alleadged, we have been) beguiled or misled by the translation, while we should be searching the true sence of the Scripture, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained unto in a naturall way (and a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is not to presume upon that which is supernaturall) but by the knowledge of the originall, and of Antiquity acquired by our own studies, or those of some other, for even <hi>Faith cometh by hearing.</hi> Wherefore a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> not making provision of men from time to time, knowing in the originall languages wherein the Scriptures were written and versed in those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities whereunto they so frequently relate, that the true sense of them dependeth in a great part upon that knowledge, can never be secure that she shall not lose the Scripture, and by consequence her Religion, which to preserve she must institute some method of this knowledge, and some use of such as have acquired it, which amounteth unto a Nationall Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Common-wealth</hi> having thus performed her duty towards God, as a rational Creature by the best Application of her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son unto Scripture, for the preservation of Religion in the purity of the same, yet pretendeth not unto infallibility, but comes in the third part of the order, establishing Liberty of Conscience according to the instructions given unto her Councell of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to raise up her hands to Heaven, for further light, in which proceeding she followeth that (as was shewen in the preliminaries) of <hi>Israel</hi> who though her Nationall Religion were evermore a part of her Civil Law gave unto her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets the upper hand of all her Orders.</p>
               <p>But the Surveyours having now done with the Parishes, tooke their Leaves so, <hi>A parish is the first division of Land occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the first Collection of the people of</hi> Oceana,<note place="margin">

The Knights and Deputies being chosen, shall be brought unto the head of the Tribe by the Lord High Sheriff, who shall administer unto them this Oath, <hi>[Ye shall well and truly observe and keep the Orders and Customs of this Common-wealth which the People have Chosen.] And if any of them shall refuse the Oath, he shall be rejected; and that Competitor which had the most voices next shall be called in his place; who if he take the Oath, shall be entred in the List; But if he also refuse the Oath, he who had most voices next shall be called, and so untill the number of nine out of those Competitors which had most voices be sworn Knights and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Gallaxy: (This Clause, in regard of the late divisions, and to the end that no violence be offered unto any mans Conscience, to be of force but for the first three years only:)</hi> The Knights of the Gallaxy being elected and sworn are to repair by the Munday next ensuing the last of March unto the <hi>Pantheon</hi> or Pallace of Iustice scituate in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Common-wealth, (except the Parliament through Sicknesse, or some other occasion, have adjourned unto some other part of the Nation) where they are to take their Places in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and continue in full Power and Commission as Senators for the full term of thrÃ©e years next ensuing the date of their Election.

But though the forgoing Orders so far as they reguard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Senate and the people, requireing no more as to an ordinary election then is therein explained, that is but one third part of their Knights and Deputies, are perfect; yet must wee in this place, and as to the Institution, of necessity erect a scaffold: For the Common-wealth to the first Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Councills in full number, required thrice as many as are eligible by the foregoing Orders; wherefore the Gratour whose ayd in this place was most necessary, rightly informing the people of the reason, staid them two daies longer at the Muster, and tooke this course. One list containing two Knights and seven Deputies, he caused to be chosen upon the second day, which list being called the first Gallaxy, qualified the parties elected of it, with power for the Terme of one yeare and no longer; another list containing two Knights and seven Deputies more, he caused to be chosen the third day, which list being called the second Gallaxy, qualified the parties e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of it with power, for the terme of two yeares and no longer. And upon the fourth day he chose the third Gallaxy according as it is directed by the Order, impowered for three yeares, which Lists successively falling (like the signes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations of one Hemisphere, that setting cause those of the other to rise) cast the great Orbs of this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> into an Annuall Trienial and Perpetual Revolution.</p>

                  <hi>Agrarian</hi> Lawes of all others have ever been the greatest Bugbears, and so in the Institution were these, at which time it was ridiculous to see, how strange a fear appeared in every body of that which, being good for all, could hurt no body. But instead of the proof of this Order, I shall out of those many debates that happened ere it could be past, insert two <hi>Speeches</hi> that were made at the Councill of Legislators, the first by the Right Honourable <hi>Philautus de Garbo,</hi> a young man, being Heir apparent unto a very Noble Family, and one of the Counsellours, who expressed himself as followeth:

                                 <salute>May it please your Highnesse, My Lord Archon, OF <hi>Oceana,</hi>

                              <p>IF I did not (to my Capacity) know from how profound a Counsellor I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; it would certainly be no hard task to make it as light as the day; First, that an <hi>Agrarian</hi> is altogether unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: Secondly, that it is dangerous unto a Common-wealth: Thirdly, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to keep out Monarchy: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it destroyes Families: Fifthly, that it destroyes Industry: And last of all, that, though it were indeed of any good use, it will be a matter of such difficulty to introduce in this Nation, and so to settle that it may be lasting, as is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invincible.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  First, that an Agrarian is unnecessary
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56348:51"/>
unto a Common-wealth, what clearer te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony can there be, than, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths which are our Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (<hi>Venice,</hi> whereunto your Highnesse giveth the upper hand of all Antiquity, being one) have no such thing? And there can be no reason why they have it not, seeing it is in the Soveraign Power at any time to establish such an Order, but that they need it not; wherefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if <hi>Aristotle</hi> who pretends to be a good Common-wealths-man, have long since derided <hi>Phaleas,</hi> to whom it was attributed by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That an <hi>Agrarian</hi> is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous  unto a Common-wealth, is affirmed upon no sleight Authority, seeing <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavill</hi> is positive, that it was the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention which happened about the Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that caused the Destruction of <hi>Rome</hi>; Nor do I think that it did much better in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> as I shall shew anon.</p>

                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, That it is insufficient to  keep out <hi>Monarchy,</hi> cannot without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety be denyed, the holy Scriptures bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witnesse, that the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> notwithstanding her <hi>Agrarian,</hi> submitted her neck unto the Arbitrary Yoke of her Princes.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                                 <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56348:52"/>Wherefore to come unto my Fourth  Assertion, That it is destructive unto Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; this also is so apparent, that it needeth pity rather then proof. Why alas do you bind a Nobility, which no Generation shall deny to have been the first that freely sacrificed her blood unto the ancient Liberties of this People, up-an unholy Altar? VVhy are the People taught, That their Liberty, which except our noble Ancestors had been born, must have long since been buried, cannot now be born except we be buried?. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth should have the innocence of the Dove: Let us leave this purchase of her birth unto the Serpent, which eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her self out of the womb of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But it may be said perhaps, that we  are falne from our first Love, become proud and idle. It is certain (My Lords) that the hand of <hi>GOD</hi> is not upon Us for nothing; but take heed how you admit of such assaults and sallyes upon mens Estates, as may slacken the Nerve of labour, and give others also reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that their sweat is vain; Or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever be pretended, your <hi>Agrarian</hi> (which is my Fourth Assertion) must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed destroy Industry: For, that so it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56348:52"/>
did in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> is most apparent, as also that it could do no otherwise, where every man having his <hi>40.</hi> Quarters of Barley, with Wine proportionable, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed him out of his own Lot by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer or Helott; and being confin'd in that unto the scantling above which he might not live, there was not any such thing as a Trade, or other Art, save that of War, in excercise; VVherefore a <hi>Spartane,</hi> if he were not in Arms, must sit and play with his fingers, whence ensued perpetuall VVar; And, the Estate of the Citizen being as little capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, as that of the Common-wealth, her inevitable Ruine. Now what better ends you can propose unto your selves in like wayes, I do not so well see, as that there may be worse; For <hi>Lacedemon</hi> yet, was free from civill VVar; but if you imploy your Citizens no better then she did, I cannot promise you that you shall fare so well, because both they are still desirous of VVar that hope it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto them; And the strongest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity you can give of Peace, is to make it gainfull; otherwise men will rather choose that whereby they may break your Lawes, then that whereby your Lawes may break them; which I do not speak so
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56348:53"/>
much in relation unto the <hi>Nobility,</hi> or such as would be holding, as to the people or them that would be getting; the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in these being of so much the more strength, as a mans felicity is weaker in the Fruition of things, then in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and encrease of them.</p>
                              <p>Truly (my Lords) it is my fear, that by taking off more hands, and the best from Industry, you will farther indammage it, then can be repaired by laying on a few, and the worst: while the <hi>Nobility</hi> must be forced to send their Sons unto the Plough; and, as if this were not enough, to Marry their Daughters also unto Farmers.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  But I do not see (to come unto the last Point) how it is possible that this thing should be brought about, to your good I mean, though it may unto the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many: For that the <hi>Agrarian</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> or that of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> might stand, is no such miracle; the Lands without any Consideration of the former Proprietor, being surveyed and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to equall Lots, which could neither be bought, nor sold, nor multiplyed; so that they knew whereabout to have a man: but in this Nation no such Division can be introduced, the Lands being already in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56348:53"/>
the hands of Proprietors, and such whose Estates lye very rarely together, but mixed one with another, being also of Tenures in nature so different; that as there is no experience that an <hi>Agrarian</hi> was ever introduced in such a case, so there is no appearance how, or reason why, it should: but that which is against Reason and Experience is impossible.</p>

from no other principle then his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, lest the <hi>Agrarian</hi> should be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto his Country; It is no lesse then my duty to give the best satisfaction I am able unto so good a <hi>Patriot,</hi> taking every one of his doubts in the Order propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: And,</p>
                              <p>
                                 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  First, Whereas my Lord, upon Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Modern Common-wealths, is of opinion, that an Agrarian is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; It must be confessed, that at the first sight of them there is some appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance favouring his Assertion: but upon Accidents of no presidents unto us. For the <hi>Common-wealths</hi> of <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> I mean of those Leagues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing situated in Countries not alluring the Inhabitants unto wantonness, but obliging them unto universal Industry, have an implicite <hi>Agrarian</hi> in the nature of them: and being not obnoxious unto a growing Nobility, which as long as their former <hi>Monarchies</hi> spread the wing over them, could either not at all be hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or was soon broken; are of no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample unto us, whose experience in this point hath been unto the Contrary. But what if even in these <hi>Governments</hi> there be indeed an explicite <hi>Agrarian?</hi> For when the Law Commands an equall,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56348:54"/>
or near equall distribution of a mans Estate in Land among his Children, as in those Countries, a <hi>Nobility</hi> cannot grow, and so there needeth no <hi>Agrarian,</hi> or is one. And for the growth of the Nobility in <hi>Venice,</hi> (if so it be, for <hi>Machiavill</hi> observes in that Republick, as a cause of it, a great mediocrity of Estates) it is not a point that she is to fear, but might study, seeing She consisteth of nothing else but Nobility; by which, what ever their Estates suck from the People, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it come equally, is digested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the better blood of that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> which is all, or the greatest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they can have by accumulation; for how unequall soever you will have them to be in their Incoms, they have Officers of the Pomp, to bring them equall in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, or at least in the ostentation or shew of them: And so unlesse the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an Estate consist more in the measure then in the use of it, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Venice,</hi> but enforceth our <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;</hi> nor shall a man evade or elude the prudence of it, by the authority of any other <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> For if a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> have been introduced at once as those of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> you are certain to find her underlayd

the Root of that Common-wealth, that it shot oftner forth, and by intervals continued longer then any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may be computed from the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the same by <hi>Joshua, 1465.</hi> years before <hi>Christ,</hi> unto the totall Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which happened in the Raign of the Emperour <hi>Adrian 135.</hi> years after the Incarnation.

So the Lands of <hi>Oceana</hi> being thus distributed, and bound unto this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution, can never fall unto fewer then Five thousand Proprietors. But Five thousand Proprietors so seased will not agree to break the <hi>Agrarian;</hi> for that were to agree to rob one another; Nor to bring in a <hi>King,</hi> because they must maintain him, and can have no benefit by him; Nor to exclude the People, because they can have as little by that, and must spoyl their <hi>Militia.</hi> So the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>

continuing upon the ballance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, though it should come into Five thousand hands can never alter; And that it should ever come into Five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hands, is as improbable as anything in the World that is not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, other Considerations are more private: As that this Order de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes Families; which is as if one should lay the ruines of some ancient Castle unto the Herbs which do usually grow out of them; the destruction of those Families being that indeed which naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Order. For we do not now argue for that which we would have, but for that which we are already possessed of; as would appear, if a note were but taken of all such as have at this day above Two thousand pounds a year in <hi>Oceana.</hi> If my Lord should grant (and I will put it with the most) that they who are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors in Land, exceeding the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exceed not Three hundred; with what brow can the Interest of so few be ballanced with that of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or rather, what Interest have they to put in such a ballance? They would live as they have been accustomed to do: Who hinders them? They would enjoy
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56348:58"/>
their Estates, Who touches them? They would dispose of what they have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Interest of their Families; It is that which we desire. A man hath one Son, let him be called; Would he enjoy his Fathers Estate? It is his, and his Sons, and his Sons Sons after him. A man hath five Sons, let them be called, Would they enjoy their Fathers Estate? It is divided among them; for we have four Votes for one in the same Family, and therefore this must be the Interest of the Family; or the Family knoweth not her own Interest. If a man shall dispute otherwise, he must draw his Arguments from Custom, and from Greatnesse, which was the interest of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> not of the Family: and we are now a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> If the <hi>Monarchy</hi> could not bear with such divisions because they tended to a <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> neither can a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> connive at such accumulations, because they tend to a <hi>Monarchy.</hi> If the <hi>Monarchy</hi> might make bold with so many for the good of one; We may make bold with one for the good of so many, nay, for the good of all. My Lords, it cometh into my head, that upon occasion of the variety of Parties enumerated in our late Civill Wars, was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56348:58"/>
said by a Friend of mine coming home from his Travels, about the latter end of these Troubles; <hi>That he admired how it came to passe, that Younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, especially being so many more in number then their Elder, did not make one against a Tyranny, the like whereof hath not been exercised in any other Nation.</hi> And truly, when I consider that our Country-men are none of the worst natur'd, I must confesse I marveil much how it comes to passe, that we should use our Children, as we do our Puppies; take one, lay it in the lap, feed it with every good bit, and drown five. Nay worse; for as much as the Puppies are once drown'd, whereas the Children are left perpetually drowning. Really, my Lords, it is a flinty Custome and all this for his cruell Ambition, that would raise himself a Pillar, a golden Pillar for his Monument, though he have Children, his own reviving Flesh, and a kind of immortality. And this is that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of a Family, for which we are to think ill of a Government that will not endure it. But quiet your selves. The Land through which the River <hi>Nilus</hi> wanders in one stream, is barren, but where he parts into Seven, he multiplies
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56348:59"/>
his fertile shores, by distributing, yet keeping and improving such a Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Nutrition, as is a prudent <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> unto a well ordered <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Nor (to come unto the fifth Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is a Political body rendred any fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Industry, by having one Gowty, and another withered Leg, than a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: It tendeth not unto the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Merchandize that there be some who have no need of their Trading, and others that are not able to follow it. If confinement discourage Industry, an Estate in money is not confined; and lest Industry should want whereupon to work, Land is not engrossed, nor entailed upon any man, but remains at her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I wonder whence the computation can arise, that this should discourage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry? Two thousand pounds a year a man may enjoy in <hi>Oceana,</hi> as much in <hi>Panopea,</hi> Five hundred in <hi>Marpesia</hi>: there be other <hi>Plantations</hi>; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will have more: Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how far the Arms of our <hi>Agrarian</hi> may extend themselves? and whether he that might have left a Pillar, may not leave a Temple or many Pillars unto his more pious Memory? Where there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56348:59"/>
is some measure in riches, a man may be rich; but if you will have them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, there will be no end of sterving himself, and wanting what he hath: and what pains does such an one take to be poor! Furthermore if a man shall think, that there may be an Industry lesse grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or more noble, and so cast his thoughts upon the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> he will have Leisure for her, and she Riches and Honours for him; his sweat shall smell like <hi>Alexander's.</hi> My Lord <hi>Philau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is a young Man, who enjoying his Ten thousand pounds a year, may keep a noble House in the old way, and have homely Guests: and having but Two, by the means proposed, may take the upper hand of his great Ancestors; with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto whom, I may say, there hath not been one of them would have dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his place with a <hi>Roman Consul.</hi> My Lord do not break my heart; the Nobility shall go unto no other Ploughs then those from which we call our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls. But saith he, it having been so with <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that neither the City nor the Citizens was capable of increase, a blow was given by that <hi>Agrarian,</hi> which Ruined both. And what are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with that <hi>Agrarian,</hi> or that blow,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56348:60"/>
while our Citizens and our City (and that by our Agrarian) are both capable of encrease? The <hi>Spartane</hi> if he made a Conquest had not Citizens to hold it, the <hi>Oceaner</hi> will have enow: the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> could have no Trade, the <hi>Oceaner</hi> may have all. The Agrarian in <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> that it might bind on Knapsacks, forbidding all other Arts but that of War, could not make an Army of above <hi>30000.</hi> Citizens. The Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian in <hi>Oceana</hi> without interruption of Traffique, provides us in the fifth part of the Youth an annuall source or fresh spring of <hi>100000.</hi> besides our Provinciall Auxiliaries; out of which to draw marching Armies; And as many Elders, not feeble, but men most of them in the flowr of their Age, and in Arms for the defence of our Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Agrarian in <hi>Laconia,</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht money; this, multiplyes it. That, allowed a matter of twenty or thirty Acres to a man; this, two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: There is no Comparison between them. And yet I differ so much from my Lord, or his opinion, that the Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian was the Ruine of <hi>Lacedemon</hi>; that I hold it no lesse then demonstrable to have been her main support; For if
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56348:60"/>
banishing all other diversions it could not make an Army of above <hi>30000;</hi> then let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in all other diversions, it must have broken that Army: Wherefore <hi>Lysan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> bringing in the golden spoyles of <hi>Athens,</hi> irrecoverably ruin'd that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>; and is a warning to us, that in giving encouragement unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, we also remember, that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse</hi> is the root of all <hi>Evill.</hi> And our <hi>Agrarian</hi> can never be the cause of those Seditions threatened by my Lord, but is the proper cure of them, as <hi>Lucan</hi> noteth well in the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Civil Wars, which happened through the want of such an Antidote;

If a man cut my purse, I may have him by the heels, or by the neck for it; Whereas a man may cut a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56348:61"/>
Womans purse and have her for his pains in fetters. How bruitish, and much more then bruitish, is that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> which preferreth the Earth before the fruits of her Womb? If the people be her treasure, the staffe by which she is sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and comforted, with what Justice can she suffer them, by whom she is most inriched, to be for that cause the most impoverished? and yet we see the gifts of <hi>God,</hi> and the bounties of Heaven in fruitful Families, through this wretched custome of marrying for money, become their insupportable grief and poverty: nor falleth this so heavy upon the lower sort, being better able to shift for themselves, as upon the Nobility or Gentry: For what availeth it in this case, from whence their veins have derived their blood; while they shall see the Tallow of a <hi>Chandler,</hi> sooner converted into that beauty which is required in a Bride? I appeal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Lord <hi>Philautus</hi> or my self be the Advocate of <hi>Nobility;</hi> against which in the Case proposed by me, there would be nothing to hold the ballance.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56348:61"/>
then so much mony may command? And if she marry, no Nobleman can give his Daughter a greater portion then she hath. Who is hurt in this case? nay, who is not benefitted? If the <hi>Agrarian</hi> give us the sweat of our brows without diminution; if it prepare our table, if it make our Cup to over flow; and above all this, in providing for our Children, anoint our heads with that oyl which taketh away the greatest of worldly cares, what man, that is not besotted with a Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as vain as endlesse, can imagine such a Constitution to be his Poverty, seeing where no woman can be considerable for her portion, no portion will be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a woman; and so their Children will not only find better preferments without their brocage, but more freedom of their own affections. We are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full severe in Laws, That hey shall not marry without our consent; as if it were care and tendernesse over them: But is it not, lest we should not have the other thousand pound with this Son, or the other hundred pound a year more in Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that Daughter? These when we are crost in them are the sins for which we water our couch with tears, but not of Penitence; seeing whereas it is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56348:62"/>
beyond any that we can do unto our enemies, we persist to make nothing of breaking the affection of our Children.

But if our <hi>Agrarian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Ambition and Covetousness, we shall at length have the care of our own breed, in which we have been curious as to that of our Dogs and our Horses.

if a new survey were taken at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Rates, and the Law made, that no man should hold hereafter above so much Land as is valued therein at <hi>2000 l,</hi> a year; it would amount unto a good and sufficient <hi>Agrarian.</hi> It is true, that there would remain some difficulty in the different kind of Rents; And that it is a matter requiring not only more leisure then we have; but an Authority which may be better able to bow men unto a more generall Consent, then is to be wrought out of them by such as are in our capacity: Wherefore, as to the Manner, it is necessary that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it unto the <hi>Parliament;</hi> but as to the Matter, they can no otherwise fix their Government upon the right Ballance.</p>
                              <p>I shall conclude with a few words, to some parts of the Order, which my Lord hath omitted.

For while the People of that Country are little
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56348:63"/>
better then the Cattle of the Nobility, you must not wonder if according as these can make their Markets with Forreign Princes, you find these to be driven upon your Grounds: And if you be so tender now you have it in your Power, as not to hold an hand upon them that may prevent the Slaughter that must other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ensue in like Cases, the bloud will lye at your door. But in holding such an hand upon them, you may settle the <hi>Agrarian;</hi> and in settling the Agrarian, you give the People not only Liberty, but Lands; which makes your Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on necessary to their Security; and their Contribution due unto your Protection, as to their own Safety.</p>
                              <p>For the <hi>Agrarian</hi> of <hi>Panopea,</hi> it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing such Proportions of so good Land, men that conceive themselves streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this in <hi>Oceana,</hi> will begin there to let themselves forth, where every Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen will in time have his <hi>Villa.</hi> And there is no question, but the improvement of that Country by this means, must be far greater then it hath been in the best of former times.</p>
                              <p>I have no more to say, but that in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56348:63"/>
those ancient and heroicall Ages, when men thought that to be necessary which was virtuous; the Nobility of <hi>Athens</hi> having the People so much engaged in their Debt, that there remained no other question among these, than, which of those should be <hi>King;</hi> no sooner heard <hi>Solon</hi> speak than they quitted their Debts, and restored the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> Which ever after held a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Annuall Feast called the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacthia,</hi> or <hi>Recision</hi> in memory of that Action.

<q>IN your whole lives (my Lords) were you never entertained with so much Ingenuity; my Lord <hi>Epimonus</hi> having at once mended all the faults of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. For first, whereas they are abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Liars, he hath not told you (except some malicious body have mis-informed him, concerning poor <hi>Spy</hi>) one syllable of falsehood. And Secondly, whereas they never fail to give the upper hand in all their Discourses unto Forraign Nations, still justling their own into the Kennell; he bears an Honour unto his Country that will not dissolve in <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> nor be corrupted with Figs, and Melons, which I can assure you is no ordinary Obligation: and therefore hold it a matter of publick concernment, that we be no occasion of quenching my Lords Affections; nor is there any such great matter between us, but might me thinks be easily reconciled: for though that which my Lord gained by sitting in the House, I stedfastly believe, as he can affirm, was gotten fairly; yet dare I not, nor do I think, that upon consideration, he will promise so much
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56348:66"/>
for other Gamesters, especially when they were at it so high, as he intimates not only to have been in use, but to be like enough to come about again. Wherefore (say I) let them throw with boxes; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we will be below the Politicks of an ordinary, there is no such barre unto Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is known unto his Lordship, that our Game is, Most at a throw, and that every cast of our Dice is, in our Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; nor will be deny, that partiality in a Suffrage is downright Cogging. Now if the <hi>Venetian</hi> boxes be the most sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of all Remedies against this same Cogging: Is it not a strange thing that they should be thrown first into the fire by a fair Gamester? Men are naturally subject unto all kinds of Passion; Some you have that are not able to withstand the brow of an Enemy; And, others that make nothing of this, are lesse of proof against that of a Friend; So that if your Suffrage be bare-faced, I dare say you shall not have one fair cast in twenty. But what ever a mans fortune be at the box, he neither knoweth whom to thank, nor whom to Challenge. Wherefore (that my Lord may have a Charitable opinion of the choice Affection which I confesse to have above all other beauties, for that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56348:67"/>
of incomparable <hi>Venice</hi>) there is in this way of Suffrage no lesse then a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that it is the most pure; and the purity of the Suffrage in a popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the health, if not the life of it; seeing the Soul is no otherwise brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into the Soveraign Power, then by the Suffrage of the People. Wherefore no wonder if <hi>Postellus</hi> be of opinion, that this use of the Ball is the very same with that which was of the Bean in <hi>Athens;</hi> or, that others, by the Text concerning <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> derive it from the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> There is another thing, though not so materiall unto us, that my Lord will excuse Me, if I be not willing to yield, which is that <hi>Venice</hi> subsisteth only by her Situation; It is true, that a man in time of Warre, may be more secure from his Enemies, by being in a Citadell; but not from his Diseases; wherefore the first cause, if he live long, is his good Constitution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which his Citadell were to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and it is no otherwise with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>

At either end of the lower Stage stands a little Table, to which the Sacreteries of the Senate are set with their tufted sleeves in the habit of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Lawyers. Unto the foure-stepps, whereby the two Stages of the Throne are ascended, answer foure-long Benches, which successively deriving from every one of the stepps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their respective height, and extend themselves by the side Walls towards the lower end of the house, every bench

being divided by numerall Characters into the Thirty seaven parts or places. Upon the upper benches sit the Censors in the Robes of Barons; the first in the middle of the right hand bench, and the second directly opposite unto him on the other side. Upon the rest of the Benches sit the Knights, who if they be called unto the Urnes distributing themselves by the fiugres come in equall files, either by the first seale which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of the two upper benches on either side; or by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond seale consisting of the two lower benches on either side; beginning also at the upper, or at the lower ends of the same according to the Lot whereby they are called for which end the benches are open, and ascended at either end with easy staires, and large passages. The rest of the ballot is conformable unto that of the Tribe; the Censors of the house sitting at the side Urnes, and the youngest Magistrate of the Signory, at the middle; the Urnes being placed before the Throne, and prepared according unto the number of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to be at that time chosen by the rules already given unto the Censors of the Tribes. But before the benches of the Knights on either side stands one being shorter; and at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of this, sit the two Tribunes of the Horse; at the upper end of the other, the two Tribunes of the foot in their Armes; the rest of the benches being covered by the Judges of the Land in their Robes; but these Magistrates have no suffrage, neither the Tribunes, though they derive their presence in the Senate, from the Romans; nor the Judges, though they derive theirs, from the ancient Senate of <hi>Oceana.</hi> Every Monday, this assembly sits of course; at other times, if there be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any Magistrate of the House by giving order for the Bell or by his lictor, or ensigne-bearer calls a Senate; And every Magistrate or Knight during his session hath the Title, Place, and Honour of a Duke, Earle, Baron or Knight respectively.

               <p>This Order is of no other use then for the frame and turne of the Councils, and yet of no small one: for in motion consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Life, and the motion of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> will never be currant, unlesse it be circular.

Wherefore the Councils of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> both in regard of their Elections, and, as will be shewn, of their Affaires, are uniforme with the Senate in their Revolutions, not as Whirle-pits, to swallow, but to bite, and with the scrues of their Rotation, hold and turne a businesse like the Vice of a Smith, unto the hand of the Work-man; Without Engines of which nature it is not possible for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, much lesse for the people, to be perfect Artificers in a Politicall capacity.

A Knight of the Senate or a Deputy of the Prerogative may not be Elected Ambassadour in Ordinary, because a Knight or Deputy so chosen, must either lose his Session, which would cause an unevennesse in the motion of this Common-wealth, or accumulate Magistracy, which agrÃ©eth not with the equality of the same.

For example, if there be occasion of an Embassador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, the Provosts of the Council of State, or any two of them shall propose unto the same, till one Competitor be chosen by that Council: and the Council having chosen a Competitor shall bring his name into the Senate, which in the usuall way shall choose foure more Competitors unto the same Magistracy; and put them with the Competitor of the Council, unto the Ballot of the House, by which he of the five that is chosen, is said to be elected by the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teny of the Council of State. A Uice-Admiral, a Polemarch, or of the Council of War. A Iudge or Serjeant at Law by the Scruteny Field-Officer shall be elected after the same manner, by the Scruteny of the Commissioners of the Seale. A Baron, or considerable Officer of the Exchequer by the Scruteny of the Commissioners of the Treasury. Men in Magistracy, or out of it are equally capable of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection by the Scruteny; But a Magistrate or Officer elected by the Scruteny unto a Military imployment; if he be neither a Knight of the Senate, nor a Deputy of the Prerogative ought to have his Office confirmed by the Prerogative, because the Militia in a Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> where the people are Soveraign, is not lawfull to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>injussÃ¹ Populi.</hi>

               <p>The Romans were so curious that though their Consuls were elected <hi>Centuriatis,</hi> they might not touch the Militia, except they were confirmed <hi>Curiatis Comitiis</hi>: for a Magistrate not receiving his power from the People, takes it from them; and to take away their Power is to take away their Liberty. As to the Election by the Scruteny it may be easily perceived to be Venetian, there being no such way to take in the knowledge, which in all reason must be best in every Council of such men as are most fit for their turnes, and yet to keepe them from the bias of particular affection or interest under that pretence: For the cause why the great Council, in <hi>Venice</hi> scarce ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects any other then the Name that is brought in by the Scrute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is very probable to be; that they may.

And every Fifty in their turn; for one eight part of the year was a Council apart called the <hi>Prytans:</hi> the <hi>Prytans</hi> in their distinct Council receiving all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and giving ear unto every Man that had any thing to propose concerning the Common-wealth, had power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and prepare all the Businesses that were to be introduced into the Senate. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> had ten selected Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates called the <hi>Demiurgs,</hi> constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Council</hi> apart called the <hi>Synar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> which with the <hi>Strategus</hi> prepared

all the Business that was introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Senate:</hi> But neither the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> nor of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but would have wondred if a man should have told them, that they had been to receive all Comers, and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the end that they might refer them afterwards unto the <hi>Prytans</hi> or the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:</hi> much lesse unto an occasionall Committee, exposed unto the catch that catch may, of the parties interested. And yet <hi>Venice</hi> in this (as in most of her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,) excells them all by the constitution of her <hi>Councils,</hi> that of the Colledge, and the other of the <hi>Dieci.</hi> The course of the Colledge is exactly described in the ensuing Order: And for that of the <hi>Dieci</hi> it so little differs from what it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon our <hi>Dictator,</hi> that I need not to make any particular description of it. But to <hi>Dictatorian</hi> power in general, and the use of it, because it must needs be of difficult digestion unto such as, peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king still at ancient Prudence, shew themselves to be in the Nursery of Mother-wit; it is no less then necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to say something. And first, in a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> that is not wrought up, nor perfected, this Power will be of very frequent, if not continual use;

Wherefore it is said more then once upon defects of the Government in the Book of <hi>Judges, That, in those dayes there was no King in Israel;</hi> Nor hath the Translator (though for <hi>no King,</hi> he should have said <hi>no Judge</hi>) abused you so much; seeing that the <hi>Dictator,</hi> (and such was the <hi>Judge of Israel</hi>) or the <hi>Dictatorian Power</hi> being in a single Person, so little differs from <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> which followed in that, that from the same cause there hath been no other effect in any <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as in <hi>Rome</hi> was manifest by <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> who to make themselves Absolute or Soveraign, had no more to do, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their Magistracy; for <hi>Dictatoris imperium quasi Numen.</hi>

                                 </note> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, so it is, that without this Power which is so dangerous, and subject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce <hi>Monarchy,</hi> a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> cannot be safe from falling into the like Dissolution; For unless you have an Expedient in this Case of your own, and bound up by your providence from recoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Expedients in some Cases you must not only have, but be beholding for them unto such whom you must trust at a pinch, when you have not leisure to stand with them for Security; which will be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

times more dangerous. And there can never be a Common-wealth otherwise then by the Order in debate wrought up unto that perfection; but this necessity must sometimes happen in regard of her natural slownesse and openness, and the suddainess of Assaults that may be made upon her, as also the secresie which in some cases may be of absolute necessity unto her affairs. Whence <hi>Machiavil</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it positively, That a Commonwealth unprovided of such a Refuge, must ruine; for her course is either broken by the blow, in one of those cases; or by her self, while it startles her out of her Orders. And indeed a Common-wealth is like a <hi>Grey-hound,</hi> which having once coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will never after run fair, but grow sloathful; and when she comes to make a common practice of taking nearer wayes then her orders, she is dissolved; for the being of a Common-wealth consists in her Orders. Wherefore at this lift, you will be exposed unto danger, if you have not provided before-hand for the safety of your resort in like cases: nor is it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that your resort be safe, unless it be as secret, and quick; for if it be slow or open, your former inconveniences are not remedied. Now for our imitation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56348:76"/>
in this part, there is nothing in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence like that of the <hi>Council</hi> of Ten in <hi>Venice;</hi> the benefit whereof would be too long to be shewn in the whole Piece, and therefore I shall take but a pattern out of <hi>Janotti:</hi> In the War (saith he) which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had with <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Casentine,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> finding a necessity in their affairs far from any other inclination in themselves to ask their <hi>Peace,</hi> sent Ambassadours about it unto <hi>Venice,</hi> where they were no sooner heard, then the bargain was struck up by the Council of <hi>Ten;</hi> and every body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring (seeing this Common-wealth stood upon the higher ground) what should be the reason of such haste; the Council up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the return of the Embassadours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Letters unto the <hi>Senate,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeared, that the <hi>Turk</hi> had newly launched a formidable <hi>Fleet</hi> against their <hi>State;</hi> which had it been known to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> it was well enough known they would have made no <hi>Peace:</hi> Wherefore the service of the <hi>Ten</hi> was highly applauded by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> and celebrated by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Whereby may appear, not only in part what use there is of <hi>Dictatorian</hi> Power in that <hi>Government,</hi> but that it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed

and inspectors of the same, with right to propose unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                     <p>The Censors have equall power with these Magistrates, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto the Council of Religion only.</p>
                     <p>Any two of the thrÃ©e Provosts in every Council may propose to and are the more peculiar Proposers of, the same Council; to the end that there be not only an inspection and super-intendency of Businesse in general, but that every work be also committed unto a peculiar hand.</p>
                     <p>Any one or more of the Magistrates, or any two of the Provosts respectively having proposed; the Council shall debate the businesse so proposed, to which they of the third Region that are willing shall speak first in their order; they of the second, next; and they of the third, last; and the opinions of those that proposed or spoke as they shall be thought the most considerable by the Council, shall be taken by the Secretary of the same in writing, and each of them signed with the name of the Authour.</p>
                     <p>The opinions being thus prepared, any Magistrate of the Signory, Censor, or any two of the Provosts of that Council, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may assemble the Senate.</p>
                     <p>The Senate being assembled, the Opinions (for example, if they be four) shall be read in their Order, that is, according unto the order or dignity of the Magistrates or Counsellors by which they were signed. And being read, if any of the Council introducing them will speak, they as best acquainted with the Businesse, shall have precedence, and after them the Senators shall speak according unto their Regions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by the third first, and so continuing till every man that will, have spoken: and when the opinions have bÃ©en sufficiently debated, they shall be put altogether unto the Ballot after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Four Secretaries carrying each of them one of the opinions in one hand, with a white box in the other, and each following another, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the order of the opinions) shall present his Box, naming the Author of his opinion unto every Senator; and one Secretary or Ballotine with a grÃ©en Box shall follow the four white ones; and one Secretary of Ballotine with a red Box shall follow the grÃ©en one: and every Senator shall put one Ball into some one of these six boxes. The Suffrage being gathered and opened before the Signory: If the red box or Non-sincer had above half the Suffrages, the opinions shall be all cast out, for the Major part of the House is not clear in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.

If no one of the four opinions had above half the Suffrages in the Affirmative, that which had fewest shall be cast out, and the other thrÃ©e shall be Ballotted again. If no one of the thrÃ©e had above half, that which had fewest shall be cast out, and the other two shall Ballotted again. If neither of the two had above half, that which had fewest shall be cast out, and the remaining opinion shall be Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted again. And if the remaining opinion have not above half, it shall also be cast out. But the first of the opinions that arrives at most above half in the Affirmative is the DecrÃ©e of the Senate. The opinions being all of them cast out by the Non-cincer, may be review'd (if occasion permit) by the Council, and brought in again. If they be cast out by the Negative, the Case being of Advice only, the House approveth not, and there is an end of it: the Case being necessary, and admitting delay, the Council is to think again upon the Businesse, and to bring in new opinions, but the Case being necessary, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting delay; the Senate forthwith electing the <hi>Juncta</hi> shall create the <hi>Dictator.

                     <p>The Senate having prepared a DecrÃ©e to be proposed unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, shall appoint their Proposers: and no other may propose for the Senate unto the People but the Magistrates of the House; that is to say, the thrÃ©e Commissioners of the Seal, or any two of them; the thrÃ©e of the Treasury, or any two of them; or the two Censors.</p>
                     <p>The Senate having appointed their Proposers, shall require of the Tribunes a muster of the People at a set time and place: and the Tribunes, or any two of them having muster'd the People accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; the Proposers shall propose the sense or DecrÃ©e of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by Clauses unto the People.

more for us to do, but to dispatch. The Piece which we have reached to us in the foregoing Orders, is the <hi>Aristocracy. Athens,</hi> as hath been shewn, was plainly lost through the want of a good Aristocracy: but the sufficiency of an Aristocracy goes demonstrably upon the hand of the Nobility or Gentry: for that the Politicks can be master'd without study, or that the people can have leisure to study, is a vain imagination; and what kind of <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> Divines and Lawyers would make, let their incurable run upon their own narrow bias; and their perpetuall invectives against <hi>Machiavill</hi> (though in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces justly reproveable, yet the only Polititian, and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Patron of the people) serve for instruction.

               <p>Nobility may be defined divers wayes, for it is either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient riches, or ancient virtue, or title confer'd by a Prince or a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Nobility of the first kind may be subdivided into two other, such as hold an over-ballance in Dominion or Propriety unto the whole People: or such as hold not an over-ballance. In the former Case a Nobility (such was the <hi>Gothicks,</hi> of which sufficient hath been spoken) is incompatible with popular Government; for unto popular Government it is essential, that power should be in the people, but the overballance of a Nobility in Dominion, draweth the power unto themselves; wherefore in this sense it is that <hi>Machiavill</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, where he saith, (<hi>Questi tali sono pernitiosi in ogni Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, &amp; in ogni Provincia</hi>); that these are pernicious in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that they are Nations (<hi>lequali tutte inscieme sono la corruttela del mondo</hi>) which for this cause are the corruption of the world: for otherwise
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56348:79"/>
Nobility may according unto his definition, which is, <hi>That they are such as live upon their own revenues in plenty, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement either unto the tilling of their Lands, or other work for their livelihood</hi>; hold an underballance unto the people: In which case they are not onely safe, but necessary unto the naturall mixture of a well-ordered Common-wealth. For how else can you have a Common-wealth that is not altogether Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick? or what comparison is there of such Common-wealths, as are or come nearest to Mechanick; for example, <hi>Athens, Switz, Holland,</hi> unto <hi>Lacedemon, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with their <hi>Aristocracies.</hi> Your mechanicks, till they have first feather'd their nests, like the Fowles of the Ayr, whose whole imployment is to seek their food, are so busied in their private concernments, that they have neither leisure to study the publick, nor are safely to be trusted with it, (<hi>quia egestas haud facile habetur sine damno</hi>) because a man is not faithfully imbarqued in this kind of ship, if he have no share in the freight. But if his share be such as gives him leisure by his private advantage, to reflect upon that of the Publick: what other name is there for this sort of men (being <hi>Ã  leur ayte</hi>) but (as <hi>Machiavill</hi> you see calls them) Nobility? especially when their families come to be such as are noted, for their services done unto the Common-wealth, and so take into their ancient riches ancient virtue, which is the second definition of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but such an one as is scarce possible in nature without the former. <hi>For as the Baggage</hi> (saith <hi>Verulamius) is to an Army; so are riches to Virtue; they cannot be spared nor left behind, though they be</hi> impedimenta, <hi>such as not onely hinder the march, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the care of them lose or disturb the Victory.</hi> Of this later sort is the Nobility of <hi>Oceana</hi>; the best of all other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they having no stamp whence to derive their price, can have it no otherwise then by their intrinsick value. The third definition of <hi>Nobility,</hi> is Title, Honour, or Distinction from the people, conferr'd or allow'd by the Prince, or the Common-wealth; and this may be in two wayes, either without any stamp or priviledge as in <hi>Oceana,</hi> or with such priviledges as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56348:80"/>
are inconsiderable, as in <hi>Athens</hi> after the battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> whence the Nobility had no right, as such, but unto religious offices, or inspection of the publick games, whereunto they were also to be elected by the <hi>people</hi>: or with priviledges, and those considerable ones<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as the <hi>Nobility</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> before the battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> and the <hi>Patricians</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> each of which had right, or claimed it, unto the Senate and all the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; wherein for some time they only by their stamp were current.</p>
               <p>But to begin higher, and speak more at large of Nobility in their several capacities of the Senate; (<hi>Ã  Jove Principium</hi>) The Phylarchs or Princes of the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> were the most renowned; or, as the Latine, the most noble of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 1.16.) whereof by hereditary right they had the leading, and judging. The Patriarchs or Princes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies according as they declared their pedigrees, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 1.18.) had the like right as to their Families; but neither in these nor the former was there any hereditary right unto the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>; though there be little question but the wise men, and understanding and known among their Tribes which the people took or elected into those or other Magistracies, and <hi>Moses</hi> made Rulers over them, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 1.13.) must have been of these, seeing these could not choose but be the most known among the Tribes, and were likeliest by the advantages of education to be the most wise and understanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solon</hi> having found the <hi>Athenians</hi> neither Locally nor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogically, but by their different wayes of life, divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Tribes, that is, into the Souldiery, the Tradesmen, the Husbandmen, and the Goat-herds, instituted a new distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, according unto the <hi>Cense</hi> or valuation of their Estates into four Classes; the first, second, and third consisting of such as were Proprietors in Land, distinguished by the rate of their free-holds, with that stamp upon them, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them capable of honour unto their riches, that is to say, of the Senate and all the Magistracies, excluded the fourth, being the body of the people, and far greater in number then
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56348:80"/>
the former three, from other right as to those capacities, then the election of these, who by this means became an hereditary <hi>Aristocracy</hi> or <hi>Senatorian</hi> Order of Nobility. This was that course which came afterwards to be the destruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had now ruin'd <hi>Athens</hi>; the Nobility, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable nature of such an one, having laid the plot how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the people of the result, and so to draw the whole power of the Common-wealth unto themselves; which in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood they had done: if the people, coming by meer chance to be victorious in the battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> and famous for defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Greece</hi> against the <hi>Persian,</hi> had not returned with such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as irresistibly brake the Classes, unto which of old they had born a white tooth, brought the Nobility unto equall terms, and the Senate with the Magistracies to be common unto both; the Magistracies by Suffrage, and the Senate which was the mischief of it, as I shall shew anon in that constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by lot only.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were in the manner, and for the same cause with the <hi>Venetians</hi> at this day, no other than <hi>Nobility</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> even according to the definition given of Nobility by <hi>Machiavill</hi>; for they neither exercised any Trade, nor labour'd their Lands or Lots, which was done by their Helots; wherefore some Nobility may be far from pernicious in a Common-wealth, by <hi>Machiavill</hi>'s own testimony, who is an admirer of this; though the servants thereof were more then the Citizens. To these servants, I hold the answer of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> when he bad him who asked, why he did not admit the people unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Common-wealth, go home and admit his servants unto the government of his Family, to relate; for neither were the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> servants, nor farther capable of the Government, unlesse, whereas the Congregation had the result, he should have given them the debate also; every one of these that attained unto sixty years of age, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor vote of the Congregation, being equally capable of the <hi>Senate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56348:81"/>The Nobility of Rome and their capacity of the Senate, I have already described by that of <hi>Athens,</hi> before the battaile of <hi>Plateae,</hi> save only that the Athenian was never eligible into the Senate without the suffrage of the people, till the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the lot, but the Roman Nobility ever; for the <hi>patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Patricians</hi> were elected into the Senate by the Kings, by the Consuls, or the Censors; or if a plebeian happened to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, he and is posterity became patrician: nor, though the people had many disputes with the Nobility, did this ever come in controversy, which if there had been nothing else might in my judgment have been enough to overturne that Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, but that they are richer, and not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, resemble at all other points the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> as I have already shewn; these, <hi>Machiavill</hi> excepts from his rule, by saying, that their Estates are rather personal then real, or of any great revenue in Land: which comes unto our account, and shews, that a Nobility or party of the Nobility not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing in <hi>Dominion,</hi> is not dangerous, but of necessary use in every Common-wealth, provided that it be rightly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if it be so ordered as was that of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they do not overballance in the beginning, as they did not there, it will not be long ere they do, as is clear both in reason, and that experience towards the later end. That the Nobility be capable of the Senate, is there only not dangerous, where there be no other Citizens; as in this Government, and that of <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Switz</hi> though but few, have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges not only distinct from the people, but so great, that in some Soveraignties they have a Negative voice; an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which I am far from commending, being such as if those Governments were not Cantonized, divided and subdivided into many petty Soveraignties that ballance one another, and in which the Nobility except they had a Prince at the head of them, can never joyn to make work, would be the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56348:81"/>
that ever was; but the <hi>Gothick,</hi> of which it savours. For in ancient Common-wealths you shall never find a <hi>Nobility</hi> to have had a negative but by the pole, which, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far more in number, came to nothing; whereas these have it, be they never so few, by their stamp or order.</p>
               <p>Ours of <hi>Oceana,</hi> have nothing else but their education and their leisure for the publick, furnished by their ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent riches; and their intrinsick value, which according as it comes to hold weight in the Judgment or Suffrage of the People, is their only way unto honour and preferment: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would have your Lordships to look upon your Children as such, who if they come to shake off some part of their baggage, shall make the more quick and glorious march: for it was nothing else but the baggage sordidly plunder'd by the Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> that lost the victory of the whole World in the midst of her Triumph.</p>
               <p>Having follow'd the Nobility thus close, they bring us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto their natural course and divers kinds, unto the divers Constitutions of the Senate.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Israel</hi> (as was shew'd by my right noble Lord <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphorus de Auge</hi> in the opening of the Common-wealth) consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of seventy Elders, elected at the first by the people; but whereas they were for life, they ever after (though without any Divine precept for it) substituted their Successours by Ordination, which ceremony was most usually performed by imposition of hands, and by this means a Common-wealth of as popular institution as can be found, became, as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by <hi>Josephus,</hi> Aristocratical. From this ordination, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth that which was introduced by the Apostles into the Christian Church; for which cause I think it is, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would have the Government of the Church to be <hi>Aristocraticall</hi>; albeit the Apostles, to the end, as I conceive, that they might give no occasion unto such a mistake, but shew, that they intended the Government of the Church to be popular, <hi>Ordained Elders</hi> (as hath been shewn) <hi>by the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The Council of the Bean (as was shewn by my Lord <hi>Navarchus de Paralo,</hi> in his full discourse) being the proposing Senate of <hi>Athens</hi> (for that of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> was a Judicatory) consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of four, some say five hundred Senators, elected annually, all at once, and by a meer lot without suffrage; wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the <hi>Senate,</hi> to correct the temerity of the lot, had power to cast out-such as they should judge unworthy of that honour; this related to manners only, and was not sufficient to repair the Common-wealth, which by such means became impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and for as much as her Senate consisted not of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> which in a Common-wealth is the onely spur and rein of the people, was cast headlong by the rashnesse of her Demagogs or Grandees into ruine; while her Senate, like the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunes, <hi>(qui ferÃ¨ semper regebantur Ã  multitudine magis quam regebant)</hi> proposed not unto the Result only,<note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> (most truly discover'd by my Lord <hi>Laco de Scytale</hi>) consisted but of 30 for life, whereof the two Kings having but single votes, were hereditary, the rest ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive by the free Suffrage of the people, but out of such as were sixty years of age; these had the whole debate of the Common-wealth in themselves, and proposed unto the result only of the people: and now the riddle which I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore found troublesome to unfold, is out; that is to say, why <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon</hi> consisting each of the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> the one should be held a <hi>Democracy,</hi> and the other an
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56348:82"/>
                  <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> or laudable <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> as it is termed by <hi>Isocrates</hi>; (for that word is not, where ever you meet it, to be branded, seeing it is used also by <hi>Aristotle, Plutarch,</hi> and others, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a good sense)<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The main difference was, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this had the result only, and in that the debate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult too. But for my part, where the people have the election of the Senate, not bound unto a distinct order, and the result which is the Soveraign power, I hold them to have that share in the Government, (the <hi>Senate</hi> being not for life) whereof, with the safety of the Common-wealth, they are capable in nature, and such a Government for that cause to be <hi>Democracy</hi>; though I do not deny, but in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> the paucity of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators considered, it might be called <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> in comparison of <hi>Athens</hi>; or, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (whose fame hath been heard to thunder in the Eloquence of my Lord <hi>Stolo de Enyo</hi>) consisting of 300, was in regard of the number, lesse <hi>Oligarchicall</hi> then that of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi> but more in regard of the <hi>Patrician,</hi> who having an hereditary capacity of the same were not elected unto that honour by the people: but being Conscribed by the Censors, enjoy'd it for life: wherefore these if they had had their wills, would have resolv'd as well as debated; which set the people at such variance with them, as dissolv'd the Common-wealth: whereas if the people had enjoy'd the result, as well that about the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> as all other strife, must of necessity have cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>The Senates of <hi>Switzs</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> (as I have learnt of my Lords <hi>Alpester,</hi> and <hi>Glaucus</hi>) being bound up, like the sheaf of Arrowes which this gives, by leagues, lie like those in their quivers; But Arrowes when they come to be drawn, fly some this way, and some that: and I am contented that these concern us not.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56348:83"/>
Lord <hi>Linceus de Stella</hi>) hath obliged a world, sufficiently punisht by its own blindnesse or ingratitude, to repent and be wiser: for whereas a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in which there is no Senate, or where the Senate is corrupt, cannot stand: the Great Council of <hi>Venice</hi> like the <hi>Statua</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> leans upon an Urn or Water-pot, which poureth forth the Senate in so pure and perpetual a stream, as being unable to instagnate, is for ever uncapable of corruption. The fuller description of this Senate is contained in that of <hi>Oceana</hi>; and that of <hi>Oceana</hi> in the foregoing Orders. Unto every one of which, because something hath been already said, I shall not speak in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. But in general, your <hi>Senate</hi> (and the other Assembly, or the Prerogative, as I shall shew in due place) are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, not as Lakes or Puddles, but as the Rivers of <hi>Eden</hi>; and are beds made, as you have seen, to receive the whole people, by a due and faithful Vicissitude into their current. They are not, as in the later way, alternate. Alternate life in Government, is the alternate death of it.</p>

               <p>This was the <hi>Gothick</hi> Work, whereby the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not only a ship, but a gust too; could never open her sailes, but in danger to overset her self: neither make any Voyage, nor lye safe in her own Harbour. The Wars of later Ages (saith <hi>Verulamius</hi>) seem to be made in the dark, in respect of the glory and honour, which reflected upon men from the Wars in ancient times. Their shipping of this sort was for Voyages, ours dare not launch: nor lye they safe at home. Your <hi>Gothick</hi> Polititians seem unto me rather to have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some new ammunition<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or Gunpowder, in their King and Parliament (<hi>duo fulmina belli</hi>) then Government. For what is become of the Princes (a kind of people) in <hi>Germany</hi>? blown up. Where are the Estates, or the Power of the people in <hi>France</hi>? blown up. Where is that of the people in <hi>Aragon,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Kingdoms? blown up. On the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56348:83"/>
other side, where is the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s power in <hi>Holland</hi>? blown up. Where is that of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Princes in <hi>Switz</hi>? blown up. This perpetual peevishnesse and jealousie, under the alternate Empire of the Prince and of the People, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto every Spark. Nor shall any man shew a reason that will be holding in prudence, why the people of <hi>Oceana</hi> have blown up their King, but that their Kings did not first blow up them: The rest is discourse for Ladies. Wherefore your Parliaments are not henceforth to come out of the bag of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> but by the <hi>Gallaxy's,</hi> to be the perpetual food of the fire of <hi>Vesta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Gallaxy's which divide the House into so many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are three, one of which constituting the third region is annually chosen, but for the term of three years; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the house having blooms, fruit half ripe, and others drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off in full maturity, to resemble an Orange-Tree: such as is at the same time an education or spring, and an harvest too; for the people have made a very ill choice in the man, who is not easily capable of the perfect knowledge in one year of the Senatorian Orders; which knowledge allowing him for the first to have been a Novice, brings him the second year unto practice, and time enough; for at this rate you must alwaies have two hundred knowing men in the Government: and thus the vicissitude of your Senators is not perceiveable in the sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse and perpetuity of your Senate, which, like that of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> being alwaies changing, is for ever the same: and though other Polititians have not so well imitated their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, there is nothing more obvious in nature, seeing a man who wears the same flesh but a short time, is neverthelesse the same man, and of the same Genius; and whence is this but from the constancy of nature in holding a man unto her Orders? Wherefore hold also unto your Orders; but this is a mean request, your Orders will be worth little, if they do not hold you unto them: wherefore imbarque. They are like a ship, if you be once aboard, you do not carry them, but they you;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56348:84"/>
and see how <hi>Venice</hi> stands unto her tacklin, you will no more forsake them, then you will leap into the Sea.</p>
               <p>But they are very many, and difficult. O my Lords, what Seaman casts away his Carde because it hath four and twenty points of Compasse? and yet those are very near as many, and as difficult as the Orders in the whole Circumference of your Common-wealth. Consider; how have we been tossed with every wind of Doctrine, lost by the glib tongues of your Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogs and Grandees in our own Havens? A Company of Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that have disturbed your rest for your groat; two to one, three thousand pounds a year to another, hath been nothing: and for what? is there one of them that yet knowes what a Common-wealth is? And are you yet afraid of such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which these shall not dare to scrape, for fear of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute? <hi>Themistocles</hi> could not fiddle, but could make of a small City a great Common-wealth: these have fiddled, and for your money, till they have brought a great Common-wealth to a small City.</p>
               <p>It grieves me, while I consider how, and from what causes, imaginary difficulties will be aggravated, that the foregoing Orders are not capable of any greater clearnesse in discourse or writing: But if a man should make a book, describing every trick or passage, it would fare no otherwise with a game at Cards; and this is no more, if a man play upon the square. <hi>There is a great difference</hi> (saith <hi>Verulamius) between a cunning man and a wise man,</hi> (between a Demagog and a Legislator) <hi>not onely in point of honesty, but in point of ability: As there be that can pack the Cards, and yet cannot play well; so there be some that are good in canvasses and factions, that are otherwise weak men.</hi> Allow me but these Orders, and let them come with their Cards in their sleeves, or pack if they can. <hi>Again,</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is one thing to understand persons, and another to understand mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for many are perfect in mens humours, that are not greatly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the reall part of businesse: which is the constitution of one that hath studied men, more then books: but there is nothing more
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56348:84"/>
hurtfull in a State, than that cunning men passe for wise.</hi> His words are an Oracle. As <hi>Dionysius,</hi> when he could no longer exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his tyranny among men, turned School-master, that he might exercise it among boyes: Allow me but these Orders, and your Grandees so well skilled in the baites and palates of men, shall turn Rat-catchers.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Councils</hi> (as is discreetly observed by the same Authour in his time) <hi>are at this day, in most places but familiar meetings,</hi> (somewhat like the Academy of Provosts) <hi>where mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are rather talked on then debated; and run too swift to order an Act of Council</hi>: Give me my Orders, and see if I have not trash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Demagogs.</p>
               <p>It is not so much my desire to return upon haunts, as theirs that will not be satisfied; wherefore if notwithstanding what was said of dividing and choosing in our Preliminary discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, men will yet be returning unto the question, Why the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate must be a Council apart; though even in <hi>Athens,</hi> where it was of no other constitution then the Popular Assembly, the distinction of it, from the other, was never held lesse then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: this may be added unto the former reasons, that if the <hi>Aristocracy</hi> be not for the Debate, it is for nothing; but if it be for the Debate, it must have convenience for it: and what convenience is there for debate in a crowd, where there is nothing but jostling, treading upon one another, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of blood, than which in this case there is nothing more dangerous? Truly, it was not ill said of my Lord <hi>Epimonus,</hi> That <hi>Venice</hi> playes her Game as it were at billiards or nine-holes; and so may your Lordships, unlesse your ribs be so strong, that you think better of football; for such sport is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in a Popular Assembly, as, notwithstanding the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Senate, was the destruction of <hi>Athens.</hi>

                              <p>It is affirmed by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Flaccus,</hi> That the Common-wealths of <hi>Greece</hi> were all shaken or ruined<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> by the intemperance of their <hi>Comitia,</hi> or Assemblies of the People. The truth is, if good heed in this point be not taken, a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> will have bad Leggs. But all the World knowes he should have excepted <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where the People (as hath been shewn by the <hi>Oracle</hi>) had no power at all of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, nor (till after <hi>Lysander,</hi> whose Avarice opened a Gulph<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that was not long ere it swallowed up his Country) came it ever to be exercised by them: Whence that Common-wealth stood longest and firmest of any other, but this, in our dayes, of <hi>Venice</hi>; which having underlaid her Self with the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56348:86"/>
owes a great, if not the greatest part of her steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto the same principle; the great Council, which is with her the People, by the Authority of my Lord <hi>Epimonus,</hi> never speaking a word. Nor shall any Common-wealth where the People in their political capacity is talkative, ever see half the dayes of one of these: But being carried away by Vain-glorious Men (that, as <hi>Overbury</hi> sayes, Pisse more then they drink) Swim down the sink; as did <hi>Athens,</hi> the most prating of these <hi>Dames,</hi> when that same ranting fellow <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> fell on Demagoging for the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Debate by the Authority and experience of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> is not to be committed unto the People in a well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Government; It may be said, That the Order specify'd is but a slight barre in a matter of like danger; For so much as an Oath, if there be no recourse upon the breach of it, is a weak tye for such hands as have the Sword in them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what should hinder the People of <hi>Oceana</hi> if they happen not to regard an Oath, from assuming Debate, and making themselves as much an <hi>Anarchy</hi> as those of <hi>Athens</hi>? To which I answer, Take the Common sort in a private Capacity, and except they be injured, you shall find them to have <hi>(Verecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam Patrum)</hi> a bashfulnesse in the presence of the better sort, or wiser Men; acknowledging their abilities by attention; and accounting it no mean Honour to receive respect from them. But if they be injured by them, they hate them, and the more for being wise, or great, because that makes it the greater injury. Nor refrain they in this Case from any kind of intemperance of speech, if of Action. It is no otherwise with a People in their political Capacity; You shall never find that they have assum'd Debate for it self, but for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else: Wherefore in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> where there was, and in <hi>Venice</hi> where there is, nothing else for which they should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it, they have never shewn, so much as an inclination to it. Nor was there any appearance of such a desire in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> (who from the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> had been very
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56348:86"/>
well contented with the Power of Result either <hi>Comitiis Curia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> as it was settled upon them by him; or <hi>Centuriatis,</hi> as it was alter'd in their regard for the worse by <hi>Servius Tullius</hi>) till news was brought some fifteen years after the exile of <hi>Tarquine</hi> their late King (during which time, the Senate had governed passing well) that he was dead at the Court of <hi>Aristodemus</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Cumae.

But this debate was interrupted by tumultuous news of the near
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56348:87"/>
approach of the <hi>Volsci,</hi> a case in which the Senate had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course but to the People, who contrary unto their former custom upon like occasions would not stir afoot, but fell on laughing, and saying, (<hi>Patres militarent patres arma caperent, ut penes eosdem pericula belli, penes quos praemia, essent</hi>) Let them fight that have something to fight for. The Senate that had purses, and could not sing so well before the Thief, being in great perplexity, found no possible way out of it, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech <hi>Servilius,</hi> one of a Genius well known to be Popular, That he would accept of the Consulship, and make some such use of it as might be helpful to the <hi>Patrician</hi> interest. <hi>Servilius</hi> accepting of the offer, and making use of his Interest with the people, perswaded them to hope well of the good intention of the Fathers, whom it would little beseem to be forced unto those things which would lose their Grace, and that in view of the enemy, if they came not freely; and withall published an Edict, That no man should with-hold a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> by Imprisonment from giving his Name (for that was the way, as I shall have opportunity hereafter to shew more at large, whereby they drew out their Armies) nor seize, nor sell any Mans Goods or Children that was in the Camp; Whereupon the people with a mighty Concourse immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took Arms, marched forth, and (which to them was as easie as to be put into the humour, and that as appears in this place was not hard) totally defeated the <hi>Volsci</hi> first, then the <hi>Sabines,</hi> (for the neighbour Nations, hoping to have had a good bargain of the Discord in <hi>Rome</hi> were up on all sides) and after the <hi>Sabines,</hi> the <hi>Aurunci.</hi> Whence returning victorious in three Battels, they expected no lesse then that the Senate would have made good their Words. When <hi>Appius Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> the other Consul of his innate Pride, and that he might frustrate the faith of his Collegue, caused the Souldiers (who being set at liberty had behaved themselves with such valour) to be restored at their return unto their Creditors, and their Gaoles. Great resort upon this was made by the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Servilius,</hi> shewing him their Wounds, calling him to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesse
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56348:87"/>
how they had behaved themselves, and minding him of his promise. Poor <hi>Servilius</hi> was sorry, but so over aw'd with the headinesse of his Collegve, and the obstinacy of the whole faction of the Nobility; that not daring to do any thing either way, he lost both Parties: the Fathers conceiving that he was Ambitious, and the People that he was False: while the Consul <hi>Claudius</hi> continuing to countenance such as daily seized and imprisoned some of the indebted People, had still new, and dangerous Controversies with them, insomuch that the Common-wealth was torn with horrid Division, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (because they found it not so safe, or so effectual in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique) minded nothing but laying their heads together in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conventicles. For this <hi>A. Virginius,</hi> and <hi>Titus Vetusius</hi> the new Consuls were reproved by the Senate as slothfull, and upbraided with the Virtue of <hi>Ap. Claudius.</hi> Whereupon the Consuls having desired the <hi>Senate,</hi> that they might know their pleasure, shewed afterwards their readinesse to obey it, by summoning the People according unto command, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Names whereby to draw forth an Army for diversion, but no man would answer. Report hereof being made unto the <hi>Senate,</hi> the younger sort of the Fathers grew so hot with the Consuls, that they desired them to abdicate the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which they had not the courage to defend.</p>
                              <p>The Consuls, though they conceived themselves to be rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, made this soft Answer: <hi>Fathers Conscript,</hi> that you may please to take notice it was foretold, some horrid Sedition is at hand: We shall onely desire, that they whose valour in this place is so great, may stand by us to see how we behave our Selves, and then be as resolute in your Commands as you Will: Your Fatherhoods may know if we be wanting in the performance.</p>
                              <p>At this, some of the hot bloods returned with the Consuls unto the Tribunal, before which the People were yet stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Consuls having generally required Names, in vain, (to put it unto something) required the name of one that was in their eye particularly; on whom, when he moved not,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56348:88"/>
they commanded a <hi>Lictor</hi> to lay hands; but the People throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the party summon'd, forbad the <hi>Lictor</hi> who durst not touch him; at which the Hot-spurs that came with the Consuls, enraged by the affront, descended from the Throne to the ayd of the <hi>Lictor</hi>; from whom in so doing they turned the indignation of the People upon themselves with such heat, that the Consuls interposing, thought fit by remitting the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, to appease the Tumult; in which neverthelesse there had been nothing but noise. Nor was there lesse in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> being suddainly rally'd upon this occasion, where they that received the Repulse, with others, whose heads were as addle as their own, fell upon the businesse as if it had been to be determined by Clamour, till the Consuls, upbraiding the Senate, that it differ'd not from the Market-place, reduced the House unto Orders: And the Fathers having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted accordingly, there were three Opinions. <hi>P. Virginius</hi> conceived, that the Consideration to be had upon the matter in question, (or ayd of the indebted and imprison'd people) was not to be farther extended then unto such as had engaged upon the promise made by <hi>Servilius: T. Largius,</hi> that it was no time to think it enough, if mens merits were acknowledged, while the whole People, sunk under the weight of their debts, could not emerge without some commmon ayd; which to restrain by putting some into a better Condition then others, would rather more inflame the Discord then extinguish it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                                 <hi>Ap. Claudius</hi> (still upon the old haunt) would have it, That the People were rather wanton then fierce: It was not oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that necessitated, but their Power that invited them unto these Freaks; the Empire of the Consuls since the Appeal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the People (whereby a plebeian might ask his Fellowes if he were a Thief) being but a meer Scar-crow. Go to, (sayes he) Let us create the <hi>Dictator,</hi> from whom there is no appeal, and then let me see more of this Work; or him that shall forbid my <hi>Lictor.</hi> The advice of <hi>Appius</hi> was abhorr'd by many, and to introduce a general Recision of Debts with <hi>Largius,</hi> was to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56348:88"/>
violate all Faith: That of <hi>Virginius</hi> as the most moderate would have past best, but that there were private Interests (that same bane of the Publique) which withstood it; So they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with <hi>Appius</hi>; who also had been <hi>Dictator,</hi> if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls and some of the graver sort had not thought it altogether unseasonable, at a time when the <hi>Volsci</hi> and the <hi>Sabins</hi> were up again, to venture so far upon Alienation of the People; for which cause <hi>Valerius,</hi> being descended from the <hi>Publicola's,</hi> the most Popular Family, as also in his own person of a mild nature, was rather trusted with so rigid a Magistracy. Whence it happened, that the People, though they knew well enough against whom the <hi>Dictator</hi> was created, feared nothing from <hi>Valerius</hi>; But upon a new promise made to the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with that of <hi>Servilius,</hi> hoped better another time, and throwing away all Disputes, gave their Names roundly, went out, and (to be brief) came home again as Victorious as in the former Action, the <hi>Dictator</hi> entring the City in Triumph. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse when he came to presse the <hi>Senate,</hi> to make good his promise, and do something for the ease of the People, they regarded him no more as to that point then they had done <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Dictator,</hi> in disdain to be made a stale, abdicated his Magistracy, and went home. Here then was a Victorious Army without a Captain, and a <hi>Senate</hi> pulling it by the beard in their Gowns. What is it (if You have read the Story, for there is not such another) that must follow? Can any Man imagine, that such only should be the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon which this People could run away! Alas, poor men, the <hi>Aequi</hi> and the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and the <hi>Sabines</hi> were nothing, but the Fathers invincible! There they sate some three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them armed all in Robes, and thundring with their Tongues; no hopes in the earth to reduce them unto any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Conditions: Wherefore, no thinking to abide long so near them; away marches the Army, and encamps in the Fields. This Retreat of the People is called the <hi>Secession</hi> of <hi>Mount Aventine,</hi> where they lodged, very sad at their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56348:89"/>
but not letting fall so much as a word of Murmur against the Fathers. The Senate by this time were great Lords, had the whole City unto themselves; but certain Neighbours were upon the way that might come to speak with them, not asking leave of the Porter. Wherefore their minds became troubled, and an Orator was posted unto the People to make as good Conditions with them as he could; but, whatever the terms were, to bring them home, &amp; with all speed: And here it was covenanted between the Senate, and the People, That these should have the Magistrates of their own Election, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Tribunes</hi>; upon which they returned.</p>
                              <p>To hold you no longer, the <hi>Senate</hi> having done this upon necessity, made frequent attempts to retract it again; while the Tribunes on the other side, to defend what they had gotten, instituted their <hi>Tributa Comitia,</hi> or <hi>Councill</hi> of the People; where they came in time, and as disputes increased, to make Lawes without the Authority of the Senate, called <hi>Plebiscita:</hi> Now to conclude in the Point at which I drive; such were the steps whereby the People of <hi>Rome</hi> came to assume Debate: nor is it in Art or Nature to debarre a People of the like effect, where there is the like cause: For <hi>Romulus</hi> having in the Election of his Senate squared out a Nobility for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a Throne, by making that of the <hi>Patricians</hi> a distinct and hereditary Order, planted the Common-wealth upon two contrary Interests, or Roots, which shooting forth in time produced two Common-wealths, the one <hi>Oligarchical</hi> in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the other a meer <hi>Anarchy</hi> of the People, which thenceforth caused a perpetual feud and enmity between the Senate and the People, even to death.</p>
                              <p>There is not a more noble, or usefull question in the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, then that which is started by <hi>Machiavil,</hi> Whether means were to be found whereby the Enmity that was between the Senate and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> might have been removed. Nor is there any other in which we, or the present occasion, are so much concerned, particularly in relation unto this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; For as much as his Judgment in the determination of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56348:89"/>
the question standing, our Common-wealth falleth. And he that will erect a Common-wealth against the Judgment of <hi>Machiavill,</hi> is obliged to give such reasons for his enterprize as must not go on begging.

                              <p>Lacedemon <hi>being governed by a King and a small Senate, could maintain it self a long time in that Condition, because the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, being few, having put a bar upon the reception of Strangers, and living in strict observation of the Lawes of</hi> Lycurgus, <hi>which now had gotten reputation, and taken away all occasion of Tumults, might well continue long in Tranquillity: For the Lawes of</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus <hi>introduced a greater equality in Estates, and a less equality in Honours; whence there was equall Poverty, and the Plebeians were lesse Ambitious, because the Honours, or Magistracies of the City could extend but unto a few; and were not communicable unto the People; nor did the Nobility by using them ill, ever give them a desire to participate of the same: This proceeded from the Kings, whose Principality being placed in the midst of the Nobility, had no greater means whereby to support it self, then to shield the People from all Injury; Whence the People not fearing Empire, desired it not. And so all occasion of enmity between the Senate and the People was barr'd. But this union happened especially from two causes, the one, that the Inhabitants of</hi> Lacedemon <hi>being few, could be govern'd by the Few. The other, that not receiving Strangers into their Common-wealth, they did not corrupt it, nor increase it, unto such a Proportion as was not governable by the Few.</hi>

                              <p>Venice <hi>hath not divided with her Plebeians, but all are called Gentlemen that be in administration of the Government; for which Government She is more beholding unto</hi> Chance, <hi>then the</hi> Wisdome <hi>of her Law-makers; For many retiring unto those Islands, where that City is now built from the inundations of</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians

                                 <hi>that overwhelm'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, when they were encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto such a number, that to live together it was necessary to have Lawes: They Ordained a form of Government, whereby assembling often in Council upon Affairs, and finding their number sufficient for Government, they put a barre upon all such as repairing afterwards unto their City should become Inhabitants, excluding them from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Power. Whence they that were included in the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had right; and they that were excluded, coming afterwards, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received upon no other Conditions to be Inhabitants, had no wrong, and therefore had no occasion; nor were they trusted with Arms, and therefore had no means to be tumultuous. Wherefore this Common-Wealth might very well maintain her Self in Tranquillity.</hi>

                                 <hi>These things considered, it is plain, that the</hi> Roman <hi>Legislators to have introduced a quiet State, must have done one of these two things; Either shut out Strangers, as the</hi> Lacedemonians; <hi>Or, as the</hi> Venetians, <hi>not allow'd the People to bear Arms. But they did neither. By which means the People having power and encrease, were in perpetual Tumult. Nor is this to be helped in a Common-Wealth for Increase, seeing if</hi> Rome <hi>had cut off the occasion of her Tumults, She must have cut off the means of her Increase, and by consequence of her Greatnesse.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Wherefore let a Legislator consider with himself, whether he would make his Common-wealth for Preservation, in which Case She may be free from Tumults; or for Increase, in which case she must be infested with them.</hi>
                              </p>

                                 <hi>If he make her for Preservation she may be quiet at home; but will be in danger abroad. First, because her foundation must be narrow, and therefore weak; as that of</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>which lay but upon</hi> 30000 <hi>Citizens; or that of</hi> Venice, <hi>which lyes but upon three Thousand. Secondly, such a</hi> Common-wealth <hi>must either be in Peace, or in War; If She be in Peace, the Few are soonest effeminated and corrupted, and so obnoxious also unto Faction: If in War, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ill, she is an easie prey; or succeeding well, ruined by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a Weight which her Foundation is not able to bear.

all</hi> Greece, <hi>through a slight accident, the rebellion of</hi> Thebes, <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the Conspiracy of</hi> Pelopidas <hi>discovering this infirmity of her nature, the rest of her conquer'd Cities immediately knocked off, and in the turn as it were of an hand reduced her from the fullest Tide, unto the lowest Ebb of her fortune. And</hi> Venice <hi>having possessed Her self of a great part of</hi> Italy <hi>by her Purse, was no sooner, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, put unto the tryall of her Arms, then She lost all in one Battail.</hi>

                                 <hi>Whence I conclude, That in the Ordination of a</hi> Common-wealth, <hi>a Legislator is to think upon that which is most honourable; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside the Modells for Preservation, to follow the example of</hi> Rome <hi>conniving at, and temporizing with the enmity between the</hi> Senate <hi>and the</hi> People, <hi>as a necessary step unto the</hi> Roman <hi>Greatnesse. For that any man should find out a ballance that may take in the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, and shut out the inconveniencies of both, I do not think it possible.</hi> These are the words of the Author, though the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod be somewhat alter'd, to the end that I may the better turn them unto my hand.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords,</hi> I do not know how you hearken unto this sound, but to hear the greatest Artist in the modern World, giving Sentence against our Common-wealth; is that, with which I am nearly concerned. Wherefore, with the honour due unto the Prince of Polititians, let us examine his ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with the liberty which he hath asserted to be the right of a free people. But we shall never come up to him, except by taking the Businesse a little lower, we descend from effects to their causes. The Causes of Commotion in a Common-wealth are either external or internal. External are from Enemies, from Subjects, or from Servants. To dispute then what was the Cause why <hi>Rome</hi> was infested by the <hi>Italian,</hi> or by the Servile Wars, why the Slaves took the Capitol: why the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were near as frequently troubled with their Helots, as <hi>Rome</hi> with all those? Or why <hi>Venice,</hi> whose Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not trusted unto the faith of Men, hath as good or better quarter with them whom She Governeth, then <hi>Rome</hi> had with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56348:91"/>
the Latines; were to dispute upon external Causes: the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion put by <hi>Machiavill,</hi> is of internal Causes; Whether the enmity that was between the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> might have been removed; And to determine otherwise of this question then he doth, I must lay down other Principles then he hath. To which end I affirm, that a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> internally considered is either equall, or unequall. <hi>A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth that is internally equall hath no internall cause of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore can have no such effect, but from without. A Commonwealth internally unequall hath no internall cause of quiet, and therefore can have no such effect, but by diversion.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>To prove my Assertions, I shall at this time make use of no other then his examples. <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was externally unquiet, because She was externally unequall, that is as to her Helots; and she was internally at rest, because she was equall in her Self, both in root and branch; In the root by her <hi>Agrarian,</hi> and in branch by the <hi>Senate,</hi> in as much as no man was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto qualified, but by election of the People: Which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> is mention'd by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> where he saith, That rendring his Citizens aemulous (not carelesse) of that Honour,<note place="margin">

                                 </note> he designed unto the People the Election of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Wherefore <hi>Machiavill</hi> in this, as in other places, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his eye upon the Division of <hi>Patrician</hi> and <hi>Plebeian</hi> Families as they were in <hi>Rome,</hi> hath quite mistaken the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this Common-wealth, where there was no such thing. Nor did the Quiet of it derive from the Power of the Kings, who were so far from shielding the People from injury, of the Nobility, of which there was none in his sense, but the Senate, that one declared end of the Senate at the Institution, was to shield the people from the Kings, who thenceforth had but single Votes: Neither did it proceed from the streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Senate, or their keeping the People aloof from the Government, that they were quiet, but from the equality of their administrations, seeing the <hi>Senate</hi> (as is plain by the Oracle, their fundamental Law) had no more then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56348:91"/>
and the Result of the Common-wealth belonged unto the People. Wherefore when <hi>Theopomp</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> Kings of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> would have kept the people aloof from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note place="margin">

                              <p>For <hi>Venice,</hi> to say, that she is quiet because she disarms her Subjects, is to forget, that <hi>Lacedemon</hi> disarmed her Helots, and yet could not in their regard be quiet; wherefore if <hi>Venice</hi> be defended from external causes of commotion, it is first, through her situation, in which respect her Subjects have no hope, (and this indeed may be attributed unto her fortune) and secondly, through her exquisite Justice, whence they have no will to invade her: but this can be attributed to no other cause then her prudence: which will appear to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as we look nearer; for the effects that proceed from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (if there be any such thing) are like their cause, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; but there never happened unto any other Common-wealth,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56348:92"/>
so undisturbed and constant a tranquillity and peace in her self, as is that of <hi>Venice</hi>; wherefore this must proceed from some other cause then Chance. And we see that as she is of all others the most quiet, so the most equal, Common-wealth. Her body consists of one Order, and her Senate is like a rolling stone (as was said) which never did, nor, while it continues upon that rotation, ever shall gather the mosse of a divided or ambitious interest; much lesse such an one as that which grasped the people of <hi>Rome</hi> in the talons of their own Eagles. And if <hi>Machiavill,</hi> a verse from doing this Common-wealth right, had consider'd her Orders, (as his reader shall easily perceive he never did) he must have been so far from attributing the prudence of them unto Chance, that he would have touched up his admirable work unto that perfection, which, as to the civil part, hath no pattern in the universall World, but this of <hi>Venice.</hi>

                                 <hi>Rome,</hi> secure by her Potent and Victorious Arms from all external causes of commotion, was either beholding for her peace at home, unto her Enemies abroad, or could never rest her head. My Lords, you that are Parents of a Common-wealth, and so freer Agents then such as are meer natural, have a care. Fo, ras no man shall shew me a Commonwealth born streight, that ever became crooked; so, no man shall shew me a Common-wealth born crooked, that ever became streight: <hi>Rome</hi> was crooked in her birth, or rather prodigious, her twins the <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeian</hi> Orders came, as was shewn by the foregoing story, into the world, one body, but two heads, or rather two bellies; for, notwithstanding the Fable out of <hi>Aesop,</hi> whereby <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> the Orator that was sent from the <hi>Senate</hi> unto the People at <hi>Mount Aventine</hi>; shew'd the Fathers to be the belly, and the people to be the Arms and the Legs; which except that, how sloathful soever it might seem, were nourished, not these but the whole body must languish and be dissolved; it is plain, that the Fathers were a distinct belly, such an one as took the meat indeed out

Neverthelesse, as the people that live about the Cataracts of <hi>Nilus</hi> are said not to hear the noise; so neither the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, nor <hi>Machiavill</hi> the most conversant with them, seem among so many of the Tribunitian storms, to hear their natural voice: for though they could not misse of it, so far as to attribute them unto the strife of the People for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in Magistracy; or, in which <hi>Machiavill</hi> more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly joyns, unto that about the <hi>Agrarian</hi>; this was to take the businesse short, and the remedy for the disease.</p>

And for experience, it was in the like case, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> set up their Ephors, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> after the battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> bowed the Senate (so hard a thing it is for a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> that was born crooked to become streight) as much the other way. Nor, if it be objected, that this must have ruin'd the Nobility, and in that deprived the Common-wealth of the Greatnesse which she acquired by them; is this opinion hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but confuted by the sequell of the story, shewing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56348:93"/>
plainly, that the Nobility through the defect of such Orders, that is to say, of <hi>Rotation</hi> and the <hi>Agrarian</hi>) came to eat up the people; and battening themselves in Luxury, (to be as <hi>Salust</hi> speaketh of them, <hi>Inertissumi nobiles, in quibus sicut in statua, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nomen, nihil erat additamenti</hi>) to bring so mighty a Common-wealth, so huge a glory, unto so deplorable an end. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, means might have been found, whereby the enmity that was between the Senate and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> might have been removed. My Lords,â€”</p>
                              <p>If I have argued well, I have given you the comfort and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that notwithstanding the judgment of <hi>Machiavill,</hi> your Common-wealth is both safe and sound: but if I have not argued well, then take the comfort and assurance which he gives you, while he is firm, That a Legislator is to lay aside all other examples, and follow that of <hi>Rome</hi> only, conniving and temporizing with the enmity between the Senate and the People, as a necessary step unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatnesse. Whence it followes, that your Common-wealth at the worst, is that which he hath given you his word is the best.</p>
                              <p>I have held your Lordships long, but upon an account of no small importance, which I can now sum up in these few words: Where there is a lickerrishnesse in a popular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Debate, it proceedeth not from the constitution of the People, but of the Common-wealth: Now that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is of such Constitution as is naturally free from this kind of intemperance, is that which to make good, I must divide the remainder of my Discourse into two Parts.</p>

The vastnesse of this weight, as also the slownesse, thence inavoidable, became a great cause (as hath been shewn at large by my Lord <hi>Phospho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) of the breaking that Common-wealth; notwithstanding that the Temple, and those religious Ceremonies for which the people were at least annually obliged to repair thither; were no small ligament of the Tribes; otherwise but slightly tack'd together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athens</hi> consisted of four Tribes, taking in the whole People both of the City, and of the Territory; not so gather'd by <hi>Theseus</hi> into one Town, as to exclude the Country, but to the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56348:94"/>
end that there might be some Capital of the Commonwealth: though true it be, that the Congregation consisting of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants within the Walls, was sufficient to all intents and purposes, without those of the Country; these also being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding numerous, became burdensome unto themselves; and dangerous unto the Common-wealth: the more for their ill education, as is observed by <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> who compare them unto Marriners, that in a calm are perpetually disputing and swaggering one with another, and never lay their hands unto the Common tackling or safety, till they be all indangered by some storm: Which caused <hi>Thucydides,</hi> when he saw this people through the purchase of their misery, become so much wiser, as to reduce their <hi>Comitia</hi> or Assemblies unto five thousand, to say, (as in his eighth Book) <hi>And now (at least in my time) the</hi> Athenians <hi>seem to have ordered their State aright; consisting of a moderate temper both of the Few</hi> (by which he means the Senate of the Bean) <hi>and of the Many,</hi> or the five thousand; and he doth not only give you his judgment, but the best proof of it; for <hi>this</hi> (saith he) <hi>was the first thing, that after so many misfortunes past, made the City again to raise her head.</hi> The place I would desire your Lordships to note, as the first example, that I find, or think is to be found, of a popular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by way of Representative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lacedemon</hi> consisted of thirty thousand Citizens dispersed throughout <hi>Laconia,</hi> one of the greatest Provinces in all <hi>Greece,</hi> and divided (as by some Authors is probable) into six Tribes; of the whole Body of these being gather'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the great Church or Assembly, which had the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power; the little Church, gather'd sometimes for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of concernment, within the City, consisted of the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> only: these happened like that of <hi>Venice</hi> to be good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of a Congregation, but from an ill cause the infirmity of a Common-wealth which through her Paucity was <hi>Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, go which way you will, it should seem, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56348:95"/>
without a Representative of the people, your Commonwealth consisting of an whole Nation, can never avoid falling either into <hi>Oligarchy</hi> or confusion.</p>
               <p>This was seen by the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose rustick Tribes extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves from the river <hi>Arno,</hi> unto the <hi>Vulturnus,</hi> that is, from <hi>Fesulae</hi> or <hi>Florence</hi> unto <hi>Capua,</hi> invented a way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative by Lots; the Tribe upon which the first fell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prerogative, and some two or three more that had the rest, the <hi>Jure-vocatae:</hi> These gave the Suffrage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth (<hi>binis Comitiis</hi>); the Prerogative at the first Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and the <hi>Jure vocatae</hi> at a second.</p>
               <p>Now to make the paralel, All the inconveniences that you have observed in these Assemblies are shut out, and all the conveniences taken in, to your prerogative; for first it is that for which <hi>Athens,</hi> shaking off the blame of <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> came to deserve the praise of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> a Representative; and secondly, not as I suspect in that of <hi>Athens,</hi> and is past suspition in this of <hi>Rome,</hi> by lot, but by suffrage, as was also the late House of Commons, by which means in the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, all the Tribes of <hi>Oceana</hi> are <hi>Jure Vocatae</hi>; and if a man shall except against the paucity of the standing number, it is a wheel, which in the revolution of a few years turneth every hand that is fit, or fitteth every hand that it turns, unto the publick work: Moreover, I am deceived, if upon due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, it do not fetch your Tribes with greater equality and ease unto themselves, and unto the Government, from the frontiers of <hi>Marpesia</hi>; than <hi>Rome</hi> ever brought any one of hers out of her <hi>Pomaeria,</hi> or the nearest parts of her adjoyning Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. To this you may adde, That whereas a Common-wealth, which in regard of the People is not of facility in execution, were sure enough in this Nation to be cast off through impatience; Your Musters and Gallaxy's are given unto the people, as milk unto babes, whereby when they are brought up through four dayes election in an whole year, (one at the Parish, one at the Hundred, and two at the Tribe) unto their strongest meat, it is of no harder digestion, then to give
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56348:95"/>
their Negative or Affirmative as they see cause. There be gallant men among us that laugh at such an appeal or umpire; but I refer it, whether you be more inclining to pardon them or me, who I confesse have been this day laughing at a sober man, but without meaning him any harm, and that is <hi>Petrus Cunaeus,</hi> where speaking of the nature of the people, he saith, that <hi>taking them apart, they are very simple, but yet in their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies they see and know something,</hi> and so runs away without troubling himself with what that something is. Whereas the people taken apart, are but so many private interests, but if you take them together, they are the publick interest; the publick interest of a Common-wealth (as hath been shewn) is nearest that of mankind, and that of mankind is right reason; but with the <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> whose reason or interest when they are all together, as appear'd by the <hi>Patricians,</hi> is but that of a party, it is quite contrary; for, as taken apart they are far wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then the people, considered in that manner; so being put together, they are such fooles, that by deposing the people, as did those of <hi>Rome,</hi> they will saw off the branch whereupon they sit, or rather destroy the root of their own greatnesse: Wherefore <hi>Machiavill</hi> following <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and yet going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, may well assert (<hi>Che la multitudine Ã¨ piu savia et piu costunte che vn Prencipe</hi>) the Prerogative of Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for wisdome. And hence it is, that the Prerogative of your Common-wealth, as for Wisdom, so for Power, is in the People: which (albeit I am not ignorant, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Prerogative was so called a <hi>Praerogando,</hi> because their Suffrage was first asked) gives the denomination unto your Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tribe.</p>

                     <p>The Proceeding of the Prerogative in case of a Proposition, is to be thus Ordered: The Magistrates proposing by Authority of the Senate, shall rehearse the whole Matter, and expound it unto the People, which done, they shall put the whole together unto the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with three Boxes, the Negative, the Affirmative, and the Non-sincere: and the Suffrage being returned unto the Tribunes, and numbred in the presence of the Proposers, if the Major Uote be in the Non-sincere, the Proposers shall desist, and the Senate shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Debate. If the Major Uote be in the Negative, the Proposers shall desist, and the Senate too. But if the Major Uote be in the Affirmative, then the Tribe is clear, and the Proposers shall begin and put the whole matter, with the Negative and the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, (leaving out the Non-sincere) by Clauses; and the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being taken and numbred by the Tribunes in the presence of the proposers, shall be written and reported by the Tribunes unto the Senate, and that which is proposed by the authority of the Senate, and confirmed by the Command of the People, is the Law of <hi>Oceana.</hi>

                     <p>The Proceeding of the Prerogative in a case of Iudicature is to be thus ordered. The Tribunes being Auditors of all Causes appertaining unto the Cognizance of the people, shall have notice of the Sute or Tryall, whether of appeale or otherwise, that is to be Commenced, and if any one of them shall accept of the same, it appertaineth unto him to introduce it. A Cause being introduced, and the people Mustered or Assembled for the Decision of the same, the Tribunes are Presidents of the Court, having power to keep it: unto Orders, and shall be seated upon a Scaffold erected in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Tribe: upon the right hand shall stand a seat, or large Pulpit assigned unto the Plaintiffe, or the Accuser; and, upon the left, another for the Defendant, each if they splease with his Counsel. And the Tribunes being attended upon such occations with so many Ballotines, Secretaryes, Door-keekers, and Messengers of the Senate as shall be requisite; One of them shall turn up a Glasse of the nature of an hour-glasse, but such an one as is to be of an houre and a halfe's running; which being turned up, the party, or Counsell on the right hand may begin to speak to the People; if there be Papers to be read, or witnesses to be examined, the Officer shall lay the Glasse side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes untill the Papers be read, and the Witnesses examined, and then turn it up again; and so long as the Glasse is running the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the right hand hath liberty to speak, and no longer. The

Party on the right hand having had his time, the like shall be done in every respect, for the Party on the left. And the Cause being thus heard, the Tribunes shall put the question unto rhe Tribe with a white, a black, and a red Box (or non-sincere), Whether Guilty, or not Guilty? And if, the Suffrage being taken, the Major Uote be in the Non-sincere, the Cause shall be re-heard upon the next juridicall day following; and put unto the question in the same manner. If the Major Uote come the second time in the Non-sincere, the Cause shall be heard again upon the third day: but at the third hearing the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be put without the Non-sincere. Upon the first of the three dayes in which the Major Uote comes in the white box, the party accused is absolv'd; and upon the first of them in which it comes in the black box, the party accused is condemned. The Party accused being condemned, the Tribunes shall put with the white and the black Box, these questions, or such of them, as, regard had unto the Case, they shall conceive most proper.</p>

                              <p>Neverthelesse, there lay no Appeal from the <hi>Roman Dictator</hi> unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which if there had, might have cost the Common-wealth dear, when <hi>Sp.

                              <p>This Discourse <hi>(de Judiciis)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we are fallen, bringeth us rather naturally then of design from the two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Orders of every Common-wealth;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56348:101"/>
that is to say, from the Debating part, or the <hi>Senate;</hi> and the Resolving part, or the <hi>People;</hi> to the third, which is the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive part, or the <hi>Magistracy;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I shall have no need to dwell: For, the Executive Magistrates of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth are the <hi>Strategus</hi> in Arms, the Signory in their several Courts; (as the Chancery, the Exchequer) as also the Councils in divers Cases within their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, the <hi>Censors</hi> as well in their proper Magistracy, as in the <hi>Council</hi> of Religion: the <hi>Tribunes</hi> in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prerogative, and that Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory: And the <hi>Judges</hi> with their Courts; Of all which so much is already said or known as may suffice.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Tuesday</hi>-Lectures or Orations unto the People, will be of great benefit unto the <hi>Senate,</hi> the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and the whole Nation. Unto the <hi>Senate,</hi> because they will not only teach your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators Elocution, but keep the Systeme of the Government in their memories. Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is of great use unto your Senators; for if they do not understand Rhetorick, (giving it at this time for granted, that the Art were not otherwise good) and come to treat with, or vindicate the cause of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> against some
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56348:101"/>
other Nation, that is good at it; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will be subject to remain upon the merit of the Art, and not upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Cause. Furthermore, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius or Soul of this Government, being in the whole and in every part; they will never be of ability in determination upon any particular, unlesse at the same time they have an <hi>Idea</hi> of the whole. That this therefore must be, in that regard, of equal benefit unto the Prerogative, is plain; though these have a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it. For this Common-wealth is the Estate of the People: and a man (you know) though he be virtuous, yet if he do not understand his Estate, may run out or be cheated of it. Last of all, the treasures of the Politicks will by this means be so opened, rifled, and dispersed, that this Nation will as soon dote, like the <hi>Indians,</hi> upon glasse Beads, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb your <hi>Government</hi> with whimsies, and freaks of mother-wit; or suffer themselves to be stutter'd out of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. There is not any reason why your Grandees, your wise men of this Age, that laugh out, and openly, at a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as the most ridiculous thing, do not appear to be, as in this regard they are, meer Ideots; but that the People have not Eyes.</p>

Popular Elections are of that kind, that all the rest of the world is not able either in number or glory to equal those of these three Common-wealths. These indeed were the ablest Cudgel and Foot-ball players; bright Armes were their Cudgels, and the World was the Ball that lay at their Feet. Wherefore we are not so to understand the Maxime of <hi>Legislators,</hi> which holdeth all men to be wicked, as if it related to mankind or a Common-wealth, the interests where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are the only streight lines that they have whereby to reform the crooked, but as it relates unto every man or party under what colour soever he or they pretend to be trusted apart, with or by the whole. Hence then it is derived, which is made good in all experience, that the <hi>Aristocracy</hi> is ravenous, and not the <hi>People</hi>: Your high-way-men are not such as have Trades, or have been brought up unto industry; but such whose education hath pretended unto that of Gentlemen. My Lord is so honest, he doth not know the Maxims that are of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity unto the arts of wickednesse; for it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if there be not more purses then Thieves, that the thieves themselves must be forced to turn honest, because they cannot thrive of their Trade: but now if the people should turn thieves, who sees not that there would be more theeves then purses; wherefore that an whole People should turn robbers or Levellers is as impossible in the end as in the means. But that I do not think your Artist mention'd, Astronomer or Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician which he be, can tell me how many barly corns would reach unto the Sun, I could be content he were called unto the account, with which I shall conclude this Point: when by the way I have chidden my Lords the Legislators, who as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56348:107"/>
if they doubted my tackling would not hold, leave me to flag in a perpetual calm; but for my Lord <hi>Epimonus,</hi> who breathes now and then into my sayles and stirs the waters. A Ship maketh not her way so briskly, as when she is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely brushed by the waves, and tumbles over those that seem to tumble against her; in which case I have perceived in the dark, that light hath been stricken even out of the Sea, as in this place, where my Lord <hi>Epimonus</hi> faining to give us a demonstration of one thing, hath given it of another, and of a better. For the people of this Nation, if they amount in each Tribe unto two thousand Elders, and two thousand Youth upon the annual Roll, holding a fifth unto the whole Tribe; then the whole of a Tribe (not accounting women and children) must amount unto twenty thousand; and so the whole of all the Tribes, being fifty, unto one million. Now you have ten thousand Parishes, and reckoning these one with another, each at one thousand pounds a year dry rent; the Rent or Revenue of the Nation as it is or might be let to farm, amounteth unto ten millions; and ten millions in revenue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided equally unto one million of men, comes but to ten pounds a year unto each whereupon to maintain himself, his Wife and Children. But he that hath a Cow upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ernes his shilling by the day at his labour, hath twice as much already as this would come unto for his share; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the Land were thus divided, there would be no body to set him on work: my Lord <hi>Epimonus</hi>'s Footman, who costs him thrice as much as one of these could thus get, would lose by this bargain. What should we speak of those innumerable Trades whereupon men live not only better then others upon good shares of Lands, but become also purchasers of greater Estates? Is not this the demonstration which my Lord meant, that the Revenue of Industry in a Nation, at the least in this, is three or four-fold greater then that of the meer rent? If the people then obstruct Industry, they obstruct their own live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood; but if they make a War, they obstruct Industry.

Take the bread out of the peoples mouthes, as did the <hi>Roman Patricians,</hi> and you are sure enough of a War, in which case they may be Levellers; but our <hi>Agrarian</hi> causeth their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to flow with milk and honey. It may be answer'd,
<q>(O fortunati nimiÃ¹m, bona si sua nÃ´rint Agricolae)</q>
That this is true, if the people were given to understand their own happinesse; but where do they that? Let me answer with the like question, Where do they not? They do not know their happinesse it should seem in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>: teach them what it is, and try whose sense is the truer. But as to the late Wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> it hath been affirmed unto me there, that the Princes could never make the people to take Arms while they had bread, and have therefore suffer'd Countreys now and then to be wasted, that they might get Souldiers: This you will find to be the certain pulse and temper of the people; and if they have been already proved to be the most wise and constant order of a Government; why should we think, when no man can produce one example of the common Souldiery in an Army, mutinying because they had not Captains pay; that the Prerogative should jole the heads of the Senate together, in regard that these have the better Salaries, while it must be as obnoxious unto the People in a Nation, as to the Souldiery in an Army, that it is no more possible, their emoluments of this kind should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by any Common-wealth in the world to be made equal with those of the <hi>Senate,</hi> then that the Common Souldiers should be equall with the Captains: it is enough to the common Souldier that his virtue may bring him to be a Captain, and more unto the Prerogative, that each of them is nearer to be a <hi>Senator.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If my Lord think our Salaries too great, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is not Houswife enough; whether is it better huswifery that she should keep her family from the snow, or
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56348:108"/>
suffer them to burn her house that they may warm themselves<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for one of these wil be; do you think that she came off at a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rate, when men had their rewards by a thousand, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds a year in Land of Inheritance? If you say, that they will be more godly then they have been, it may be ill taken; and if you cannot promise that, it is time we find out some way of stinting at least, if not curing them of that same <hi>Sacra Fames.</hi> On the other side, if a poor man (as such an one may save a City) give his sweat unto the publick, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can you suffer his Family in the mean time to sterve. But he that layes his hand unto this plough, shall not lose by taking it off from his own<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and a Common-wealth that will mend this, shall be penny-wise. The <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Supream, and a constant Court of Judicature could not choose but be exceeding gainful. The <hi>Senate</hi> of the Bean in <hi>Athens,</hi> because it was but annual, was moderately sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riated, but that of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> being for life bountifully; which advantages the Senators of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> had, where there was little mony or use of it, was in honour for life. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians</hi> having no profit took all; <hi>Venice</hi> being a situation, where a man goes but to the door for his imployment, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is great, and the reward very little: but in <hi>Holland</hi> a Counsellour of State hath fifteen hundred Flemish pounds a year, besides other accommodations. The States General have more. And that Common-wealth looketh nearer her penny, then ours need to do.</p>
                              <p>For the Revenue of this Nation, besides that of her indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, amounts, as hath been shewn, unto ten millions, and the Salaries in the whole, come not unto three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds a pear; the beauty they will adde unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will be exceeding great, and the people delight in the beauty of their Common-wealth, the encouragement they will give unto the study of the publick very profitable, the accommodation they will afford unto your Magistrates, very honourable and easie. And the sum, when it or twice as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56348:108"/>
much was spent in hunting and house-keeping, was never any grievance unto the people. I am ashamed, to stand huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon this point; it is sordid. Your Magistrates are rather to be provided with farther accommodations. For what if there should be sicknesse? whither will you have them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move? and this City in the soundest times, for the heat of the year, is no wholsome aboad: have a care of their healths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom you commit your own. I would have the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> except they see cause to the contrary; every first of <hi>June,</hi> to remove into the Country ayr, for the space of three moneths: you are better fitted with Summer houses for them, then if you had built them to that purpose; there is some twelve miles distant the <hi>Convallium</hi> upon the River <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionia,</hi> for the Tribunes and the Prerogative, a Pallace capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a thousand men; and at twenty miles distant you have <hi>Mount Celia,</hi> reverend as well for the antiquity as state of a Castle, compleatly capable of the Senate, the Proposers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lodgings in the <hi>Convallium,</hi> and the Tribunes in <hi>Celia</hi>; it holds the correspondence between the Senate and the People exactly. And it is a small matter for the Proposers, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Coaches and Officers of State, besides other conveniences of their own, to go a matter of five or ten miles (those Seats are not much farther distant) to meet the people upon any Heath or Field that shall be pointed: where having dispatched their businesse, they may hunt their own Venizon, (for I would have the great walled Park upon the <hi>Halcionia</hi> to belong to the Signory, and those about the <hi>Convallium</hi> unto the Tribunes) and so go to supper. Pray my Lords, see that they do not pull down these houses to sell the lead of them; for when you have consider'd on it, they cannot be spared. The founders of the School in <hi>Hiera,</hi> provided that the boyes should have a Summer seat. You should have as much care of these Magistrates. But there is such a selling, such a Jewish humour in our Republicans, that I cannot tell what to say to it; onely this, any man that knowes what belongs to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

or how diligent every Nation in that case hath been, to preserve her ornaments, and shall see waste lately made, the Woods adjoyning unto this City which served for the delight and health of it, cut down to be sold for three pence; will tell you, that they who did such things would never have made a Common-wealth: The like may be said of the ruine or damage done upon our Cathedrals, ornaments in which this Nation excels all others: nor shall this ever be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused upon the score of Religion; for though true it be, that God dwelleth not in houses made with hands, yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold your Assemblies but in such houses, and these are of the best that have been made with hands. Nor is it well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that they are pompous, and therefore prophane, or lesse proper for Divine service, seeing that the Christians in the Primitive Church chose to meet with one accord in the Temple; so far were they from any inclination to pull it down.</p>

               <p>To begin with the Youth, or the military Orbes, they are Circles unto which the Common-wealth must have a Care to keep close; A man is a Spirit raised up by the Magick of Nature; if she doe not stand safe, and so that she may set him to some good and usefull work, he spets fire, and blowes up Castles; for where there is life, there must be motion or work and the work of idlenesse is mischiefe, (<hi>Non omnibus dormit</hi>) But the work of industry is health. To set men unto this, the Common-wealth must begin early with them, or it will be too late: and the meanes whereby she sets them unto it, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation; the Plastick art of government. But it is as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as sad in experience, whether through negligence, or which in the consequence is all one, or worse, overfondnesse in domestick performance of this Duty, that innumerable Children come to owe their utter Perdition unto their own Parents; in each of which, the Commonwealth loseth a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen; Wherefore the Lawes of a Government how wholesome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in themselves, being such as if men by a congruity in their Education be not brought up to find a relish in them,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56348:111"/>
they will spit at: The education of a mans Children is not wholly to be committed or trusted unto himself. You find in Livy the Children of <hi>Brutus,</hi> having been bred under Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, make faces at the Common-wealth of Rome, <hi>A King</hi> (say they) <hi>is a Man, you may prevaile with him when you have need there should be Law, or when you have need there should be no Law. He hath favours in the right, and he frowns not in the wrong place; he knowes his friends from his Enemies.

                                 <hi>Lacedemon</hi> (to speak truth) though she could write and read, was not very bookish.

For <hi>Rome,</hi> she (had <hi>ingenium par impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>) was as Learned as Great, and held her Colledge of <hi>Argurs</hi> in much reverence. <hi>Venice</hi> hath taken her Religion upon trust: <hi>Holland,</hi> cannot tend it to be very studious: Nor doth <hi>Switz</hi> mind it much; yet are they all addicted unto their Universities. We cut down Trees to build Houses, but I would have some body shew me, by what reason or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the cutting down of an University, should tend unto the setting up of a Common-wealth. Of this I am sure; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a Common-wealth is not to be attained unto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of ancient Prudence; nor the knowledge of ancient prudence without Learning; nor Learning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Schools of good Literature; and these are such as we call Universities. Now though meer University-Learning of it self, be that which (to speak the words of <hi>Verulamius) Crafty men contemn, and simple men onely admire, yet is it such as wise men have use of; for Studies do not teach their own use, but that is a wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without, and above them, won by observation. Expert men may execute, and perhaps judge of particulars one by one; but the general Counsels and the plots, and the marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.</hi> Wherefore if you would have your children to be Statesmen, let them drink by all means of these Fountains, where perhaps there was never any. But what though the water a man drinks be not nourishment? it is the <hi>vehiculum</hi> without which he cannot be nourished. Nor is Religion lesse concerned in this point than Government; For

                              <p>The Holy Scriptures are written in Hebrew and in Greek, they that have neither of these Languages may think leight of both; But find me a man that hath one in perfection, the study of whose whole Life it hath not been. Again, this is apparent to us in daily Conversation, that if four or five Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have lived together be talking, another speaking the same Language may come in, and yet understand very little of their Discourse: in that it relateth unto Circumstances, Persons, Things, Times and Places which he knoweth not. It is no otherwise with a Man, having no insight of the times in which they were written, and the Circumstances unto which they relate, in the reading of ancient Books, whether they be Divine or humane. For example, when we fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the discourse about Baptisme and Regeneration, that was between our <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> reproacheth him of his Ignorance in this manner: <hi>Art thou a Doctor in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and understandest not these things?</hi> What shall we think of it? or, Wherefore should a Doctor in Israel have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood these things more then another, but that both <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> (as was shewed at large by my Lord <hi>Phospho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) were Doctrines held in <hi>Israel?</hi> Instance in one place of a hundred, which he that hath not mastered the circumstances unto which they relate, cannot understand. Wherefore to the understanding of the Scripture, it is necessary to have ancient Languages, and the knowledge of ancient times, or the ayd of them who have such knowledg: and to have such as may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies able and ready to give such ayd, (unlesse you would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it of another Nation, which would not only be base, but deceitful) it is necessary unto a Common-wealth that She have Schools of good Literature, or Universities of her own. We are Commanded (as hath been said more then once) to search the Scriptures; And whether do they search the Scriptures that take this pains in ancient Languages and Learning? or they that will not, but trusting unto Translations onely, and to words as they sound unto present Circumstances? than which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56348:117"/>
nothing is more fallible, Or certain to lose the true sense of Scriptures, pretend to be above humane understanding, for no other cause then that they are below it? But in searching the Scriptures by the proper use of our Universities, we have been heretofore blessed with greater Victories and Trophies against the purple Hosts, and golden Standards of the Romish Hierarchy, than any Nation; and therefore, why we should relinquish this upon the presumption of some, that because there is a greater Light they have it, I do not know. There is a greater Light then the Sun, but it doth not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Sun, nor doth any Light of GOD's giving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish that of Nature, but encrease and Sanctifie it. Wherefore, neither the honour borne by the <hi>Israelitish,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor any other Commonwealth that I have shewn, unto their Eclesiasticks consisted in being governed by them, but in consulting them in matter of Religion; upon whose <hi>respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> or Oracles, they did afterwards as they thought fit. Nor would I be mistaken, as if by affrming the Universities, to be in order both unto Religion and Government, of absolute necessity, I declared them or the Ministry in any wise fit to be trusted so far as to exercise any power not derived from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magistrate, in the administration of either. If the Jewish Religion were directed and established by <hi>Moses,</hi> it was directed and established by the civill Magistrate; or if <hi>Moses</hi> exercised this administration as a Prophet, the same Prophet did invest with the same administration, the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and not the Priests; and so doth our Commonwealth, the Senate and not the Clergy. They who had the supreme Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Government of the Nationall Religion in <hi>Athens,</hi> were the first <hi>Archon,</hi> the (<hi>Rex Sacrificus,</hi> or) High Priest, and Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march; which Magistrates were ordained or elected, (<hi>per</hi>

The Religion of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was governed by the Kings, who were also high Priests, and officiated at the sacrifice, these had power to substitute
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56348:118"/>
their <hi>Pythii,</hi> Embassadors or Nuncios by which not without concurrence of the Senate they held intelligence with the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos.</hi> And the Ecclesiasticall part of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was governed by the <hi>Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> the <hi>Rex Sacrificulus,</hi> and the <hi>Elaminus,</hi> all ordained or elected by the people, the <hi>Pontifex, Tributis</hi>; the King, <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis</hi>; and the <hi>Flamines</hi> or Parish Preists, <hi>Curiatis Comitiis.</hi> I do not mind you of these things, as if for the matter there were any parallel to be drawn out of their superstitions to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but to shew that for the manner, ancient prudence is as well a rule in divine as humane things; nay, and such an one as the Apostles themselves, ordaining Elders by the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of hands in every Congregation, have exactly follow'd; for some of the Congregations where they thus ordeined Elders were those of <hi>Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe,</hi> the Country of <hi>Lycaonia, Pisidia, Pamphylia, Perga,</hi> with <hi>Attalia.</hi> Now that these Cittys and Countrys when the <hi>Romans</hi> propagated their Empire into <hi>Asia,</hi> were found most of them Commonwealths, and that many of the rest were indued with like power, so that the people living under the protection of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, continued to the elect their own Magistrates, is so known a thing; that I wonder whence it is, men quite contrary unto the universall proof of these examples, will have Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Government to be necessarily distinct from civill power; when the right of the Elders ordained by the holding up of hands in every Congregation, to teach the people, was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derived from the same civill power by which they ordained the rest of their Magistrates. And it is no otherwise in our Commonwealth; where the Parochiall Congregation electeth or ordaineth her Pastor. To object the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> in this place were to shew us that it hath been no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but where the civill power, hath lost the liberty of her Conscience by embracing of Popery: as also that to take away the liberty of conscience in this administration from the civill power, were a proceeding which hath no other president, than
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56348:118"/>
such as is Popish. Wherefore your Religion is thus settled; the Universities are the seminaries of that part which is nationall, by which meanes others withall safely may be permitted to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the liberty of their consciences, in reguard that however they behave themselves, the ignorance of the unlearned in this case cannot lose the religion, nor disturb the Government; which otherwise it would most certainely do, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities with their Emoluments, as also the Benefices of the whole Nation are to be improoved by such Augmentations, as may make a very decent and comfortable subsistance for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, which is neither to be allow'd Synods nor Assemblies, (but upon the occasion shewn in the Universities, they are consulted by the Councill for Religion, suffred to meddle with affaires of State) nor to be capable of any other publick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment whatsoever; by which means the interest of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned can never come to corrupt your Religion, nor disturb your Government; which otherwise it would most certainly do. <hi>Venice,</hi> though she do not see, or cannot help the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of her Religion, is yet so circumspect to avoid distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in this kind of her Government, that her Council pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not unto election of Magistrates, till it be proclaimed, <hi>Fora Papalini,</hi> by which words such as have consanguinity with red hats, or relation unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> are warned to withdraw. If a Minister in <hi>Holland</hi> meddle with matter of State, the Magistrate sendeth him <hi>a pair of shooes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon if he do not go, he is driven away from his charge. I wonder why Ministers of all men should be perpetually tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with Government, first because they as well as others have it in expresse charge to submit themselves unto the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of men; and secondly, because these Ordinances of men must go upon such Politicall Principles; as they of all others (by any thing that can be found in their writings or actions) least understand: whence you have the suffrage of all Nations unto this sense: An ounce of wisdom is worth a pound of Clergy: Your greatest Clerks are not your wisest men: and when some foul absurdity in State is committed, it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56348:119"/>
is common with the <hi>French,</hi> and even the <hi>Italians,</hi> to call it <hi>Pas de Clerc,</hi> or, <hi>Governo du Prete.</hi> They may bear with men that will be preaching without study, while they will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning without Prudence. My <hi>Lords,</hi> if you know not how to rule the Clergy, you will most certainly be like a man that cannot rule his Wife; have neither quiet at home, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour abroad. Their honest Vocation is to teach your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at the Schools and the Universities, and the people in the Parishes; and Yours is concern'd to see that they do not play the shrewes: of which parts consists the Education of your Common-wealth, so far forth as it regards Religion.</p>
                              <p>To <hi>Justice,</hi> or that part of it which is commonly executive, answers the <hi>Education</hi> of the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> or <hi>Chancery.</hi> Upon which (to Philosophize) requires a peculiar kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have not. But they who take upon them any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession proper unto the Educations mentioned, that is, <hi>Theology, Physick, Law,</hi> are not at leisure for the Essayes: Wherefore the Essays being Degrees, whereby the Youth Commence for all Magistracies, Offices and Honours in the Parish, Hundred, Tribe, Senate, or Prerogative; <hi>Divines, Physicians,</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> not taking these Degrees, exclude themselves from all such Magistracies, Offices, and Honours. And whereas <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> are likest to exact farther reason for this: They growing up from the most gainful Art at the Barr, unto those Magistracies upon the Bench, which are continually appropriated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and not onely endowed with the greatest Revenues, but held for life; have the least reason of all the rest to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto any other; Especially in an equal Commonwealth, where Accumulation of Magistracy, or to take a Person en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by his Profit unto the Lawes as they stand, into the Power which is Legislative, and should keep them unto what they were, or ought to be, were a <hi>Soloecisme</hi> in Prudence. It is true, that the Legislative power may have need of Advice and Assistance from the executive Magistracy, or such as are learned in the Law; for which Cause the <hi>Judges</hi> are, (as they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56348:119"/>
have heretofore been) Assistants in the Senate. Nor, however it came about, can I see any reason why a Judge, being but an Assistant, a Lawyer, should be a member of a Legislative Council.</p>
                              <p>I deny not, that the <hi>Roman Patricians</hi> were all Patrons, and that the whole People were Clients, some unto one family, and some unto another, by which means they had their Causes pleaded and defended in some appearance <hi>gratis</hi>; for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron took no money; though if he had a daughter to marry, his Clients were to pay her portion: nor was this so much. But if the Client accused his Patron, gave testimony or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage against him, it was a crime of such nature, that any man might lawfully kill him as a Traytor: and this, as being the nerve of the <hi>Optimacy,</hi> was a great cause of ruine unto that Common-wealth: for when the people would carry any thing that pleased not the <hi>Senate,</hi> the Senators were ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if they could not intercede, that is, oppose it by their Clients; with whom, to vote otherwise then they pleased, was so high a Crime. The observation of this bond till the time of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> (that is to say, till it was too late, or to no purpose, to break it) was the cause, why in all the former heats and disputes that had happened between the Senate and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it never came to blowes; which was good: but withall, the people could have no remedy, which was Evil: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of opinion, that a Senator ought not to be a Patron or Advocate; nor a Patron or Advocate to be a Senator; for if his practice be <hi>gratis,</hi> it debaucheth the people; and if it be mercenary, it debaucheth himself: take it which way you will, when he should be making of Lawes, he will be knitting of Nets.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56348:120"/>
(though it be not regarded in our times, when things being left to take their chance, it fares with us accordingly) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; No man can be a Polititian, except he be first an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian or a Traveller; for except he can see what Must be, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, the Embassies in ordinary by our constitution, are the Prizes of young men, more especially such as have been Travellers. Wherefore they of these inclinations, having leave of the <hi>Censors,</hi> owe them accompt of their time, and cannot choose but lay it out with some ambition of Praise, or Reward, where both are open: whence you will have eyes abroad, and better choice of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Ministers: your Gallants shewing themselves not more unto the Ladies at their balls, than unto your Commonwealth at her Academy, when they return from their Travels.</p>
                              <p>But this Common-wealth being constituted more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of two Elements, <hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> driveth by a natural instinct, at <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Wisdome,</hi> which he who hath attained, is arriv'd at the perfection of humane nature. It is true, that these Virtues must have some naturall root in him that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them; but this amounteth not unto so great a matter as some will have it. For if Poverty make an industrious; a moderate Estate, a temperate; and a Lavish fortune, a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Man; and this be the common course of things; Wisdom is rather of necessity, than <hi>Inclination.</hi> And that an Army which was meditating upon Flight, hath been brought by Despair to win the Field, is so far from being strange, that like Causes will evermore produce like Effects. Wherefore this Common-wealth driveth her Citizens like Wedges, there is no way with them but through; nor end, but that Glory whereof Man, is capable by Art or Nature.

I will not say, but that some Man or Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equall improvement of this kind may be lighter then some other; but certainly, Education is the scale without which no Man or Nation can truly know his or her own weight or value. By our Histories we can tell when one <hi>Marpesian</hi> would have beaten ten <hi>Oceaners</hi>; and when one <hi>Oceaner</hi> would have beaten ten <hi>Marpesians. Marc Anthony</hi> was a <hi>Roman,</hi> but how did that appear in the embraces of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>? You must have some other Education for your Youth; or they, like that passage, will shew better in Romance, then true Story.</p>
                              <p>The Custom of the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> in distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her Magistracies without respect of age, happened to do well in <hi>Corvinus</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi>; for which cause <hi>Machiavill</hi> (with whom that which was done by <hi>Rome,</hi> and that which is well done, is for the most part all one) commendeth this course. Yet how much it did work at other times, is obvious in <hi>Pompey</hi> &amp; <hi>Caesar</hi>; examples by which <hi>Bocalini</hi> illustrateth the Prudence of <hi>Venice</hi> in her contrary practice, affirming it to have been no small step unto the ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, that these having tasted in their Youth of the Supream Honours; had no greater in their age to hope for, but by perpetuating of the same in themselves, which came to Blood, and ended in Tyranny. The opinion of <hi>Verulamius</hi> is safe, <hi>The Errours</hi> (saith he) <hi>of Young Men are the ruine of Businesse; whereas the errours of aged men amount but to this, that more might have been
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56348:121"/>
done or sooner.</hi> But though their Wisdome be little, their Courage is great. Wherefore (to come unto the main Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this <hi>Common-wealth</hi>) the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Youth.</p>
                              <p>The distribution of this Province by the Essays is so fully described in the Order, that I need repeat nothing. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it self being but a Repetition or Copy of that Originall, which in ancient Prudence is, of all other, the fairest; as that from whence the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> more especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the Empire of the World; And there is much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this age, when Governments are universally broken, or swerved from their Foundations, and the People groan under Tyranny, that the same causes (which could not be withstood when the World was full of Popular Governments) should have the like effect.</p>
                              <p>The Causes in the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World was not any miraculous, but a naturall (nay I may safely say necessary) consequence are contained in that part of her discipline which was domestick, and in that which shee exercised in her provinces or conquest. Of the latter I shall have better occasion to speak when we come unto our Provinciall Orbes; the former divided the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Tribes, amounting, as <hi>Livy</hi> shewes, at their full growth unto thirty five; and every Tribe by the Cense or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of Estates into five Classes, for the sixth being <hi>Proletary</hi> that is, the Nursery, or such as through their Poverty contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted nothing to the Commonwealth but Children, was not reckoned nor used in Armes: And this is the first point of the Militia; in which Moderne Prudence is quite contrary unto the Ancient; for where as we excusing the rich, and arming the Poore, become the vassalls of our Servants, they by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing the Poor and Arming such as were rich enough to be Freemen, became Lords of the <hi>Earth.</hi> (The Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, who understand so little what it is to be Lords

The Tribunes being chosen, the Consuls appointed the day unto the Tribes, when those in them of military Age were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the <hi>Capitol</hi>; The day being come, and the Youth Assembled accordingly, the Consuls ascended their Tribunal,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56348:122"/>
and the younger Tribunes were forthwith divided into four parts after this manner: foure were assigned unto the first <hi>Legion,</hi> (a Legion at the most consisted of 6000 Foot, and 300 Horse) three unto the second, four unto the third, and three unto the fourth; the younger Tribunes being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed, two of the Elder were assigned unto the first Legion, three unto the second, two unto the third, and three unto the fourth. And the Officers of each Legion thus assigned, having drawn the Tribes by Lots, and being seated according unto their divisions at a convenient distance from each other; the Tribe of the first Lot was called: whereupon they that were of it knowing the businesse, and being prepared, presently bolted out four of their Number, in the choice whereof such care was taken, that they offered none that was not a Citizen; no Citizen that was not of the Youth; no Youth that was not of some one of the five Classes, nor any one of the five Classes that was not expert at his Exercizes. Moreover, they used such diligence in matching them for age and stature, that the Officers of the Legions, except they happened to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Youths so bolted, were forced to put themselves upon fortune, while they of the first Legion chose one; they of the second, the next; they of the third, another; and the fourth Youth fell to the last Legion, and thus was the election (the Legions and the Tribs varying according unto their Lots) carryed on till the Foot were compleat.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56348:123"/>
proof, and beauty, as (notwithstanding the <hi>Argyraspides,</hi> or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shields of <hi>Alexanders</hi> guard) were never worn by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; such as will present marks of Virtue and direction unto your General or <hi>Strategus</hi> in the distribution of his Army, which doubles the value of them, unto the Proprietors, who are bound to wear them, and easeth the Common-wealth of so much Charge, so many being Armed already. But here will be the Objection, now. How shall such a Revenue be compassed? Fifty pounds a year in every Hundred is a great deal, not so easily raised: men will not part with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; nor would the sum as it is proposed by the Order of <hi>Pompe,</hi> rise in many years. These are difficulties that fit our Genius exactly: And yet a Thousand pounds in each Hundred once levied, establisheth the Revenue for ever. Now the Hundreds one with another are worth ten thousand pounds a year dry rent, over and above Personal Estates, which bring it unto twice the value. So a twentieth part of one years Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Hundred, does it. If you cannot afford this while you pay Taxes, though from henceforth they will be but small ones, do it when you pay none: If it be then too much for one year, do it in two: If it be too much for two years, do it in four. What Husbands have we hitherto been? What is become of greater Summes? My Lords, if you should thus cast your bread upon the waters, after many daies you would find it: stand not huckling, when you are offer'd Corn and your money again in the mouth of the Sack.</p>
                              <p>But to proceed: The first Essay being Officer'd at the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and mustred (<hi>Tributis</hi>) at the Tribes, where they are entertain'd with other Sports, which will be very fine ones; Proceed unto the Election of the second Essay, or standing Army of this Nation consisting of thirty thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse; and these (upon a War decreed) being delivered at the Rendezvouz of <hi>Oceana</hi> unto the <hi>Strategus,</hi> are the third Essay, which answereth unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions. But you may observe, that whereas the Consuls elected the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56348:123"/>
                                 <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> and raised Commanded men out of the Veteranes at their own discretion: Our <hi>Polemarchs</hi> or Field-Officers are elected by the Scruteny of the Council of Warre; and our Veteranes not otherwise taken on, than as Voluntiers, and with the consent of the <hi>Polemarchs,</hi> which may serve for the removall of certain Scruples which might otherwise be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in this place, though without encouragement by the <hi>Roman</hi> way of proceeding, much lesse that which is proposed. But whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in all amounted not in one Army to above 30000 Men, or little more, you have here Fourty thousand; and whereas they added <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi> in this regard it is that <hi>Marpesia</hi> will be of greater Revenue unto you, then if you had the <hi>Indies</hi>; for whereas heretofore She hath brought you forth nothing but her native Thistle: plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ranknesse of her <hi>Aristocracy</hi> by your <hi>Agrarian,</hi> you will find her an inexhaustible Magazine of Men, and to her own advantage, who will make a far better Accompt by the Arms, then by the Pins of <hi>Poland</hi>: Wherefore as a Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Army consisted of about an equall number of Auxiliaries added unto their Legions by their <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Associates, you may adde unto a Parliamentary Army an equall number of <hi>Marpesians,</hi> or <hi>Panopeans,</hi> as that Colony shall hereafter be able to supply you. By which means the Common-wealth will be able to go forth to Battail with Fourscore thousand Men. To make Wars with small Forces is no Husbandry, but a waste, a disease, a lingring and painful Consumption of Men and Money; the <hi>Romans</hi> making theirs thick, made them short, and had little regard unto money, as that which they who have men enow, can command where it is fittest that it should be Levied. All the ancient <hi>Monarchies</hi> by this means got on wing, and attain'd unto vast Riches. Whereas your Modern Princes being dear Purchasers of small parcels, have but empty Pockets. But it may be that some will accuse the Order, of rashnesse; in that it committeth the sole Conduct of the War unto the General; and the Custom of <hi>Venice</hi> by her <hi>Proveditori,</hi> or Checks upon her Commanders in Chief, may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56348:124"/>
seem to be of greater Prudence; but in this part of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neither <hi>Venice,</hi> nor any Nation that maketh use of mercenary Forces, is for our Instruction. A mercenary Army, with a standing <hi>Generall,</hi> is like the fatall Sister that Spins: But proper Forces, with an annuall Magistrate, are like Her that cuts the thread. Their Interests are quite contrary, and yet you have a better <hi>Proveditor</hi> then the <hi>Venetian,</hi> another <hi>Strategus</hi> sitting with an Army standing by him; whereupon that which is marching, if there were any probability it should, would find as little possibility that it could recoyl, as a Forraign Enemy to invade you. These things considered, a War will appear to be of a contrary nature unto that of all other reckonings, in as much as of this, you must never look to have a good accompt if you be strict in imposing Checks. Let a Council of <hi>Hunts-men</hi> assembled before-hand, tell you which way the Stagg shall run, where you shall cast about at the fault, and how you shall ride to be in at the Chase all the day: but these may as well do that, as a Council of War direct a General. The hours that have painted wings, and of different colours, are his Counsel: he must be like the eye that maketh not the scene, but hath it so soon as it changes. That in many Counsellors there is strength, is spoken of civill Administrations; As to those that are Military, there is nothing more certain, then that in many Counsellors there is weaknesse. Joynt Commissions in Military affairs are like hunting your Hounds in their Couples: In the <hi>Attick</hi> War, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and <hi>Demaratus,</hi> Kings of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> being thus coupled, tugg'd one against another; and while they should have joyn'd against the <hi>Persian,</hi> were the Cause of the calamity: whereupon that Common-wealth took better Counsel, and made a Law, whereby from thenceforth there went at once but one of her Kings unto Battail.</p>

                              <hi>Rome</hi> was said (<hi>Mole sua ruere</hi>) to bee broken by her own weight, but Poetically. For that weight by which she was pretended to bee ruined, was supported in her Emperors, by a farre slighter foundation. And in the Common experience of good Architecture, there is nothing more known, than that buildings, stand the firmer and the longer for their own weight; nor ever swerve through any other internal cause, than that their materials are corruptible; but the people ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dyes, nor, as a Political Body, are subject unto any other corruption than that which deriveth from their Government. Unlesse a man will deny the chain of causes in which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies God, hee must also acknowledge the chain of effects; wherefore there can bee no effect in Nature, that is not from the first Cause, and those successive lincks of the chain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it could not have been. Now except a man can shew the contrary in a Commonwealth, if there bee no cause of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the first make of it, there can never bee any such effect. Let no mans superstition, impose prophanenesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this assertion; for as Man is sinful, and yet the world is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, so may the Citizen bee sinfull, and yet the Commonwealth bee perfect. And as man seeing the World is perfect, can
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56348:128"/>
never commit any such sin as can render it imperfect, or bring it unto a natural dissolution; so the Citizen, where the common Wealth is perfect can never commit any such crime, as can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it imperfect; or bring it unto a natural dissolution. To come unto experience, <hi>Venice,</hi> notwithstanding that wee have found some flaws in it, is the only Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monwealth, in the make wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no man can find a cause of dissolution; for which reason wee behold her (albeit she consist of men that are not without sin) at this day with one thousand years upon her back, for any internal cause, as young, as fresh, and free from decay, or any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, as shee was born, but what ever in nature, is not sensible of decay by the course of a thousand years, is capable of the whole age of nature: by which calculation for any check that I am able to give my self; a Commonwealth rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may for any internal causes be as immortal, or long-lived as the World. But if this be true, those Commonwealths that are naturally fallen, must have derived their ruine from the rise of them. <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> died not naturall, but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deaths, in this manner the World is to dye; wee are speaking of those causes of dissolution which are naturall unto government; and they are but two, either <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Inequality,</hi> if a Common-wealth be a contradiction she must needs destroy her self; and if she be unequal, it tends to strife, and strife to ruine. By the former of these fell <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> by the latter <hi>Rome. Lacedemon</hi> being made altogether for war, and yet not for increase, her natural progresse, became her natural dissolution, and the building of her own victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand, too heavy for her foundation; so shee indeed fell by her own weight.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Rome</hi> through her native Inequality, which how it inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Look well unto it my Lords, for if there be a contradiction or inequality in your Commonwealth it must fall; but if it have neither of these, it hath no principle of mortality, do not think mee impudent; if this be truth, I should commit a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56348:128"/>
grosse indiscretion, in concealing it. Sure I am that <hi>Machiavil,</hi> is for the immortality of a Commonwealth upon far weaker principles.<note place="margin">Dis. B. 3. C. 22. B. 3 C. 29.</note> 
                              <hi>If a Commonwealth</hi> (saith he) <hi>were so happy as to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided often with men, that when she is swarving from her principles should reduce her unto her institution, shee would be immortall.</hi> But a Common-wealth, as we have demonstrated, swarveth not from her Principles, but by and through her institution, if she brought no byasse into the World with her, her course for any internal cause, must be streight forward, as we see is that of <hi>Venice,</hi> she cannot turn unto the right hand, nor to the left, but by some rubs, which is not an internal but an external cause, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such she can be no way fortifyed, but through her situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is <hi>Venice,</hi> or through her Militia as was <hi>Rome</hi>; by which examples a Common-wealth may be secure, or those also; Think me not vain, for I cannot hold; a Common-wealth that is rightly instituted can never swarve, nor one that is not rightly instituted be secured from swarving by reduction unto her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, wherefore it is no less apparent in this place, that <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avil</hi> understood not a Common-wealth as to the whole peice. As where having told <hi>you,</hi>

                              <hi>That a Tribune or any other Citizen of</hi> Rome, <hi>might propose a Law unto the people, and debate it with them,</hi> he adds <hi>this order was good while the people were good, but when the people became evil, it became most pernicious</hi>; as if this Order, through which with the like, the people most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently became evil, could ever have been good; or that the people, or the Commonwealth could ever have become good, by being reduced unto such principles as were the Original of their evil. The disease of <hi>Rome</hi> was, as hath been shewn, from the native inequality of her ballance, and no otherwise from the Empire of the World, which then as this falling into one scale, that of the Nobility (an evil in such a Fabrick inevitable) kickt out the People, wherefore a man that could have made her to throw away the Empire of the World, might in that have reduced her unto her principles, and yet have been so far from rendering her immortal, that going no farther hee should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have cured her. But your C. W. is founded upon an equal Agrarian; and if <hi>the earth be given unto the Sonnes of men,</hi> this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56348:129"/>
is the ballance of justice,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.14</note> such an one as in having due regard unto the different industry, of different men, yet <hi>faithfully judgeth the poor. And the King that faithfully judgeth the poor, his Throne shall be established for ever,</hi> much more the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; seeing that equality which is the necessary dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monarchy, is the generation, the very life and soul of a Commonwealth; And now, if ever, I may be excusable, seeing that the Throne of a Commonwealth may be established for ever, is consonant unto the holy Scriptures.</p>
                           <p>The ballance of a Commonwealth that is equal, is of such nature, that what ever falleth into her Empire, must fall equally, and if the whole earth fall into your scales, it must fall equally, &amp; so you may be a greater people, and yet not swerve from your principles one hair. Nay you will be so far from that, that you must bring the world in such a case, unto your ballance, even unto the ballance of Justice. But hearken, My Lords, Are we on earth? Do we see the Sun? or are we visiting those shady places which are fained by the Poets?

These Gothick Empires that are yet in the world, were at the first, though they had legs of their own, but an heavy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy burden, but their foundations being now broken, the Iron of them entereth even into the souls of the oppressed, and hear the voice of their Comforters. <hi>My father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</hi> Hearken, I say, if thy brother cry unto thee in affliction, wilt thou not hear him? This is a Commonwealth of the fabrick, that hath an open ear, and a publick concernment, she is not made for her self only, but given as a Magistrate of God unto mankinde, for the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of common Right, and the law of Nature. Wherefore saith <hi>Cicero</hi> of the like, that of the <hi>Romans (Nos magis patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum orbis terrarum suscepimus, quam Imperium)</hi> we have rather undertaken the Patronage than the Empire of the world. If you, not regarding this example, like some other Nations that are upon the point to smart for it, shall, having attained unto your own liberty, <hi>bear the sword</hi> of your common Magistracy, <hi>in vain,</hi> sit still; and fold your arms, or which is worse, let out the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56348:129"/>
blood of your people unto Tyrants to be shed in the defence of their yoaks, like water, and so not only <hi>turn the grace of God into wantonness,</hi> but his <hi>justice into wormwood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>You are not now making a Commonwealth, <hi>but heaping coals of fire upon your own heads.</hi> A Commonwealth, I say, of this make is a Minister of God upon earth, to the end that the world may be <hi>governed with righteousness.</hi> For which cause (that I may come at length unto our present business) the orders last rehearsed are buds of Empire, such as with the blessing of God, may spread the arms of your Commonwealth, like an holy <hi>Asylum</hi> unto the distressed world, and give the earth her Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of years, or rest from her labours under the shadow of your wings. It is upon this point where the writings of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavil</hi> having for the rest excelled all other Authors, come as far to excel themselves.</p>
                           <p>(<hi>Commonwealths,</hi> saith he, <hi>have had three wayes of propagating themselves,</hi> One after the manner of Monarchies,<note place="margin">Disc. B. 2. C. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>by imposing the yoak, which was the way of</hi> Athens, <hi>and towards the latter times of</hi> Lacedemon; <hi>Another by equal leagues, which is the way of</hi> Switz (I shall adde of <hi>Holland</hi> though since his time) <hi>A third by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal leagues, which to the shame of the world, was never practised</hi>; nay nor so much as seen, or minded <hi>by any other Commonwealth, but that only of</hi> Rome. They will each of them either for caution, or imitation, be worthy to be well weighed, which is the proper work of this place. <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> have been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of great scandal to the world, in two, or at least one of two regards. The first their emulation, which involved <hi>Greece</hi> in perpetual wars, the second their way of propagation, which by imposing yoaks upon others, was plainly contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own principles.</p>
                           <p>For the first, Governments bee they of what kinde soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if they bee planted too close, are like trees, that impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in their growth to have it hindred, eat out one another. It was not unknown unto these, in contemplation, or (if you read the story of <hi>Agesilaus</hi>) in action, that either of them with thirty thousand men might have mastered the East,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56348:130"/>
and certainly, if the one had not stood in the others light, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had come too late to that end, which was the means (and would be if they were to live again) of ruine, at the least unto one of them: wherefore with any man that understandeth the nature of Government, this is excusable; so it was between <hi>Oceana</hi> and <hi>Marpesia</hi>; so it is between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> (though lesse excusable) and so it ever will bee in like cases. But to come unto the second occasion of scandal by them gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which was in the way of their propagation, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable: for they brought their confederates under bondage; by which means <hi>Athens</hi> gave occasion of the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> warre, the wound of which shee dy'd stinking, when <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> taking the same infection from her carkasses, soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore my Lords, let these bee warnings unto you, not to make that liberty which God hath given you, a snare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, in using this kind of inlargement of your selves.</p>
                           <p>The Second way of Propagation or inlargement used by Common-wealths, is that of <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> equal leagues; this, though it be not otherwise mischievous, is uselesse to the world, and dangerous unto themselves; uselesse unto the world, for as the former governments were Storks, these are blocks, have no sense of honour, or concernment in the sufferings of others. But as the <hi>Aetolians</hi> a state of the like fabrick, were reproached by <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> prostrate themselves, by letting out their arms unto the lusts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: while they have their own liberty barren, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out legitimate issue. I do not defame the people, the <hi>Switz</hi> for valour have no superior, the <hi>Hollander</hi> for industry no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual: but themselves in the mean time shall so much the less excuse their Governments, seeing that unto the <hi>Switz</hi> it is well enough known, that the Ensigns of his Common-wealth have no other <hi>Motto</hi> then (<hi>in te converte manus</hi>) and that of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> though hee swear more gold than the <hi>Spaniard</hi> digs, let's him languish in debt, for shee her self lives upon chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, these are dangerous unto themselves, precarious govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56348:130"/>
such as do not command, but beg their bread from Province to Province; in Coats that being patched up of all colours are of none. That their Cantons and Provinces are so many arrows, is good; but they are so many bows too, which is naught.</p>
                           <p>Like unto these was the Commonwealth of the ancient <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> hung together like Bobbins, without an hand to weave with them, therefore easily overcome by the <hi>Romans,</hi> though at that time; for number, a far lesse considerable people. If your liberty be not a root that grows, it will be a branch that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which consideration brings mee unto the Paragon, the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ways and means whereby the <hi>Romans</hi> acquired the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, and in that the Empire of the world, were different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the different Condition of their Commonwealth in her rise, and in her growth; in her rise shee proceeded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Colonies, in her growth by unequal Leagues. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies without the bounds of <hi>Italy</hi> shee planted none (such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, as to plant him in forreign parts, til the contrary interest of the Emperors brought in that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, was unlawful) nor did shee ever demolish any City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Compass; or divest it of liberty, but whereas the most of them were Commonwealths, stirred up by emulation of her great felicity, to war against her, if shee overcame any she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated some part of their Lands that were the greatest incendiaries, or causes of the trouble, upon which shee plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Colonies of her own people, preserving the Lands and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties for the rest, unto the natives or inhabitants. By this way of proceeding, (that I may bee brief as is possible) she did many and great things. For in confirming of Liberty, shee propagated her Empire, in holding the inhabitants from rebellion, shee put a curb upon the incursion of Enemies; in exonerating her self of the poorer sort, shee multiplied her Citizens, in rewarding her veterans, shee rendered the rest lesse seditious, and in acquiring unto her self the reverence of the Common parent, shee from time to time became the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56348:131"/>
Mother of New-born Cities.</p>
                           <p>In her farther growth the way of her propagation, went more upon Leagues, which for the first division were of two kindes, Social and Provincial.</p>
                           <p>Again, Social Leagues, or Leagues of Society, were of two kindes.</p>
                           <p>The first called, <hi>Latinity</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi>; The second <hi>Italian Right.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The League between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Latins,</hi> or Latine Right, approached nearest unto (<hi>Jus Quiritium</hi>) the right of a native <hi>Roman,</hi> The Man or the City that was honoured with this Right was (<hi>Civitate donatus cum suffragio</hi>) adopted a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the right of giving suffrage with the people in some cases, as those of Confirmation, of Law, or Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Judicature, if both the Consuls were agreed, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; wherefore that coming to little, the greatest and most peculiar part of this Priviledge was, that who had born Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy (at least that of <hi>Aedile</hi> or <hi>Quaestor</hi>) in any Latine City, was by consequence of the same a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> at all points.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Italian Right</hi> was also donation of the City, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Suffrage; they who were in either of these Leagues, were governed by their own Laws and Magistrates, having all the Rights, as to liberty of Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> yeelding and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Commonwealth as head of the League, and having the Conduct of all Affairs appertaining to the Common Cause, such aid of Men and Monies as were particularly agreed upon the merit of the cause, and specified in their respective Leagues, whence such Leagues came to be called equal or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal accordingly.</p>

                              <hi>Provincial Leagues</hi> were of different extention, according unto the Merit and Capacity of a conquered people, but of one kinde, for every Province was governed by <hi>Roman</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, as a <hi>Praetor</hi> or a <hi>Consul,</hi> according to the dignity of the Province, for the Civil Administration, and conduct of the Provincial Army: And a <hi>Quaestor</hi> for the gathering of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56348:131"/>
publick Revenue, from which Magistrates, a Province might appeal unto <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the better understanding of these particulars, I shall exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie in as many of them as is needful: And first, in <hi>Macedon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> were thrice conquered by the <hi>Romans,</hi> first under the conduct of <hi>T. Quintus Flaminius,</hi> secondly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that of <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus</hi>; and thirdly, under that of <hi>Q. Caecilius Metellus,</hi> thence called <hi>Macedonicus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the first time <hi>(Pax petenti Philippo data, Graeciae libertas) Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who (possessed of <hi>Acro Corinthus</hi>) boasted no less than was true, that he had <hi>Greece</hi> in fetters, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>Flaminius,</hi> had his Kingdome restored unto him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that he should forthwith set all the Cities which he held in <hi>Greece,</hi> and in <hi>Asia</hi> at liberty; and that he should not make war out of <hi>Macedon,</hi> but by leave of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> (having no other way to save any thing) agreed should be done accordingly.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> being at this time assembled at the <hi>Istmian</hi> Games, where the concourse was mighty great, a Cryer, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto the office by <hi>Flaminius,</hi> was heard among them proclaiming all <hi>Greece</hi> to be free; to which the people being amazed, at so hopeless a thing, gave little credit, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such testimony of the truth as put it past all doubt, whereupon they fell immediately on running unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul, with Flowers and Garlands, and such violent expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their admiration and joy, as if <hi>Flaminius</hi> a young man (about some thirty three) had not also been very strong, hee must have dyed of no other death then their kindness, while every one striving to touch his hand, they bore him up and down the field with an unruly throng, full of such Ejaculations as these; How! Is there a people in the world, that at their own Charge, at their own Peril, will fight for the liberty of another! Did they live at the next door unto this fire! Or what kinde of men are these, whose business it is to pass Seas, that the World may be governed with righteousness! The Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> and of <hi>Asia</hi> shake off their Iron fetters at the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56348:132"/>
voyce of a Cryer! Was it madness to imagine such a thing, and is it done! O Vertue! O Felicity! O Fame!</p>
                           <p>In this example your Lordships have a Donation of Liberty, or of <hi>Italian</hi> Right unto a people, by restitution to what they had formerly enjoyed, and some particular Men, Families, or Cities, according unto their merit of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if not upon this, upon like occasions were gratified with <hi>Latinity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But <hi>Philips</hi> share by this means did not please him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the League was broken by his son <hi>Perseus.</hi> And the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> thereupon for the second time conquered by <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Paulus,</hi> their King taken, and they sometime after the Victory, summoned unto the Tribunal of the General; where remembring how little hope they ought to have of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they expected some dreadful sentence. When <hi>Aemilius</hi> in the first place declared the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to be free, in the full possession of their Lands, Goods, and Laws, with right to elect annual Magistrates, yeelding and paying unto the people of <hi>Rome</hi> one half of the Tribute which they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to pay unto their own Kings. This done he went on, making so skilful a division of the Country, in order to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodizing of the people, and casting them into a form of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government. That the <hi>Macedonians</hi> being first surprized with the vertue of the <hi>Romans,</hi> began now to alter the scene of their Admiration, that a stranger to them should do such things for them in their own Country, and with such facility, as they had never so much as once imagined to be possible. Nor was this all, for <hi>Aemilius,</hi> as if not dictating to conquered Enemies, but to some well-deserving friends, gave them in the last place Laws, so suitable, and contrived with such care and prudence, that long use and experience (the only Correctress of works of this nature) could never finde a fault in them.</p>
                           <p>In this Example you have a Donation of Liberty, or of <hi>Italian</hi> Right, unto a people that had not tasted of it before, but were now taught how to use it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>My Lords,</hi> The Royallists should compare what we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we what hitherto we have done for them, vvith this
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56348:132"/>
example. It is a shame that while wee are boasting up our selves above all, we should be so far from imitating such examples as these, that we do not so much as understand, that if Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be the parent of manners, where there be no Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vertues, there is no Heroical Government.</p>
                           <p>But the <hi>Macedonians</hi> rebelling (at the name of a false <hi>Philip</hi>) the third time against the <hi>Romans,</hi> were by them judged incapable of Liberty, and reduced by <hi>Metellus</hi> unto a Province.</p>
                           <p>Now whereas it remains, that I explain the nature of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, I shall rather choose that of <hi>Sicely,</hi> because having been the first that the <hi>Romans</hi> made, the descriptions of the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>We have so received the Sicilian Cities into amity</hi> (saith <hi>Cicero) that they enjoy their ancient Laws, and upon no other condition than of the same obedience unto the people of</hi> Rome, <hi>which they formerly yeelded unto their own Princes or Superiors.</hi> So the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> whereas they had been parcelled forth unto divers Princes, and into divers States, the cause of perpetual Wars, whereby hewing one another down, they became Sacrifices unto the ambition of their Neighbours, or of some Invader, were now received at the old rate into a new Protection, which could hold them, and in which no Enemy durst touch them; nor was it possible (as the case stood with such) for the <hi>Sicilians</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or for the <hi>Romans</hi> to give more.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Roman Province</hi> is defined by <hi>Sigonius, a Region having Provinciall Right.</hi> Provinciall Right in general, was to bee Governed by a <hi>Roman Praetor,</hi> or <hi>Consull,</hi> in matter, at lest, of State, and of the <hi>Militia.</hi> And by a <hi>Quaestor,</hi> whose Office it was to receive the Publicks Revenue. Provinciall Right in particular, was different, according unto the different Leagues, or Agreements between the Common-wealth, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reduced unto a Province. <hi>(Siculi hoc jure sunt, ut quod civis cum cive agat, domi certet suis legibus,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> 
                              <hi>quod Siculus cum Siculo non ejusdem Civitatis, ut de eo Praetor Judices, ex P: Rupilii De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto, Sortiatur. Quod privatus a Populo petit, aut populus a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vato,

Ceterarum rerum selecti Judices. ex civium Romanorum conventu proponi solent. Inter aratores &amp; decumanos lege fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaria, quam Hieronicam appellant, judicia fiunt.</hi>) Because the rest would oblige mee unto a discourse too large for this place, it shall suffice that I have shewed you how it was in <hi>Sicely.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>My Lords,</hi> Upon the Fabrick of your Provinciall Orbe I shall not hold you; because it is sufficiently described in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and I cannot beleeve that you think it inferiour to the way of a <hi>Praetor</hi> and a <hi>Quastor.</hi> But whereas the Provinciall way of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealths was that whereby shee held the Empire of the World, and your Orbes are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee capable at the least of the like use; there may arise many Controversies. As whether such a course bee lawfull, whether it bee feizable? and seeing that the <hi>Romans</hi> ruined upon that point, whether it would not bee unto the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Common-wealth?</p>
                           <p>For the first, If the Empire of a Common-wealth bee a Patronage, to ask whether it bee lawfull for a Commonwealth to aspire unto the Empire of the World, is to ask whether it bee lawfull for her to do her duty, or to put the World into a better condition than it was before.</p>
                           <p>And to ask whether this bee feizable, is to ask why the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceanar,</hi> being under the like administration of Government, may not do as much with two hundred men as the <hi>Roman</hi> did with one hundred, for comparing their Commonwealths in their rise, the difference is yet greater. Now that <hi>Rome (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Avaritia Luxuriaque)</hi> through the naturall thirst of her constitution, came at length with the fulnesse of her Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to burst her self, this is no otherwise to bee understood, than as when a man that from his owne evill constitution, had contracted the Dropsie, dyes with drinking: It being apparent that in case her Agrarian had held, shee could never have been
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56348:133"/>
thus ruined; And I have already demonstrated that your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarian being once poysed, can never break or swarve.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore to draw towards some Conclusion of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, let mee inculcate the use, by selecting a few conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations out of many. The regard had in this place unto the Empire of the World, appertaineth to a well-ordered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, more especially for two Reasons.</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>1 The facility of this great enterprize, by a Government of the Modell proposed.</item>
                              <item>2 The danger that you would run, in the omission of such a Government.</item>
                           </list>
                           <p>The facility of this enterprize, upon the grounds already laid, must needs bee great, forasmuch as the Empire of the World hath been, both in reason and experience, the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence of a Common-wealth of this nature only, for though it have been given unto all kinds to drive at it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as that of <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> if the one had not hung in the others light; might have gained it, yet could neither of them have held it; not <hi>Athens,</hi> through the manner of her propagation, which being by down-right Tyranny, could not preserve what shee had; nor <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> because shee was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by the weight of a less Conquest. The facility then of this great Enterprize, being peculiar unto that popular Government; I shall consider it, First, In gaining; And secondly, In holding.</p>
                           <p>For the former <hi>(Volenti non fit injuria)</hi> it is said of the people under <hi>Eumenes,</hi> that they would not have changed their subjection for liberty, wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them no disturbance.</p>
                           <p>If a people be contented with their Government, it is a certain sign that it is good, and much good do them with it. The sword of the Magistracy is for a terror unto them that do evil.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eumenes</hi> had the fear of God, or of the <hi>Romans</hi> before his eyes, concerning such hee hath given you no Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="268" facs="tcp:56348:134"/>But till wee can say here are the <hi>Romans,</hi> where is <hi>Eumenes?</hi> Do not think that the late <hi>appearances of God</hi> unto you, have been altogether for your selves; <hi>he hath surely seen the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of your Brethren, <hi>and heard their cry, by reason of their task-masters.</hi> For to believe otherwise, is not only to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of his wayes, but altogether deaf. If you have ears to hear, this is the way in which you will assuredly bee called upon: for if while there is no Stock of Liberty, no sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the afflicted, it bee a common object, to behold a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple casting themselves out of the pan of one Prince, into the fire of another: what can you think, but if the world should see the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle again, shee would renew her age, and her flight? nor ever did shee spread her wing with better Omen, then will be read in your Ensigns, which if called in by an oppressed people, they interpose between them and their Yoak; the people themselves must either do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the mean time, or have no more pains to take for their wished fruit than to gather it, if that bee not done for them. Wherefore this must needs bee easy, and yet you have a greater facility, than is in the arm of flesh; for if the cause of mankind, bee the cause of God; the Lord of Hosts will bee your Captain, and you shall bee a praise unto the Earth.</p>
                           <p>The facility of holding, is in the way of your Propagation; if you take that of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon</hi>; you shall rain snares, but either catch or hold nothing. Lying lips are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Lord, if setting up for liberty you impose yoaks, hee will assuredly destroy you; On the other side, to go about a work of this nature, by a League without an head, is to abdicate that Magistracy, wherewithall hee hath not only indued you, but whereof hee will require an account of you; for <hi>cursed is hee that doth the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</hi> Wherefore you are to take the course of <hi>Rome</hi>: if you have subdued a Nation that is capable of liberty, you shall make them a present of it, as did <hi>Flaminius</hi> unto <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Aemilius</hi> unto <hi>Macedon</hi>; reserving unto your selves some
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56348:134"/>
part of that revenue, which was legally paid unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Government, together with the right of being head of the League, which includeth such Levyes of men and mony as shall bee necessary for the carrying on of the publick work, for if a people have by your means attained unto freedom, they owe both unto the cause and you, such aid as may propagate the like fruit unto the rest of the world. But whereas every Nation is not capable of her liberty unto this degree, lest you be put, to doing and undoing of things, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were in <hi>Macedon,</hi> you shall diligently observe what Nation is fit for her liberty unto this degree, and what not; which is to be done by two marks, the first if shee bee willing to <hi>help the Lord against the mighty</hi>; for if shee have no care of the Liberty of mankind, shee deserveth not her own; but because in this you may be deceived by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which continuing for a while specious, may afterwards vanish; the other is more certain, and that is, if shee bee capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an equal Agrarian; which that it was not observed by excellent <hi>Aemilius,</hi> in his Donation of Liberty, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Popular State among the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> I am more then moved to believe, for two reasons, the first because at the same time the Agrarian was odious unto the Roman <hi>Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; the second, that the <hi>Pseudo-Phillip</hi> could afterwards so easily recover <hi>Macedon,</hi> which could not have happened, but by the Nobility, and their impatience having great estates, to bee equalled with the people, for that the people should otherwise, at the meer sound of a name, have thrown away their liberty, is incredible; Wherefore bee assured<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that the Nation where you cannot establish an equal Agrarian, is incapable of her liberty, as to this kinde of Donation. For example, except the Aristocracy in <hi>Marpesia,</hi> bee dissolved, neither can that people, have their liberty there, nor you govern at home, for they continuing still liable to bee sold by their Lords, unto forrain Princes, there will never (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a Country of which there is no other profit to be made) bee want of such Merchants and drovers, while you
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56348:135"/>
must be the market where they are to receive their second payment.</p>
                           <p>Nor can the Aristocracy there be dissolved but by your means, in relation whereunto, you are provided with your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Orb, which being proportioned unto the measure of the Nation that you have vindicated or conquered, will easily hold it; for there is not a people in the world more difficult to be held than the <hi>Marpesians,</hi> which though by themselves it be given unto their own nature, is truly to be attributed unto that of their Country: Nevertheless you having nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men upon the continual guard of it, that threatned by any sudden insurrection, have places of retreat; and an Army of forty thousand men upon a dayes warning ready to march unto their rescue, it is not to be rationally shewn, which way they can possibly slip out of your hands; and if a man shall think, that upon a Province more remote, and divided by Sea, you have not the like hold; he hath not so well considered your wings, as your talons, your shipping being of such nature, as maketh the descent of your Armies almost of equal faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in any Country, so that what you take, you hold, both because your <hi>Militia</hi> being already populous, will bee of great growth in it self, and through the confederates, by whom in taking and holding, you are still more inabled to take and hold.</p>
                           <p>Nor shall you easilier hold, then the people under your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire or Patronage be held (My Lords, I would not go unto the door; to see whether it be <hi>(rimarum plena)</hi> close shut, this is no under-board dealing, nor game, at which he shall have any advantage against you that sees your Cards, but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the advantage shall be your own) for with eighteen thousand men (which number I put, because it circulates your Orb by the annual charge of six thousand) having set the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the order shewn, you will be able to hold the greatest Province, and eighteen thousand men, allowing them greater pay than any Prince ever gave, will not stand the Province in one Million revenue; <note n="*" place="margin">This by the pay of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Army, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary.</note> In consideration whereof, they shall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56348:135"/>
have their own estates free unto themselves, be governed by their own Laws and Magistrates; which if the Revenue of the Province be in dry rent (as there may be some that are four times as big as <hi>Oceana</hi>) forty millions, will bring it with that of industry (to speak with the least) unto twice the value, so that the people there, who at this day are so oppressed, that they have nothing at all whereupon to live, shall for one Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion paid unto you, receive at the least seventy nine unto their proper use, in which place I appeal unto any man, whether the Empire described, can be other than the Patronage of the world.</p>
                           <p>Now if you adde unto the propagation of Civil Liberty, (what is so natural unto this Commonwealth that it cannot bee omitted) the Propagation of the Liberty of Conscience, this Empire, this Patronage of the world, is the Kingdome of Christ. For as the Kingdome of God the Father, was a Commonwealth, so shall be the Kingdome of God the Son; <hi>The people shall be willing in the day of his power,</hi> Psal. 110.3.</p>
                           <p>Having shewed you in this, and other places some of those inestimable benefits of this kinde of Government, together with the natural and facile emanation of them from their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I come (lest God, who hath appeared unto you, for hee is the God of Nature, in the glorious Constellation of these subordinate causes, whereof wee have hitherto been taking the true elevation, should shake off the dust of his feet against you) to warn you of your dangers, which you, not taking the opportunity, will run by omission.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Machiavil</hi> speaking of the defect of <hi>Venice,</hi> through her want of proper Arms, cryes out <hi>(Questo tagliogli le gambe da montar in cielo)</hi> this cut her wings, and spoyled her mount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven. If you lay your Commonwealth upon any other foundation, then the people, you frustrate your self of proper Arms, and so lose the Empire of the World; nor is this all, but some other Nation will have it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Columbus</hi> offered gold unto one of your Kings, through whose happy incredulity, another Prince hath drunk the poyson,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56348:136"/>
even unto the consumption of his people; but I do not offer you a nerve of war that is made of purs-strings, such an one as hath drawn the face of the earth into convulsions, but such an one as is natural unto her health and beauty. Look you to it, where there is tumbling and tossing upon the bed of sickness, it must end in death, or recovery. Though the people of the world in the dregs of <hi>Gothick</hi> Empire, bee yet tumbling and tossing upon the bed of sickness, they cannot dye, nor is there any means of recovery for them, but by ancient prudence, whence of necessity it must come to pass, that this drug bee better known. If <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were not all sick, all corrupted together, there would bee none of them so, for the sick would not bee able to withstand the sound, nor the sound to preserve her health without curing of the sick. The first of these Nations (which if you stay her leasure, will in my minde bee <hi>France</hi>) that recovers the health of ancient Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, shall assuredly govern the world; for what did <hi>Italy</hi> when shee had it? And as you were in that, so shall you in the like case bee reduced unto a Province, I do not speak at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Italy, (L. Aemilio Papo. C. Atilio Regulo Cos.)</hi> armed upon the <hi>Gallick</hi> Tumult that then happened of her self, and without the aid of forreign Auxiliaries, Seventy thousand Horse, and Seven hundred thousand Foot; but as <hi>Italy</hi> is the least of those three Countries in extent, so is <hi>France</hi> the greatest in Population.</p>

She is comely as the Tents of Kedar, and terrible as an Army with Banners. Her neck is as the Tower of David, builded for an Armory, whereon there hang a thousand Bucklers, and Shields of mighty men. Let me hear thy voyce in the morning, whom my soul loveth. The South hath dropped, and the West is breathing upon thy Garden of Spices. Arise Queen of the earth; Arise holy Spouse of Jesus, For lo the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone. The Flowers appear on the earth, the

time of singing of birds is come, and the voyce of the Turtle is heard in our Land. Arise I say, come forth, and do not tarry; ah! wherefore should mine eyes behold thee by the rivers of</hi> Babylon, <hi>hanging thy harpes upon the willows, thou fairest among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</hi>

                              <p>The like is done by the election of four into the Council of Religion, and four into the Council of Trade, out of the same Region in the Senate, each of these Councils consisting of twelve Knights, four in every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                              <p>But the Council of Warre consisting of nine Knights, three in every Region, is elected by and out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, as the other Councils are elected by and out of the Senate; And if the Senate add a Iuncta of nine Knights more, elected out of their own number, for the term of three months, the Council of Warre by vertue of that addition, is Dictator of <hi>Oceana</hi> for the said term.</p>

                              <p>Next unto the elections of the Tropick, is the Bienni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Election of one Embassadour in ordinary, by the Ballot

                              <p>The last kind of Election is emergent. Emergent Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made by the Scruteny.

                              <p>So the Parliament of <hi>Oceana</hi> consisteth of the Senate proposing, and the People resolving.</p>

                              <p>Every Wednesday next ensuing the last of Ianuary, the Stratiots assembling at the hundred, elect their Captain and their Ensign, and fall to their game.</p>

in Chief, with the Conductors and the Censors, and having been disciplin'd and entertained with other Games, are called unto the Urnes, where they elect the second Essay, consisting of two hundred horse and six hundred foot in a Tribe, that is, often thousand Horse, and thirty thousand foot in all the Tribes, which is the standing Army of this Nation, to march at any warning; they also elect at the same time, a part of the third Essay, by the mixture of balls marked with the letter M. and the letter P. for <hi>Marpesia</hi> and <hi>Panopea,</hi> they of either mark being ten Horse and fifty foot in a Tribe, that is, five hundred horse and two thousand foot in all the Tribes, which are forthwith to march to their respective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                              <p>But the third Essay of this Nation more properly so called, is when the Strategus with the Polemarches (the Senate and the People, or the Dictator having Decreed a Warre) receive in return of his Warrants the second Essay from the hands of the Conductors at the Randezvouz of <hi>Oceana,</hi> which Army marching with all Accommodations, Provided by the Council of Warre, the Senate elects a new Strategus, and the Lords Lieutenants, a new second Essay.</p>
                              <p>A Youth except he bee an onely sonne, refusing any one of his three Essays without sufficient cause, shewn unto the Phylarch, or the Censors, is uncapable of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and is fined a fift part of his yearly rent, or of his Estate for Protection.

                              <p>The Provincial Orbe consisting in part of the Elders, and in part of the Youth, is thus created.</p>
                              <p>Four Knights out of the first Region falling, are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Senate, to bee the first Region of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Orbe of <hi>Marpesia,</hi> these being triennial Magistrates, take their places in the Provincial Council, consisting

of twelve Knights, for in every Region, each Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on choosing there weekly Provosts, of the Council thus constituted, one Knight more chosen out of the same Region in the Senate, being an annual Magistrate is President, with power to propose, and the opinions proposed by the President, or any two of the Provosts are Debated by the Council, and if occasion bee of farther power or instruction, than they yet have transmitted unto the Council of State, with which the Provincial is to hold Intelligence.</p>
                              <p>The President of this Councill is also Strategus, or General of the Provincial Army, wherefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors upon notice of his Election, and appointment of his Randezvous, deliver unto him the Stratiots of his Letter, which hee takes with him into his Province: and the Provincial Army having received the new Strate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, with the third Classis, the Council dismisseth the old Strategus with the first Classis. The like is done for <hi>Panopea,</hi> or any other Province.</p>
                              <p>But whereas the term of every other Magistracy or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in this Common-wealth, whether annual or trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, requireth an equal Uacation, the term of a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Counsellor or Magistrate, requireth no vacation at all.

A miserable Scene in any, but most deplorable in the eies of <hi>Caesar,</hi> thus beholding what havock his prodigious ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not satisfied with his own bloody ghost, had made upon his more innocent Remains, even unto the total extinction of his Family. For it is (seeing where there is any humanity, there must be some compassion) not to be spoken without tears, that of the full branches deriving from <hi>Octavia,</hi> the elder sister, and <hi>Julia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Augustus,</hi> there should not be one fruit or blossome that was not cut off, or blasted, by the Sword, Famine, or Poyson. Now might the great soul of <hi>Caesar</hi> have been full; and yet that which powred in as much or more, was to behold that execrable race of the <hi>Claudii,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hunted, and sucked his blood with the thirst of Tygars, to be rewarded with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and remain in full possession of the famous Patrimony: A spectacle to pollute the light of heaven. Nevertheless as if <hi>Caesar</hi> had not yet enough, his <hi>Phaebean</hi> Majesty caused to be introduced on the other side of the Theater, the most illustrious and happy Prince <hi>Andrea Doria,</hi> with his dear posterity, imbraced by the soft and constant arms of the City <hi>Genoa,</hi> into whose bosome, ever
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56348:141"/>
fruitful in her gratitude, he had dropp'd her fair liberty like the dew of heaven, which when the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyrant beheld, and how much more fresh that Lawrel was worn with a root in the hearts of the people, than that which hee had torn off; he fell into such horrid distortion of limbs and countenance; that the Senators who had thought themselves steel and flint at such an object, having hitherto stood in their reverent snow like thawing Alpes, now covered their faces with their large sleeves.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR the rest (sayes <hi>Plutarch</hi> closing up the story of <hi>Lycurgus</hi>) when he saw that his Government had taken root, and was in the very Plantation strong enough to stand by it self; he conceived such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light within him, as GOD is described by <hi>Plato</hi> to have done, when he had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Creation of the World, and saw his owne Orbes move below him: For in the Art of Man, being the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, which is the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hobb</hi>
               </note> Art of GOD, there is nothing so like the first Call of beautifull Order, out of Chaos and Confusion, as the Architecture of a well order'd Common-wealth. Wherefore <hi>Lycurgus</hi> seeing in effect, that his Orders were good, fell into deep Contemplation how he might render them, so far forth as is in humane providence, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and immortall. To which end he assembled the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and remonstrated unto them, that for ought he could perceive, their Policy was already such, and so well establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as was sufficient to entayle upon them and theirs, that virtue and felicity whereof humane Life is Capable.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, there being another thing of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment then all the rest, whereof he was not yet provided to give them a perfect accompt, nor could, till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi>; he desired that they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Lawes, without any change or alteration whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till his return from <hi>Delphos</hi>; unto which all the People chearfully and unanimously engaged themselves by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, desiring him that he would make as much hast as he could. But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> before he went, began with the Kings and the Senators, and thence taking the whole People in Order, made them all swear unto that which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and then took his Journey. Being arrived at <hi>Delphos,</hi> he sacrificed unto <hi>Apollo,</hi> and afterwards enquired if the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy which he had established, were good and sufficient for a virtuous and an happy Life. (It hath been a Maxime with Legislators, not to give Checks unto the present Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, but to make the best use of it, as that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the most powerfull with the People; otherwise though <hi>Plutarch</hi> being a Priest, was interested in the cause, there is nothing plainer then <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Book <hi>De Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> hath shewed it, that there was never any such thing as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56348:144"/>
an Oracle, except in the Art of the Priests. But to be civill unto the Author.) The <hi>God</hi> answered <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that his policy was exquisite, and that his City holding unto the strict observation of his forme of Government, should attain unto the height of fame and glory. Which Oracle <hi>Lycurgus</hi> causing to be written, failed not to send unto his <hi>Lacidemon.</hi> This done, that his Citizens might be for ever inviolably bound by their Oath, that they would alter nothing till his return, he took so firm a Resolution to dye in the Place, that from thence forward receiving no manner of food, he soone after performed it accordingly. Nor was he deceived in the Consequence, for his City became the first in glory and excellency of Government in the whole World. And so much for <hi>Lycurgus</hi> according to <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Archon</hi> when he beheld not onely the rapture of motion, but of joy and harmony, into which his Sphears without any manner of Obstruction or enterfering, but as it had been naturally were cast, conceived not les of exultation in his Spirit, but saw no more necessity or reason why he should administer an Oath unto the Senate and the People, that they would observe his Institutions, then unto a Man in perfect health, and felicity of Constitution that he would not kill himself. Neverthelesse whereas Christianity though it forbid violent hands, consisteth no lesse in Self denial then any other Religion, he resolved that all carnall Concupisence should dye in the Place, to which end that no manner of Food might be left unto ambition, he entred into the Senate with an unanimous Applause, And having spoken of his Government as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did when he assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the People, abdicated the Magistracy of <hi>Archon.</hi> The Senate as strucken with astonishment continued silent, Men upon so suddain an Accident being altogether unprovided of what to say; till the <hi>Archon</hi> withdrawing, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at the doore, divers of the Knights flew from their Places offering as it were to lay violent hands on him, while he escaping left the Senate with the tears in their eyes of Children that had lost their Father, and to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of all farther importunity, retired unto a Country house of his, being remote and very private, in so much that no Man could tell for some time what was become of him. Thus the Law-Maker happened to be the first object and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law made: For as Liberty of all things is the most welcome unto a People, so is there nothing more abhorrent from their nature then ingratitude. We accusing the <hi>Roman</hi> People of this Crime against some of their greatest Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as <hi>Camillus,</hi> heap mistake upon mistake, for being not so competent Judges of what belongs unto Liberty as they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56348:144"/>
were, we take upon us to be more competent Judges of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But whereas virtue for being a vulgar thing among them, was of no lesse rate then Jewels are with such as wear the most; we are selling this stone which we have ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raked out of the <hi>Roman</hi> ruders, at such a rate as the <hi>Switz</hi> did that which they took in the Baggage of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy:</hi> For that <hi>Camillus</hi> had stood more firme against the Ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> then her Capitol, was acknowledged: But on the other side that he stood as firme for the <hi>Patricians</hi> against the Liberty of the People was as plain; wherefore he never wanted of the People that would dye at his foot in the Field, nor that would withstand him to his beard in the City. An example in which they that think that <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> had wrong, neither doe themselves right nor the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in this signifie no lesse then that they had a scorn of slavery beyond the fear of Ruine, which is the height of Magnanimity. The like might be shewn by other examples, objected against this, and other Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the Banishment of <hi>Aristides</hi> the Just from <hi>Athens,</hi> by the Ostracisme, which first was no punishment, nor ever understood for so much as a disparagement, but tended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Security of the Common-wealth, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of a Citizen, whose Riches or Power with a party was suspected, out of harms way for the space of ten years, neither to the diminution of his Estate or Honour. And next though the virtue of <hi>Aristides</hi> might in it self be unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet for him under the name of the Just to become U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall Umpire of the People in all cases, even to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Legall wayes and orders of the Common-wealth, approached so much unto the Prince, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aristides</hi> no wrong, did their Government no more then right in removing him, which therefore is not so probable to have come to passe as <hi>Plutarch</hi> presumeth, through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of <hi>Themistocles:</hi> seeing <hi>Aristides</hi> was far more popular then <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who soon after took the same walk upon a worse occasion. Wherefore as <hi>Machiavill</hi> for any thing since alleadged hath irrefragably proved that Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are of all other the least ingratefull, so the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (I say) into which my Lord <hi>Archon</hi> had now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himself, caused an universall sadnesse and cloud in the minds of Men upon the glory of his rising Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Much had been ventilated in private discourse, and the People (for the Nation was divided into Parties that had not yet lost their animosities) being troubled, bent their eyes upon the Senate, when after some time spent in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Wherefore the Decree being forthwith Printed and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, Copies were returned by the Secretaries unto the <hi>Phylarches</hi> (which is the manner of Promulgation) and the Commissioners of the Seal, that is to say, the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Phosphorus de Auge</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Eudia, Dolabella d' Enyo</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Turmae,</hi> and <hi>Linceus de Stella</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Nubia</hi> being elected Proposers <hi>pro tempore,</hi> bespoke of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> a Muster of the People to be held that day 6 weeks, which was the time allowed for Promulgation, at the <hi>Halo.</hi>

            <p>The Satisfaction which the People throughout the Tribes received upon promulgation of the Decree, loaded the Carriers with weekly Letters between Friend &amp; Friend, whether Magistrates or private Persons. But the day for Proposition being come, and the Praerogative upon the Place appointed in Discipline, <hi>Sanguine de Ringwood</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Saltum</hi> Captain of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> marched by Order of the Tribunes with his Troop unto the <hi>Piazza</hi> of the <hi>Panthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> where his Trumpets entering into the great Hall by their Blazon gave notice of his Arrivall, at which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jant of the House came downe, and returning informed the Proposers, who descending were received at the foot of the Staires by the Captaine, and attended unto the Coaches of State, with which <hi>Calcar de Gilvo</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Phalera</hi> Master of the Horse, and the <hi>Ballotins</hi> upon their great Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses stood waiting at the Gate<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

               <hi>Brochus, Boristenes de Holiwater</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Ave</hi> Master of the Ceremonies: The Mace and the Seale of the Chancery went immediately before the Coaches, and on either side the doore-keepers or Guard of the Senate with their Pole-axes, accompanied with some three, or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

The <hi>Tribunes</hi> were placed at a Table that stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the long seat, those of the Horse in the middle, and those of the Foot at either end, with each of them a bowle or bason before him, that on the right hand being white, and the other green: in the middle of the Table stood a third which was red. And the House-keeper of the Pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who had already delivered a proportion of linnen balls or pellets unto every one of the Tribe, now presented boxes unto the <hi>Ballotines.</hi> But the Proposers as they enter'd the Gallery, or long Seat, having put off their Hats by way of Salutation, were answered by the People with a shout, whereupon the younger Commissioners seated themselves at either end, and the first standing in the middle, spake after this manner.</p>

                           <hi>Machiavill</hi> gives an handsome Caveat, Let no man (sayth he) be circumvented with the Glory of <hi>Caesar,</hi> from the false reflection of their pens, who through the longer continuance of his Empire in the name then in the family, changed their freedome for flattery. But if a man would know truly what the <hi>Romans</hi> thought of <hi>Caesar,</hi> lett him observe what they said of <hi>Catiline.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet by how much he who hath perpetrated some heighnous Crime, is more execrable then he who did but attempt it: by so much is <hi>Caesar</hi> more execrable then <hi>Catline.</hi> To the contrary let him that would know what ancient and heroicall times, what the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> would both have thought and sayd of my Lord <hi>Archon</hi>; Observe what they thought and sayd of <hi>Solon, Lycurgus, Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola.</hi> And yet by how much his vertue that is crown'd with the perfection of his worke, is beyond theirs, who were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour in their ayme, or in their performance, by so much is my Lord <hi>Archon</hi> to be preferred before <hi>Solon, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Publicola.</hi>

                        <p>Nor will we shun the most illustrious example of <hi>Scipio</hi>; this <hi>Hero,</hi> though never so little lesse, yet was he not the founder of a Common-wealth, and for the rest allowing his tue to have been of the most untainted ray, in what did it out thine this of my Lord <hi>Archon</hi>? But if dazling the eyes of the Magistrates it over-awed Liberty, <hi>Rome</hi> might be allowed some excuse that She did not like it, and I, if I admit not of this comparison. For where is my Lord <hi>Archon</hi>? Is there a Genius, how free soever, which in his presence would not find it self to be under power? He is shrunk into Clouds, he seeks obscurity in a Nation that sees by his light. He is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56348:147"/>
impatient of his own Glory, least it should stand between you and your Liberty.</p>
                        <p>Liberty! What is that, if we may not be gratefull? And if we may, we have none: For who hath any thing he doth not owe? My Lords, there be some hard conditions of virtue: If this debt were exacted, it were not due; whereas being cancel'd, we are all entred into Bonds. On the other side, if we make such payment as will not stand with a free People, we doe not enrich my Lord <hi>Archon,</hi> but Rob him of his whole estate, and of his immence glory.</p>
                        <p>These Particulars had in due deliberation, and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, according unto the orders of this Common-wealth. <hi>It is proposed by Authority of the Senate to you my Lords the People of</hi> Oceana.</p>

                        <p n="3">III. That the Lord <hi>Archon</hi> have the reception of all Forreigne Embassadors, by and with the Councill of State, according unto the orders of this Common-wealth.</p>

                        <p>The Proposer having ended his Oration, the Trumpets sounded, and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Horse being mounted to view the <hi>Ballot,</hi> caused the Tribe which thronging up to the Speech, came almost round the Gallery, to retreat a matter of twenty paces, when <hi>Linceus de Stella</hi> receiving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, repaired with <hi>Bronchus de Rauco</hi> the Heralt, unto a little Scaffold erected in the middle of the Tribe, where he seated himself, the Herrault standing bare upon his right hand. The <hi>Ballotines</hi> having their boxes ready, stood before the Gallery, and at the Command of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> marched, one unto every Troop on Horsback, and one unto every Company on foot, each of them being followed by other Children that bore red boxes, (this is putting the Question whether the Question should be put.) And the Suffrage being very suddainly returned unto the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and number'd in the view of the Proposers, the Votes were all in the Affirmative; whereupon the red, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Boxes were laid aside, it appearing that the Tribe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Negative or Affirmative, was clear in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wherefore the Herrault began from the Scaffold in the middle of the Tribe to pronounce the first Proposition, and the <hi>Ballotines</hi> marching with the Negative and Affirmative only: <hi>Bronchus</hi> with his voyce like Thunder, continued to repeat the Proposition over and over again so long as it was in Balloting: The like was done for every Clause, till the Ballot was finisht, and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> assembling had signed the points, that is to say, the number of every Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, as it was taken by the Secretary upon the tale of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> and in the sight of the Proposers; for this may not be omitted, it is the pulce of the People. Now whereas it appertaineth unto the <hi>Tribunes</hi> to report the Suffrage of the people unto the Senate, they cast the Lot for this Office with three silver Balls, and one gold one, and it fell upon the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Worshipfull <hi>Argus de Crookhorne,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Pascua,</hi> first <hi>Tribune</hi> of the Foot. <hi>Argus</hi> being a good sufficient Man in his own Country, was yet of the mind that he should make but a bad spokes man, and therefore became some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing blank at his Luck, till his colleagues perswaded him that it was no such great matter, if he could but read, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56348:148"/>
his Paper before him. The Proposers takeing Coach, received a volley upon the Field, and returned in the same Order, save that being accompanied with the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> they were also attended by the whole Praerogative unto the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza</hi> of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> where with another volley they took their leaves. <hi>Argus,</hi> who had not thought upon his Wife and Children all the way, went very gravely up, and every one being seated, the Senate by their silence seemed to call for the Report, which <hi>Argus</hi> standing up, delivered in this wise.</p>

For truly (Fathers) if he who is able to doe harm, and doth none, may well be called ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.

What shall we say unto my Lord <hi>Archon's</hi> Highnesse, who having had it in his power to have done us the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est mischief that ever befell a poor Nation, so willing to trust such as they thought well of, hath done us so much good, as we should never have known how to doe our selves? which was so sweetly delivered by my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Phosophorus,</hi> unto the People, that I dare say there was never an one of them could forbear to doe as I doeâ€” An't please your Fatherhoods they be tears of Joy. Ah my Lord <hi>Archon</hi> shall walk the streets (an it be for his ease I mean) with a Switch, while the People run after him, and pray for him: he shall not wet his foot, they will strew flowers in his way: he shall sit higher in their hearts, and in the judgement of all good Men, then the Kings that goe up stairs unto their seats, and one of these had as good pull two or three of his Fellowes out of their great Chaires, as wrong him, or meddle with him; he ha's two or three hundred thousand Men, that when you say the word, shall sell themselves unto their shirts for him, and dye at his foot. His Pillow is of Down, and his grave shall be as soft, over which they that are alive shall wring their hands. And to come unto your Fatherhoods, most truly so called, as being the loving Parents of the People; truly you doe not know what a feeling they have of your Kindnesse, seeing you are so bound up, that if there come any harm, they may thank themselves: And (alasse! poor souls) they see that they are given to be of so many minds, that though they always mean well, yet if there come any good, they may thank them that teach them better. Wherefore there was never such a thing as this invented, they doe verily believe that it is none other then the same which they always had in their very heads, if they could have but told how to bring it out: As now for a sample, My Lords the Proposers had no sooner said your minds, then they found it to be that which heart could wish. And your Fatherhoods may comfort your selves, that there is not a People in the world more willing to learn what is for their own goods, nor more apt to see it, when you have shew'd it them: Wherefore they doe love you as they doe their own selves, Honour you as Fathers, resolve to give you as it were Obedience forever; and so thanking you for your most good and excellent Lawes, they doe pray for you as the very Worthies of the Land, Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lords and Fathers assembled in Parliament.</p>

               <hi>Argus</hi> came off beyond his own expectation, for thinking right, and speaking as he thought, it was apparent by the House, and the thanks they gave him, that they esteemed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56348:149"/>
him to be absolutely of the best sort of Orators, upon which having a mind that till then misgave him, he became very Crounse, and much delighted with that which might goe down the next week in Print unto his Wife, and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. <hi>Livy</hi> makes the <hi>Roman Tribunes</hi> to speak in the same stile with the Consuls, which could not be, and therefore for ought in him to the contrary, <hi>Volero &amp; Canuleius</hi> might have spoken no otherwise forth their stile, then <hi>Argus.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were not created the first year of the Common-wealth; and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of <hi>Oceana</hi> are since become better Orators then were needfull. But the Lawes being Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had the Preamble annexed, and were delivered unto <hi>Bronchus,</hi> who loved nothing in the Earth so much as to goe staring and bellowing up and down the Town, like a Stagg in a Forrest, as he now did, with his Fraternity in their Coats of Arms, and I know not how many Trumpets, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the Act of Parliament, when meeting my Lord <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> (who from a retreat that was without Affectation, as being for Devotion only, and to implore a blessing by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Fasting, upon his labours, now newly Arrived in Town) the Herault of the Tribe of <hi>Bestia,</hi> set up his throat, and having chaunted out his Lession, past as haughtily by him, as if his own had been the better Office; which in this place was very well taken, though <hi>Bronchus</hi> for his high mind, happened afterwards upon some disasters (too long to tell) that spoyled much of his Embroidery.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Archons</hi> arrivall being known, the Signory acompanyed by the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> repaired unto him, with the newes he had already heard by the Herrauld: to which my Lord <hi>Strategus</hi> added, That his Highnesse could not doubt upon the Demonstrations given, but the minds of men were firme in the opinion, that he could be no seeker of himselfe, in the way of earthly Pompe and Glory; and that the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Senate, and the People, could not therefore be understood to have any such reflection upon him; But so it was, that in regard of dangers abroad, and Parties at home, they durst not trust themselves, without a standing Army, nor a standing Army in any mans hands, but those of his Highnesse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Archon</hi> made answer, that he ever expected this would be the sense of the Senate, and the People, and this being their Sence, he should have been sorry they had made choice of any other then himselfe for a standing Generall; First, because it could not have been more unto their owne safety, and secondly, because so long as they should have need of a standing Army, his worke was not done. That he would not dispute against the Judgement of the Senate,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56348:149"/>
and the People, nor ought that to be: Neverthelesse, he made little doubt, but experience would shew every Party their owne Interest in this Government, and that better improved, then they could expect from any other; that mens animosityes should over ballance their Interest, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, was impossible, that humor could never be lasting, nor through the Constitution of the Govermment, of any effect at the first charge. For supposing the worst, and that the People had chosen none other into the Senate, and the Prerogative, then royalists, a matter of Fourteen hundred men must have taken their Oaths at their Election, with an intention to go quite contrary, not only to their Oaths so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but to their own Interest; for being estated in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power, they must have decreed it from themselves, (such an example as for which there was never any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, nor can be any reason) or holding it, it must have done in their hands as well every whit, as in any other. Furthermore, they must have removed the Government from a Foundation that apparantly would hold, to set it upon another which apparantly would not hold, which things if they could not come to passe, the Senate and the People, consisting wholly of Royallists, much lesse by a parcel of them elected. But if the feare of the Senate and of the People, derived from a party without such an one as would not be elected, nor engage themselves unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth by any oath: this againe must be so Large, as would go quite contrary to their owne Interest, they being as free and as fully estated in their liberty, as any other, or so narrow that they could do no hurt, while the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Arms, and at the beck of the <hi>Strategus,</hi> every Tribe would at any time make a better Army, then such a Party, and there being no parties at home, fears from abroad would vanish. But seeing it was otherwise determined by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the People, the best course was to take that which they held the safest, in which with his humble thanks for their great bounty, he was resolved to serve them with all duty and obedience.</p>
            <p>A very short time after, the Royallists now equall Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, made good the <hi>Archons</hi> Judgement, there being no other that found any thing near so great a sweet in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For he who hath not been acquainted with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) knoweth but half the things of this world.</p>
            <p>Moreover they saw plainly, that to restore the ancient Government, they must cast up their Estates into the hands of three hundred men; wherefore in case the Senate, and the Prerogative consisting of thirteen hundred men, had
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56348:150"/>
been all Royallists, there must of necessity have been, and be for ever, one thousand against this or any such Vote. But the Senate being informed by the Signory, that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> had accepted of his Dignity and Office, caused a third Chair to be set for his Highness, between those of the <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegus,</hi> and the Orator in the House, the like at every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; to which he repaired, not of necessity, but at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, being the best, and as <hi>Argus</hi> not vainly said, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Prince in the World; for in the Pomp of his Court he was not inferiour unto any, and in the Field he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a force that was formidable unto all: Nor was there a cause in the Nature of this constitution, to put him unto the charge of Guards, spoyle his stomack or his sleep: Insomuch as being handsomely disputed by the wits of the Academy, whether my Lord <hi>Archon,</hi> if he had been ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, could have made himself so great, it was carried clear in the Negative; not only for the Reasons drawn from the present ballance, which was Popular, but putting the case the ballance had been Monarchicall. For there be some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (whereof this is one) that will bear a Prince in a Common-wealth, far higher then it is possible for them to bear a Monarch. <hi>Spain</hi> looked upon the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> as her most formidable Enemy, but if ever there be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in that Country, he will be her best friend. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Prince in a Common-wealth, deriveth his greatnes from the root of the People, a Monarch deriveth his from one of those ballances which nip them in the root; by which means the <hi>Low Countreyes</hi> under a Monarch, were poor and inconsiderable, but in bearing a Prince could grow unto a miraculous height, and give the glory of his actions by far the upper hand of the greatest King in Christendome. There are Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> to whom a King of <hi>Oceana</hi> would be but a <hi>Petit Companion.</hi> But the Prince of this Common-wealth is the terror, and the Judge of them all.</p>
            <p>That which my Lord <hi>Archon</hi> now minded most, was the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> upon which debate he uncessantly thrust the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the Council of State, to the end it might be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon some firm root, as the main point and Basis of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity unto the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And these are some of the most remarkable Passages that happened in the first year of this Government. About the latter end of the second, the Army was disbanded, but the Taxes continued at thirty thousand pounds a month, for three years and an half. By which means a piece of Artigli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery was Planted, and a portion of Land to the value of 50. <hi>l.</hi> a year purchased for the maintenance of the Games, and of the Priz-arms for ever, in each Hundred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:56348:150"/>With the eleventh year of the Common-wealth, the terme of the Excise, allotted for the mayntenance of the Senate and the People, and for the raysing of a Publique Revenue, expired. By which time the Exchequer over and above the annuall Sallaryes, amounting unto three hundred thousand pounds, accumulating every year out of one Million income, Seaven hundred thousand pounds, in Bancho, brought it with the Product of the Summe, rise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about eight Millions in the whole, whereby at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times they had purchased unto the Senate and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Foure hundred thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> sollid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue: which besides the Lands holden in <hi>Panopea,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Perquisites of either Province, was held suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a publique Revenue. Neverthelesse, Taxes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now wholly taken off, the Excize of no great burthen, and many specious Advantages not vainly proposed in the heightening of the Publique Revenue, the Excise was very chearfully established by the Senate and the People, for the terme of ten years longer: and the same course being taken, the Publique Revenue was found in the One and twentieth of the Common-wealth, to be worth one Million in good Land; Whereupon the Excise was so abollished for the present; as with all resolved to be the best, the most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and easie way of raising Taxes, according unto future Exigencies. But the Revenue now such, as was able to be a yearly Purchaser, gave a jealousie that by this means the ballance of the Common-wealth, consisting in private For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, might be eaten out; whence this yeare is famous for that Law whereby the Senate &amp; the People forbidding any farther Purchase of Lands unto the Publique, within the Dominions of <hi>Oceana,</hi> and the adjacent Provinces, put the <hi>Agrarian</hi> upon the Common-wealth her self. These encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are things which men, addicted unto Monarchy, deride as impossible, whereby they unwarily urge a strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, against that which they would defend: For having their eyes fixed upon the Pomp and Expence, by which not only every Child of a King being a Prince, exhausteth his Fathers Coffers; but favorites and servile spirits devoted unto the flattery of those Princes, grow insolent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, returning a fit Gratitude unto their Masters, whom while they hold it honourable to deceive, they suck and keep eternally poor. It followes that they doe not see now it should be possible for a Common-wealth to cloath her self in Purple, and thrive so strangely upon that which would make a Prince's haire grow through his hood, and not afford him bread. As if it were a Miracle that a careless and Prodigall Man should bring ten thousand pounds a

year to nothing, or that an industrious and frugall Man brings a little unto ten thousand pounds a year. But the fruit of a mans industry and frugality, can never be like that of a Common-wealth, first because the Greatnesse of the encrease, followes the greatnesse of the Stock or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: and secondly, because a frugall Father is for the most part succeeded by a Lavish Son, whereas a Common-wealth is her owne Heire.</p>
            <p>This year a part was proposed by the Right Honourable <hi>Aureus de Woolsacke</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Pecus,</hi> first Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Treasury; unto the Council of State, which soon after past the ballot of the Senate and the People: by which the Lands of the Publique Revenue amounting unto one Million, were equally divided into five thousand Lots, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by their names and parcells into a Lot-booke preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Exchequer: and if any Orphant being a Mayd should cast her Estate into the Exchequer for Fourteen hundred pounds, the Treasury was bound by the Law to pay her quarterly Two hundred pounds a yeare, free from Taxes for her Life, and to assigne her a Lot for her Security; if she marryed, her Husband was neither to take out the Principall without her consent (acknowledged by her selfe unto one of the Commissioners of the Treasury who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coridng as he found it to be free, or forced, was to allow or disallow of it) nor any other way engage it, then to her propper use: But if the Principall were taken out, the Treasury was not bound to repay any more of it then One thousand pounds; nor might be repay'd at any time, save within the first year of the Marriage: the like was to be done by a halfe or quarter Lot respectively.</p>
            <p>This was found to be a great Charity unto the weaker Sex, and as some say, who are more skilfull in like Affairs then my self, of good Profit to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Now began the Native Spleen of <hi>Oceana</hi> to be much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and men not to affect sullennesse and Pedantisme. The Elders could remember that they had been Youth. Wit and Gallantry were so far from being thought Crimes in themselves, that care was taken to preserve their innocence. For which cause it was proposed unto the Council for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by the Right Honourable <hi>Cadiscus de Clero,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Stamnum,</hi> first Censor, That such women as living in Gallantry and view about the Town, were of evil fame, and could not shew that they were maintained by their own Estates or Industry; or such as having Estates of their own, were yet wastfull in their way of life, unto others, should be obnoxious unto the animadversion of the Council of Religion, or of the Censors: In which the proceeding
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56348:151"/>
should be after this manner. Notice should be first given of the scandall, unto the party offending, in private; if there were no amendment within the space of six Months, she should be summoned and rebuked before the said Council or Censors: And if after other six Moneths it were found that neither this avayled, She should be Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured not to appear at any Publick Meetings, Games or Recreations, upon Penalty of being taken up by the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, or Guards of the Senate, and by them to be detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, untill for every such offence, five pounds were duly paid for her enlargement.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if any Common-Strumpet should be found, or any scurrility or prophanesse represented at either of the Theaters, the Prelates for every such offence should be fined Twenty pounds, by the said Council, and the Poet for every such offence on his part, should be whipt. This Law relates unto another, which also was enacted the same year upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>The Youth and Wits of the Academy having put the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse so home in the defence of Comedies, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vosts had nothing but the Consequences provided against by the fore-going Law to object, prevailed so far, that two of the Provosts of the Council of State, joyn'd in a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which after much adoe came to a Law, whereby one hundred thousand pounds was alotted for the building of two Theaters, one on each side of the <hi>Piazza</hi> of the <hi>Halo,</hi> and two annuall Magistrates called Prelates, chosen out of the Knights, were added unto the Tropick, the one called the Prelate of the <hi>Buskin,</hi> for inspection of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Scene called <hi>Melpomene,</hi> and the other the Prelate of the <hi>Socke,</hi> for the Comick called <hi>Thalia,</hi> which Magistrates had each of them five hundred pounds a year, allowed out of the Profits of the Theaters, the rest (except 800 a year to four Poets) payable into the Exchequer. A Poet <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reate</hi> created in one of these Theaters, by the <hi>Strategus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a wreath of five hundred Pounds in Gold, paid out of the said Profits. But no man is capable of this Creation, that had not two parts in three of the Suffrages at the Academy, assembled after six weeks warning, and upon that occasion.</p>
            <p>These things among us are sure enough to be censured, but by such only as doe not know the nature of a Common-wealth; for to tell men that they are free, and yet to curb the genious of a People in a lawfull Recreation unto which they are naturally inclined, is to tell a tale of a Tub. I have heard the Protestant Ministers in <hi>France,</hi> by men that were wise, and of their own profession, much blamed in that they forbad Dancing, a Recreation to which the genious of that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56348:152"/>
aire is so enclining, that they lost many who would not loose that; nor doe they lesse then blame the former determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rashnesse, who now gently connive at that which they had so roughly forbidden. These sports in <hi>Oceana</hi> are so Governed, that they are pleasing for private diversion, and profitable unto the Publique: For the Theaters soon defrayed their own Charge, and now bring in a good Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. All this so far from the Detriment of virtue, that it is to the improvement of it, seeing Women that heretofore made havock of their Honours, that they might have their pleasures, are now incapable of their pleasures, if they loose their Honours.</p>
            <p>About the one and fortieth year of the Common-wealth, the Censors according unto their Annuall Custome, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pillar of <hi>Nilus,</hi> by which it was found that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were encreased very near one third. Whereupon the Council of War was appointed by the Senate to bring in a State of War, and the Treasurers the State of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury. The State of War, or Pay, and Charge of an Army, was soon after exhibited by the Council, in this Accompt.</p>

But it is against all experience, sense and reason, that such an Army should not be soon broken, or make a great Progresse; in either of which Cases the Charge seaseth, or rather if a right course be taken in the latter, Profit comes in; for the <hi>Romans</hi> had no other considerable way, but Victory, whereby to fill their Treasury, which neverthelesse was seldome empty. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> did not consult his Purse, upon his designe for <hi>Persia.</hi> It is observed by <hi>Machiavill,</hi> that <hi>Livy</hi> arguing what the event in reason must have been, had that King invaded <hi>Rome,</hi> and diligently measuring what on each side was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto such a War, never speaks a word of Money.
