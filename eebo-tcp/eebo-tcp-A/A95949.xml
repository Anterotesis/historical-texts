            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By <hi>Jo: Harr:</hi> Eſq.</byline>
            <p>THe honeſt uſe of making queres was heretofore, to be inſtructed and attaine ſatisfaction in thoſe things whereof our reaſon doubted; not to juſtifie our owne wilfull errors, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of asking queſtions to vent opprobrious calumnies, and raile poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively againſt the ſenſe of other men. The nature therefore of queres is much miſtaken by the Author of thoſe nine againſt the Army; for I cannot diſcern in what point he deſires to be inſtructed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153715:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->himſelfe, or teach others; but inſtead of that, in a poſitive way, and with much bitterneſſe, he inveighs againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of thoſe gallant gentlemen, to whoſe ſucceſſefull valour, and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable induſtry (next under God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe bleſſing all endeavours are fruitleſſe) the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is indebted to for the reſcue of her ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and almoſt loſt) Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
            <p>If this Army have well deſerved of the Common-wealth, why ſhould any man that loveth the Common-wealth flie ſo high againſt them, as by way of prejudice to cenſure their intentions worſe then their actions ſhew. For no action of theirs hath yet produced any hurt. Can any candid or honeſt man harbour a ſuſpicion, that the noble <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> names honoured by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153715:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->the very enemies, whom no ſucceſſe could ever puffe up, thoſe miracles of modeſty, in whom no ſelfe-ſeeking, no pride or ambition has in the leaſt meaſure diſcovered it ſelfe; ſhould now be guilty of ſuch a monſtrous ambition as to affect an arbitrary power, to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the State, to ſubject the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enſlave the nation to their owne will?</p>
            <p>But it appeares by the queres (ſaith he) that they have broken the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, and are therefore ſuſpected to aime at wicked ends. I, for mine own part, do ſo much honour the Parliament, that I thinke every Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge belonging to it of ſo tender a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is unfit to be trod upon, or rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with: But I confeſſe I doe more honour the eſſence and being of the Parliament then I doe every ſmall pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuality
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153715:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 6 -->of Priviledge, and could be content rather to ſee the finger of it wounded (for theſe conteſting times have taught us ſuch diſtinctions) then the whole body periſh. Some parts of a body may be a little afflicted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that the whole may live in the more health: Neither can I thinke that this Army which hath given ſo noble a teſtimony of their affections to the Parliament, as to preſerve the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; would now violate any part or priviledge thereof, unleſſe the ſafety of the whole did require ſuch a ſeeming violation. Let honeſt Engliſh-men therefore ſuſpect no hurt unleſſe they ſee probable inducements to ſuch a ſuſpicion; but hope ſtill, that this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament whom the ſwords of ſo many Lords and others of the Engliſh-Gentry could not cut downe, whom the Votes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153715:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 6 -->of that <hi>Oxford</hi> Aſſembly (which the King called his mungrill Parliament) could not at all blaſt, nor many ſecret practices undermine, ſhall be ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by Almighty God, and not rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but reſcued from ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which might have wrought a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, if not prevented.</p>
            <p>The particular queres are ſcarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſeverall anſwers: but to the firſt, wherein he makes it ſo great a breach of Priviledge that the Army printed their Declarations, and Charge againſt the Members without leave of the Houſe, I think it a ſufficient anſwer, that there was no other way to make the cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their intentions appear, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate themſelves from farther jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as their enemies might raiſe, who have beene too apt to throwgh cauſleſſe aſperſions on them. I could rather wiſh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153715:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->
               <hi>that the London Preſſes were not too open in theſe dayes, to reproachfull pamphlets of our greateſt enemies, which are daily ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the honour and eſſence of the Parliament it ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond quere wherein this Religious and deſerving Army is in many things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to</hi> Cade <hi>and his fellow Rebells, being ſo injurious as that it cannot be anſwered with patience enough, may with diſcretion be ſcorned and paſſed over. As likewiſe the third, wherein he compareth this demand of the Members to another, which was made heretofore, and judged by both Houſes to be a great breach of Priviledges, of which becauſe the caſe is ſo notoriouſly different, J think it not fit to ſpeak at all; nor to ſay any thing at all to that cavill of his, becauſe the Members are not particularly charged, becauſe time muſt produce that, only to which it is referred.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>As for another compariſon which he makes in a following quere betwixt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies proceedings, and thoſe which</hi> Sleiden <hi>relates of the bloody &amp; mad actions of thoſe Anabaptiſts in</hi> Munſter, <hi>J hope all judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men will eaſily make a difference, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vindication of mine, betwixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and actions ſo extreamly diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for another imputation of hindering the reliefe of</hi> Ireland, <hi>it may eaſily appear, and J make no queſtion but it will in time, that the cauſe of that may with more reaſon be imputed to the enemies of this Army, who by unjuſt provocations have diverted that important ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſpare therefore farther expreſſions in this kinde, J ſhall onely ſtay with patience, and expect what it will pleaſe God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of theſe jarrs, hoping that it may be ſuch a bleſſing to this afflicted Kingdome,
