            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The true State &amp; Condition of the ſeven foot-Companies
in the City of London-Derry, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the ſeverall Captains following, viz Robert Thornton,
Simon Pitt, Henry Fynch, Henry Oſborn, John Kilner, Robert Lawſon,
&amp; William Patſall, (who now commandeth that Company which was
raiſed by Hewet Finch, deceaſed, and for ſome time comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Captain Henry Vaughan) is as followeth, viz.</head>
            <p>
               <label>FIRST,</label>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſaid ſeverall Captaines by authority, derived from the right Honourable the
Lords Juſtices, and Councell of <hi>Ireland;</hi> about the twenty ſeventh of <hi>October,</hi> 1641.
did raiſe, feede, Cloath, Arme, and at their owne proper coſt and charges,
maintaine their ſaid Companies, each Company conſiſting of one hundred men
beſides Officers, and by the carefull induſtry, of the ſaid Commanders, were
made able, ready, and expert Souldiers, as by Certificate dated the firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
1642. Signed by Colonell Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> Knight and Barronet,
Collonel Sir <hi>Robert Stewart</hi> Knight, Sir <hi>William Sempill</hi> Knight, and divers other perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ready to be produced, appeareth more at large.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the ſaid Captains &amp; their ſaid Companies, from the time of their ſaid raiſing, have
conſtantly, faithfully, and ſucceſſefully ſerved, not onely in guarding, repairing, and preſerving the
ſaid City, but have alſo often marched out, into the field, and given Battaile to the Rebels, and
beene Actors in the greateſt ſervices that have beene performed in the Counties of <hi>Tyrone, Donnegall,</hi>
and <hi>London-derry;</hi> the ſaid Captaines, alwayes furniſhed their ſaid Companies, with all proviſions,
at their owne coſts and charges, as by the ſaid Certificate likewiſe appeareth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the ſaid Captaines, and their ſaid Comapnies, have beene a very prevalent meanes,
for the preſervation of the ſaid City of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and the Country adjacent; and that without
the aſſiſtance of the ſaid Captaines and their ſaid Companies, and the ſupplies, and ſupport, which
ſome of the ſaid Captaines upon credit, (out of their affection to the Publicke ſervice) did advance in
ready money, victuals, and other proviſions, (wherewith other Regiments were furniſhed) ſeverall
other Regiments, could not have ſo well ſubſiſted, as by the ſaid Certificate may alſo appeare.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the ſaid Lords Juſtices, and Councell, by their Letters, dated the ſixth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
1642. directed to the then Mayor of <hi>London-derry,</hi> and to Sir <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aughan,</hi> Knight, taking
notice how helpefull the Forces in that City, had beene to the other Regiments in thoſe parts, and to
the ſervice, did render them thankes for it; and require the continuance thereof, from time to time:
by their ſaid letters, alſo ſignifying, That their Lordſhips formerly had, and were then againe, writing
into <hi>England,</hi> as well for their pay, as for proviſions of Victuals, Clothes, and other Neceſſaries for
them, as by a copy of the ſaid Letters may appeare.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That by Order of the honourable Houſe of Commons, dated the ſeventeenth of <hi>May,</hi>
1643. the ſaid Companies were to have entertainment, according to the pay of the Army there, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
from the date of the Muſter-booke, ſigned by Commiſſary <hi>Roberts,</hi> by order of the Lord Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was taken the nineteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1642. as by a Copy of the ſaid Order ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That upon the Petition of <hi>Robert Harrington,</hi> Eſquire, Agent for the City of <hi>London-derry,</hi>
preſented unto the Committee of Adventurers, of the honourable Houſe of Commons, and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
choſen in the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the Iriſh affaires, An Order was made the eighth of <hi>September,</hi>
1643. by which for the Reaſons therein mentioned, It was ordered that as the ſaid Committee ſhould
be inabled, they would take care to provide for the ſaid ſeverall Companies in the next Ship, that
ſhould goe to <hi>London-derry,</hi> in ſuch manner and meaſure, as other the Companies there, ſhould be
provided for; as by the ſaid Order appeareth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is now hereupon humbly offered to conſideration.</hi> That although divers proviſions, have beene ſent
to <hi>London-derry,</hi> and to <hi>Knock fergus,</hi> ſince the ſaid Companies were raiſed, and ſince all the ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
by them performed as aforeſaid, (and lately a Ship with proviſions of victuals, which came out
of <hi>Holland,</hi> ſent unto <hi>Knock fergus</hi>) yet have not any of the ſaid Captains, nor any of their ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
at any time ſince their being raiſed as aforeſaid, received any manner of proviſion, either in
Money, Victuall, Clothes, Armes, Ammunition, or ought elſe whatſoever, to their extreame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement:
And now upon the Ceſſation, if ſome reaſonable and preſent reſpect, bee not had of
them, and their doing and ſuffering for the time paſt, And ſuch proviſion for the future, to bee made
for them, as for others of their quality in thoſe parts. They are like in ſhort time to bee utterly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
and deſtroyed: The ſpeedy prevention whereof, is now by them, and their ſaid Agent, in
their behalfe, humbly prayed and deſired.</p>
