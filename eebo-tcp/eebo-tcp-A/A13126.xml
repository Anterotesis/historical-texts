         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For being altogether restrained then, from free practise of my profession abroad, &amp; no lesse impatient of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at home, I could not readily thinke of a better course to spend that vacation, than in an Argument having a reference to mine old Grammaticall Muses, and according; in some <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ort, with my latter studies in Physick. What howres therfore, either the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or diseased estate of my neighbours, together with the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mine owne mortalitie would afford, I employed gladly in the said Subiect.</p>
            <p>Againe, for as much as the selfe same cause debarred me from accesse unto your house at <hi>Combe</hi> (a dutie that otherwise the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie of our aboad did require) I fully resolued at the finishing of those my Sedentary labours, to prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the same to your view: therby to sheild my selfe (whom it pleased you before time to grace with kind entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) from the iust imputation of rude negligence in that behalfe. But now, since the same citie so dangerous the yeare before, is become a retyring place of safety for your Houshold, &amp; hath to mee alreadie yeelded fit opportunitie to excuse my former absence personally by word of mouth, I have presumed nevertheles to dedicate the same unto your Honour, as a token of my thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for your bounteous favour, farre above the proportion of my
<pb facs="tcp:3392:2"/>
deserts, and an earnest penny of that propense minde, which I carie to honour your name, in the best maner I could deuise.</p>
            <p>And verily calling to my remembrance how courteously you have vouchsafed heretofore to accept even at second hand my trauailes in this kinde, and with good words testified oftentimes the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you received therin, I had no reason to doubt the like accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that which out of a loving and devote heart I offer first unto your selfe.</p>
            <p>Lastly, when I consider, how together with sincere pietie, rare wisdome, and other eminent vertues, there is seated in your person a singular affection to advance good literature, with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie respect of learned men, I knew no means out of my small fortunes to do you greater honour, than by entituling you as Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that, which may benefit young Scholers, my countrimen, that would be learned: to give knowledge unto the word, that all the profit or pleasure whatsoever, which shall grow unto them, from these endeavours of mine, are derived immediatly from you and for your sake bestowed upon them.</p>
            <p>These motives, right Honorable, as well of my first enterprise, as of chusing your Patronage, if it please you to approue, (the onely thing that I humbly crave at your hand for this present) <hi>I</hi> shall not only thinke my pains well taken and choise as well made: prising your acceptance to the worth of a competent guerdon: but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my hearty prayers unto the Almightie for your perfect health, proceeding in a vertuous course of life, with increase of true Honour here upon earth, and after the revolution of many new yeares, for eternall happinesse in the highest Heaven.</p>

            <p>Secondly, for as much as he continueth in generall the Narrations of the said Princes, from before their Nativitie unto their Death &amp; Funerals: and in the severall discourses, of their ages, affaires, vertues, vices, feature &amp; lineaments of bodie, first, after an uniform maner, proposeth throughout certain heads summarily, and then exemplyfieth the same in due order by perticulers (a most lightsome method and way of teaching) keeping him selfe still to the Subiect matter, without any digressions at all: my advise is, that for your more expedite course in reading the whole, yee direct your minde thereunto. Now, for that his IVLIVS CHASAR sorteth not with the rest, but appeareth <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thirdly, considering that brevitie is many times the mother of Obscuritie, may it please those among you, who are not so conuersant in such concise writings, as admit not one word superfluous, to have recourse, for the clearing of some doubts unto the margin, as also to those briefe Annotations, which for their sakes, out of mine owne readings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the select observations of BEROALDVS, SABELLICVS, TORRENTIVS and CASAVBONVS I have collected. Which also will ease them of many difficulties that his succinct style and termes, not elswhere obvious, interlaced, may otherwise breed.</p>
            <p>Finally, if there happen to occur some Errata, that might escape either my pen in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or the ordinarie dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of meane Correctors in the printing ye will of your iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious candour, I hope, either passe them over with connivency, if they be literall, or else taxe with some easie censure in case they bee materiall: So long as for your full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ye may with small paines before yee begin either to read or iudge, correct what is amisse, according to the Examen and Review annexed to the end of all.</p>

For his better securitie therefore against future times, he travailed much to obligue and make beholden unto him the Magistrates every yeare: and of those Competitours who sued for any honourable Office, to helpe or suffer none other to come unto the place, but such as covenanted with him, and undertooke to defend &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note n="*" place="margin">For that hee was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily absent, longer than the Law <hi>Sempronia</hi> did permit.</note> him in his absence.

CURIO a most violent Tribune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to sticke unto him, &amp; defend his honor. But seeing all things carried still against him more obstinately than before, &amp; the new Consuls elect take the contrarie side &amp; bent another way, he wrote unto the Senate, and by his letters humbly besought them, not to suffer the benefit granted unto him by the people to be taken from him: or if they did, yet to giue order that other Generals like wise as well as hee, might leave their Armies: presuming confidently, as men thinke, vpon this, himselfe should be able whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer he pleased to assemble together his souldiers more easily the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> POMPEIUSTO levy new. But with his aduersaries he wold haue treated by way of Capitulation in these termes, that after he had discharged and sent away 8. Legions, and giuen over the prouince of <hi>Gaule</hi> beyond the Alpes, he might be allowed 2. legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with the prouince on this side the Alpes: or if not so, yet atleast wise one, together with ILLYRICUM, vntil such time as he were created co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sul.</p>
            <p>But perceiuing that the Senate came not betweene nor interposed their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to stop the course intended against him, &amp; his aduersaries denied flatly to admit all manner of capitulating &amp; composition concerning the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, he passed into the hither part of <hi>Gaule,</hi> &amp; having kept the Assizes there and executed his provinciall jurisdiction stayed at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> with full resolution to be reuenged by open warre, in case there had passed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Senat, any sharp and cruell decree, touching the Tribunes of the Commons opposing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in his behalfe, &amp; quarrell: And verily this was the colour and occasion which he pretended of ciuill warre: yet men thinke there were some other causes &amp; motiues thereto. Cn. POMPEIUS was wont to giue out that for as much as CAESAR was not able of himselfe and with his owne priuate wealth, either to consummate and finish those stately workes &amp; aedifices which he had begun, or to satisfie the expectation of the people which he had raised &amp; wrought of his comming, therefore he intended to trouble the state and set all on a garboyle. Others say, that he feared least he should be compelled to giue an accoumpt of those things which in his first Consulship he had done against the sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spices, the lawes, and prohibitions of the Tribunes (in the name of the people) considering that M. CATO had threatned and professed eftsoones, &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an oath, that no sooner should he and his armie be parted, but he would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially call his name in question &amp; bring him to his answere: Also for that it was commonly spoken abroad that if he returned ones in qualitie of a priuate person, he should after the example of MILO plead before the iudges, with a guard of armed men about the Court and Tribunall. And this seemeth to bee more probable by that which ASINIUS POLLIO writeth, who reporteth, that in the battaile of Pharsalia, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beheld his aduersaries before his face, slaine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3392:23"/>
and put to flight, he vttered this speech word for word. <hi>Loe, this was their own doing: this would they needes haue,</hi> And I CAIUS CEASAR <hi>after so many worthie exploites atchieved should haue beene a condemned man, had I not craued helpe of mine armie.</hi> Some are of opinion, that being so long inured &amp; acquainted with soueraigne command, &amp; weighing his owne puissance &amp; the power of his enemies, in balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one against the other, took the occasion &amp; opportunitie to usurpe that absolute dominion, which in the uerie prime of his years he aspired unto; and of this mind, it seemeth CICERO was, who in his 3. book of duties writeth, that CEASAR had alwaies in his mouth, these verses of EURIPIDES</p>

            <p>When word therefore was brought unto him, that the Tribunes inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">31</note> &amp; negatiue voice was put down, and themselues departed out of the Citie:<note place="margin">A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> V<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> C<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 705,</note> hauing immediatly sent before certaine Cohorts priuily, because no suspition might arise, he dissimuled the matter, &amp; was present in person to behold a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Game, viewed, and considered the plotforme according to which he was about to build a Schoole of sword fencers, and according to his usuall manner gaue himselfe to feast &amp; banquet often. After this presently vpon the Sun-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he tooke vp certaine <hi>Mules</hi> from the next Bakersmil-house; set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their geires to his wagon, and as closely as possibly he could with a small retinewe and companie about him put himselfe in his Iournie; and when by reason that the lights were gone out, he had lost his way, after he had wandred a long time, at the length meeting with a guide by that time it was day, he passed on foote through most narrow crosse lanes and by-pathes untill he recovered the right way againe. Now when he had ones ouertaken his Cohorts, at the riuer <hi>Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> which was the utmost bound of his province, he rested &amp; stoode still a little while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> casting in his mind, how great an enterprise he went in hand with, he turned vnto them that were next unto him and said. As yet my maisters wee may well returne backe; but passe we once ouer this little bridge, there will be no dealing but by force of armes and dint of sword.</p>
            <p>As he thus staied, and stood doubtfull what to doe, a strang sight he chanced to see in this manner. All of a suddaine their appeared vnto him a certaine man of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary stature &amp; shape withall, sitting hard by, &amp; piping with a reed. Now when beside the shepheards &amp; herdmen many soldiours also from their standing wards ran for to heare him, &amp; among them the Trumpetters likewise, he caught from on of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Trum pet, leapt forth to the riuer, &amp; begining with a mightie blast to sound the battaile, kept on his pace to the very bancke, on the otherside. Then CEASAR, Let vs march on quoth he &amp; goe whither the toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Gods &amp; the iniurious dealings of our enemies call vs. The dice be throwne: I haue set vp my rest. Come what will of it.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing conueyed his armie ouer the riuer, he ioyned with the Tribunes of the commons, who vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their expulsion out of the Citie were come vnto him, &amp; in a ful &amp; freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie, with shedding teares &amp; re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t down the brest, besought<note place="margin">3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

who might better see than heare him speak, took that for spoken which they imagined by bare sight, and so the speech went for currant, That hee promised them the dignity of wearing the ring (of gold) together with 400000 (sesterces.)</p>

Having atchieved the victory, he graunted the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">A. V.

            </p>
            <p>IN all the civill warres, hee sustained no losse or overthrow but by his owne<note place="margin">36</note> Lieutenants: of whom, C. CVRIO was slaine in <hi>Affrick:</hi> C. ANTONIVS yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>HAVING finished all his warres, he rode in 5. triumphs: to wit, when he had<note place="margin">37</note> vanquished SCIPIO, 4. times in one and the same moneth, but certaine daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene:<note place="margin">A.

In the election of Magistrates he parted with the people thus farre forth; as (excepting the Competitours of the Consulship) for all the number besides of Candidates, the one halfe should be declared those whom the People were disposed to propound, the other halfe, such as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would nominate.

               </note> of those who had been proscript and outlawed. He reduced all Iudgements unto two sorts of Iudges, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Knights degree and the Senatours: As for the Tribunes of the Treasurie or cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Citie, which had been the third, he utterly<note n="*" place="margin">Disabled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for being Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> abolished. The generall survay and numbering of the people he held, neither after the accustomed (<hi>d</hi>) manner, nor in the usuall place, but streete by streete, and that by the<note n="*" place="margin">As who best knew the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their tennants and inhabitants in their houses.</note> Land-lords &amp; owners of messuages and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements standing together: and whereas 3020000 Citizens (<hi>e</hi>) received allowance of corne from the State, he brought and reduced them to the number of one hundred &amp; fiftie thousand. And to the end that no new conventicles &amp; riots at any time might arise about this review, he ordained, That every yeare, in the place of those that were deceased, the Pretour should make a new supply and choise by casting lots, out of such as had not beene reckoned and enrolled in the former survey.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, when as to the number of 80000. (Romaine) Citizens were bestowed<note place="margin">42</note> in sundry Colonies beyond the Sea; hee made a Law for the more frequent inhabiting of the Citie (of <hi>Rome</hi>) thus exhausted and dispeopled; That no Citizen above 20. yeares of age, and under 40. (unlesse he were a sworne (<hi>f</hi>) souldiour to the State, and so bound by his oath) should remaine out of <hi>Italie</hi> above 3. yeares together: Item, That no Senatours sonne, except hee lodged within the house or Pavilion, or belonged to the (<hi>g</hi>) familiar triall of a chiefe Magistrate, should travaile (forth of <hi>Italie.</hi>) Item, That no Grasiars should keep and reteine fewer than a third part of free borne young men, among the keepers of their cattell. All professours of physick at <hi>Rome,</hi> and teachers of the liberall Arts, he enfranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Citizens: that both they themselves might more willingly dwell in the Citie, &amp; others beside desire there to inhabite. As touching money lent out; when he had quite put down the expectation of (<hi>h</hi>) cancelling debts, (at thing that was often <note n="*" place="margin">Either by the Tribunes of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, or the debters themselves.</note>moved) hee decreed at length; That all debtours should satisfie their Creditours in this manner: Namely by an estimate made of their possessions, according to the worth and value as they purchased them before the civill warre, deducting out of the principall whatsoever had beene paide or set downe in the Obligations for the use: by which condition, the third part wel-neare of the money credited forth, was lost. All the Societies and Colledges, saving those that were of auncient foundation, he dissolved. The penalties of hainous crimes he augmented: And whereas the rich &amp; wealthier sort fell to wickednes so much the sooner, because they went<note n="*" place="margin">In the free State before the Emperors, Citizens of Rome might depart before sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, &amp; so avoid with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>HE ministred Iustice and decided matters in Law, most painfully and with passing great<note place="margin">43</note> severitie. Such as were attaint and convict of (<hi>a</hi>) extortion, hee removed even from their Senatours place and degree. He brake the mariage of a man that had beene Pretour, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a wife presently after two daies that she was divorced and went from a former hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, albeit there was no suspition at all of adulterie and naughtinesse. Hee ordained cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and imposts of forraine merchandize. The use of Licters, likewise the wearing of purple<note n="*" place="margin">Or scarlet in graine.</note> cloathes and of pearle he tooke away, saving onely in certaine persons and ages, and upon special daies. The Law <hi>Sumptuaria,</hi> (<hi>b</hi>) to represse excessive cost in fare, he executed most of any other: And for this purpose, he set certaine Watchmen and Warders in sundry places about the shambles and markets where victuals were sold, to lay hold upon all cates and viands contrarie to the prescript rule of the Law in that behalfe, and to bring the same unto him. Otherwhiles also, he sent secretly his owne Officers &amp; Souldiours, to fetch away such meates our of the very dining Parlors and banquetting roomes, even when they were set upon the bord, if happily they had any way escaped the hands of the foresaid warders.</p>
            <p>FOR, as concerning his purpose to adorne and beautifie the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> with gallant<note place="margin">44</note> works, as also to maintaine &amp; amplifie the Empire, hee had more matters in his head and greater every day than other. Principally his intent and meaning was, to build so stately a temple in the honour of <hi>Mars,</hi> as the like was no where to be seene; having filled up and laid levell that huge pit, wherin he had exhibited the shew of a Naval battel: &amp; also to erect

Item, to erect publiquely the greatest Libraries that he could, as wel of Greeke as Latine Authors: committing unto (<hi>a</hi>) M. VARRO the charge, both to provide the said books, and also to digest &amp; place them in order. Item to lay the Meeres &amp; Fennie Plashes POMPTINAE drie: to draw &amp; let forth the lake <hi>Fucinus:</hi> to make a cawsie or high-way, from the Adriatick Sea, by the ridge or side of the Apennine hill, as farre as to the river <hi>Tibris,</hi> &amp; to digge through the (<hi>b</hi>) <hi>Isthmus.</hi> Moreover, to bridle the Dakes who had invaded <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Thracia:</hi> and soone after, to make warre upon the Parthians by the way of <hi>Armenia</hi> the lesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not to give them battell before he had made (<hi>c</hi>) triall of them.

Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, finding by experience, that the deformity of his bald head was oftentimes subject to the scoffes and scornes of back-biters and slaunderers, hee tooke the same exceedingly to the heart: and therefore he both had usually drawne downe his haire that grew but thin, from the crowne toward his forehead: and also of all honours decreed unto him from the Senate and People, he neither received nor used any more willingly, than the priviledge to weare continually the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Lawrel guirland.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3392:36"/>
and CASSIUS the third against L. ANTONIUS brother to the <hi>Triumvir,</hi> the 4. against Sex. POMPEIUS, Cn. POMPEIUS his sonne. Of all these warres he tooke the occasion and quarrell from hence, namely, reputing and iudging in his mind nothing more meet and conuenient than the revenge of his unkles death and the maintenance of his acts and proceedinges.</p>
            <p>No sooner was he returned from <hi>Apollonia,</hi> but he purposed to set upon BRV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS and CASSIUS at unwares: and (because upon foresight of daunger they<note place="margin">10</note> were fled secretly out of the way) to take the course of law, and in their absence<note place="margin">A, V, C 710<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> to endite them of murder. As for the Plaies and games for CEASARS victory because they durst not exhibit them, whose lot and office it was so to do, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe set them forth. And to the end that he might go through all other matters also more resolutely; he professed himselfe to labour for the <note n="*" place="margin">Of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> Tribuneship in the rowme of one who fortuned to die: albeit he was one of the Nobility, though not of the Senate. But seeing that M.

                  </gap> Antonius.</note> he endevored all that he could by force of armes to expell DECIMUS BRVTUS besieged at <hi>Mutina,</hi> out of that province which by CEASAR was granted and by the Senate confirmed unto him. And thereupon by the aduice and perswasion of some he set certaine persons priuily in hand to murder ANTONIUS; which perilous practise of his being detected and fearing still the like danger to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he waged the old soldiers with as beautiful a larges as possiblie he could,<note place="margin">A. V. C. 711.</note> for the defence as well of his owne person as of the state. And being appointed to lead this armie thus levied, in qualitie of propretour &amp; together with HIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS and PANSA, who had entred upon the Consulship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to aide D. BRVTUS, he made an end of this warre committed unto him within three moneths, in two fought fieldes. In the former of which, ANTONIE writeth that he fled, and without coat armour or horse appeared at length after two dayes and shewed himselfe. But in the battaile next following, well knowne it is, that he performed the part not onely of a Captaine but also of a soldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the very heat and midst of the medly, by occasion that the Standerd bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his owne Legion was grievously hurt, he supported the Aegle with his owne shoulders <note n="*" place="margin">As mass<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>During this warre, when HIRTIUS had lost his life in the conflict, and<note place="margin">11</note> PANSA soone after of his wound, it was bruited rifely abroad, that both of them were by his meanes slaine: to the ende that having defaited ANTONIUS, and the Common-wealth beeing bereift of both Consuls, he alone might seize uppon the victorious armies. And verily the death of PANSA was so deepely suspected that GLYCO the Physitian was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ward and durance, as if he had put poyson into his wound. AQVIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIUS NIGER addeth moreover and saith, that the one of the Consuls, to wit, HIRTIUS, was in the verie confused medly of the battaile killed by AVGUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS himselfe.</p>

            <p>Being entred into Societie with ANTONIE and LEPIDVS, hee finished<note place="margin">13</note> the Philippian warre also, (although he was but weake and sickely,) and that<note place="margin">A.

Whereuppon the rest, &amp; amongst them M FAVONIUS that worthie follower of CATO, when they were brought forth with their yrons and chaynes to execution, after they had in honorable termes saluted ANTONIUS by the name of<note n="*" place="margin">Soveraine commander</note> Emperour, openly reviled and let flie at him most foule and rayling words. Hauing parted betweene them their charges &amp; offices after this victorie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ANTONIUS undertook to settle the <hi>East</hi> in good order, and himselfe to bring the olde Soldiers backe into <hi>Italie,</hi> &amp; to placethem there, in the lands &amp; teritories belonging to the free <hi>Townes</hi> and <hi>Burowghes,</hi> he kept himselfe in favour neither with the said old soldiers, nor the former posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of those lands: whilest the one sort complained, that they were disseized: and the other, that they were not well entreated according to their hope, for so good deserts.</p>
            <p>At which verie time, he forced L.

thereupon a rumor was carried and spred by his malicious ill willers and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, as if presently after torture he had put the same soldier to death.

For, whereas they were exorable and would bee oftentimes intreated by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and prayer, to respect the persons of many; hee alone was very carnest, that none might bee spared: among the rest, hee proscribed C. TORANIVS also, his owne <hi>Tutour</hi> and guardian, yea and the companion in the Office of Aedileship with his father OCTAVIVS. IVNIVS SATVRNINVS writeth moreover, that after the proscription was ended, when M. LEPIDVS had in the Senate-house excused all that was past and given good hope of clemencie for the time to come, because there had beene execution enough done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: he on the contrarie side professed openly, That hee had determined no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the saide proscription, but that hee might have liberty still to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in all things as he would. Howbeit, in testimonie of repentance for this rigour and obstinacie of his, hee honoured afterward with the dignitie of Knighthood <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Vinius,</hi> for so was his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone named.</note> T. IVNIVS PHILOPAEMEN, for that hee was reputed to have in times past hid his owne Patron, that was proscribed. In the same <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate,</hi> hee incurred many waies the ill will and heart-burning of the people: for he commaunded that PINARIVS a Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> (what time as he himselfe made a publike speech in an assembly whereunto hee had admitted a multitude of Paganes, that is to say, such as were no souldiours, and espied him there to take notes of something that he delivered before the souldiours, supposing him to be over busie and a spie,) should be stabbed to death even in his sight: yea, and hee terrified TEDIVS AFER, Consull elect, (because hee had maliciously in some spitefull termes depraved something that he had done) with so great menaces, that in a melancholy hee cast himselfe headlong and brake his owne necke. Likewise, as Q. GALLIVS the Pretour held under his robe a paire of duple writing tables, when hee came of course to doe his duty and salute him; he suspecting, that he had a (short) sword hidden underneath, and not daring straight-waies to search him farther, for feare something else than a sworde should bee found about him; within a little while after cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be haled out of the Tribunall seate of Iudgement, by the handes of certaine Centurions of Souldiours, and put to torture like a bondslave; yea &amp; seeing he would confesse nothing, commanded him to be killed; having first

with his owne hands plucked his eies out of his head. Howbeit AVGVSTVS writeth, that the said GALLIVS by pretending to parle secretly with him, laid waite for his life; whereupon hee committed him to prison, and afterwards dismissed and enlarged him onely to dwell in <hi>Rome:</hi> and that in the end hee pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished either by shipwracke, or else by the hands of theeves who forlayed him.

For the Citie beeing not adourned according to the maiestie of such an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Subiect to the casualties of Deluges and fires, hee beautified and set out so, as iustly he made his boast, that where he found it built of bricke, hee left it all of marble. And for the safety therereof, hee performed as much for future posterity as could be fore-seene and provided for by mans wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p n="29">29 Publike works he built very many whereof the chiefe and principal was his <hi>Forum or stately Hall of Iustice,</hi> together with the temple of MARS the <hi>Revenger: The temple of</hi> APOLLO <hi>in</hi> Palatinus; <hi>The te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple likewise of</hi> IUPITER <hi>the Thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> in the Capitol. The reason why he built the said <hi>Foru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> was the multitude of men &amp; their suites: which because, (<hi>a</hi>) ij. would not suffice, seemed to have need of a third also. And therfore with great speed erected it was for that publike use, even before the temple of MARS was finished. And expresly provided it was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3392:41"/>
by law, that in it publike causes should be determined apart, and choosing of Iudges (or Iuries) by it selfe. The temple of <hi>Mars</hi> hee had vowed unto him, in the Philippian warre which hee tooke in hand for the revenge of his fathers death. He ordained therefore by an Act, that heere the Senate should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with, as touching warres &amp; triumphs: that from hence those Pretours or Governours who were to goe into their provinces should be honorably atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; brought onward on their way: and that hither they should bring the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes and ornaments of triumph, who returned with victorie. The temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> he reared in that part of the <hi>Palatine house,</hi> which being smitten with lightning was by that <hi>God</hi> required, as the Soothsayets out of their learning had pronounced: hereto was adioyned a gallerie, with a librarie of Latine and Greeke bookes. In which temple, he was wont in his old age both to sit often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in counsaile with the Senate, and also to over-see &amp; review the <hi>Decuries</hi> of the Iudges. He consecrated the temple vnto IVPITER the <hi>Thunderer,</hi> upon occasion that he escaped a daunger, what time as in his <hi>Cantabrian</hi> expedition, as he travailed by night, a flash of lightning glaunced upon his licter, &amp; <hi>strucke his seruant stone dead,</hi> that went with a light before.

LEPIDVS was once dead, which he never could finde in his heart to take from him whiles he lived: what bookes soever of prophesies &amp; destinies went com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abroad in Greeke and Latine, either without authors, or such as were not authenticall and of credite, he caused to be called in from all places, to the number of 2000 &amp; aboue: and when he had burnt them, he reteined those only of <hi>Sibyls</hi> prophesies. And even of those also he made some special choice: and bestowed them close in two litle Desks or coffers under the base &amp; piedstoole of APOLLO PALATINVS. The yeeres revolution reduced as it was into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by IVLIVS of sacred memory, but afterwards through negligence troubled and confused, he brought againe to the former calculation. In the dispose whereof, he called the moneth Sextilis (rather than September wherin he was borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) by his owne name, because in it there befell unto him both his first Consulship &amp; also notable victories. Of all the Religious &amp; priests, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the vestall virgins he augmented the number, the dignity and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities also. And whereas in the rowme of any vestall Nun deceased, there must another of necessity be chosen &amp; také, he perceiving many to make suite that they might not put their daughters to the lottery; protested and bound it with an oath, that if any one of his owne Nieces or daughters daughters were of competent age he would present her to the place. Divers auncient ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies also which by little &amp; little were disused and abolished, he restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as namely the (<hi>a</hi>) <hi>Augurie</hi> of SALVS, the <hi>Flaminship</hi> of IVPITER, the <hi>sacred Lupercal,</hi> the (<hi>b</hi>) <hi>Saecular</hi> playes and the <hi>Compitalitij.</hi> At the <hi>Lupercall</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, he commanded that no beardlesse boyes should runne. Likewise, at the Secular playes, he forbad young folke of both sexes, to frequent any shew exhibited by night; unlesse it were in the company of some auncient person of their kindred. The <hi>Tutelare</hi> Images of crosse-wayes called <hi>Lares Compitales</hi> he was the first that ordained to adorne twice in the yeere with flowers of the spring &amp; sommer seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The principal honour next unto the immortall gods, he performed to the memoriall of those worthy Captaines, who had raised the <hi>Romaine</hi> onpire from a small thing to so high and glorious a state. And therefore both the works &amp; monuments of every of them he repaired &amp; made againe, reserving their titles and inscriptions still; and all their Statues also in triumphant forme and shape he dedicated in both the Porches or galleries of his <hi>Hall</hi> of <hi>Iustice.</hi> And in a publick edict he professed thus much, That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised it to this end, That <hi>both himselfe whil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

gave lesse than he promised: that the summe which he had appointed, might hould out and be sufficient. When upon a time, there was great barrainnesse and scarcitie of corne, being put to an hard exigent and to seeke a difficult re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, in so much as he was driven to expell out of the Cittie, all the sort of young slaves pampered aud trimmed up for sale, as also whole scholes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Novice-fencers and sword players: all strangers and forainers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Physitians and scholemaisters: yea and some of the ordinarie houshold seruants: so soone as the market began to mend, and victuals grew plentifull, he writeth, <hi>That it tooke him in the head to abolish those publike doles of Corne for euer: because upon the trust and confidence of them, tillage was cleane laid downe.</hi> Howbeit he continued not in that mind long, as being assured, that the same doles might be set up againe one time or other by the ambitious humour (of Princes his successors.)

His mother he buried during the time of his first Consulship, and his sister OCTAVIA in the 54 yeere of his age.

            <p>Vpon SCRIBONIA he begat IVLIA By LIVIA he had no issue, although<note place="margin">63</note> full faine he would.

For the better effecting whereof, and because hee would not in any place trouble and stay reader or hearer, hee stucke not either to put Prepositions unto Verbes, or to iterate Coniunctions very oft: which being taken away breed some obscurity, although they yeeld a greater grace.

AREUS the Philosopher and his two sonnes, DRONYSIUS and NICANOR: yet so, as for all that he neither could speake readily, nor durst compose any<note n="*" place="margin">In Greeke:</note> thing. For if occasion required ought, he drew it in Latine, and gave it unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for to be translated into Greeke. And, as he was not altogether unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Poemes, so he tooke delight even in the (<hi>b</hi>) olde Comoedie also, which he exhibited oftentimes to be acted in publique solemnities. In reading over and perusing Authors of both Languages, hee sought after nothing so much as holsome precepts and examples, serving to publique or private use: and those, when he had gathered out of them word for word, hee sent either to his inward friends and domesticall Servitours, or to the Commaunders of armies and Governours of Provinces: or else for the most part to the Magistrates of the Citie, according as any of them needed admonition. Moreover, whole bookes he both read from one end to the other unto the Senate, and also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished oftentimes to the people by proclamation: as namely, the Orations of Q. (<hi>c</hi>) METELLUS touching the propagation and multiplying of children: those likewise of RUTILIUS concerning the model<note n="*" place="margin">As wel to cut of the expenses of sumpteous aed fices as to prevent danger by Skare-fires.</note> and forme of buildings: thereby the rather to perswade them, <hi>That hee was not the first that lookt into both these matters, but that their fore-fathers in old time had even then a care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereof.</hi> The fine wits flourishing in his daies he cherished by all meanes possible. Such as rehearsed before him their Compositions he gave audience unto, courteously and with patience: notonely verses and histories, but<note n="*" place="margin">Which were not so usually red and reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in open au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also and dialogues. Mary, if anything were written of himselfe, unlesse it were done with serious gravity and by the best, hee tooke offence thereat; and gave the Praetours in charge not to suffer his name to be made vulgar and stale, in the trivial contentions (of Oratours, Poets, &amp;c) when they were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched one with another.</p>
            <p>For Religious scrupulosity and Superstition, thus by heere-say hee stoode<note place="margin">90</note> affected. Thunder and Lightning hee was much affraide of: in so much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and in every place, hee caried about him for a preservative remedie a<note n="*" place="margin">Or of a sea calfe, wich as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth checketh all lightnings:</note> Seales skinne: yea, and whensoever he suspected there would be any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie storme or tempest, he would retire himselfe into a close secret roome under (<hi>a</hi>) ground, and vaulted above head: Which hee did, because once in times past, he had beene frighted with a flash of lightning, crossing him in his iourney by night; as we have before related.</p>

            <p>Certaine foretokens and ominous signes he observed as unfallible presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<note place="margin">92</note> to wit, if in a morning his shoes were put one wronge, and namely, the left for the right, he held it unluckie: Againe, when hee was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long journey by land or sea, if it chanced to mizzle of raine, hee tooke that for a luckie signe betokening a speedie and prosperous returne. But moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he was especially with uncouth and supernaturall sights. There happened a date tree to spring forth betweene the very joincts of the stones before his dore, which he remooved and transplanted in the inward court of his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall<note n="*" place="margin">Wherin they stood,</note> Gods; taking great care that it might get roote and grow there. Hee joied so much that in the Iland <hi>Capreae,</hi> the boughes of a very old holmetree hanging and drouping now for age down to the ground, became fresh againe at his comming thither, that he would needes make an exchang with the State of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in liev of that Iland geve them AENARIA.

            <p>Of foraine ceremonies and religions, as hee entertained with all reverence<note place="margin">93</note> those that were auncient, and whereof hee conceived good reason: so hee despised the rest.

away to prison. After this, he had certaine intelligence given him that IVLIA his wife was convict and condemned for her incontinencie and adulteries; also that in his name (by a warrant directed from AVGVSTVS) she had a bill of divorse sent unto her. And albeit, he was glad of these tidings, yet he thought it his part, as much as lay in him, by many letters to reconcile the father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his daughter: yea and how ever she had deserved badly at his hands, yet to suffer her for to have whatsoever he had at any time given unto her in free gift. Now, after he had passed through the time of his Tribunes authoritie, and<note place="margin">A. V.

I wote well, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received and beleeved, that when TIBERIUS after private conference was gone forth, these words of AUGUSTUS were over heard by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaines. <hi>Miserum populum Romanum qui sub tam lentis maxillis erit. Ounhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie people of Rome, that shall be under such a slow</hi> (<hi>a</hi>) <hi>paire of chawes.</hi> Neither am I ignorant of this also, that some have written and reported of AUGUSTUS, How openly and in plaine termes without dissimuling, hee disliked his churlish behaviour and harshnesse of manners so much, as divers times being in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant discourse and mery talke, he would breake-of when TIBERIUS came in place: Howbeit, overcome by his wives intreaty and earnest praier he refused not to adopt him; or rather was induced so to doe, upon an ambitious humor and conceite of his owne, that leaving such a successour, himselfe might ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day be more missed and wished for againe. Yet cannot I be perswaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, but to thinke, that AUGUSTUS a right circumspect, considerate and prudent Prince did nothing, especially in so weighty a businesse, hand over head and without advise: but having duly weighed the vices and vertues of TIBERIUS, esteemed his vertues of more worth: and namely seeing that both he sware solemnly in a generall assembly of the people, <hi>That hee adopted him for the</hi> (<hi>b</hi>) <hi>good of the Common-weale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and also commendeth him in certaine Epistles for a most expert and martiall warriour, yea the onely Defender and Protectour of the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Out of which, I have thought good to quote some places heere and there for example. <hi>Farewell most sweet</hi> TIBERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US, <hi>and God blesse your conduct and proceeding, warring as you doe for mee and the Muses.</hi> Againe, <hi>O most pleasant, and (as I desire to bee happy) right valiant man,</hi>

               </note>, whereby hee was commaunded to doe the deede. This writ, whether AUGUSTUS left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him when hee died, thereby to take away all matter that might minister tumult after his death: or whether LIVIA in the name of AUGUSTUS endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and that with the privity of TIBERIUS, or without his knowledge, it resteth doubtfull. Certaine it is, that when the saide Tribune brought him word, that the thing was dispatched which he had commaunded, he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, <hi>That he gave no such commaundement,</hi> and added moreover, <hi>That he should answere it before the Senate:</hi> Declining no doubt the envie and hard conceit of men for the present: for within a while after he buried the matter in silence.</p>
            <p>Having nowe assembled the Senate by vertue and authority (<hi>a</hi>) of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buneship,<note place="margin">23</note> and begun to make a <note n="*" place="margin">Which hee had penned.</note> speech unto them by way of <note n="*" place="margin">For the death of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
               </note> Consolation: all on a suddaine, as unable to maister his griefe, he fell into a fit of sighing and groaning. Yea he wished, <hi>That not onely his voice, but his vitall breath also might faile him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and therewith gave the booke unto his sonne DRUSUS to read it out. After this, when the last will or testament of AUGUSTUS was brought in, and none of the witnesses admitted to come in place, but those onely who were of Senatours degree, the rest standing without the <hi>Curia</hi> &amp; there acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their hands and seales, hee caused it to be read and pronounced by his freed man. The will began in this manner. <hi>For as much as sinister fortune hath bereft me of</hi> CAIUS <hi>and</hi> LUCIUS, <hi>my sonnes, I will that</hi> TIBERIUS CAESAR <hi>be mine heire, in the one moity and a sixth part.</hi> By which very beginning, their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition<note place="margin">* That is to say, in 8 parts of twelve, or 2 third parts</note> was augmented who thought thus, that seeing he forbare not after this sort to make his preface, hee ordained TIBERIUS to be his successour upon necessity, rather than any iudgement and discretion.</p>
            <p>Albeit hee made no doubt to enter upon his imperiall government imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly<note place="margin">24</note> and to menage the same, and that by taking unto him a strong guard of Souldiours about his person, that is to say maine force &amp; the very forme of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute rule &amp; dominion: yet notwithstanding, he refused it a long time: &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a most impudent &amp; shamlesse mind, one while he seemed to rebuke his friends that encouraged him thereto, as those who knew not, <hi>what a monstrous and untamed beast an Empire was:</hi> and otherwhiles with ambiguous answeres

and crafty delaies holding the Senate in suspence when they besought him to take it upon him, yea and humbly debased themselves before his knees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much as some of them having their patience moved therewith, could endure him no longer: and one among the rest in that tumult cried aloude, <hi>Let him either doe it at once, or else give over quite:</hi> and another openly to his face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him in these words, <hi>Whereas other men be slacke in doing and performing that which they have promised, he was slacke in promising that which hee did and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> In the end, as if forsooth he had beene compelled, and complaining withall, that there was imposed upon his shoulders a miserable and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some servitude, he tooke the Empire upon him: and yet no otherwise, than gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hope, that one day he would resigne it up. His very words are these, <hi>Vntill I come unto that time, wherein yee may thinke it meete to give some rest unto mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged yeeres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cause of this holding of &amp; delay that he made, was the feare of imminent<note place="margin">25</note> dangers on every side, in so much as he would often say, <hi>Hee held a Woolfe by the eares.</hi> For there was one of AGRIPPAES slaves named CLEMENS, who had levied &amp; gathered together no small power, for to revenge his Maisters death: and L. SCRIBONIUS LIBO, a noble man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> secretly complotted sedition and rebellion: yea, and a two-fold mutinie of the Souldiours arose, in <hi>Illyricum</hi> and in <hi>Germanie.</hi> Both the armies called hard upon him for performance of many matters extraordinarily: but above all, that they might have equall pay with the (<hi>a</hi>) Pretorian souldiours. And as for the (<hi>b</hi>) Germanician souldiours, they verily refused him for their Prince and Soveraigne, as not by them ordained: and with all their might and maine urged GIRMANICUS, who then was their Generall to take upon him the government of the State, albeit he withstood &amp; denied them stoutly, Fearing therefore the issue and danger of this occurrent most of all, he required for himselfe to have that part of the Common-weale in charge, which it should please the Senate to lay upon him: seeing that no man was sufficient to weld the whole, unlesse he had another or many assistants ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ioyned with him. Hee feigned himselfe also to be sickly, to the end that GERMANICUS might with the better will and more patience abide in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance either of speedy succession after him, or at least waies of fellowship in the Empire with him. Well, after hee had appeased those mutinies, CLEMENS likewise by a fraudulent wile he over-raught, and brought to his devotion. As for LIBO, because he would not be thought at his entrance newly into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for to proceede rigorously, two yeeres after and not before he charged &amp; reproved him before the Senate, contenting himselfe all that meane space to beware of him onely, and to stand upon his guard. For, as the said LIBO was together with him among other Pontifies sacrificing, hee tooke order, that in steed of the (yron) cleaver, there should be closely laid for him a chopping knife of Lead: And when the same LIBO requested upon a time to have secret talke and conference with him, he would not graunt it, without his sonne DRUSUS might be by: and so long as he walked up &amp; downe with LIBO, he seemed to leane upon his hand; and so, held it sure enough all the while untill their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was ended.</p>

Besides, as well knowne it is, that certaine Princes and Potentates of <hi>Gaule, Spaine, Syria</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> forfaited their estates upon so slight a slaunder and impudent imputation, that against some of them nought else was obiected but this, That they had part of their substance and wealth <note n="*" place="margin">more than by law they might</note> lying in money: yea and that many Cities and private persons lost their auncient immunities and priviledges, as also their right in mines and mettals, Tolls and customes: and finally that VONONES a King of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians who beeing driven out of his kingdome by his owne subiects, retired himselfe with an huge masse of Treasure into <hi>Antiochia,</hi> under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it were, of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> was perfidiously stript out of all and killed.</p>
            <p>The hatred that hee bare to his kinsfolke and neere Allies, hee bewraied,<note place="margin">50</note> first in his brother DRUSUS by disclosing a letter of his: wherein hee dealt with him about compelling AUGUSTUS to restore the common Libertie: afterwardes, in others also. As for his wife IULIA, so farre was he from shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any courtesie or kindnesse unto her when she stoode confined (which had beene the least matter of a thousand) that whereas by an Ordinance of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, shee was shut up within one Towne, hee gave straight order that shee should not steppe out of dores, and enioy the Societie of people and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie commerce: nay, hee proceeded so farre, as to bereave her of that little stocke and housholde-stuffe which her Father allowed her: yea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded her of the yeerely Pension and exhibition for her maintenaunce:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3392:71"/>
and all, forsooth, under a colour of common right and law; because AUGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STUS in his last will and testament had not expresly provided in this behalfe. Being notable well to endure his mother LIVIA, as chalenging to her selfe equall part with him in power and authority, hee avoided both to keepe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and daily company, and also to entertaine long speech or secret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with her; because hee might not be thought ruled and directed by her counsailes; which otherwhiles notwithstanding he was wont both to stand in neede of, and also to use. Semblably, he tooke to the very heart the passing of this Act in the Senate, <hi>That in his stile as he had the title, sonne of</hi> AUGUSTUS, <hi>so this addition should runne withall sonne of</hi> LIVIA. And therefore it was, that he would not suffer her to be named <note n="*" place="margin">Mother of her Country.</note> PARENS PATRIAE, nor to receive any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable honour in open place and by publique decree. Oftentimes also he admonished her to forbeare intermedling in greater affaires, and such as were not meet for women; especially after he perceived once, that when the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Vesta</hi> was on fire, she also came thither in person among others, &amp; there encouraged the people and souldiours both, to doe their best and help all what they could, as her manner was to doe in her husbands dayes.</p>
            <p>By these degrees he proceeded even to secret rancour &amp; malice against her,<note place="margin">51</note> but chiefly upon this occasion, as men report.

He againe tooke the matter so greevously, that she had both kept those writings so long by her, and also cast them in his dish so spitefully, that some thinke this was the greatest cause of his departure from the Citie. And verily, for the space of three yeeres compleat, during which time hee was absent and his mother living, hee sawe her but once: and that was no more than one day, and very fewe howers of the same. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as little minde hee had to be by her lying sicke: and when shee was dead, suffering her corps by staying so long above ground (whiles men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped still of his comming) to corrupt at length and putrifie: after shee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, he forbad that she should be canonized and registred in the Catalogue of Saints: pretending as if she her selfe had given that order.

            <p>He increased and strained still more and more this crueltie, by occasion that<note place="margin">62</note> he was galled and fretted at the newes of his sonne DRVSVS his death: For, having beene of opinion, that he died upon some sickenes &amp; intemperate life, so soone as he understood at length, that he was poysoned &amp; so made away by the villanous practise of his wife <note n="*" place="margin">Daughter of <hi>Germanicus</hi> &amp; <hi>Agry<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> LIVILLA and SEIANVS together, he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to torment and execute any one whomsoever; so bent and addicted whole daies together to the inquisition and tryall of this onely matter, as that when word came unto him how an host of his an inhabitant of <hi>Rhodes</hi> (whom by familiar letters he had sent for to <hi>Rome</hi>) was come, he commanded him out of hand to be put to <note n="*" place="margin">among other examinates.</note> corture, as if he had beene some neere freinde present at the foresaid examination: but afterwards, when his errour was discovered, and seeing how he had mistaken, he caused him also to be killed. because he should not divulge and make knowne the <note n="*" place="margin">Done vnto him.</note> former injury. The place is yet to bee seene at <hi>Capreae</hi> of his butcherly cariage: From which he caused condemned persons after long and exquisite torments to be flung headlong before his face into the sea: where were readie to receive them a number of mariners, who with their sprits, poles, and oares should beate and batt their carkasses: to the end that none of them might have any breath or wind remaining in the bo die: He had devised moreover, among other kinds of torment, what time as men by deceitfull meanes had their lode with large drinking of strong wine, sodainely to knit fast and tie their privie members with (Lute) strings, that hee might cause them to swell and be pent in most dolorous paines occasioned at once as well by the streight strings, as the suppression and stoppage of vrine. And had it not beene that both death prevented and <note n="*" place="margin">The Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,</note> THRASYLLVS also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him of purpose, (as men say) to put of some designes in hope of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger life, he would haue murdred a good many more (as it is fully beleeved) and not spared those verie nephewes of his that remained yet alive; considering he both had CAIVS in suspition, and also cast of TIBERIVS, as conceived in adulterie. And it soundeth to truth, that he was minded thus to do. For, ever and anon, he called PRIAMVS happie in that he overlived all his sonnes and daughters.</p>

            <p n="65">65 When SEIANVS went about seditiously to worke alteration in the state: albeit he saw now that both his birth day was publikely solemnized, and also his Images of gold worshipped everie where, he overthrew him (I must needs say) at length: but with much adoo, by craftie sleights and guile, rather than by his princely authoritie and Imperiall power. For first, to the end that he might dismisse the man in shew of honour, he assumed him to be his Colleague in the fifth Consulship, which in his <note n="*" place="margin">For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained still at Capreae.</note> long absence he had taken upon him for that verie purpose. Afterwards when he had deceived him with hope of <note n="*" place="margin">To be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with on of his neipces.</note> Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and the Tribunes authoritie, he complained of the man (looking for noe such matter) in a shamefull and pitious Oration: beseeching the LL. of the Senate among other requests. <hi>To send on of the Consuls to conduct him an aged and desolate man with some guarde of soldiour: into their sight.</hi> And yet neverthelesse, distrusting himselfe and fearing an <note n="*" place="margin">Or Epistle rather written unto the Senat.</note> uprore, he had given commandement; that his nephew DRVSVS, whom still he kept in prison at <hi>Rome:</hi> should be set at libertie (if need did so require,) &amp; ordained generall captaine. Yea &amp; whiles his ships were readie rigged and prepared to what Legions soever he ment for to flie, hee stood looking ever and anon from the highest cliffe that was, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the markes and signes, which he had appointed (least messengers might stay too long) for to be reared a great way of: thereby to have intelligence, as any occurrent (good or bad) fell out. Nay, when the conspiracie of SEIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS was now suppressed, he was never the more secure and resolute: but for the space of 9. moneths next ensuing he stirred not out of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Beside all this, diverse and sundrie reprochfull taunts from all parts netled<note place="margin">66</note> and stung his troubled minde. For there was not a person condemned, that reviled him not in all sorts openly to his face, yea and discharged uppon him opptobrious termes by libels laid for the nonce in the verie <note n="*" place="margin">Where the Senatours sat to behold the plaiet.</note> 
               <hi>Orchestra,</hi> with which contumelies verily, affected he was after a most divers and contrarie manner: so that, one while he desired for verie shame of the world, that all such abuses might be unknowne and concealed: otherwhiles, hee contemned the same, and of his owne accorde broached and divulged them abroade. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, rated he was &amp; railed at in the letters also of ARTABANVS K. of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who charged him with parricidies, murders, cowardise and luxurious roiot: who gave him counsell likewise with all speede possible, to satisfie with a voluntarie death the hatred of his Citizens, conceived against him in the highest degree and most iustly. At the last, being even wearie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the beginning of such an Epistle as this, hee declared and confessed in manner the verie summe of all his miseries. <hi>What shall</hi> I <hi>write? my</hi> LL. <hi>of the</hi>

Howbeit, for example sake, provided it would be that the Senate binde not themselues to keepe and ratifie the Actions of any one, who by some chaunce might bee altered.</hi> And againe, <hi>Marie, if at any time, quoth hee, yee shall make doubt of my loyall behaviour and devoted mind unto you (which before it ever happen, I wish my dying day to take me from this minde and opinion of yours, once conceived of me and afterwards chaunged) the bare title of</hi> PATER PATRIAE <hi>will adde no honour unto me, but upbraide you either with inconsiderate rashnesse, for imposing that Surname uppon mee, or else with inconstancie, for your contrary iudgements of mee.</hi>

Of colour and complexion he was cleere and white: wearing the haire of his head longe behind, in so much as it covered his very necke: which was thought in him to be a fashion appropriate to his linage and familie.

All which properties being odious and full of arrogancie, AVGVSTVS both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in him, &amp; also went about to excuse &amp; cloke for him before the Senate and people, assuring them, they were the defects and imperfections of nature, and not the vices of the mind.

            <p>But, as the opinion of the world went, his death contrived by the wicked<note place="margin">2</note> plot of TIBERIUS, was effected by the ministerie and helpe of CN.

            <p>It is for certaine knowne and confessed, that there were in GERMANICUS<note place="margin">3</note> all good parts and gifts as well of body as mind: and those in such measure, as never to any man befell the like: to wit, for shew full of passing beauty, favour and feature; with strength &amp; valour answerable thereto &amp; for wit excellently well seene in eloquence and learning of <note n="*" place="margin">Greeke and Latine,</note> both kinds: The very attractive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, he was of singular <note n="*" place="margin">The good wil and affection of men, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ameng the gifts of fortune</note> benevolence, endowed with a wonderfull grace and effectuall desire to win mens favour and deserve their love.

And among other monuments of his studies he left behind him in Greeke, Comaedies also. Both at home and abroad (<hi>b</hi>) civile he was, in so much as he would goe to free and confederate Cities without any <note n="*" place="margin">Sergeants or officers.</note> Lictors. Where ever he knew any Sepulchers of brave and worthy men to be, there his use was to offer unto their ghosts. Being purposed to enterre in one tombe the olde reliques and bones dispersed of those that were slaine in that great overthrow with VARUS, he first gave the assay with his owne hand to gather and carie them together into one place. Moreover, to his slaunderers and backbiters (if he lighted upon them); of what quality so ever the persons were, or how great cause so ever they gave, so milde, so remisse and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee was: that notwithstanding PISO reversed and canciled his Decrees, plagued and persecuted a long time his Dependants, yet could he not finde in his heart to be angry with him, before he had for certaine knowne, that hee attempted his person with poysons and sorcerous execrations: and even then verily, hee proceeded no farther against him, but, <hi>more maiorum</hi> to renounce all friendshippe with him, and to give his domesticall friendes in charge to bee revenged, if ought happened to himselfe otherwise than well.</p>
            <p>Of these vertues hee reaped most plentifull fruite; so liked and loved of his<note place="margin">4</note> kinsfolke and friendes, (for I let passe all other affinities and acquaintance

As he returned out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> after the suppressing of seditious tumults and mutinies there, all the <hi>Praetorian</hi> cohorts every one went out to encounter him upon the way: albeit warning was given before hand by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>That no more than twayne of them should goe forth.</hi> But as for the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> of all sexes, ages, and degrees, they ran out by heapes to meet him xx miles from <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>How beit, farre greater, and more assured testimonies of mens iudgement<note place="margin">5</note> touching him appeared at, and after his death. The very day wherein he left this life, The <note n="*" place="margin">Or, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gods within the temples.</note> temples (<hi>a</hi>) were pelted with stones: the altars of the Gods cast downe: the Domesticall (<hi>b</hi>) Lares, by some flung out of dores into the street; yea, and new-borne (<hi>c</hi>) babes of wedded parents throwne forth to be destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And, that which more is, the report goeth, That the very Barbarians, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were at variance and civil warre among themselves, yea and had taken armes against us, yet, as it were in some <note n="*" place="margin">Touching them all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly.</note> domesticall and common sorrow, agreed all to make truce and a cessation of armes for a time. Some of their Princes also and Potentates, to declare their extraordinarie mourning and regret, did cut off their owne beards and shaved their wives heads: Yea, the very King (<hi>d</hi>) of Kings himselfe, gave over his exercise of hunting and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Societie of his great Peeres and Princes at his table: which among the Parthians is as much as a (<hi>e</hi>) <note n="*" place="margin">At Rome. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>For the child-birth and deliverie of</hi> AGRIPPINA. But these verses following, divulged soone after that he came to be Emperour, do plainly shew, that borne he was in the very Camp, where the Legions wintered.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>In castris natus patrijs nutritus in armis,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Borne in the Camp, in Fathers warres with souldiours rear'd was he;</l>
               <l>A signe, that then ordain'd he was an Emp'rour for to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I my selfe do find among the Records, that <hi>Antium</hi> was the place of his birth. PLINIE refelleth GETULICUS, as if he made a lie by way of flattery, because to the praise of a young and glorious Prince, hee would fetch some argument &amp; matter even out of a Citie consecrated to HERCULES: and was the bolder, as he saith to abuse the said Lie, for that, indeede, a yeere almost before, GER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANICUS had a sonne borne at <hi>Tibur,</hi> named likewise CAIUS CAESAR: of whose amiable childhood and untimely death we have spoken before. And as to PLINIE himselfe, confuted he is by the Calculation of the times. For, they who have recorded the Acts of AUGUSTUS doe all agree, That GERMANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUS was sent into <hi>Germanie</hi> after the time of his Consulship expired, when as CAIUS was already borne. Neither can the Inscription of the Altar one iote make good his opinion: considering that AGRIPPINA was delivered of daughters twice in that Country. And what child-birth so ever it was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect &amp; difference of sex, called it is <hi>Puerperium:</hi> For that in old time folk used to name little girles also PUERAE, like as little boyes PUELLI. There is besides, an Epistle of AUGUSTUS written, not many moneths before he died unto AGRIPPINA his Niece as touching this CAIUS, (for there was not now living any other Infant of the like name) in these wordes. <hi>I have no longer agoe than yesterday taken order with</hi> TALARIVS <hi>and</hi> ASELLIUS, <hi>that with the leave of God they bring the boy</hi> CAIUS <hi>upon the</hi> 15 <note n="*" place="margin">18 of May.</note> 
               <hi>day before the Calends of Iune.</hi> I send besides with him of mine owne servants a Physician whom GERMANICUS (as I have written unto him) may if he will retaine &amp; keepe with him still. Farewell my AGRIPPINA and endeavour to come well &amp; in health to thy GERMANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUS. It appeareth I suppose sufficiently that CAIUS could not in that place be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3392:79"/>
borne, unto which he was conveied from <hi>Rome</hi> not before he was well-neere two yeares old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as for those verses, these selfe same evidences likewise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite them: and the rather, because they have no Author. We are to follow therefore the onely authority that remaineth, of the Records &amp; publick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: seeing especially that CAIUS evermore preferred <hi>Antium</hi> before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther retiring places, and loved it no otherwise than his native soile: yea, and by report, was fully minded once (upon a tedious wearinesse that he had of <hi>Rome</hi> City), to transferre thither even the very seat and habitation of the Empire.</p>
            <p>He gat his surname CALIGULA by occasion of a merry word taken up in<note place="margin">9</note> the Camp, because he was brought up there in the habit of an ordinarie (<hi>a</hi>) and common souldiour among the rest. With whom, how much besides he was able to doe in love and favour by meanes of his education &amp; daily feeding with them, was most of all knowne; when after the death of AUGUSTUS, he onely (no doubt) with <note n="*" place="margin">He was then but a child, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3 or 4 yeeres old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> his very sight &amp; presence quieted them; what time they were in an uprore &amp; at the very point of furious outrage. For they ceased not to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie, untill they perceived that he was about to be sent out of the way for dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the sedition, and appointed to the next City adioyning. Then and not before, turning to repentance, they staied and held back his coach, and so by prayer averted the displeasure that was toward them.</p>
            <p>He accompanied his Father also in the Expedition into <hi>Syria:</hi> From whence<note place="margin">10</note> being returned, first hee abode in house with his Mother: and after that shee was banished and sent away, hee remained with his great Grandmother LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIA AUGUSTA: whom deceased hee praised in a funerall Oration at the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra,</hi> when hee was as yet but a very youth in his <hi>Praetexta:</hi> and then removed he to his Grandmother ANTONIA. From her in the twentieth yeere of his age hee was sent for to <hi>Capreae</hi> by TIBERIUS, and upon one and the selfe same day, he did on his virile (<hi>a</hi>) gowne and withall cut the first downe of his beard, without any honourable solemnitie, such as his brethren before him had at their Commencements. Heere, notwithstanding hee was tempted by all the deceitfull traines that they could devise, who would have drawne and forced him to quarrels, yet gave hee never any occasion, having rased out and quite forgotten the fall and calamity of his mother, brethren and neere friends, as if nothing had befallen to any of them: passing over all those abuses which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had endured with incredible dissimulation: so obsequious and double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent besides, to his Grandfather and those about him, that of him it was said and not without good cause, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Passienus</hi> was the Author of this Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegm.</note> 
               <hi>A better servant and a worse M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. there never was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit, the cruell disposion and villainous nature of his owne, hee could not even then bridle and hold in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but both at all castigations and punishments<note place="margin">11</note> of such as were delivered over to execution, most willing he was to be present: and also would haunt Tavernes and Brothel-houses, mens wives also suspected for adulterie, going about from place to place disguised under a (<hi>a</hi>) peruke of false haire, and in a side (womans) garment: yea, and most studiously gave his minde to learne the artificiall feate of dauncing and singing upon the Stage. And verily TIBERIUS was well content to winke heere at and suffer all, if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereby his fierce and savage nature might have been mollified and become tractable. Which the old man (as he was a Prince right prudent and one most quick of sent) had foreseene well enough long before: in so much as divers times he gave out &amp; said openly, <hi>That</hi> CAIUS <hi>lived to the destruction of him and</hi>

            <p>Not long after, he took to wife IVNIA <note n="*" place="margin">For <hi>Claudiae:</hi> as <hi>Lirilla</hi> for <hi>Liria,</hi> after his ordinary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to name women <hi>

And then, being nominated to succeede<note place="margin">12</note> AUGUR in the roume of his brother DRVSVS, before his inuesture &amp; instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation therein, he was aduanced to the sacerdotall dignitie of a <hi>Pontifie;</hi> a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble testimonie of his pietie, and towardnesse, when as <hi>The royall line and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court beeing desolate and destitute of all other</hi>

he passed over by the water but to the next Ilands of <hi>Campania,</hi> vowes were made for his safe returne: and no man there was who did let slip the least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion offred, to testifie what pensive care he tooke, as touching his health and safetie.

To this surpassing love of his owne Citizens and Countrie men, was adjoyned the notable favour also of foraine states. For, <hi>Artabanns</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> professing alwaies his hatred and contempt of TIBERIVS, sought of his owne accord to him for amitie: yea he came in person to a conference with one of his legates (or Lieutenants) that had beene Consul, and passing over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> adored the <note n="*" place="margin">The maine standards.</note>

            <p>Himselfe also enkindled and set more on fire the affections of men by all<note place="margin">15</note> manner of popularitie.

And therfore he laid foundations of piles where the sea was most raging and deep withal, and hewed rocks of most hard flint &amp; rag: plains also he raised even with mountaines &amp; by digging down hill tops levelled them equall with the plaines: all with incredible celeritie: as punishing those who wrought but slowly even with death.

In it there stood to prostitute themselues, maried wives, youths and springals free borne. Then sent he all about to the frequented places as well markets as Halles of resort, certaine <hi>Nomenclatours,</hi> to inuite and call thither by name, young men and olde, for to fulfill and satisfie their lust. All comers at their entrance payde money (as it were) for usurie and interest. Certaine persons also were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to take note in open sight, of their names, as ofsuch as were good friends increasing the revenewes of CAESAR. And not disdeining so much as the lucre and vantage arising out of hazard and dice play, hee gained the more by cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, lying, yea and forswearing (of gamesters). And upon a time, having put over to his next fellow gamester his owne course, to cast the dice for him in his turne: out he goes into the court-yeard and foregate of the house: where, having espied two wealthy gentlem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>But when he had once a daughter borne, complaining then of his povertie<note place="margin">42</note> and the heavie charges that lay upon him not onely as Emperour, but also as a father, he gently tooke the uoluntarie contributions and benevolence of men toward the finding of the girle her food, as also for her Dowry another day.

Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, so farre was he incensed with the desire of handling money, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would both walke bare-footed up &amp; down, yea &amp; wallow also a good while with his whole body upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> huge heapes of coyned gold peeces, spred here and there in a most large and open place.</p>
            <p>In militarie matters and warlike affaires he never dealt but once: and that<note place="margin">43</note> was not vpon any intended purpose: but what time as he had made a progresse to <hi>Mevania,</hi> for to see the sacred grove &amp; river of <hi>Clitumnus;</hi> being put in mind to supply &amp; make up the number of the <hi>Batauians</hi> whom he had about him for his guard, it tooke him in the head to make an expedition into <hi>Germanie.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deferred he this disignement, but having levied from al parts a power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of legions and auxiliarie forces; and taken musters most rigorously in every quarter, as also raised &amp; gathered together uictuals &amp; provision of al sorts in that quantity, as never any other before him the like, he put himselfe on his journey. Wherein he marched, one while in such hurrie and haste, as that the <hi>Pretorian</hi> cohorts were forced (against the manner and custome) to bestowe their ensignes vpon the sumpter beasts backs &amp; so to follow after: otherwhiles, after such a slow and delicate manner, as that he would be carried in a litter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eight mens shoulders, and exact of the common people inhabiting the neighbour cities adioyning, that the high waies might be swept &amp; watered for the dust, against his comming.</p>
            <p>After that he was arrived once at the campe, to the end that he might shew<note place="margin">44</note> himselfe a sharpe and severe Captaine.

As for the rest, after hee had given them a rebuke for their avarice, he abridged the fees and availes due for

            <p>Soone after, when there failed matter of warre, he commanded a few <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> of the <note n="*" place="margin">

Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was come backe to supper, those who brought him word that the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes were rallied and come forward in safetie, hee exhorted to sit downe to meate armed as they were in their Corselets: yea and aduertised them out of that most vulgar Verse of VIRGIL. <hi>Durarent, Secundisque rebuise serua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent..</hi> i.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>Moreover, amid these affaires, he rebuked most sharply in a proclamation, the Senate and people both, in their absence: For <hi>that whiles</hi> CAESAR <hi>fought bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes and was exposed to so many perils, they could so unseasonably celebrate feastes, haunt also the Cirque, The Theatres, and their retyring places of solace and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>

            <p>Last of all, as if he meant now to make a finall dispatch for ever of the warr<note place="margin">46</note> having embattailed his armie upon the Ocean shore, planted his balists and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engins of Artillerie in their seuerall places, (and no man wist the while or could imagine what he went about) all at once he commanded them to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fish-shels, and therewith to fill their headpeeces and laps, tearming them the spoiles of the Ocean, <hi>due to the Capit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And after hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3392:88"/>
publikely a donative to his Souldiours, even an hundred good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers a peece; as if thereby hee had surmounted all former precedents of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,<note place="margin">* As if with 3 l. 2 S 6 pence, they had beene made for ever.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="47">47 Turning his minde after this to the care of his Triumph, hee selected and set apart for the pompe (over and above the Captives and runnagate Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians) the tallest men of Stature also that were to be found in Gaule: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that (as hee saide himselfe) was <hi>axiothriambentos,</hi> that is, worthy to be seene in a Triumph, yea and some of the Nobles and principall persons of that Nation: Whom hee compelled not onely to colour the haire of their heads yellow like burnished gold, and to weare the same long: but also to learne the Germaines language, and to beare barbarous names. He gave commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement also; that the Gallies with three rankes of Oares, wherein hee had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued and entred the Ocean, should bee convaied to <hi>Rome,</hi> a great part of the way by land. Hee wrote likewise unto his procuratours and Officers, <hi>To provide the furniture of his triumph, with as little cost as might be: but yet the same in as ample manner as never before was the like, seeing they had both might and right to seize all mens goods into their hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="48">48 Before his departure out of that Province, hee intended the execution of an horrible and abhominable designement; even to put to sword those Legions, which long a goe upon the decease of AUGUSTUS, had made a commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: because, forsooth, they had beset both his father GERMANICUS their Captaine, and himselfe also, then an Infant. And being hardly and with much a-doe reclaimed from such a rash and inconsiderate proiect, yet could hee by no meanes be stayed: but stifly persisted in a full minde and will to <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> To kill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tenth man of them:</note> tith them. When hee had summoned them therefore to a publique assembly, unarmed, and without their swords which they had put off and bestowed heere and there, he environed them with his Cavallerie all armed. But seeing once, that many of them suspecting where-about he went, slipped away in sundry places for to resume their weapons if any violence were offred, himselfe abandoned the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly and fled, taking his direct way immediatly to the Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his bitternesse and crueltie upon the Senate: Whom, (to avert from himselfe the odious rumours of so great and shamefull villanies) hee openly threatned; complaining among other matters that he was by them defrauded and put by his iust and due triumph: whereas, himselfe but a little before, had intimated and denounced upon paine of death, that they should not make nor meddle in any matter about his honours.</p>
            <p n="49">49 Being encountred therefore and met upon the way by Embassadours from that most honourable <note n="*" place="margin">Of Senators</note> Order, entreating him to make speed: with a most loud voice, <hi>Come I will,</hi> quoth he, I <hi>will come,</hi> I <hi>say and this with me heere,</hi> beating oft upon the swords <note n="*" place="margin">Or haft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> hilt which he ware by his side. He made it knowne also by an Edict, <hi>That he returned in deede, but it was to them alone who wished it,</hi> namely, <hi>The degree of Gentlemen and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people. For himselfe would be no longer a Citizen or Prince to the Senate.</hi> He commaunded moreover, <hi>That not one of the Senatours</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:3392:89"/>
               <hi>should meete him.</hi> And thus, either omitting quite or putting of his triumph, hee entred the Citie riding ovant, upon his very birth-day: and within foure moneths after came to his end, having attempted and done notable outrages and very great villanies, but plotting still and practising much greater. For hee had purposed to remove his imperiall Court to <hi>Antium,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria:</hi> but having massacred first the most choise and chiefe persons of both <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi> is <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi> in old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts.</hi>
               </note> degrees. And that no man may seeme to doubt heereof, there were in his secret Cabinet found two bookes bearing divers titles. The one had for the Inscription <hi>Gladius. i. the sword:</hi> the other, <hi>Pugio,</hi> that is to say, <hi>the dagger.</hi> They contained both of them the markes and names of such as were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death. There was found besides, a bigge chest full of divers and sundry poisons, which soone after being by CLAUDIUS drowned in the Seas, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and poisoned the same, not without the deadly bane of fishes killed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which the tide cast up to the next shores.</p>
            <p n="50">50 Of Stature hee was very tall, pale and wan-coloured: of body grosse and without all good making: his necke and shanks exceeding slender: his eyes sunke in his head, and his temples hollow, his forehead broad, and the same furrowed and frowning: the haire of his head growing thinne, and none at all about his crowne: in all parts else hairie he was and shagged. It was therefore taken for an hainous and capitall offence, either to looke upon him as he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by from an higher place, or once but to name a Goate upon any occasion whatsoever. His face and visage being naturally sterne and grim, hee made of purpose more crabbed and hideous: composing and dressing it at a looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse, all manner of waies to seeme more terrible and to strike greater feare. He was neither healthfull in body nor stoode sound in minde; Being a child, much troubled with the falling sicknesse. In his youth, patient of labour and travaile: yet so, as that ever and anone upon a suddaine fainting that came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, he was scarce able to goe, to stand, to arise, to recover himselfe and to beare up his head. The infirmitie of his minde, both himselfe perceived, and oftentimes also was minded to goe aside (unto <note n="*" place="margin">An Isle, where grew the best Ellebor, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue meete <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Anticyra</hi>), there to purge his braine throughly. It is for certaine thought, that poysoned he was with a Potion given unto him by his wife CAESONIA: Which in deede was a love <note n="*" place="margin">Or drinke.</note> medicine, but such an one, as crackt his wits and enraged him. He was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled most of all with <note n="*" place="margin">Insomnia</note> want of sleepe; For, he slept not above three houres in a night: and in those verily hee tooke no quiet repose, but fearefull; and ska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with strange illusions and fantasticall imaginations: as who among the rest, dreamed upon a time that hee saw the very forme and resemblance of the sea talking with him. And heereupon for a great part of the night, what with tedious wakefulnesse and wearinesse of lying, one while sitting up in his bed, another while roaming and wandering too and fro in his Galleries (which were of an exceeding length) hee was wont to call upon and looke still for the day-light.</p>
            <p n="51">51 I should not doe amisse, if unto this mindes sicknesse of his I attributed the vices which in one and the same <note n="*" place="margin">Or person</note> subiect were of a most different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: to wit, excessive confidence, and contrariwise, overmuch fearefulnesse.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3392:89"/>
For, hee that set so light by the Gods and despised them as hee did, yet at the least (<hi>a</hi>) thunder and lightning, used to winke close with both eyes, to enwrap also and cover his whole head: but if the same were greater and somewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, to start out of his bed, to creepe and hide himselfe under the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steede. During his peregrination verily and travaile through <hi>Sicilie,</hi> after hee had made but a scorne and mockerie at the miracles and strange fights in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie parts there, he fled suddainly by night from <hi>Messana,</hi> as affrighted with the smoake and rumbling noise of the top of <hi>Aetna.</hi> And hee that against the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians was so full of threats and menaces, when as beyond the river Rhene he rode in a Germaines Chariot betweene the Streights, and the Armie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in thicke squadrons together: by occasion onely that one saide, <hi>There would be no small trouble and hurliburly,</hi> in case the enemie from any place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in sight: forth-with hee mounted on horsebacke and turned hastily to the bridges: but finding them full of Camp-slaves and cariages wherewith they were <note n="*" place="margin">Or guarded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> choaked as one impatient of any delay, he was from hand to hand and over mens heads conveied to the other side of the water. Soone after likewise, hearing of the revolt and rebellion of Germanie, hee provided to flie; and for the better meanes of flight, prepared and rigged shippes: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and staying himselfe upon his onely comfort; That hee should yet have Provinces beyond sea remaining for him, in case the Conquerours following the traine of their victorie, either seized the Hill tops of the Alpes (as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Cimbrians), or possessed themselves of the very Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Senones in times past did. Heereupon I verily beleeve that the murderers of him afterwards devised this shift, namely to hold up his Souldiours with a loude lie when they were in an uprore, and to beare them in hand that hee laide violent hands on himselfe, affrighted at the fearefull newes of the field lost.</p>
            <p n="52">52 As for his apparrell, his shooes and other habite, hee wore them neither after his owne Country-guise, nor in a civile fashion, no nor so much as in manlike manner, nor yet alwaies, I may tell you, sorting with the state and condition of a mortall wight. Beeing clad oftentimes in cloakes of needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke and embroidred with divers colours, and the same set out with pretious stones: in a coate also with long sleeves: and wearing bracelets withall, hee would come abroade into the Citie.

But for the most part he shewed himselfe abroade with a golden (<hi>a</hi>) beard carying in his hand either a (<hi>b</hi>) thunderbolt or a three-tined (<hi>c</hi>) mace, or else a warder<note place="margin">* With three graines like an ele speare;</note> or rod called (<hi>d</hi>) <hi>Caduceus</hi> (the ensignes all and ornaments of the Gods) yea and in the attire and array of VENUS.

            <p>Having once established his Empire, hee thought nothing more deere and<note place="margin">11</note> behovefull than to abolish the remembrance of those two daies, wherein there was some doubtfull question about the change and alteration of the State. Of all deedes and words therefore, which had passed during that time he made an Act there should be a generall pardon and perpetuall oblivion: which also hee made good and performed accordingly. Onely, some few Colonels and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions, out of that crew which conspired against CAIUS, he put to the sword: as well for example sake, as for that he had certaine intelligence, they required to have him also murdered. Then presently turning and bending his minde to the duties of pietie and kindnesse, hee tooke up no forme of oath, either with more devout religion or oftener, than by the name of AUGUSTUS. He gave order, that for his Grandmother LIVIA, there should by Decree be graunted Divine honours; as also in the stately pompe of the Cirque Solemnities, a Chariot drawne with Elephants, like unto that of AUGUSTUS: Semblably, for the soules of his owne parents departed, publick Dirges and Funerall feasts: and more than so, particularly in the honour of his father Cirque-Plaies and games every yeere upon his birth day: and in memoriall of his mother, a coach to be led and drawne along through the Cirque: and the surname of AUGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STA, which by his Grandmother was refused. In remembrance of his <note n="*" place="margin">Germanicus.</note> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to celebrate whose memoriall hee omitted no occasion) hee exhibited a Greeke Comaedie at the solemne Games held in <hi>Naples:</hi> Where by sentence of the Vmpiers and Iudges he received a coronet therefore. Hee suffered not so much as M. ANTONIUS to passe unhonoured, nor without a thankfull mention and remembrance: protesting one time, and that by an Edict, <hi>That so much the more earnest he was, to have men celebrate the Birth day of his father</hi> DRUSUS, <hi>because upon the same day, his Grandfather</hi> ANTONIUS <hi>also was borne.</hi> The Marble Arch, decreed verily in times past by the Senate to be erected for TIBERIUS <note n="*" place="margin">His Vnkle</note> neere unto the Theater of POMPEIUS, but for let, hee finished. And albeit hee abrogated and repealed all the Acts of CAIUS, yet the day of his death, although it were the beginning of his Empire, he forbad to be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred among feasts in the Kalendar.</p>
            <p>But in honouring himselfe he was sparie, and caried a civile modestie.

He restored no banished person, but by the authority and warrant of the Senate.

He made suite unto the Consuls for a licence, to hold Faires and Markets, for his owne private Manors and Lands.

reckon up particularly, every small thing, to wit, his liberalities and gifts revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, his iudgements reversed, his Patents &amp; Writings concerning the graunts of Offices either foisted in or plainly altered and chaunged by them: hee slew his brother (<hi>a</hi>) APPIUS SILANUS: the ij IULIE, the one daughter of <note n="*" place="margin">

To the execution of 35 Senatours, and above an hundred Romaine Gentlemen so easily was hee induced, as that, when the Centurion brought word backe, as touching the death of one who had beene Consull, saying, <hi>That the deede was done which he had commaunded,</hi> he flatly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he gave any such warrant. Neverthelesse the thing he allowed: whiles his freed men afore-said standing by, avouched, <hi>That the Souldiours had done their devoir, in that they ran willingly of their owne heads to revenge their Emperour.</hi> For, it would be thought incredible if I should relate, How even for the very mariage of MESSALLINA with the Adulterer SILIUS: his own self sealed the Writings for assurance of the Dowrie, being perswaded and brought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as though the said wedding was but colourably, of purpose pretended to avert forsooth and translate the danger, that by certaine prodigies were por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hang over his owne head.</p>
            <p n="30">30 Right personable hee was, and caried a presence not without authorite and maiestie, whether he stoode or sate; but especially when he was laid and tooke his repose. For, of stature hee was tall, and nathlesse his body not lanke and slender. His countenance lively, his gray haires beautifull, which became him well, with a good fat and round neck under them. Howbeit, both as he went his hams being feeble failed him: and also whiles he was doing ought, were it re missely or in earnest, many thinges disgraced him: to wit, undecent laughter and unseemely anger, by reason, that hee would froth and slaver at the mouth, and had evermore his nose dropping: Besides, his tongue stutted and stamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: his head likewise at all times, but especially if he did any thing were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little used to shake and tremble very much.</p>
            <p n="31">31 Concerning his bodily health, as before time he used to be grievously sick, so being once Emperour exceeding healthfull he was and stoode cleere of all diseases save onely the paine of the (<hi>a</hi>) stomack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a fit whereof hee saide, hee thought to have killed himselfe.</p>
            <p n="32">32 Hee made feasts, and those very great and ordinarily; yea, and in most open and large places, such as for the most part would receive sixe hundred guests at one sitting. Hee feasted also even upon the Sluce of the Lake <hi>Fucinus:</hi> what time hee had like to have beene drowned, when as the water let out with a forcible violence reflowed backe againe. At everie supper

his manner was to have also his owne children, who together with other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mens children as well boyes as girles, should after the olde manner sit and feede at the tables <note n="*" place="margin">Or at a Settle at the tables end:</note> feete. One of his guests, who was thought to have close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie stollen away a cup of gold the day before, he reinvited against the morrow: and then he let before him a stone <note n="*" place="margin">Or earthen pot.</note> pot to drinke in. It is reported moreover, that he meant to set forth an Edict, wherein he would give folke leave to breake winde downward and let it goe (<hi>a</hi>) even with a crack at the very bourd; having certaine intelligence, that there was one who for manners and modestie sake, by holding it in, endaungered his owne life.</p>
            <p n="33">33 For appetite to meate and drinke his stomacke served him passing well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and in every place. Sitting upon a time iudicially in AUGUSTUS Hall of Iustice, to heare and determine causes, and senting there the steime of a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that was a dressing and serving up for the Priests (<hi>a</hi>) <hi>Salij</hi> in the temple of <note n="*" place="margin">Revenger, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate neere to the Hall: for distinction of another Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, bearing that name, in the Capitoll mount.</note> 
               <hi>Mars</hi> next adioyning, he forsooke the Tribunall, went up to the said Priests, and there sate downe with them to meate. Lightly you should never have him goe out of any dining roome. but with his belly strutting out, well whitled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and drenched with wine: so, as straightwaies, whiles hee layd him downe along upon his backe and tooke a sleepe gaping, there was a feather put ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily into his mouth wide open for to discharge his stomack. Hee tooke very short sleepes: for commonly before midnight hee awaked: yet so, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles he would catch a nap in the day time, as he sat to minister iustice: and scarcely could bee awakened by the Advocates at the barre, who of purpose raised their voices and pleaded the lowder. Hee was excessively given to the wanton love of women. As for the preposterous abuse of malekind, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unacquainted therewith. Hee plaied at dice most earnestly (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Art and skill whereof, he published also a little booke) being wont to plie that game even whiles hee was caried up and downe, having his Carroch and Dice-bourd so fitted, as there might be no confusion nor shuffling at all in play.</p>
            <p>That cruell he was and given to bloudshed naturally, appeared in great and<note place="margin">34</note> very small matters. As for tortures used in examinations, and the punishments that (<hi>a</hi>) PARICIDES suffred, hee exhibited and exacted the same to be done without delay, and openly in his owne presence. Being desirous upon a time to be hold an execution performed after the auncient manner at <hi>Tibur,</hi> when as, (the malefactours standing bound already to a stake), there wanted the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly executioner to doe the feat; he staied there still in the place, and waited untill evening, for one that was sent for out of <hi>Rome.</hi> At all Sword fights, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were set forth by himselfe, or by others, he commaunded as many of the Champions as chaunced onely but to stumble and fall therewith, to have their throats cut: especially the Fencers called <note n="*" place="margin">The adverse faction to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of both their blades, for his owne proper use. Hee tooke such pleasure in those that <note n="*" place="margin">Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats were usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the morning:</note> fought (<hi>b</hi>) with wild beasts, as also in the sword fights ordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noone, that he would by breake of day go downe to the Theater for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

the one: and at noone disinisse the people to their dinners, and sit it out himselfe to see the other: yea, and besides those that were appointed to such combats, upon any slight and suddaine occasion set some to fight for their lives, even out of the number of Carpentars, Servitours, &amp; such like emploied about these games: if happily any of those artificiall (<hi>c</hi>) motions that goe by vices, or a pageant <note n="*" place="margin">Or Pegme</note> in frame, or some such fabrick proved not well. Hee fetcht in also one of his owne <note n="*" place="margin">Prompters of names.</note> Nomenclatours even in his gowne as he went <note n="*" place="margin">With wilde beasts or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</note> to fight for his life.</p>
            <p n="35">35 But it passed, how timorous and diffident hee was. At his first comming to the Empire; (how ever as we said before, he bragged and stoode upon his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and familiar behaviour) he durst not for certaine daies goe to any feast, din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or supper, without Pensionars standing about him with their speares and Iavelins, and his Souldiours waiting at the table: neither visited hee any sicke person, unlesse the bed-chamber where the party lay, were first searched; the beds, bolsters, pillowes, Coverlets and other cloathes were groped, felt, and throughly shaken before hand. All the time after, hee appointed evermore certaine searchers for them all, that came to salute him, sparing not one; and such searchers as were most cruell. For, long it was first, and that with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, ere hee graunted that women, young boyes in their embroidred coates, and maidens, should not bee handled and felt in this manner: that any mans Attendants likewise or Clerks might not have their Pensheathes and Penknife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases (<hi>a</hi>) taken from them. In a civile commotion, when CAMILLUS, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no doubt but that without any warre at all hee might be terrified) willed him in a contumelious, menacing, and malapert letter, to resigne up the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and to leade a quiet life in private estate, hee called his Nobles and chiefe personages about him, to counsell, and put to question, whether it were best to hearken unto him or no?</p>
            <p n="36">36 At the headlesse report and flying newes of some treason that should bee practised against him, he was so affrighted, that hee went about to lay downe his Imperiall dignity. By occasion, that one (as I related before) was taken with a weapon upon him, about his person as hee sacrificed, in all hast he sent out the Bedels and called the Senate together; before whom, with teares and loude out-cries hee bewailed his owne piteous case, as who no where could make account of any safety: and thereupon for a long time forbare to come abroad. His affectionate love also to MESSALLINA, most servant though it were he renounced and cast cleane from her, not so much for any indignity of the dishonourable wrongs she offred unto him, as upon very feare of daunger; as fully perswaded that shee practised to bring the Empire into SILIUS the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers hands. At which time in a great fright he fled in shamefull manner to the camp, asking and enquiring all the way nothing else, but whether the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire remained still safe to his behoofe?</p>
            <p n="37">37 There arose no suspition, there came forth no Author so light and vaine, but gave him a bone to gnaw upon, and put no small toyes in his head: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was forced to beware and seeke revenge. One of those, that had a matter depending in Court before him, taking him a side, when hee came by way of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3392:102"/>
salutation to doe his duty, avowed unto him, that he dreamed, How hee was killed by one. Then within a while after, the same party, (as if he had now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken knowledge who that one was that should murder him) pointed unto his owne adversarie, even as hee tendered a supplication unto CLAUDIUS; and said, This is he. Whereupon immediatly apprehended he was, and haled to execution. After the semblable manner by report, came APPIUS SILANUS to his death. For, when MESSALLINA and NARCISSUS had conspired to worke his overthrow and finall destruction, they complotted thus, that NAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISSUS betimes in a morning before day light rushed like a man amazed and astonied into the bedchamber of his Patrone (CLAUDIUS) relating unto him his dreame, namely that APPIUS had laid violent hands upon him: and MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALLINA for her part, composing and framing her selfe as if shee wondered greatly thereat, reported, <hi>How shee likewise had seene already the same vision for certaine nights together.</hi> And not long after this, word came, (as it was before agreed betweene them) that APPIUS was comming to rush in among them:<note place="margin">* <hi>Narcissas.</hi>
               </note> who in deed had beene bidden the day before to be present at the same instant. Whereupon, as if the said dreame had now proved true and beene plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in effect, order was given for APPIUS, to be endited, arraigned, and to suffer death.

            <p n="38">38 Being privie to himselfe of passionate (<hi>a</hi>) anger &amp; bearing malice, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused them both in an Edict, distinctly promising that the one of them verily should be but short and harmlesse, the other not uniust nor causelesse.

            <p>In his youth, he attempted to write an Historie, exhorted thereto by TITUS<note place="margin">41</note> LIVIUS; and having the help besides of SULPITIUS FLAVUS. And when he put the same first to the triall &amp; iudgement of men in a frequent auditorie, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie &amp; with much a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>do he read it through, being often in the while coldly heard, by an occasion that himselfe gave. For, when, (as hee began his reading) there was set up a laughter, by reason that many of the seates brake with the weight

of a certeine corpulent and fatswad, he was not able to hold, no not after the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>umult appeased, but eftsoones ever and anon call to minde that accident and fall afresh to unmeasurable laughing. During his Empire likewise, hee both wrote much and also rehearsed the same continually by his reader. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his foresayd historie he tooke from the time presently ensuing the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of CAESARDICTATOR: but hee passed over to the latter dayes: and began againe at the civill pacification: perceiving that it was not left in his power and libertie to write of the occurrents in those former times, as who was often checked both by his <note n="*" place="margin">

Hee compiled of his owne life eight bookes: a report not so wisely and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly put downe, as otherwise elegantly penned: <hi>Item,</hi> an Apologie or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of CICERO against the bookes of ASINIUS GALLUS: a peece of worke full enough of learning. He devised moreover three (<hi>a</hi>) new characters or letters in the (Latine) Alphabet, and put them to the number of the olde as most necessarie. And having published whiles he was yet a private person, concerning the reason of those letters, one booke: soone after beeing Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he easily effected that they should be brought into use also indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly with the rest.

            <p n="43">43 Toward the end of his life, hee shewed certaine signes and those evident enough, that he repented both his mariage with AGRIPPINA, and the

            <p n="44">44 And not long after this he wrote his wil and signed it with the seales of al the (<hi>a</hi>) head-magistrates: whereupon before that he could proceed anie further, prevented hee was and cut short by AGRIPPINA. Whom they also who were <note n="*" place="margin">

And verely it is agreed upon generally by all, that killed he was by poyson: but (<hi>a</hi>) where it should be, and who gave it, there is some difference. Some write, that as he sat at a feast in the (Capitoll) Castle with the priests, it was presented unto him by HALOTUS the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch his taster: others report that it was at a meale in his owne house by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRIPPINA herselfe, who had offered unto him a mushrome empoisoned; knowing that he was most greedy of such meats. Of those accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts also which ensued hereupon, the report is variable. Some say, that streight upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the poyson he became speechlesse, &amp; continuing all night in dolorous torments, dyed a little before day. Others affirme, that at first he fell a sleepe: and afterwards, as the meate flowed and floted aloft vomited all vp, and so was followed againe with a ranke <note n="*" place="margin">Toxico,</note> poyson. But whether the same were put into a messe of thicke gruell, (considering hee was of necessitie to be refreshed with food beeing emptied in his stomacke) or conueied up by a clistre, as if being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overcharged with fulnesse and surfeit, he might be eased also by this kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion and purgation, it is uncertaine.</p>
            <p n="45">45 His death was kept secret until all things were set in order about his succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssour. And therefore, both vowes were made for him as if hee had lyen sicke stil and also comicall Actours were brought in place colourably to solace and delight him, as having a longing desire after such sports. He deceased three dayes before the Ides of October, when ASINIUS MARCELLUS and ACILIUS AVIOLA were Consuls: in the 64th yeere of his age, and 14th of his Empire. His funerals were performed with a solemne pompe and proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Magistrates: and canonized he was a Saint in Heaven: Which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor forlet and abolished by NERO hee recouered afterwards by the meanes of VESPASIAN.</p>
            <p n="46">46 Especial tokens there were presaging &amp; prognosticating his death: to wit the rising of an <note n="*" place="margin">The 13th. of October.</note> hairy starre which they call a Comet: Also the * monumen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

yeere most of the (<hi>a</hi>) Magistrates of all sorts were dead. But himselfe seemeth not either to have beene ignorant that his end drew neere, or to have diffimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so much: which may bee gathered by some good arguments and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations. For both in the ordination of Consuls hee appointed none of them to continue longer then the moneth wherein he dyed: and also in the Senate, the very last time that ever he sat there, after a long and earnest exhortation of his children to concord, he humbly recommended the age of them both to the LL. of that honourable house: and in his last Iudiciall Session upon the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal once or twice he pronounced openly, That come he was now to the end of his mortalitie: notwithstanding they that heard him, greived to heare such an Osse, and praied the gods to avert the same.</p>

And when he had tryed what hee could doe, and performed, as it were, his first Actes in (private) hortyardes among verie slaves and the base commons, he proceeded to shew himselfe in the greatest Cirque in all Mens eyes, appointing one of his freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to put out a (white) towell for a signall, from the place where Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are wont to doe it. But not content with this, that he had given good proofe of his progresse in these feats at <hi>ROME,</hi> hee goes, as I sayde before, into <hi>ACHAIA,</hi> moved especially upon this occasion.

And least whiles he was busied about these matters, anie thing might either call him away or detaine him: when he was aduertised by his freed-man HELIVS, that the Citie affaires required his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, hee wrot backe unto him in these words. <hi>Albeit your councell to mee at this present and your willing desire is, that I should returne with all speede, yet ought you to aduise me and wish rather, that</hi> I <hi>may returne worthy my selfe, that is to say,</hi> NERO. All the while hee was singing, Lawefull it was not for anye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to depart out of the Theatre, were the cause never so necessarie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon reported it is, that some great bellied women falling into travaile were delivered upon the very skaffolds: yea and many men besides, wearie of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearing and praysing him, when the towne gates were shut, eyther by stealth leapt downe from the walles, or counterfeiting themselues dead were caried forth as corses to bee buried. But how timorously, with what thought and anguish of minde, with what aemulation of his concurrents and feare of the Vmpiers, hee strove for the Mastery; it is almost incredible. His manner was to deale with his aduersaries, as if they had been but his aequals and of the same condition with him, in this sort: namely, to obserue, watch and mark their behaviours; to ly in the wind for to catch aduantage: to defame them vnder hand, other whiles to raile at them &amp; given them hard tearms as they came in his way: yea and to corrupt with <note n="*" place="margin">Thereby to make them telent and not to do their best.</note> bribes and giftes such as excelled in skill and cunning.

            <p n="24">24 During the time that hee strove for to winne anie prise, so strictely

And to the end, there should remaine extant no memoriall or token of anie other victours (<hi>c</hi>) in these sacred games beside himselfe, hee commanded all their statues, and images to be overthrowen, drawen with a drag and so slung into sinkes and privies. Furthermore, he ran with chariots for the best game in many places, and at the Olympicke so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities with one that had a teeme of tenne steedes, notwithstanding he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the very same in K.

But being once shaken and hoisted out of his Chariot and set therein againe, how be it not able to hold out, he desisted and gave over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had runne the race through. Yet was he crowned neverthelesse. After this, at his departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, he enfranchised the whole Province through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: and withall, the Iudges of these Games he endowed with the freedome of <hi>Rome,</hi> and rewarded with great summes of money.

To do him honor all the way as he went, were beasts killed for sacrifice, and saffron estsoones strewed along the streets.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, never after durst he goe abroad into the streets at that houre of the night, without his militarie Tribunes following after him aloofe and secretly.

When this dessigne could not be kept close, but was revealed by some of the complices privie thereto; hee devised a ship, so made, as that quickly it should cleave a sunder: that either by the wrack, or fall of the fore-deck aloft, she might come to a mischiefe and perish.

leave to cast forth dead karkasses, and rid away the rammell of the ruines; looke what reliques remained of all their goods and substance unburnt, he permitted not one to goe unto it.

               </note> the Astrologers words: who having long before warranted him that he should sur: vive NERO, was then of his owne accord come unlooked for &amp; promised againe that shortly also he should be Emperour.

And when one of them went to law with his neigh bour abovt a parcell of ground in the skirts and confines of both their lands, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen Arbitratour, bought the whole land for the said souldier and enfeoffed him in it.

            <p n="6">6 He had minded once, presently after the adoption (of PISO) to seize their campe into his owne hands, and so to set uppon GALBA as hee sat at supper in the Pallace: but the respective regarde hee had of the Cohort, which then kept watch and warde, hee checked this intent of his: for feare least the same

            <p n="4">4 All the time also of his age ensuing stained as he was with all manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable villanies, so hee caried a principall sway above others in the Court, growen into familiar acquaintance with CAIUS for his love to chariot running, and with CLAUDIUS for his affection to dice-play: but in greater favour he was a good deale with NERO, both in the selfe same regards afore-said, as also for this especiall demerite, in that being president at the solemnity called <hi>Neroneum,</hi> when NERO was desirous to strive for the prise among the Harpers &amp; Musicians, but yet durst not promise so to do, (notwithstanding all the people called instantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) and thereupon went out of the Theater: hee pretending that hee was sent Embassadour unto him from the people persisting still in their earnest request, had called him back and so brought him in the end to be entreated.</p>

For in his Province he demeaned himselfe for two yeeres

together with singular <hi>innocencie</hi> and integrity; as who after his brother succeeded in his stead, staied there still in quality of his Lieutenant. But in his office within the Citie, he was reported to have secretly stollen away, the oblations, gifts and ornaments of the Temples; to have embecilled and chaunged some of them; yea, and in lieu of gold and silver to have foisted in Tinn and Copper.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Hee tooke to wife PETRONIA the daughter of one that had beene Consull, by whom hee had a sonne with one eye named PETRONIANUS, Him being by his<note n="*" place="margin">Deceased:</note> mother ordained her heire upon condition that he were freed once out of his fathers power, he manumised in deede: but soone after (as it was thought) killed: having charged him besides with parricidie, and pretending withall, that the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which was provided to worke that mischiefe; hee upon remorse of conscience had drunke himselfe. After this, bewedded GALERIA FUNDANA, whose father had beene Pretour: and of her body also begat children of both sexes: but the male child had such an impediment of stutting and stammering, that little better he was than dumbe and tonguelesse.</p>

So that evident it was to every man, that he chose him in contempt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than upon any speciall grace. This is for certaine knowne, that when he was to goe forth, he wanted provision for his iourney by the way; and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his family was driven to those hard shifts and extremities, that muing up his wife and children (whom he left at <hi>Rome</hi>) in a little upper<note n="*" place="margin">For in such, tenants dwelt, whereas the Lord himselfe kept beneath.</note> lodging that he<note n="*" place="margin">Tooke for rear.</note> rented: and let out his owne dwelling house for the rest of the yeere: yea, and tooke from his mothers eare a pearle, which he laid to gage: and all for to defray the charges of that voiage. As for a number verily of his Creditours, who waited for him as ready to stay his passage: and among them, the Sinuessanes and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, whose publick imposts, tollage, and revenewes he had intercepted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to his owne use, he could not be rid of; but by terrifying them with an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the case: seruing one of them, and namely a Libertine (who very eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded a debt) with processe upon an action of batterie, as if he had stricken him with his heele; and would not withdraw the suit before he had extorted from him fiftie thousand Sesterces. In his comming toward the Campe, the armie malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bent against the Emperour, and ready to intertaine any revolt and chaunge of State, willingly and with open armes received him, as a gift of the Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto them from heaven above; the sonne of one thrice Consull; a man in the vigour and strength of his yeeres; of a gentle disposition besides, and of a frank and prodigall heart. Which opinion and perswasion, being of old conceived and settled in mens heads, VITELLIUS had augmented by some fresh proofes lately given of himselfe: kissing all the way as hee went along every meane common Souldiour that hee met: so courteous and affable above all measure, to the very mulitiers and wayfaring passengers, in every Inn and baiting place, that he would

in a morning betimes aske them one by one, whether they had yet broken their fast? and shew unto them even by his belching, that hee had beene at his breakfast already.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Now when hee was entred once into the Camp, no suit denied he to any man: nay, of his owne accord hee tooke off their marks of ignominie who stoode in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; dispensed with those that were obnoxious to the Lawes for wearing poore and sullied garments; and forgave condemned persons their punishments. Whereupon, before one moneth was fully come and gone, without all respect either of day or time, when the very evening was now shooting in, suddainly by the Souldiours called forth he was out of his bed-chamber: and clad as he was in<note place="margin">A, V, C. 822</note> his domesticall and home apparrell, saluted by the name of <hi>Imperator,</hi> and caried round about through the most frequented and populous<note n="*" place="margin">

Againe, as hee sate another time at supper, an Oxe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene at plough and shaken of his yoke, rushed into the parlour where hee was at meate: and when hee had driven the waiters and seruitours out, as if all on a sodaine hee had beene wearie, layed him downe along at his feete where hee sate, and gently put his necke under him. A Cypresse tree like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in his Grand-fathers land without anie force of tempest plucked up by the roote and layed along, the very next day following rose up againe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and stronger than before. But in <hi>ACHAIA</hi> hee dreamed, <hi>That hee and his, should beginne to prosper so soone as</hi> NERO <hi>had a tooth drawen out of his head.</hi> Now it fortuned, that the morrow following, a Chirurgion that came forth into the court-yeard shewed unto him a tooth of NEROES newly drawen. In <hi>Iurie,</hi> when hee consulted with the Oracle of the good (<hi>a</hi>) CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MELUS, the answere which was given, assured him in these tearmes, That whatsoever he thought upon and cast in his minde (were it never so great) it should so come to passe: And one of the Noble men of that Countrey taken captive, named <note n="*" place="margin">Who wrote the Iewish historie.</note> IOSEPHUS, when hee was cast into prison, avouched and sayde unto him most constantly, that hee should shortly be set at liberty even by him, but hee should be Emperour first. There were moreover significant tokens presaging no lesse reported unto him out of the very Citie of <hi>Rome:</hi> and namely, <hi>that</hi> NERO <hi>in his latter dayes,</hi> a little before his death, was warned in a dreame to take the sacred Chariot of IUPITER <hi>Optimus Maximus</hi> forth of the Chappel where it stoode, into VESPASIANS house, and so from <note n="*" place="margin">Inde in Circum</note> thence into the Cirque. Also, not long after, as GALBA held the solemne election for <note n="*" place="margin">Vespasians.</note> his second Consulship, the statue of IULIUS, late CAESAR of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, turned of it selfe into the (<hi>b</hi>) East. And at the field fought before <hi>Bebriacum,</hi> ere the battailes joyned, two Aegles had a conflict and bickered together in all their sights: and when the one of them was foyled and overcome, a third came at the very instant from the sunne rising and chased the Victresse away.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yet for all this attempted he no enterprise (notwithstanding his friends &amp; souldiours were most prest and forward yea and urgent upon him) before that hee was sollicited by the unexpected favour, of some, who as it fell out were both unknowen to him and also absent. Two thousand drawen out of the three legions of the <hi>Maesian</hi> armie and sent to ayde OTHO, when they were upon the way marching (albeit newes came unto them that hee was vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and had layed violent hands upon himselfe,) held on their journey ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse as farre as to <hi>Aquileia;</hi> as giving small credit to that rumour: where after they had by vantage of opportunities offred, and vncontrolled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, committed all manner of robberies and outrageous villanies, fearing least if they returned backe againe, they should answere for their misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and abide condigne punishment therefore; layed their heades to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and consulted about the chusing and creating of an EMPEROVR. For, worse they tooke not themselues nor inferiour, eyther to the

armie in <hi>SPAINE</hi> that had set up GALBA: or to the Pretorian bands, which had made OTHO: or to the Germanician forces who had elected VITELLIUS, Emperours. Having purposed therefore and nominated of the Consular Lieutenants as manie, as they coulde in anie place thinke upon: when they misliked all the rest, taking exceptions against one for this cause and another for that: Whiles some againe of that third Legion, which a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the death of NERO had been translated out of <hi>SYRIA</hi> into <hi>MESIA,</hi> highly praysed and extolled VESPASIAN; they all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereto, and without delay, wrote his name upon their flagges and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And verily, for that time this project was smuddred, the companies for a while reclaimed, and all brought into good order.

that when his friendes admonished him to beware of MAETIUS POM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSIANUS, because it was generally beleeved that the Astrologors had by the horoscope of his nativitie assured him to bee Emperour another day, hee aduanced the same METIVS to the Consulship, presuming and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising in the mans behalfe, that hee would be one day mindfull of this benefit and good turne of his.</p>
            <p n="15">15 There is not lightly found an innocent person to have beene punished, but when hee was absent and not ware thereof: or at leastwise unwilling thereto and deceived. With HELUIDIUS PRISCUS who onely had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him after his returne out of <hi>SYRIA,</hi> by his private name, <note n="*" place="margin">Not Caesar nor Augustus nor Imperator</note> plaine VES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PASIAN: and being pretour in all his Edicts and Proclamations passed him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without any honour at all, or once naming him, hee was not angry and displeased, before that he had, with his most insolent altercations made him in manner contemptible and little better than an ordinarie person. Him also, notwithstanding he was first confined to a place and afterwards commanded to bee killed, hee would have given a great deale to have saved by all meanes possible: as who sent certein of purpose to call backe the murderers: and saved his life hee had, but that false word came backe that he was dispatched alreadie. Otherwise he never rejoyced in the death of any but rather when malefactours were justly punished and executed, hee would weepe and groane againe.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The onely thing, for which hee might worthily bee blamed was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse.

Neither made hee it straung to sell either honourable places unto suiters for them <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or absolutions and pardons, to men in trouble, whether they were innocent or gultie it skilled not. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, it is verily thought that of his Procuratours, if any were greedy and given to extortion more than other, his manner was to promote such for the nonce to higher offices: to the ende, that when they were more enriched, hee might soone after condemne them. And commonly it was sayd, that those hee vsed as spunges, for that hee did wet them well when they were drie, and presse them hard when they were wette. Some write that hee was by nature most covetous; &amp; that an old Neat heard upbraided him once therwith who being at his handes denied freedome without paying for it (which hee hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie craved of him now invested in the Empire) cryed out with a lowd voice and said, <hi>The Wolfe might change his haire, but not his qualities.</hi> Contrariwise there bee againe who are of opinion, that hee was driven to spoyle, to pill and poll of necessitie, even for extreame want both in the common treasurie and

also in his owne exchequer: whereof he gave some testimonie in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning immediately of his Empire; professing that there was neede of fortie thousand Millenes to set the STATE upright againe. Which also see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to sounde more neere unto the truth. Because the monie by him ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Hee used and bestowed passing well.

Whereupon arose the first suspition, That he revolted from his father, and had attempted to chalenge the kingdome of the East parts for him selfe. Which surmise himselfe made the more, after that in his way to <hi>Alexandrea,</hi> as he consecrated at <hi>Memphis</hi> the <hi>Ox Apis,</hi> he wore a (<hi>a</hi>) Diademe: Which he did in deed according to the custome &amp; rites of the auncient religion there. But there wanted not some, who construed it otherwise.

            <p n="5">5 From that time forward hee ceased not to carie himselfe as partner with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea and Protectour also of the Empire: With him hee triumphed: with him<note place="margin">A, V, C, 824 825, 824</note> hee iointly administred the Censureship: His Colleague hee was in the Tribunes authority: his Companion likewise in seven Consulships.

As for example, among these, hee commaunded AULUS CAECINA, a man of Consular Degree, and a guest by him invited to supper, when hee was scarce gone out of the Banquetting parlor to bee stabbed. I must needes say, that driven he was to this violent proceeding upon an extremity of daunger: considering that he had found out his hand-writing bearing evidence of a conspiracie that he plotted with the Souldiours. By which courses, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided well and sufficiently for his owne security another day: so, for the present time he incurred very much displeasure and hatred of the world: In so much, as no man lightly, when so adverse a rumor was on foote, and that which more is, against the wills of all men, would have stepped to the Imperiall throne.</p>

But this name that went of him proved good for him and turned to his greatest commendation: considering that no grosse vice could bee found in him, but contrariwise many excellent vertues. The feasts that he made were pleasant meriments, rather than lavish and sumpte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He chose for his friends such, as in whom the Emperours also his successours reposed themselves, and whom they used especially as necessarie members both for them and also for the Common-wealth. As for Queene BERENICE, he sent her quickly away from the Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> but full loath they were both of them to part a sunder. Certaine of his minions and dearlings whom hee favoured and fansied most, albeit they were such artificiall Dauncers, that within a while after they caried the greatest praise and prise upon the stage, he forbare quite not onely to huggle and embrace long together, but to behold so much as once in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meeting and assembly.

And verily, even so hee did: for, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied he ought to them that would call for it: and of his owne accord, willed them to aske what their mindes stoode to.

To cure the sicknesse and mitigate the furie of those contagious Diseases, hee used all helpe of god and man; having sought out what soever kindes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and remedies might bee found: Among the adversities of those times, may bee reckoned these Promoters and Informers, with such as under hand set them a worke, occasioned all by old licentiousnesse and impunitie. And those he commaunded to be whipped and beaten with cudgels ordinarily in the open Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place: and last of all, when they had beene brought in a Shew through the Amphitheatre, partly to be solde in port-sale for slaves: and in part to be caried away into the roughest and bleakest Ilands that were.

But DOMITIA devoutly sware, That he never had such dealing with her: who no doubt would not have denied it, if there had beene any folly at all betweene them: nay, shee would rather have made her vaunt thereof: so ordinary a thing it was with her to glory in all naughtinesse and shamefull deedes.</p>

And not to handle every particular. having with uncleane hands offred dishonour to many mens wives, hee fled a way and maried also DOMITIA LONGINA the wedded wife of AELIUS LONGINVS: and in one day gave and dealt above twentie offices, within the Citie and abroad in foraine provinces: in so much as VESPASIAN commonly said, <hi>That hee marvailed, why <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Himselfe likewise made wonderfull sembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of modestie. But above all, hee seemed outwardly to affect Poetrie, (a studie which he was not so much unacquainted with before time, but he despised and reiected it as much afterwards) &amp; recited his owne verses even in publike place. Yet never the lesse, when VOLOGESVS King of the <hi>Parthians</hi> required aide against the <hi>Alanes,</hi> and one of VESPASIANS two sonnes to be the Generall of those forces, he labou red with might and maine, that himselfe before all others should be sent: and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the quarrel was<note n="*" place="margin">Peace con cluded between the a, nations</note> dispatched alreadie to his hand, hee assaied by gifts and large promises to sollicite other Kings of the East, to make the same request.

Neither would hee give over from that time forwarde

both to-lay wait secretly for his brother, and also to practise openly against him, untill such time as he gave commandement when hee was stricken with greivous sickenesse, that he should be left for dead before the breath was out of his bodie: and after he was departed indeed, vouchsafing him no other honour but his <note n="*" place="margin">Canonization for a God.</note> consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he carped also at him many a time as well in glauncing figurative speeches as in open Edicts.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the beginning of his Empire his manner was, to retire himselfe daily into a secret place for<note n="*" place="margin">

VIEIVS CRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PVS made answer not impertinently, no, not so much as a flie. After this, DOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIA his owne wife, who in his second Consulship had borne him a sonne, and whome two yeeres after he had saluted as Empresse, by the name of AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TA, her I say, falling in fansie with PARIS the stage player and ready to die for his love, hee put away: but within a smal while after (as impatient of this breach and divorse) tooke her home, and maried her againe, as if the people had instantly called uppon him so to do. In the administration of the Empire hee behaved him selfe for a good while variablie, as one made of an equall mixture and temper of vices and vertues, untill at length hee turned his vertues also into vices: being, (so far as we may coniecture) over &amp; above his naturall inclination, for want coverous and greedie; for feare bloudy and cruell.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Hee exhibited ordinarily magnificent and sumpteous shewes not onely in the Amphitheatre, but in the Cirque also. In which, beside the usuall running of Chariots, drawen as well with two steedes as foure. Hee represented likewise two battailes of horsemen and foote men both: and in the Amphitheatre a Navall fight. For, baitings of wild beasts, and sword fencers, he shewed in the very night by cresset and torch lights; and hee brought into the place not men onely to fight, but women also to encounter wild beasts. Furthermore, at the games of swordfight set out by the Questours (which having in times past been discontinued and forlet, hee brought into vse againe) hee was alwaies present in person, so as he gave the people leave to choose two paire of swordfencers out of his owne schoole, and those hee brought in, royally, &amp; courth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And at all sights of sword players, there stood ever at his feet a little dwarfe arraied in skarlet with a small head that it was wonderfull: with whome hee vsed to talke and conferre otherwhiles of serious matters.

CAPITOLINVS, Quinquennall Games of three fold Maisteries, musicke, horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding, &amp; Gymnicke exercises: &amp; in the same, rewarding victours with Coroners, more by a good many then now they be. Herein the concurrents strove also for the prise in Prose, both Greeke &amp; Latin: and besides single harpers, there were Setts of those also that played uppon the harpe, yea and consorts of such as sung therto, in a quire. In the running place, Virgins also ran for the best games. At all these masteries and solemnities, he sat as president in his Pantofles, clad in a robe (<hi>a</hi>)<note place="margin">* Or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Semblably, hee celebrated everie yeere uppon the Albane mount, the Quin quatria of MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERVA. In whose honor he had instituted a Societie, out of which there should be chosen by lot, Maisters and Wardens of that solemnitie who were to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite peculier and especiall Beastbaitings and stage playes, yea and contentions for the prise, of Oratours and Poets besides.

Of the stone that was about which, the greatest Cirque of al was afterwards built, by occasion that both sides thereof had been burnt downe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Expeditions hee made, some voluntarie; some uppon necessitie.
