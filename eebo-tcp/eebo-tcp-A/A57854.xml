            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE World may know, that this Treatise,
however little in bulk, and as little in
it's own eyes, yet presumes not to walk
abroad, after so long confinement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the perusal and approbation of several very
<hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Judicious Men,</hi> as skilfull in the
<hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Church-Government</hi> as most
of their Age. If any demand why a posthumous
piece shall need to be anonymous too? Its answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that though the worthy and much lamented Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath been a <hi>Dead Man</hi> ever since 1662. Yet
there may be Reasons which concern the living why it
should be so. If another ask, why the lists are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so late, after 20 years silence? <hi>Ans.</hi> Better late
than never. And as <hi>Diogenes</hi> said of <hi>Dineing,</hi> A
Rich Man when he will, and a poor Man when he
may; so say I of <hi>Printing.</hi> The Hebrew servant
who refused his liberty in that year of Jubilee, when
he might have had it, was to be a slave for ever. But
the greatest Question is yet behind, and it is about the
seasonableness of this Work. Wherefore, if any shall
say with <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Priest,</hi> withdraw thine hand:
this is not a time to plead for a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of
<hi>Church-Government,</hi> when the <hi>Church</hi> it self, is
like to be swallowed up of <hi>Popery;</hi> even the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:57560:3"/>
City trod under foot of the Gentiles; and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy be glad to see <hi>Protestant</hi> against <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
(that they may divide the spoil) and so great
a <hi>Champion</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Cause</hi> assailed. To
this several things must be said: 1. As some may
write for their way, when they will, (as I have said)
why should others neglect the <hi>year</hi> of <hi>Release,</hi> which
falls out but once in an <hi>Age?</hi> 2. But if you would
know why we venture on offending <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> by
asserting the principles of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> when <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
so pretends to be the <hi>Ascendant.</hi> Truly, there's
but little reason to stick at this; Partly because the
Reformed Churches generally look on <hi>Prelacy</hi> as a
limb of <hi>Popery;</hi> and partly to the grief of our hearts
we see many of those men fallen in so kindly
with that interest, that it causeth great thoughts in
heart: I mean, not so much by the Popish doctrines
that many of them vent, as by a more general pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the late <hi>hellish, popish plot,</hi> to murther our
<hi>King,</hi> and introduce the <hi>Romish Religion</hi> into these
<hi>Nations.</hi> There being no person more ingrateful to
some of them than Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> the first and great <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer</hi>
of the Plot; no discourse more unsavoury to
them than the <hi>discovery</hi> it self, and no <hi>Parliament</hi> so
dreaded by them as one likeliest to prosecute the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and punish the <hi>Papists.</hi> And let
the World judg whether we have cause to be tender
in offending such <hi>Protestants</hi> in this <hi>Controversie,</hi>
who had rather the <hi>Plot</hi> should be <hi>stifled</hi> and the
<hi>Papists</hi> go <hi>unpunished,</hi> than poor <hi>dissenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
should have any favour shewed them. Now
the <hi>good Lord</hi> forgive these men, and turn their
hearts from hating of their <hi>Brethren</hi> to love the
<pb facs="tcp:57560:3"/>
               <hi>Truth.</hi> 4. As for Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (whom this
Author deals with about <hi>Church-Government)</hi> I
am far from placing him, Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his <hi>Worthy Brethren</hi> in that Category, They
have done so worthily in our <hi>Israel;</hi> especially, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath writ so learnedly against the <hi>Papists,</hi> that
he deserves well of all good <hi>Protestants.</hi> But yet,
seeing the learned Dr. seems to have repented of
his writing against the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
(having since his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> much applauded
and congratulated the happy restitution of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to its wonted lustre and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi>
(far enough from his formerly desired <hi>Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
to <hi>Primitive Presbyteries:)</hi> I know not but
he may find as good Reason here, for his repenting
to write against the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of <hi>Presbyterie.</hi>
For the end of his Epistle to the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> about
this matter, may be recanted, but never reconciled to
the beginning of his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Arch-Bishop Laud</hi>'s
Defence against <hi>Fisher.</hi> What pity so <hi>grave</hi> and
<hi>great</hi> a Man should thus <hi>expose himself by a</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
too palpable between <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>preferment.</hi>
Now though this hath the last word, and carries it
with the <hi>World;</hi> yet the <hi>Elder Brother</hi> will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the <hi>honester</hi> with the <hi>wise,</hi> because born of
the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> while the after-seed was conceived
and brought forth in <hi>Bondage.</hi> 5. It may be judged
a fit season of asserting the Kingly Power of Christ
in setling the Government of his own House, when
Men so liberally give away the Lord's Prerogative;
Not a <hi>coal of the Altar, almost,</hi> which they are
not willing to carry to the <hi>Eagles nest.</hi> Pray God
they fire it not. Our <hi>Pulpits</hi> now so ring with a
<pb facs="tcp:57560:4"/>
               <hi>Catholick Jus Civile,</hi> that there is scarce any <hi>Jus
Divinum</hi> left, but of <hi>Tythes,</hi> which I hope they will
hold to the last, being good <hi>Church-men.</hi> Those <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
Sons</hi> of the Church, are like to prove the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusest
spenders of her <hi>Patrimony,</hi> that ever she
brought forth: and, which is worst of all, they are
like to promote a <hi>DIVORCE</hi> from her <hi>Husband,</hi>
by cutting her off from <hi>Subjection</hi> unto, and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi>
with the true <hi>Head.</hi> A fair Charter
hath <hi>Christ</hi> sealed to his <hi>Church</hi> with his own <hi>blood,</hi>
giving her <hi>Officers, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>free Courts</hi>
within her self; all which unfaithful Children, with
profane <hi>Esau</hi> often sell for morsels of meat, and
by base compoundings alienate the Churches Good's
from her self (the greatest of Sacrileges) and put
them into the hands of strange Children, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
detriment of Religion, and disgrace of
Christianity.</p>
            <p>Now could Men let <hi>Christ</hi> alone, to govern his
own <hi>House</hi> in his own <hi>Way,</hi> by his own <hi>Officers</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances;</hi> how happy were we! <q>Who can better
reprove the Atheism of the World in setting up
Mans Post by Christ's,</q> than Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath
done in his other works, while he sayeth that <q>To
say a Man may be of any Religion, according to the
Laws of Men, is to take it for granted, that there
is no such thing as Religion in the World. And
again, That no Men do so dangerously undermine
the foundations of Civil Government, as those
who magnifie it to the contempt of Religion.</q>
Fear, <hi>i. e.</hi> Religion, and particularly Worship and
the Ordinances of Christs House must not be taught
more by the Precepts of Men, than by the Truths
<pb facs="tcp:57560:4"/>
of God. Nor may <hi>Polititians</hi> and <hi>Court-parasites</hi>
dare to form a <hi>Religion</hi> in the flexible mould of
<hi>State.</hi> A <hi>municipal Religion</hi> would many fain
promote, following <hi>Reasons of State</hi> more than
<hi>Rules of Conscience,</hi> like the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who first
built <hi>Cities,</hi> and then instituted a <hi>Religion</hi> fit for
the <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> The <hi>Roman Empire</hi> flourished
while Virtue was nourished, to shew, says <hi>Austin,</hi>
how happy they should be, who should have <hi>Religion</hi>
superadded. And indeed they had no better Subjects
than <hi>Christians:</hi> for none can give unto <hi>Caesar</hi> the
things that are <hi>Caesar's,</hi> upon any valuable or holding
account, who make no Conscience of giving unto <hi>God</hi>
the things that are <hi>God's.</hi> Now this <hi>innocent</hi> and
<hi>learned Book</hi> can hardly offend any, that are not
<hi>Adiaphorists</hi> on <hi>Erastians:</hi> pleading in <hi>Thesi</hi> the
faithfulness of <hi>Christ</hi> in setling a form of <hi>Church-Government</hi>
in his Fathers House, which he is set
over: and the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> or a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Governours,</hi> is not so much asserted positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(further than the Dr's Concessions give ground
to build on) as <hi>arguments</hi> are <hi>answered,</hi> being
brought against its <hi>divine Right.</hi> So that the design
is meerly to set it as right as it was before the Dr.
imployed his <hi>Ordinance</hi> against <hi>Presbyterie</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi>
as to <hi>divine Right,</hi> with equal force. And
how the <hi>learned,</hi> and <hi>unprejudiced,</hi> (if it fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such hands) shall find this <hi>Defence</hi> managed,
<hi>Judicium sit penes lectorem. Sed frustra ferit
aures Orator, si Cor non reserat Creator,</hi> says
<hi>great Calvin</hi> like himself. If Men could come with
a prepared mind to read <hi>Books,</hi> i. e. with some sense
of their own blindness at best, looking to <hi>God</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:57560:5"/>
more light, supposing that clear <hi>Scripture</hi> and strong
Reason may be brought against some things they hold,
there were some hope of getting Good, and Truth's
taking place. How may the <hi>Most High,</hi> after all
the <hi>Antichristian encroachments</hi> on the <hi>Scepter</hi>
of his <hi>Son,</hi> bring back the hearts of this People to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
making them yield to the internal <hi>Government</hi>
of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the true, <hi>Apostolick,</hi> and ancient
external <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>House:</hi> that the glory
of the Latter <hi>House</hi> may be greater than the glory
of the former, even a spiritual Glory of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
presence of the <hi>Lord</hi> may appear among us; and
the pleasure of the <hi>Lord</hi> may prosper by his own <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
in the hands of his own appointed Servants
as the beauty of his House, and the blessing of his
<hi>Chosen.</hi> Amen. Even so <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> let thy <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
come!</hi>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>THIS Book, though set off with the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Title of an <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and carrying in
its Face the pretence of a Laudable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<hi>viz.</hi> the healing of the dangerous
Wounds and sad Divisions of the Church at
this time prevailing, will, upon due Examination, I
suppose, be found an unsuitable Salve for these Sores,
and to mend our rents, as they say <hi>Tinkers</hi> do, by
making a greater rent instead of mending a lesser. For
instead of a Debate about particular Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it bringeth in another Debate, whether there
be any Form instituted of Christ, whether we must
search the will of Christ about managing Church-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
in his Word, or be content with what is the will
of man? Which Controversie is like to be harder in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining,
and more stiffly agitated than the other;
for sure it is harder to perswade them, who would take
the word of God for their rule, that <hi>Christ hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
any one Form of Government in his House,</hi> than
that <hi>he hath not appointed this or that.</hi> By this device we
are cast loose of all hold where we may fix, and there
shall be no end of Contention, at least among them,
who consult so as to determine some one Form of all
these, which are thought to be lawful; and when they
have determined, the People, on whom they impose it,
have a very unsure bottom to settle their Consciences
upon in this matter, that doth so nearly concern Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57560:6"/>
to wit, nothing but the Judgment and Will of
man, which is often wrong, and led by Interest, and at
best is fallible and cannot guide us certainly in that,
which pleaseth God. Wherefore this Authors Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seems to be a cutting of the knot with <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and casting all loose, when he cannot so untie it, as to
hold fast the exercise of Christ's Kingly Power in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
his Church. Neither is this Opinion new, as
the Author seemeth to imply; for it was long since
maintained, and largely propugned by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his
<hi>Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi> and solidly refuted by Mr.
<hi>Rutherford</hi> in his <hi>Divine Right of Church-Government;</hi>
and indeed hath always been and still is the main Pillar
to uphold Episcopacy in these Nations, it being the
most ready and plausible way for them, who would
wreath this Iron Yoke on the Necks of their Brethren,
when they cannot shew them Christ's Authority for it,
to take the determining of the Case out of his hand,
and to put it in the hand of the King, and then to press
it from his Authority with Fire and Sword. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this Opinion is a most colourable excuse for the
unfaithful complyance of them, who would fain hold
their places under any Form of Church-Government,
that shall lye uppermost; for so they shall be sure never
to cross Authority, and not to cross the Interest of their
own Back and Belly; and how much mischief this
piece hath done this way, is too evident; seeing men,
that incline to comply, are satisfyed with shadows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of substantial reason, to put off troublesome
Conscience. Yet among them, who are conscientiously
zealous for any one way of Government, I suppose, the
Lot of this Author will be that, which is ordinary to
such unhappy Peace-Makers, as sell truth, or some part
of it by an over-reach of condescendency, and that
in Gods matters, not their own, (in which we must
bargain as hard Merchants do in worldly things,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
peace; for I suppose men of all perswasions will
be about his Ears: For that which I am perswaded to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57560:6"/>
be the truth of God in point of Church-Government, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Government by Ministers acting in parity, and ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
met in Congregational, Classical, Provincial and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Presbyteries or Assemblies;</hi> it is more easily upheld
against his undermining Engines, than any of the other
Forms; for the least of his Book is levelled against it in
particular and what he saith against it, I hope, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not to have great strength; yea, I believe, that out
of what he hath said, this truth may be strongly
confirmed; which I shall thus essay in a word. He
acknowledgeth and stifly maintaineth, that <hi>Christ hath
given power, not only of teaching, but of ruling his Church,
to all and every one of his Ministers; and that he hath not
given more power to one of them than another, nor made them
subject or subordinate to one another.</hi> Whence it clearly
followeth that <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> (I mean the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Ministers and their Association) is <hi>jure divino,
ex confesso;</hi> and that Prelacy is an addition to it, made
<hi>jure humano.</hi> And hence it followeth, that this addition
is unlawful, except he can prove that Christ hath given
a power to men to make them unequal, whom he hath
made equal; to subject one to another of them, to whom
Christ hath given equal power; to restrain, yea and
take quite away the exercise of ruling power in some of
them, to whom Christ hath given it as much as to others;
and to enlarge that power in some, to whom Christ hath
given no more than to others. Which I am sure he
will never be able to do: Yea further it's confessed by
him, that <hi>Christ hath instituted the Office of Presbyters;</hi>
and that he hath <hi>not instituted the Office of Prelates, ruling
over Presbyters:</hi> Wherefore he must either say, that the
Church hath power to institute new Offices, which I
hope he will not assert, and I am sure he cannot prove;
or that Prelacy is unlawful. For, that a Prelate is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officer than a Presbyter, is undeniable, because
the one is ruled by the other. Now these of the same
Office cannot be ruled by or subordinate to one another;
as common sense and reason will teach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57560:7"/>
§. 2. But to come to the Book it self. My design is
not a full Refutation, but some brief Animadversions
for private satisfaction, and mine own establishment
in these truths, that he endeavoureth to shake: Neither
do I intend to meddle with the whole, but only to cull
out these passages, that relate to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and any that might infer the unsetling of that or
any part of it.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The first thing, that I meet with, to be disproved,
is <hi>p.</hi> 2. where he asserteth a Principle, that will not only
shake our Faith (if it be received) in the point of
Church-Government; but (which I hope he doth not
intend) will unsettle us in most points of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
His Principle is this, <hi>That Difference in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
about a point, and probable Arguments brought on both
hands by wise and able men; if it be not a matter of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Salvation, gives men ground to think, that a final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of the matter in Controversie was never intended as a
necessary means for the Peace and Vnity of the Church of
God.</hi> His Opinion in this he setteth down in fewer and
clearer words in the Contents of <hi>ch. 1. things,</hi> saith he,
<hi>necessary for the Churches peace must be clearly revealed;
the Form of Church Government is not so, as appears by the
remaining Controversie about it.</hi> I shall first shew the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and falsehood of this Principle, and then try the
strength of what he saith for the establishment of it.
And 1. I argue thus: This Assertion destroyeth it self;
for if no point, not necessary to Salvation, be so sure,
that we must necessarily hold it, in order to peace;
then this his Assertion falleth under the same condition,
and needeth not to be maintain'd, for it is not needful
to Salvation; I hope, they will go to Heaven, that are
not of his mind in this; and I am confident he doth not
think it so clear, that no wise and able men will contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
with him about it; and if it be needless in order
to the Churches peace, why is it here laid down as the
first stone of the Foundation, on which he buildeth his <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum?</hi>
but it fareth here with our Author, as it doth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57560:7"/>
with all other Abetters of <hi>Scepticism;</hi> they attain at
least so far their end, as they make men question that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that they labour to establish, by perswading them
to question every thing.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Secondly, There is no cause at all, why the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
should except from the uncertainty, here asserted,
things, that are of necessity to Salvation; for, if we are
to think, that the Lord hath so clearly revealed things
not needful to Salvation, which are needful to peace in
the Church; much rather are we to think so of things
needful to Salvation (which also cannot but be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to peace; for we can have no peace with them, that
destroy the Foundation.) For it hath hitherto been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Principle, that things of necessity to Salvation
are revealed with more clearness, than other things. And,
though <hi>Papists</hi> have laboured to cast a Mist upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
discovery in both sorts of things, that they might
take all power to themselves over the Truths of God,
and Consciences of men, in determining what is truth;
(as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> would darken the discovery of the
<hi>circa-fundamentals</hi> of Religion, that he might put the
power of determining these things in the hand of the
Magistrate) yet <hi>Protestants</hi> have ever firmely maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that however the Scripture speaketh darkly in some
things, not essential; yet that the light of it is most
clear in things necessary to Salvation. They are not
then of this mans mind, who will have the things, that do
not so nearly relate to Salvation, but are needful to
peace, so clearly revealed, that there can remain no
Controversie about them among wise and able men, but
excepteth from this necessity, things of necessity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
From what hath been said, I argue thus against
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Principle: If any things not necessary
to Salvation be so necessary to be clearly revealed, that
we are to look upon them as not Christ's Truth, if there
remain a Controversie about them, managed with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Arguments on both sides among wise and able men,
much more things necessary to Salvation must be thus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57560:8"/>
clearly revealed; so that there is no truth in them, if
they be so controverted; but the consequent is most
false and absurd, and overturneth all the Foundations of
our Religion: for have not the <hi>Arrian, Soecinian, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi>
and <hi>Popish</hi> Controversies been managed, yea and
are they not managed by the Adversaries of Truth,
with Learning even to admiration. We must then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this principle, not take either part of these
debates for truth, but think that the Lord hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
nothing in them, and we must leave it to men
to determine in them what they please, and must em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that. Is not this a fine device to cast loose all,
to bring in Scepticism instead of Faith, to make way
for a subtle Sophister to nullifie any truth, by disputing
speciously against it? Yet this we are to bless the Lord
for, that the overturners of the Government of Christ's
house, have no other means to cast it loose by, but
these, that do also cast loose all our Religion: which I
hope will be a consideration to fix this truth the better in
the minds of them, who are serious and intelligent.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Thirdly, If these things not necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that speciously on both hands are controverted,
be not needful to be determined in our consciences, in
order to the Churches peace, I ask the Author of this
Assertion, What things of that nature are needful to
the Churches peace, that we hold an opinion about
them? Or are there any things such? or must we hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
about all the <hi>circa-fundamentals</hi> in Religion, and
look on them as indifferences determinable by men, if
we will not be guilty of disturbing the peace of the
Church? I hope this good man will not say so: and yet it
would necessarily follow out of this principle maintained
by him; for I believe he cannot instance in many things
(scarce if any) that are not of necessity to salvation, which
are not controverted, and that with specious pretexts.
For learned men, when they erre, use not to come
off so bluntly, as barely to say, <hi>it is so,</hi> or <hi>I think so;</hi>
but they bring plausible Reasons, and those often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57560:8"/>
to be drawn from Scripture, for their foulest
errours. If then we receive this principle, we must
not think it needful to the Churches peace, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether there be two Sacraments or seven; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be Purgatory; whether we are to pray to
Saints departed; whether there be power of Censure
in Church-men; or if all Church-power be in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;
whether the Pope be the head of the Church;
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all these, and such-like, are controverted; and
there are colourable Arguments for the Errours, that
men maintain in these points. If this, our Author will
not assert, what reason is there, that he should maintain,
that the Form of Church-Government is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by men for the Churches peace; and that because
there are Controversies about what is the Form appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 6. But I come now to examine what the Author
hath to say for this Assertion of his. <hi>We cannot,</hi> saith
he, <hi>with any shew of reason imagine, that Christ, who hath
made it a necessary duty for all the Members of the Church to
endeavour the Peace and Vnity of it, should suspend the
performance of that duty upon a matter of Opinion, which
when many have used their utmost endeavour to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about, they yet find, that those very grounds, which
they are most inclinable to build their Judgments upon, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly rejected by others as wise and able as themselves,
or else, it may be, they erect a far different Fabrick upon
the very same Foundations. Ans.</hi> 1. The weakness, if
not wickedness of this Argument will easily appear,
by making an Assumption to the Proposition here set
down, and considering what will necessarily follow,
which I shall thus perform. <hi>That Christ is true God,</hi> is
a matter of Opinion, which, when we have used our
utmost endeavours to satisfie our selves about it, we
yet find that those very grounds, which we are most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to build our Judgments upon, are either
<q>wholly rejected by others, as wise and able as we, or
else that they erect on them a far different Fabrick;</q>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57560:9"/>
for it's well known that the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who are men of
Wisdom and Ability, though it be unsanctifyed; and
especially <hi>Grotius</hi> (the wonder of his Age for Learning)
though yet he profess the truth in this point: That,
I say, they do wholly reject all the grounds, on which
we do build our Faith in this point; and that on many
of them they endeavour to erect a contrary Fabrick. It
doth then follow <hi>vi syllogisticâ</hi> (supposing our Author's
Proposition) that we cannot with any shew of reason
think that Christ would have us suspend the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of our duty in endeavouring the peace of the
Church on this, <hi>That Christ is true God;</hi> and so we must
by this Argument yield this Truth as a <hi>matter determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
by men, rather than hold an Opinion in it with the loss
of peace in the Church.</hi> I hope the Author will not own
this Conclusion; wherefore he ought not to own that
his Assertion, out of which it is clearly deducible.</p>
            <p>§. 7. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. There is very great reason for that, for
which he denyeth all shew of reason; for some matters
of Opinion of that condition, which he describeth, are
the Truths of God, as is clear from what hath been
said; but we are to suspend the endeavouring of the
Churches peace, rather than part with any Truth of
God, or then we should yield it upto men's determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
as if it were none of his truths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. When we are to judge of the validity of the
grounds, on which we build our opinion about truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
is not the thoughts of men as wise and able as we, that
must determine us; for, we know, the wisest may mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
when they, who are less wise, may hit the truth
through the grace of God: but we must consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these grounds be the dictates of the Spirit of God
in his word: and if they be, we must not be shaken in
mind by the contrary assertions of men, though never
so wise, yea and holy too. I grant the opinions of such
should make us search carefully; but they must not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our assent to the truth of God. And this is a valid
reason, why we are to suspend our endevours of peac
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57560:9"/>
on some matters of opinion, though contradicted by
wise and able men.</p>
            <p>§. 8. He addeth, <hi>That it is not consistent with Christs
Wisdom to leave the peace of his Church at the mercy of men's
private opinions; which are most uncertain; for it is not
expected, that all men should be of the same mind. Ans.</hi> 1.
It is too great rashness to think that Christ cannot be a
wise Governour of his Church, unless he take courses
for its setlement, that our Wisdom thinketh meet. I
hope Christ may wisely govern his Church and yet not
leave it to Men to determine, what shall be the form of
it's Government, which yet cannot be, if this reason
prove that, which it is brought for. 2. We may easily grant
the conclusion of this argument, without giving the least
advantage to the assertion, which it is brought to prove.
It is true, Christ hath not left the peace of his Church
at the mercy of men's private opinions; <hi>viz.</hi> So as that
there can be no peace in the Church, except all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in opinion about all things: for peace may be
maintained among dissenting Brethren, by harmony of
affection, mutual forbearance, and a prudent manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and concealing of our opinion, so far, as it may be
without sin: and all this may be done without deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, which we differ about, to be determined by
Christ; and asserting it to be a thing left indifferent.
And if this be not particable, either through the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the truth, that we dissent about; in that it is
practical, or so important that it cannot be concealed;
or through the obstinacy, or wrong zeal of dissenters;
the Lord hath not left his Church without a Remedy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in this case, <hi>viz.</hi> they who do unreasonably dissent
must be censured, or shunned: and if this cannot be
done without breach of peace, it is our Lords Wisdom
to provide, that we should rather loose Peace then
Truth. 3. All that is here said will as well prove, that
there is no fixed trnth in any controverted point, though
of never so great concernment: for it may be said also
in these, that Christ hath not left the peace of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57560:10"/>
Church at the mercy of Men's private opinions, which
are not the same in the most fundamental points. But
of this enough.</p>
            <p>§. 9. From what hath been said, we may see what
fit advice this healer giveth, while he thus saith, <hi>p. 3.
The only way left for the Churche's setlement and peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such variety of apprehensions, concerning the means and
method in order to it, is to pitch upon such a foundation, if
possible to be found out, whereon the different parties, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their private apprehensions, may yet be agreed to carry on
the same work in Common, in order to the peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church of God.</hi> Hitherto we consent with him,
and wish he would help us to such a Foundation, so as
it self be founded on the Word of God and not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to it. But he goeth on. <hi>Which,</hi> saith he, <hi>cannot be by
leaving all absolutely to follow their own ways; for that were
to build a</hi> Babel <hi>instead of</hi> Salem. This also we grant:
but that which follows we cannot agree to. <hi>It must be
then,</hi> saith he, <hi>by convincing men, that neither of these ways
to Peace and Order, which they contend about is necessary
by way of Divine command (though some be as a means to an
end) but which particular way or form it must be, is wholly
left to the prudence of those, in whose Power and Trust it is to
see the Peace of the Church secured on lasting Foundations.</hi> If
this be a fit way of healing Church-rents, then those
Churches are in the best way to peace, who cast away
the Bible, and will not look there what God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
because some may say, he hath commanded
this, and others, he hath commanded that: and so
refer all controversies to be determined by men, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
nothing to be determined by God. And indeed
this is the basis that the peace of the Popish Church
standeth upon: and I believe no Jesuit would have
given another advice, than this, toward the setling of our
divided condition. What? Must we say that neither
way is commanded of God, whether it be so or not?
when we can prove from Scripture that this is Christ's
Institution, that not, but a device aud usurpation of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57560:10"/>
men; must we yield this our ground? and leave the
whole matter to men's wills, as being the readiest way
to peace. If this be his cure for Church-Divisions, I
believe they, who take the word of God for their rule,
especially in Church-matters, will think it worse than
the Disease. Every way to peace is not a good way,
otherwise there were no duty at any time to contend for
<hi>the truth, once delivered to the Saints, Jude</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>§. 10. I do not dissent from the learned Author in
his Determinations about the Nature of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right,</hi> but must examine some of the Principles, from
which he will have <hi>a Divine Right</hi> to be inferred.
Wherefore as to the rest of the first Chapter, I first
take notice, that what he largely discourseth from <hi>p.</hi> 6.
to <hi>p.</hi> 11. concerning the lawfulness of that, which is
not forbidden by God; however it may be granted
<hi>sano sensu</hi> (on which I now insist not;) yet it doth not
reach his point, unless he prove that Christ hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<hi>no species of Government;</hi> for if he hath determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one, then all other inconsistent with it are <hi>eo ipso</hi>
prohibited: Wherefore, though we grant to him, that
<hi>ratio regiminis ecclesiastici</hi> is <hi>juris naturalis;</hi> yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
grant, except he proves it, that the <hi>modus</hi> of it is
<hi>juris divini permissivi;</hi> that is to say, it is <hi>juris humani;</hi>
but we assert it to be <hi>juris divini, partim naturalis, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
positivi, viz.</hi> in respect of the divers parts, of which
that Form is made up, which are approved of God.</p>
            <p>§. 11. To make up an Obligation, whereby we are
bound to a thing as duty, we assert with him, that there
is required <hi>Legislation and Promulgation of it.</hi> But what
he saith of the way of Promulgation of Divine Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Laws, that is necessary to lay an Obligation on us,
I cannot fully agree to. <hi>P. 12. He asserteth that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
binds Christians as an universal standing Law, must
be clearly revealed as such, and laid down in Scripture in
such evident terms, as all who have their senses exercised
therein, may discern it to have been the will of Christ, that
it should perpetually oblige all Believers to the Worlds end;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57560:11"/>
as is clear in the case of Baptism and the Lords Supper.</hi>
But because the learned Author could not but see, how
obvious it was to every one to argue against this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the instances of the change of the Sabbath,
and Infant Baptism, which he acknowledgeth to be
<hi>Christs Will and Law established,</hi> and yet not <hi>thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;</hi>
therefore he laboureth to obviate that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by this exception; (to wit) that <hi>there is not the
same necessity for a particular and clear revelation in the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of a Law unrepealed in some circumstances of it, as
there is for the establishing of a new Law: The former</hi>
(saith he) <hi>may be done by a different practice of persons
infallibly guided; as in the case of the change of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
and Infant Baptism; not so the latter.</hi> To this I
reply a few things. 1. It had been good, if, in an
Assertion so fundamental to his whole discourse, and
so positive for the clearness of Divine Laws, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had used more clearness; there is no small muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ambiguity in his expressions, which I must a
little remove. And first, when he saith, that <hi>Christs
Laws must be revealed clearly as such;</hi> either he meaneth
(as <hi>Hooker, Eccles. polit.</hi> defending this Opinion of our
Author's, expresseth it) that they must be set down in
the <hi>Form of Laws.</hi> But it is too great presumption to
prescribe to him, how he should word the intimations
of his will to his People; or in what mode or form he
should speak to them: His will manifested to us is that
which obligeth us; and this may be without such a Form.
Or he meaneth, that Christs Laws must be so clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
as that <hi>we may come to know, that this we are to do,
and that to forbear, and that he would have us to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it as his Will;</hi> and this we agree to, and do
maintain, that the Form of Church-Government is
thus revealed. Another ambiguity is, that he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them to be laid down <hi>in such evident terms as all who
have their senses exercised therein, may discern them to be
his will to oblige us.</hi> If he mean that they, who have
<hi>competent understanding and means, and do seriously search
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57560:11"/>
the truth in these things</hi> (which, I suppose, is the meaning
of having their senses exercised in them) may for the
objective evidence of the things come to know them;
this we do not deny; if he mean, that <hi>such will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be convinced of them, and that there can be no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
insuperable by them, neither in the Object, nor in
their blindness or prejudice, or other Infirmity or Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that they lye under, which may make them, that they
cannot see that to be the will of Christ, which is so revealed;</hi>
this we utterly deny. Now this latter, not the former,
must be his meaning, because it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which I will not impute to so learned a man; for
what is not so revealed, is not revealed at all, seeing
it is unintelligible by defect of objective light; now, to
say that Christ's Laws must be thus revealed, is to say
that they must be promulgated, some way or
other; which was never questioned by any; and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing for his design, <hi>viz. that Christs Laws must be
so revealed, as that the disputes about them shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away.</hi> Yea, he cannot mean this, for the change of
any Circumstance of an old Law must at least be thus
revealed, else it is not revealed at all; and yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
another sort of Revelation of new Laws, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
from what hath been said.</p>
            <p>§. 12. 2. If this Assertion thus explained were true,
there should remain no more Controversie among seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and learned men about any of the Laws of Christ;
for such have their senses exercised in these things:
Wherefore they may (if we believe this Author)
know such to be Christs Laws, and therefore cannot
be in an Errour about them. But how absurd this is,
sad Experience maketh too evident: Is it not a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
whether Christ hath appointed seven or but two
Sacramentst? whether he hath commanded us to pray
to Saints departed? whether Excommunication be by
his Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We must then either say, that Christ hath
made no Law in these things; or that men cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in them; but that they who oppose the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57560:12"/>
do oppose that which they know to be Christ's
Law, or that Christ hath made and revealed a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these things, but these men cannot see it, which
is contrary to the Author's Assertion.</p>
            <p>3. Is it not enough to bind the Conscience of any, who
soberly seek to know what is the good, and perfect, and
acceptable will of God, that the Lord in his word hath
given some intimation, from which we may gather, that
such a thing is his will: Sure, seeing it is his will, that
bindeth the Conscience, whatever way we come to the
knowledge of this will, we are obliged by it to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Now we may be able, in some cases, to deduce
from Scripture such a thing to be the will of God,
though it be not set down in such evident terms as are
here mentioned, as is clear to any who do consider.
4. There are many points of Truth, or many <hi>Credenda,</hi> in
the Scripture, which want such an Evidence of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as is here required; which yet we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as the truths of God; for it is clear, that the
Lord hath taught us many things in the Bible, as it were
on the bye, and left them to be gathered from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Assertions: yea many times Truths are couched in
Duties commanded, as Commands also are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in Assertions and Promises. Now if this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of terms in the Revelation of the <hi>Credenda</hi> of
Religion be not necessary to bind the Conscience to
believe, how is it imaginable, that it should be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Revelation of the <hi>Agenda,</hi> to bind the Will to
act? seeing the Lord doth as peremptorily require us
to believe what he hath said, as to do what he hath
commanded. 5. For the exception that he maketh of
the <hi>changing some Circumstances of old Laws;</hi> I see not
on what Foundation of reason, the difference between
these and new Laws can stand; but that this shift
serveth his purpose: For (to take his own instance)
supposing a standing Law for a Sabbath, and that the
<hi>seventh day must be kept:</hi> This Circumstance (as he is
pleas'd to call it) that not the <hi>seventh,</hi> but the <hi>first day</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57560:12"/>
be kept, is really a new law: yea there are here two
new laws; one abrogating what was before, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it no duty to keep the <hi>seventh day:</hi> another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing
a new, which was not before, and making
it a duty <hi>to keep the first day.</hi> Now if this may be
thought no obliging law of Christ without that evidence
of revelation, which he talks of, why may not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, that was not such before? If we are to look
to <hi>Apostolick practice</hi> as ground sufficient why we should
think it Christs will, that <hi>we should keep the first day of
the week to the Lord;</hi> which was not done before; why
should we not think the same ground sufficient, why
<hi>Ministers should rule the Church by a parity of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
Yea, reason would say, that there is need of more
clearness, in the revelation of Christ's will for altering
a standing law in such of it's circumstances as doth
annul one duty, and establish another, than for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that as duty which is altogether new, seeing in
the former, we must both know the will of God in
abrogating and establishing: in the later we are to
know only, that he will stablish such a thing.</p>
            <p>§. 13. In his examination of what maketh an unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Divine right, I agree to most that he teacheth;
only his <hi>Postulatum p.</hi> 14. one which he buildeth all his
assertions, needeth to be a little cleared. He asserteth
that <hi>nothing can be founded on Divine Right, nor bind Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
as a positive Law, but what may be certainly known
to have come from God, with an intention to bind Believers
to the Worlds end.</hi> Where I only take notice that, though
<hi>Plerophory</hi> in that case be very desirable; yet such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is not necessary to our obligation: But so much
knowledge of the will of God as may satisfie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
by Jnclining it to the one hand, and not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it absolutely in suspence. If this be not sufficient,
we shall take off all obligation of Gods positive laws
from most men: for few have plerophorie in most
things. I agree with him, that <hi>a divine right is built
on the law of nature, and on the immutable positive laws
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57560:13"/>
of God:</hi> also, that these are three good marks of the
immutability of divine positive laws, which he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
viz. <hi>when the reason of the law remains: when God
hath declared such a law never to be changed: when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to the being of a Society, that he would have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</hi>
Only I cannot see how these (espeeially the
former two marks) do consist with the <hi>mutability of that
Church government,</hi> (in these things we controvert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout)
which the Apostles practised (no doubt, as being
Christs will and law) seeing there is the same reason
for parity now, that then was: and Christ hath not
said, that he will have it altered in after ages.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Page 23. He comes to examine some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
(as he is pleased to call them) for a divine right.
And first, he laboureth to enervate the argument for
the divine right of Church-Government, taken from
<hi>Apostolical practice:</hi> of which he promiseth to say
more after: but what he here saith, we shall examine.
I yield to him, that <hi>all Scripture examples do not bind;</hi>
neither doth any example bind as an example: also,
that the <hi>rule, whereby we know what examples do bind, is
not immediately obligatory, but directive.</hi> I grant likewise
that in such examples, that which bindeth us, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>moral nature of the action,</hi> or the <hi>law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to follow the example.</hi> And yet all these concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
yield him no advantage, neither bring our cause
any loss: for when he requireth us, who plead for the
divine right of a particular form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Apostolical example, to shew either the
<hi>morality of their actions;</hi> or <hi>a law commanding us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them:</hi> I Answer, as to the first, there needeth no
particular demonstration of the morality of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
actions: but this we can say for them, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and condition of the actions, and the Apostles
doing of them, being considered; reason will not suffer
us to question the morality of them. I mean it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they are the will of Christ: for we must think
that in matters not light and occasional, but weighty
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57560:13"/>
and of great concernment whether they be well or ill
done; and which were done on mature deliberation;
as the administration of the affairs of Christ's house:
in matters, I say, of this nature, we are to think that
the Apostles did that which was best and most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of God; they being infallibly guided by his spirit.
Now that, which was best to them, must certainly be best
to us also, we managing the same affairs; except some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of our case from theirs can be shewn: wherefore we
are obliged to think that the parity of Ministers in
ruling the Church, is Christ's will, and so a moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
(not a thing indifferent) seeing it was so in the
Apostolick Churches; as, I suppose, is proved by the
maintainers of that way: and there is no reason why
it should be otherwise with us than with them. For
the second, we have also a law for following Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
example (as we have for following Christ's exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
which, our Author saith, maketh it our duty) <hi>viz.
1 Cor. 4. 16. Wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of
me.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I am
of Christ.</hi> And lest any think that this command of
imitation is only in reference to duties otherways
known to be such, as faith, love, &amp;c. it is evident
that this last place relateth to Church administrations;
for he prefixeth this exhortation to the doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and purity in their worship. Beside, that the
exhortation being general, can suffer no exception,
but where imitation would not have the same morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in us, that giving example had in them, <hi>viz.</hi> where
the case is different. Other Scriptures to the same
purpose are <hi>Phil. 3. 17. Heb.</hi> 6. 12. and this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
(which clearly supposeth a command) 1 <hi>Thes.</hi>
1. 6. and 2. 14. 2 <hi>Thes. 3. 9. Ja.</hi> 5. 10. Wherefore, if
we can shew Apostolical practice for our way of
Church-Government (as I know we can) it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on our adversaries to shew a reason why they did
such things, which doth not agree to our case; or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57560:14"/>
else to submit to that way, as that which is Christ's law.
For the other grounds of divine right, that he examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
we insist not on them, as not being necessary to
the defence of that truth which we maintain. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I wave what might be said against what he there
disputeth.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>§. 1. IN the second chapter of the first part of his <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum</hi>
he layeth some hypotheses for a foundation
of his following discourse: where I shall pass over in
silence, these things that have truth in them; and
these also, the examining of which is not needful to
the present purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> defending Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to be <hi>juris divini.</hi> Only, I take notice, that
here, and through his whole book, he spendeth most
of his pains and learning, in proving these points,
which are either digressions from the present business,
or are not denied by any of his opposites: which is
<hi>magno conatu nihil agere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. In his fourth hypothesis, <hi>p.</hi> 38. some things
need our remark: he setteth it down thus: <hi>In things
which are determined both by the law of nature and divine
positive laws, as to the substance and morality of them, but
not determined as to all circumstances belonging to them, it is
in the power of lawful authority in the Church of God to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them so far as they judge them tend to the promoting of the
performance of them in due manner.</hi> Two things in this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
I condemn. 1. That he warranteth men to
determine things undetermined in the Church, so far
as <hi>they judge needful:</hi> he should have said, so far <hi>as is
needful:</hi> for if we hold this his assertion <hi>in terminis,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
men in lawful authority may bind us in all
things where Christ hath left us free; so that it shall
not be lawful to speak, look or act in the Church,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57560:14"/>
but as they think fit. And indeed here is a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for almost all the Ceremonies that either Popes or
Prelates ever burthened the Church of God with: they
are nothing but determinations of what is left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;
and they judge them to tend to promote
worship: as, it is not determined, what Garment a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
shall wear, the Church judgeth a Surplice to
tend to promote worship: then by this hypothesis,
the Church may determine this: which is not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
truth, as might easily be shewed, if that were now
my work, but also against this Author, who declareth
himself against Ceremonies of Mens appointing.</p>
            <p>2. That he extendeth this determining power so far,
that not only things undetermined, and that must be
determined, otherwise the Ordinances cannot be gone
about without defect or sin, may be determined by
lawful authority (for this we grant, and therefore do
close with his example of appointing the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
hour for worship) but also things that <hi>they judge
tend to promote the due manner of the Ordinances,</hi> may
be thus determined; which a little after he expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the <hi>decency and solemnity of worship.</hi> This we
cannot assent to: For there is no pompous Ceremony
that ever man devised, but they judged it fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the solemnity of worship. And indeed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
condemning the pompousness and gaudiness of
worship, and commending the simplicity of it, saith
plainly, that it is not left to men to add their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
to God's, to make the worship as solemn as
they judge meet; but that we ought to be content
with that solemnity, which is made in worship by God's
Institutions, and the needful determination of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
Neither can this blow to his hypothesis be
evited, by saying, that he speaketh only of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
which we confess may be determined by the
Church. For 1. All Ceremonies are also circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and he doth not here mention meer circumstances,
to exclude Ceremonies from the determing power of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57560:15"/>
Authority in the Church. 2. Though he should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of meer circumstances, <hi>viz.</hi> which are such
before they be determined; as the habit in which we
are to worship: yet even such, when they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by men without necessity, only, that they may
add to the worship a decency, which is not needful
by nature, civil custom, nor divine institution, they
become Religious Ceremonies; their end being Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and they being peculiar to Religion: As I have
shewn in another piece.</p>
            <p>§. 3. It seemeth to me very strange, and not to
be passed over in our Animadversions; that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
of this his hypothesis, wherein he had ascribed a
determining power to lawful Authority in the Church;
he taketh notice of no power or Authority seated in
Church-men; but speaketh only of the Magistrate: for
<hi>p.</hi> 38. shewing why there is need to prove this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
he tells us of <hi>some that give no power, and some
that give little power to the Magistrate about Religion:</hi>
and then falleth upon a large debate of the Magistrate's
power in Church-matters. Which is an evident sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
that all Church-power is in the Magistrate,
and in none else: otherwise this discourse should be
very impertinent to his hypothesis. But this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a gross falshood, as is fully proved by many
worthy men against <hi>Erastus</hi> and his followers. I
shall not now ingage in that large debate. If we
should grant a determining power to any authority
about the things in hand, it should not be to the <hi>Civil
Magistrate;</hi> but to the Guides of the Chnrch met in
a lawful Assembly. And it is not only contrary to
truth, but a contradiction to what this Author wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
elsewhere, in his Appendix about <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
where he taketh much pains to assert a power
of Discipline in the <hi>Church-Guides:</hi> and if so, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Magistrate is not the lawful Authority in the
Church: for that implyeth Church Authority. I hope
he will not say, that Ministers have lawful Authority in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57560:15"/>
the State; because they have no Civil Authority: why
then should we say, or suppose, that the Magistrate
hath lawful Authority in the Church; except he think
that the Magistrate hath <hi>Church-Authority?</hi> against which
he there disputeth; especially seeing <hi>Respublica non est
in Ecclesia, sed Ecclesia in Republica;</hi> he that hath only
Civil power, hath no power in the Church, whatever
he hath about Church-matters, and over Church-men.</p>
            <p>§. 4. In asserting the Magistrates power in these
things, he professeth, that <hi>he will not so much make his
way through any party, as strive to beget a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
among them that differ:</hi> how well he keepeth
his promise may be seen, by examining what he saith;
on which I will not much insist, (intending to meet
with this his Doctrine elsewhere) but only mark what
is amiss, with a short ground of our censure
of it: for this debate is somewhat extrinsecal to the
<hi>indifferency of Church-Government:</hi> it rather supposeth
it, than asserteth or proveth it. In explicating his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
distinction about the Magistrate's power, <hi>p. 41.
The internal, formal, elicitive power of order,</hi> saith he,
<hi>lies in the Authoritative exercise of the Ministerial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
in Preaching of the word, and Administration of the
Sacraments; but the external, objective, imperative power
of jurisdiction lies in a due care and provision for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
protection, and propagation of Religion.</hi> The former
is only proper to the <hi>Ministry,</hi> the later to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistracy.</hi> Here several things are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
1. That he maketh the power of Order to be all one
with internal, formal, elicitive power about Church
affairs; and the power of Jurisdiction the same with
external, objective and imperative power about them.
This is instead of distinguishing to confound things
most different: for, I hope, he is not Ignorant that
all the Assertors of Church-power against the <hi>Erasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
do distinguish Church-power, or the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven (for so is this power designed
by Christ) in the power or Key of Order; and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57560:16"/>
power or Key of Jurisdiction. Let the Author shew
us one (not <hi>Erastian)</hi> who before himself did ever
make the power of Order in the Church to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all formal and elicitive Church-power. Yea, he
doth by this most evidently contradict himself (which
I wonder to meet with so often in such a learned man)
for in his Appendix he maketh the power of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
to be <hi>in the Church;</hi> and so to be <hi>formal, internal
and elicitive Church-power:</hi> and sure the power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
is the power of <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> not of <hi>Order:</hi> not
only because all that speak of this distinction do so
understand it: but also our Author doth here make
the <hi>power of Order</hi> to respect only the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
and so the <hi>power of Discipline</hi> must belong
to Jurisdiction, according to him: now whereas he
maketh the power of Jurisdiction there to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
only in the Church: and here to be external in the
Magistrate only; if this be not a contradiction, let
any man judge. 2. Another thing, that here I take
notice of, is, that the power which he ascribeth to
the Ministry is only <hi>Administration of the Word and
Sacraments.</hi> Then they have no power of <hi>Discipline,</hi> for
every one knoweth that that is some other thing than
the Word and Sacraments. Now this is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the whole of his own Appendix: and also to
Scripture, which giveth to Church-Officers power of
<hi>binding and loosing, Mat. 18. 18. Jo.</hi> 20. 23. and <hi>of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Lord's People, 1 Thes. 5. 12. Heb.</hi> 13. 17. But
I insist not on this, it having been made evident by
so many against the <hi>Erastians.</hi> 3. He ascribed all
power about Church affairs to the Magistrate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that of Administring the Word and Sacraments;
and so to the Magistrate as it is only belonging to
him: for he giveth him that which he called the power
of Jurisdiction, and that is to him all power but that
of Word and Sacraments. Now there was never any
<hi>Erastian</hi> that gave more to the Magistrate than this:
for by this means, he hath all the power of deciding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57560:16"/>
controversies in Synods (for that is not preaching of
the Word) of Ordination, the exercise of Discipline,
&amp;c. and none but he hath any share in it. Behold
unto what absurdities this man runneth unawares,
while he maketh it his business to unhinge that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which Christ hath setled in his Church.
And indeed I cannot but take notice of a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
connexion between this putting all Church-power
in the hands of the Magistrate, and denying it to be
<hi>juris divini.</hi> For he knew well, that if it had been
left to be decided by Church-men among themselves;
it had not been easily determined amidst the interest
of men clashing one with another; the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
and self-denied sort being ever the
fewest.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Page 42. Speaking of the Subordination or
Co-ordination of the Magistracy and Ministry, there
be some mistakes worthy of our notice. Though he
acknowledgeth the <hi>person of the Magistrate to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the word of God,</hi> yet he denieth it to <hi>be subject
to the power of the Ministers.</hi> This is the Doctrine of
Court-preachers, who love to flatter rather than speak
truth. But consider. 1 It is to me an inconsistency,
that Ministers have power or authority of Preaching
the Word; and the Magistrate's person is subject to
this Word, and yet he is not subject to the power of
Ministers. When they teach, rebuke, exhort with
all authority and command in the name of the
Lord; doth not this reach Magistrates as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if they be subject to the word of God? I see
not how they are subject to it, if they be not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to it as declared by Christ's Embassadors, which
is the ordinary way of dispensing it: and if so, then
are they subject to the Preaching power of Ministers
at least. 2. Magistrates are also subject to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
power of Ministers: for they rule over Christ's
Flock; the Members of the Church, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
if the Magistrate be, I see no ground in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57560:17"/>
for exempting him from the power of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
When Christ said, <hi>Whosesoever sins ye remit,
they are remitted, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are
retained;</hi> he did not add, except the supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
May not, I pray, the Pastors of the Church
debar him, if he be a flagitious man, from the Lord's
Table, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> did to <hi>Theodosius?</hi> and if they may,
certainly the Magistrate personally considered is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ruling power of Pastors in spiritual things;
as they are subject to him in civil things. And to
deny this, what is it, but to make the supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
head of the Church and not a Member of it?
Much more worthy to be received is the opinion of
<hi>Crysostome,</hi> who speaketh thus to Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in reference to abstention from the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<hi>Si dux igitur quispiam, si Consul ipse, si, qui dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demate
ornatur, indigne adeat, cohibe ac coerce; majorem
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u illo habes authoritatem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. He cometh afterward, <hi>p.</hi> 43. to ascribe to the
Magistrate not only a <hi>political power,</hi> which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to lie in the Execution and Administration of
laws for the common good: but also an <hi>Architectoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Nomothetical power</hi> (though not absolute and
independent) whereby he may make laws in things
that belong to the Church. His meaning in this he
expresseth more fully in the end of <hi>p. 44. In matters,</hi>
saith he, <hi>undetermined by the word of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the external policy of the Church of God, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
hath the power of determining things, so they
be agreeable to the word of God.</hi> And because he
knew that the Church-Guides would put in for this
Power, that here he giveth to the Magistrate, therefore,
<hi>p.</hi> 45. he laboureth to reconcile these parties, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
or two, <hi>viz.</hi> between <hi>declaring Christ's Laws, and
making new Laws:</hi> and between <hi>advising what is fit,</hi> and
<hi>determining what shall be done.</hi> The declaring and advising
Power is given by him to the Church; the Authoritative
determining power to the Magistrate. For <hi>p. 46. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57560:17"/>
great use,</hi> saith he, <hi>of Synods and Assemblies of Pastors of the
Church is, to be as the Council of the Church unto the King;
as the Parliament is for matters of Civil Government.</hi> And p.
47. but yet, saith he, <hi>When such men thus assembled
have gravely and maturally advised and deliberated what is
fittest to be done; the force, strength, and obligation of the
thing so determined doth depend on the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Civil Magistrate.</hi> Against this Doctrine (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I come to examine the Reasons that he bringeth
for it) I have these things to say. 1. It must be noted
(by passing over which in silence our Author hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
the matter) that we are not here speaking of
things that are properly Civil, though belonging to the
Church, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is a Society, and in the Common-Wealth;
such as Church-rents, Meeting-places, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the use of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of the Government
of the Church, as it is a Church, of its Discipline;
which things are properly the external policy of that
Church, as our Author termeth that which he speaketh
of. Now the Question is, whether the Power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
these, be in the Church-Guides or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
2. That which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the
ground of most of this Author's mistakes, is, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
that some things of this Church-policy are so left
undetermined by the word, that they are capable of a
determination by men's Legislative power, and that
new Laws may be made about them. This is not truth;
for, if we speak of the Substantials of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
even of a particular Form, it is determined
in the word, and so not subject to men's Nomothetical
Determinations; if of the Circumstances of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are these left for men to make Laws about them,
but they are determined by the Lord, in the general
Rules that are in the word, and the Dictates of right
reason compared with them; and the Obligation, that
lyeth on our Consciences in these things, is not from
the Magistrates Law (though we do not deny but he
may add his Sanction to both sorts of things, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57560:18"/>
make them the Law of the Nation, as Dr. <hi>Stillingsleet</hi>
saith well, that he may with any thing in Religion) but
from the will of God, which ought to be searched out,
and held forth Authoritatively by the Guides of the
Church, that are acting in the name of Christ. 3. It
is false then that the <hi>Magistrate hath Power in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
what of the External Policy of the Church is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in the word.</hi> For if we speak of that which
is not determined at all, neither by particular Praecepts,
or Examples, or otherwise, signifying particularly the
mind of Christ about such a thing, <hi>viz.</hi> by the general
rules of the word compared with right reason, is not held
forth to be the mind of Christ; such things ought not to be
determined by any man or men, but are left to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty; for such things must be determined meerly
by mans will, but the Lord hath not left the matters of his
Church to that crooked rule. But if we speak of things
not determined by particular praecepts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in which
the mind of Christ is deducible by general rules: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here hath the Magistrate the determining Power,
but they, whom the Lord hath made the Guides and
Eyes of his Church; they must declare what is the will
of Christ, not impose what is their own Will or Law.
And here the Obligation is from the will of Christ, not
the Authority of the Church, nor the Magistrate nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the declaration of it from them, whom Christ
hath made his Embassadors. For what I have said, I
give this brief reason, The Affairs of the Church are
to be managed by a Ministerial Power, the farthest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of which is to declare Christ's Laws, and apply
them; as is generally confessed by <hi>Protestants</hi> against <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists:</hi>
but the Magistrate's Power is not Ministerial, but
Magisterial: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not his part to manage or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Affairs of the Church, of which doubtless
her external Policy is no small part, which may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enforced thus; Church-Determinations must be
the Declarations of the will of Christ, but not the
Magistrate, but the Pastors are the Embassadors of
Christ, whose it is to decalre his will: <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not his,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57560:18"/>
but their part to make such Determinations. We
speak not of the Judgment of Discretion, which the
Magistrate hath in these things, in order to the adding
his Sanction to them; and that not only as others have,
theirs being private, and his publick and with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
Bnt we speak of that determination of things,
which is the ordinary means of promulgating to us the
mind of Christ in Church-matters. 4. It is most false
that the <hi>great use of Synods is to be the King's Church-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
as the Parliament is his Civil Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for, 1. himself
acknowledgeth another use of them, while he ascribeth
to the Church, a power of declaring Christ's Laws; is
not this of great use? but Contradictions are no rarity
in this Author. 2. Hence it followeth, that as Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary
Acts have no force without the King's San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
so likewise Church-Determinations have none
without it; and if the Church Excommunicate any
person, it is not valid, nor his sins bound in Heaven,
till the King put his Seal to it; for that such a person be
Excommunicated, is not determined in Scripture.
3. The Council at <hi>Jerusalem, Act.</hi> 15. and all the Councils
before <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, were of no great use; for
they had not this use, there being no Magistrate to own
them as his Council. 4. This destroys that received
Axiom among all them, who are not the avowed Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Erastus, viz.</hi> that the Magistrate's power is cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to the Church, not privative; for it maketh his
to swallow it up, there being no Authority, nor great
use of Synods, without the Magistrate. 5. This taketh
away from the Church entireness of power in her self,
in things that do concern her as such a Society, and a
Capacity to subsist without the Magistrate; which I
hope this Author, when better advised, will not own.
5. It is also false, that when Church-Guides Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
have deliberated and determined, the force,
strength, and obligation of the things of determined,
doth depend on the Magistrate; for it dependeth on the
reason of them containing the Will of Christ, and not
on the Authority of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57560:19"/>
§. 7. I come now to see what Arguments he bringeth
for what he hath asserted. 1. Saith he, <hi>Taking the
Church as incorporated into the Civil State, though the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of these things, the matter of them, and persons deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
them be ecclesiastical, yet the force and ground of the
Obligation of them is wholly Civil. Ans.</hi> That the Church
is in the Republick we do not deny: yet that must not
be so understood as if either these two were not distinct
Corporations, or the Power of the one were subordinate
to, or swallowed up the other. The saying of <hi>Optat
Milev:</hi> (which he citeth) that <hi>Ecclesia est in Republica,
non Respublica in Ecclesia;</hi> will not bear that: but the
meaning is, that either the Church is in the <hi>Rep.</hi> as
the lesser society in the greater, as a few Parishes are in
a County; so the Primitive Churches were in <hi>Rome, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
&amp;c.</hi> or when the Church is <hi>ae<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> late patens</hi> with
the Nation, that the Church is in Protection of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
State, not <hi>e contra;</hi> seeing Kings must be Nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to her, and as it were keep house for her to be nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in. Or speaking of a National Church, that it's being a
nation is Prior in order of Nature than it's being a Church;
because it might be a Nation, and not a Church; but it
cannot be a Church and not a Nation. Now, none of these
do infer that the Obligation of determinations made
by Church men, about Church affairs is civil; but it may
be and is Ecclesiastical, <hi>viz.</hi> from the will of Christ,
which the Church holdeth forth as his Embassadors.
Wherefore this Ratiocination is altogether inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
But he cometh to Authority, to see if that
will help him. He citeth <hi>P. Martyr. lo. com. clas: fig. 4. c.
5. s.</hi> 11. and in 1 <hi>Sam. 8. Nam quod ad potestatem eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticam
attinet, satis est civilis Magistratus: is enim cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
debet ut omnes officium faciant.</hi> What he meaneth for
citing both these places for these words, I know not, un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>less
it be that they are to be found in them both. But I am
sure neither they, nor any thing like them is in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
place (for the later I have not that part of his works)
but the contrary of what this Author intendeth, is there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57560:19"/>
clearly and fully taught, <hi>viz.</hi> he is refuting them who
would have the Power of discipline in the Church to
cease, now when the Magistrate is Christian, and he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth
<hi>Ecclesiastical Power and Civil as distinct:</hi> and only
says that the <hi>Magistrate should correct ministers if they do
not carry as they ought:</hi> but this is far from that, <hi>quod ad
potestatem Ecclesiae attinet, satis est civilis Magistratus.</hi> He
refers, for the judgment of the reformed Divines in
this to <hi>Vedel. de Episc. Const. Mag. et Offic. Magistratus, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi>
to <hi>Grot. de Imper. sum. pot. circa sacra.</hi> But it is well
known that <hi>Vedelius</hi> was an <hi>Erastian</hi> and (as this Author
doth) did fowly abuse the reformed Divines making
them speak what they never thought; wherefore I refer
to <hi>Apol. Triglandius, Revius;</hi> who have refuted that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Pamphlet of <hi>Vedelius.</hi> For the other Author, let
his Citations be weighed, they will never prove that
any of the Reformers gave the Power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
Church-Affairs to the Magistrate.
He addeth three reasons of his Allegation, yet they are
but two, for the two former do coincide, and the strength
of them is; <hi>that it is from the Authority of the Magistrate,
that obligation to obedience or penalty is;</hi> or (which is the
same) it is from him that the <hi>sanction, or annexing of
Penalties to the constitutions, is;</hi> that it is from him only
that the force of obligation is in matters determined by
advice of the Church and which do concern the Church.
<hi>Ans.</hi> All this is easily taken away by a well known di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
in things that are commanded by Christ, and
by his Church declared to be such; and also, are rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the sanction of the Magistrate, there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Obligation: one <hi>Spiritual;</hi> this is from Christ as
Law-giver; and is laid on by the Instrumental interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church as his Herald Proclaiming his will:
Another <hi>civil,</hi> whereby we are bound to external Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
if we contravene such a constitution; this is
from the Magistrate: of this, not of the former the
Author's Assertion is to be understood; otherwise it is
false: For that Obligation is no way from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57560:20"/>
His third reason is, <hi>the Magistrate can null any
Obligation laid on by the Church representative:</hi> as if they
do prescribe some indifferent rites and ceremonies to
be observed by all; he forbidding them the former sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Obligation is null; otherwise these absurdities
would follow. 1. That there <hi>are two Supream Powers
in a Nation at once.</hi> 2. That <hi>a man lyeth under different
Obligations to the same thing. 3. The same action may be a
duty and a sin, viz.</hi> Being forbidden by the one Power
and commanded by the other. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He supposeth
(which we will never yield to him) that <hi>ceremonies may be
indifferent and imposeable by men.</hi> Nay, all the Ceremonies of
God's worship, being worship themselves, are Christ's
institution; otherwise but will-worship: And so him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
understandeth Ceremonies <hi>p.</hi> 68. It is like forgetting
what he here said. 2. It concerneth the Author as
much as it doth us to answer his own Objection, for he
ascribeth to the Church an <hi>intrinsecal power of Discipline:</hi>
Now suppose one be excommunicated; the Church
commandeth it, the Magistrate forbiddeth it; if his
prohibition doth not null the former Obligation, the
same absurdities follow, that are mentioned in his reason;
if it doth, then this doth as much destroy the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Discipline in that Church, which he assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
as it destroyeth the Power of determining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
other Church-matters, which we assert. 3. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that the Magistrate by his power can destroy the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to any Church-Act (being otherwise warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
laid on by the Church, or rather by Christ, the Church
declaring his will (for so the Church only commandeth)
otherwise we might as well say (and it must needs be this
Man's Opinion, if he believe what here he writeth) that
when the Church ordaineth a Minister and commandeth
him to preach Christ, the Magistrate by forbidding him
to speak any more in that name, maketh null the former
Obligation. 'Tis true the Magistrate may, in some
cases, restrain the outward exercise of what we are so
obliged to, and also when he doth injuriously forbid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57560:20"/>
such exercise, we may be, in some cases, obliged to
cede to this violence: but neither of these destroyeth
our Obligation to our duty; neither the power by which
it is laid on; more than the Magistrate doth destroy
my Obligation to obey my Father, or his power over
me, when he putteth me in Prison, and so I cannot do
what my Father commandeth. The Absurdities that he
would fright us with, do not follow from our opinion,
but from his own false supposition. For the first, it is
<hi>not absurd that there should be two Supream Powers about
things so different that one Power cannot have them both for
it's formal Object.</hi> Will not the Author grant that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
have the Supream preaching power, that is not
subordinate to the Magistrate: and the Magistrate the
Supream civil Power? Why not then, that they have
the Supream ruling Power in Church affairs? These
Powers need not clash, though they be not subordinate,
being about things so different as are this world and that
which is to come, the Soul and the Body: But this
man feareth that <hi>Caesar</hi> be dethroned, if we confess Christ
to be a King; and so would have Christ's Kingdome
subordinate to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s. For the second, there <hi>cannot be two
Obligations</hi> here; for if the Church keep within her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
her command is Christ's. And so any contrary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
must be null: if not, her Authority layeth on
no Obligation. For the Third, it is the same Argument,
and it admitteth of the same Answer.</p>
            <p>§. 8. Having made the Magistrate the sole Judge and
determiner in the matters of the Church even Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
themselves: our Author proceedeth <hi>p.</hi> 49. to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the extent of his Power, asserted in his former
Hypothesis, and here he proceedeth by three steps.
1. <hi>That there are some things left undetermined by the Word.</hi>
This we assent to, as it is here set down; but cannot
understand it (as he doth, which appeareth a little after)
<hi>of Ceremonies:</hi> but rather of <hi>bare Circumstances of the
worship of God</hi> (if he take these for one, he is very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Nature of both) neither of the <hi>species of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57560:21"/>
Church-Government,</hi> for which this indifferency of things
is here asserted. What he discourseth here of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of indifferency, I shall not insist upon, intending to
meet with it elsewhere. Only I take notice of his concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>p</hi> 53. that in <hi>things wholly indifferent both in respect of their
common nature and their use and end; that are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
nor tend to the peace and order of the Church, there can
be no reason why the Nature of these things should be altered
by humane Laws: wherefore matters that are indifferent as
to a command, but are much conducing to the peace and order
of the Church are the proper matter of humane constitutions
concerning the Churches Policy.</hi> Let it be here considered
that these things are not properly indifferent, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>viz.</hi> where the peace and order of the Church
is injoyned: and if it be so, it is the part of the Church
representative, not of the Magistrate, to Judge what
things are thus conducible to peace and order; and to
hold forth the doing of these, as the Laws of Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 9. His second step is, that <hi>matters of this Nature
may be determined and restrained; and that it is not to the
wronging of Christians liberty, so to do:</hi> And this he doth
very largely prove against some as he pretendeth of
great note and learning; I wonder who they are: For
I never met with any who do deny what he asserteth:
It is true that many do, and that warrantably, maintain;
that where Christ hath left us free, man hath no Power
by his meer will to restrain us; especially in things that
belong to the worship of God: but all do acknowledge
so far as I know, that in things (though not expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded)
which by their nature or circumstances are
made conducible to the ends that Christ hath enjoyned
us to endeavour, the Church may enjoyn us; and that
without making any new Laws; but by declaring the
will of God. This and no more do all the arguments,
which the Author with much pains hath set down, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.
And indeed, if our author had once proved the
<hi>Species of Church Government to be indifferent,</hi> we should
not deny it to be determinable and imposeable (not by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57560:21"/>
the Magistrate, but) by the Church. In the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Arguments, there occur several things that I
cannot assent to; but they not being to the Question in
hand, and intending to touch some of them in a Treatise
else-where, I pass them here; he hath some greedy
hints after <hi>obeying whatever is commanded, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;
the non-obligation of the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> which do
discover his spirit. Though the Author doth state the
Question as hath been said, yet all his reasons whereby,
from <hi>p.</hi> 56. he proveth the <hi>determination of indifferent
things, not to take away our liberty,</hi> doth prove as much,
that <hi>determination grounded on mans meer will doth not take
it away;</hi> for in that case there may be left a <hi>liberty of
judgment;</hi> and there may be <hi>no necessity antecedent to the
command;</hi> as he saith in his first Argument; also in that
case, the <hi>determining of the things supposeth them to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of liberty,</hi> which is a second <hi>medium,</hi> and the <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in that case, is only in respect of contempt and scandal,</hi>
which is his third Argument; and the <hi>repealing of the
law or ceasing of the authority commanding, may free us of
impositions made by meer will,</hi> which is his fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Wherefore these Arguments prove that which
the Author doth not own, if they prove any thing,
which is a token that they prove nothing at all. But
that I may shortly answer them. The first Argument is
inconcludent; for though <hi>radical liberty, (i. e.</hi> a right
to do or not do) be consistent with <hi>such commands, as
men, without warrant from God, lay on us,</hi> (their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
never being able to destroy that right given to us
which is founded on the will of God) yet these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are <hi>an unlawful taking away of the exercise of our
liberty:</hi> for where neither Scripture nor Reason (which
are Gods law) do bind, mans will ought not to bind;
especially in the things of Religion. He hath here, <hi>p.</hi>
57. a gird by the way at them who hold <hi>one posture of
receiving the Lords Supper to be necessary,</hi> as more destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liberty, than doth the command of the Magistrate
imposing one posture. <hi>Answ.</hi> If they hold this without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57560:22"/>
warrant from the word of the Lord; I yield to what
he saith; but if they can prove that we ought in this to
imitate Christ, and keep a table-gesture as he did; it is
no destroying our liberty, unless he think it less liberty
to be bound to the will of Christ, declared by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than it is to be bound to the will of men. Other
falshoods I pass over (it not being my intention to touch
every thing) but I wonder at a gross aspersion that he
layeth on the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. <hi>that he did use the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Ceremonies, (as that he circumcised</hi> Timothy) <hi>when
they were not only</hi> mortuae <hi>but</hi> mortiferae, and that, where
there was no opinion of their necessity. What is it I
pray to say they were <hi>mortiferae,</hi> but that it was sin to
use them? (for when they were <hi>mortuae,</hi> they were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
not as to the opinion of their necessity, but as
to their use) then <hi>Paul</hi> used them when it was sin to
use them. I hope the Author will not own this when
he is better advised: but we see whither zeal for an
errour will lead men. His other Arguments run on the
same mistake, <hi>viz.</hi> they prove that <hi>radical liberty is not
taken away whatever be commanded:</hi> but they prove not
that when men command without warrant from the
Lord, they hinder that exercise of liberty that the
Lord alloweth us. Wherefore I need not insist on any
further Answer to them. <hi>p.</hi> 59. He maketh this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>laws concerning Ecclesiastical and Civil
things;</hi> that these bind <hi>extra casum scandali &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
those <hi>not so;</hi> whether this doth consist with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that both these Laws are from the Magistrate,
let it be considered. I thought that the different way
of obligation had been from the different Authorities,
not from the things about which the Laws do converse:
and that violation of all the Magistrates Laws, had been
alike opposite to his Authority. I mean, where the
things are of equal moment, as certainly may be in
things Civil, and Ecclesiastical. The wise advice of
<hi>Ambrose</hi> to <hi>Augustine</hi> (which he citeth <hi>p. 60, 61.)</hi> I do
with <hi>Augustine</hi> reverence as <hi>coeleste graculum:</hi> so it be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57560:22"/>
understood of Customes truly indifferent: but that
the things we plead about, and that the Author would
permit to the will of the Magistrate; are such, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yield: Wherefore all this his pains about indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things, is to small purpose. what he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 62.
of superstition in the imagined necessity of things really
indifferent, I will elsewhere examine; and what others
also have alledged to that purpose.</p>
            <p>§. 10. His third step is to set bounds to the restraint
of Christian liberty, where his first rule is, that <hi>nothing
be imposed as necessary, but what is clearly revealed in the word
of God.</hi> But what if it be revealed, so as it is visible to
them who read and search attentively; though it be not
<hi>clearly revealed?</hi> must such things be slighted, as no part
of Gods will? but of this we have said enough before.
The second rule is, that <hi>nothing be determined but what is
sufficiently known to be indifferent in its own nature.</hi> The
way to know what is such, he maketh to be, by <hi>taking
the primitive Church, and the reformed Churches to be Judges
in this.</hi> I confess, their decision should have much
weight; but we dare make none Judge, but God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Scriptures. What if Christ hath in Scripture
signified his will in a point, and yet these Churches
looked on it, and used it as a thing indifferent? must
we then think it indifferent? I hope not. This is to
lay too much weight on men: especially considering
that the mystery of iniquity (which did prostitute all
or most of Christs Institutions to mens will; as if
they had been indifferent things) began early to work
in the primitive Church, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 2. and few reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches want their own Lees; from which the
Lord is yet daily purging them. Wherefore I think
(with submission to better judgments) a surer standard,
to know what is indifferent, to be this; <hi>what cannot be
proved to be determined by the Lord in Scripture, and is not
of the Law of nature, neither primarily nor secondarily;
that is to be thought indifferent.</hi> Passing his other rules;
in prosecuting the last, he openeth a door to <hi>humane cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57560:23"/>
(though he seem to speak against them) by
approving the <hi>Feast of Dedication,</hi> the <hi>Jewish Ceremonies
in the Passover:</hi> sure these were some more than ordinary
decency; neither were to be esteemed of the same rank
(as he doth) with <hi>building of Synagogues, hours of prayer,</hi>
which are meer order: the continuation of the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> which was transient; no recurrent
fast; and had a reason then urgent; and the feast of
<hi>Purim</hi> which was a Civil solemnity: and the fasts of the
<hi>4th, 5th,</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Months; which were occasional for
the captivity, and expired with it. But of this matter I
treat at large elsewhere.</p>
            <p>§. 11. In his <hi>5th</hi> Hypothesis, there is an unwary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>things determined, as aforesaid, by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
authority in the Church</hi> (which to him is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate)
<hi>do bind the conscience.</hi> I suppose he meaneth,
that we are bound to obey for conscience sake; and not
that Civil Authority by it self doth reach the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which Protestants with good reason deny against
the Papists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The rest of his first part needeth not our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
seeing it containeth nothing contrary to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
Government; but rather asserteth several parts
of it: wherefore I shall only set down briefly his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
many of which are so many Concessions to us.
He Asserteth,</hi> (cap. 3.) <hi>that</hi> the law of Nature dictates
that there must be a society of men for the worship of God;
<hi>that is a Church. And</hi> (cap. 4.) <hi>that</hi> there must be a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in this society. <hi>Where he maketh 6 things in
this Government to be</hi> juris naturalis; 1. <hi>That</hi> there be
a distinction of persons, and a superiority both of power and
order in some over the rest. 2. <hi>That</hi> the persons so above
others have respect paid them sutable to the nature of their
imployment. <hi>(cap. 5.) The third thing is,</hi> that all things
either pertaining to the immediate worship of God, or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Government of the Church be performed with the
greatest solemnity and decency that may be, <hi>(cap. 6.) Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that there be a way agreed upon to determine and decide
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57560:23"/>
all the controversies arising in the Church, which immediately
tend to the breaking of the peace and unity of it. <hi>Where he
pleadeth for the definitive sentence in the</hi> major <hi>part,
where power is equal; and for liberty of appeals, where
there is subordination; as being of natural right: and
that this subordination must be in a Society consisting
of many Companies or Congregations. (cap. 7.) Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that all who are are admitted unto this Society, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to be governed by the laws of that Society. <hi>(cap. 8.)
Sixthly,</hi> that in a well-ordered Society, <hi>(and so in the
Church)</hi> every offender against the rules of that Society,
must give an account of his actions to the Governours of that
Society; and submit to the censures of it, according to the
Judgment of the Officers of it.</p>
            <p>All this we accept of as truth, but how this last doth
consist with his putting all power of jurisdiction in the
hand of the Magistrate, and leaving the Church-Officers
only power of Preaching and Administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
(of which before) I cannot understand. So
much for the first part of his <hi>Irenicum.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter">
            <head>PART II. CAP. 1, 2.</head>
            <p>§. 1. IN his second part we have also some concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be taken notice of, as <hi>cap. 2. p.</hi> 154.
that <hi>there must be a Form of Government, as necessary, not
by Nature only, but by a Divine Law.</hi> This we receive as
truth, and do thus improve it <hi>ad hominem:</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
cannot shew us any express Law in Scripture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
that there be a Form of Government in the
Church; Neither can any Scripture ground of this truth
be brought, but what is drawn from Apostolick pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
they had a Form of Government, <hi>ergo,</hi> so must
we; seeing it is as needful to us as it was to them.
Now if this be so, why doth the Author dispute so much
against our reasoning from Apostolick practice (where
the case is alike) for this particular Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57560:24"/>
as being established by Divine Law? If their
practice be a sufficient evidence of a Divine Law (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Law of Nature) for this, <hi>that there be a Form:</hi>
why is it not as significant of a Divine Law for this, <hi>that
this is the Form;</hi> where the case of them and us is alike.</p>
            <p>§. 2. We receive also as a concession, <hi>p. 157. that there
is a Divine Warrant for a National Church; and for a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Form of Church-Government.</hi> Also, cap. 2. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
<hi>that the Government of the Church ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
by Officers of Divine Appointment, is of Divine
Right.</hi> Where, in one word, he destroyeth (unawares)
all that he saith for maintaining the lawfulness of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal
Government; for he doth not deny that Bishops
as ruling over Presbyters, and having more power than
their Brethren, are of Humane Constitution; and so
they cannot be Officers of Divine appointment: If so,
then by this Concession the Church ought not to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them; and so Episcopal Government is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
I know not, if he did foresee this Argument taken
out of himself: But in explaining his Concession he
would fain seem to say some other thing than he hath
indeed said: For he saith, that <hi>he here taketh the Church
for the Members of the Church: So that his meaning is, there
must be a standing perpetual Ministry:</hi> And this he prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
largely. This doth no ways explain what he hath
said: For it is one thing <hi>that it be Divine Appointment
that there are Officers;</hi> and another thing <hi>that these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
be such as God hath appointed. Jeroboam</hi> when he
made Priests of the lowest of the People, kept Divine
Institution so far, that he made Priests; and did make
that work common to all: And yet his Priests were not
Officers of Divine Appointment: So neither is the
Church ruled by Officers of Divine Appointment,
though there be Officers who rule, which is Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
except these Officers be such as God hath
Instituted, and not such as men have devised. And
besides this, the Law of Nature dictateth that there
should be Rulers in the Church, distinct from the Ruled,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57560:24"/>
as he had formerly observed: Wherefore he must here
either trifle, or say some more, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Lord must
appoint these sorts of Officers that should govern his Church:</hi>
for the Author is here speaking of what is of Divine
positive Right; having formerly shewed what is of
Divine Natural Right.</p>
            <p>§. 3. In the third Chap. we have the Question stated;
in speaking of the Church as comprehending many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations, (and so excluding the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
way from this Competition) he compareth
these two forms of Government, <hi>viz. 1. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Officers of several Churches, acting in equality of
power, called a Colledge of Presbyters. 2. A superiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
above the Ministry, having the Power of Jurisdiction
and Ordination belonging to it.</hi> Now the Question is not
whether of these cometh nearest to the primitive pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern:
But whether either of them be setled by Divine
Right; so as that the Church is bound to obseeve it.
He holds the Negative: We the affirmative: and we
say, that the former of these two is <hi>Juris Divini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. For proving his opinion, he undertaketh to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate
all the Pleas which are made for the Divine
Right of either of these: Five he proposeth, <hi>viz. 1. A
former Law standing in force under the Gospel. 2. Some
plain institution of a new Law under the Gospel. 3. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
Nature of Apostolical practice. 4. The general
sence of the primitive Church. 5. The Judgement of the
chief Divines and Churches since the Reformation.</hi> Of
these he discourseth severally: And we shall give our
sence of them as in following him we come at them.
But first I must here note a few things. 1. It is an injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
way of stateing the Question about this Divine
Right, to exclude any who put in for it, from the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Competition: Now he knoweth that others besides
these plead a Divine Right of their way; as <hi>Erastians</hi>
will have the keys given by Christ to the Magistrate:
Independents, to the Community, or at least the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of a particular Church (Popery is not excluded,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57560:25"/>
seeing it standeth on the same bottom with Episcopacy)
though I think the Resolution of the question about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right, might have laid both these aside; yet I
think the stating of it might have taken them in; and
they might have a fair hearing; lest some by seeing
Presbytery and Episcopacy laid aside as of no Divine
stamp, might be tempted to take of either of the other
two for Christs Government, rather than leave the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wholly at an uncertainty, and the will of men. But
I observe that though the one of these he doth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
slight; yet the other he doth not pass, out of any
misregard to it; for he laboureth to take all power by
Christ's gift, out of the hands of Presbyters and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
that the Magistrate might have it, <hi>in solidum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. 2. I observe, for further clearing the state of
the Question, that all other parts of these two forms
of Government, are confessed to be <hi>juris divini, vel na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis,
vel positivi,</hi> (as from his concessions have been
manifest, and will yet more appear) only the matter of
Parity or Superiority of Ministers is in question: and
it being so, I propose this to be considered: that Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be of Divine Right, it is sufficient, 1. That Christ
hath given power to all Ministers to rule the Church.
2. That he hath not given a greater share of it to some
than to others. 3. That it is his will that as he hath
distributed this power equally, so that no man make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal;
seeing that cannot be but by taking from the rest
what Christ hath given them, and giving to one what he
hath not given him. If these three be granted, Parity
of Power is Christs Will, and so of Divine Right. Now
our Author agreeth to the first two as Truth: For the
first he asserteth <hi>in terminis;</hi> the second he cannot deny,
while he asserteth Superiority not to be <hi>juris divini;</hi> the
question then is only about the third, <hi>viz.</hi> When
Christ hath given equal power to his Ministers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men may make it unequal, by subjecting one of
them to another; abridging the power of one, and
inlarging the power of another: Or which is all one;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57560:25"/>
whether it be in the power of men, when Christ hath
made but one Officer: to set up another of their own
devising, who shall have a power that Christ never
gave to any Officer in his Church? I am sure, we have
this clear advantage; that Presbyters acting in Parity,
do keep themselves within the bounds of Christs Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and can shew his warrant for so doing; whereas set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a Bishop over them is without that line, and can
be warranted by no divine Institution. Let it then be
considered whether of these is the safest way for us to
take.</p>
            <p>§. 6. 3. I take notice that the Pleas that he ennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merateth
for a particular form of Government, are not
all which may be alledged; there may be many significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the will of God in Scripture, that are neither
set down in the plain terms of a Law, nor expressed by
Apostolical practice. We draw good consequences
from Promises, Reproofs, &amp;c. which may shew us what
is our duty. 4. Let it be minded that it is not needful
for asserting of Divine Right, that we prove it from all
these Topicks: one demonstration that it is the will of
God that such a thing be, is sufficient. 5. The questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being stated as before, the probation will be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon him, who asserteth that it is lawful for men
to make them unequal in power, whom Christ hath
made Pairs: we assert that the power of Ministers that
is of Divine Right, is equal; which the Author doth
not deny: he asserteth further, that men may restrain
this Power in some, and enlarge it in others; for this he
must shew warrant; for <hi>affirmant, incumbit probatio:</hi> we
deny it; and here we might rest, till it can be shewed that
Christ hath given such power to men, to cut and carve
on his Institutions. The <hi>Divine Right of Parity</hi> is built
on the <hi>want of Divine Right of Imparity.</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we hope, <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> to make other Pleas for it
stand good, which he laboureth to make void.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The first plea from a <hi>standing law in the Jewish
Church</hi> we do not insist on, knowing that in matters of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57560:26"/>
Institution, the Old Testament is no pattern for the
New. Neither are we obliged to insist on this Plea, as
he alledgeth, because some of ours do some times make
use of their Example, as in proving a subordination of
Courts: For 1. It is not instituted, but of the law of
Nature; supposing once the unity of more Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
now what is taught by Nature may well be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us by the Law of God to the <hi>Jews;</hi> though we be
not bound by that law, where there is not that reason.
Again, <hi>Jewish</hi> example should have weight with us, where
their case is not peculiar; seeing their practice came
from an Infinitely wise Lawgiver: but this holdeth not
in imparity, or subordination of Officers: It is known
that the High Priest was Typical: that the Priesthood
was annexed to one Tribe, for a peculiar Reason: these
things do not concern us.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <p>HE cometh to the second Plea for a particular form
of Government, <hi>viz. Christs instituting it by a
new Law,</hi> where he alledgeth, that <hi>it is more hotly pleaded
by many, that Christ must do it, than that he hath done it.</hi>
This is a mis-representation, to say no worse. If it be
not proved by the Assertors of Presbyterial Government
that Christ hath instituted that form of Government, let
their cause fall to the ground. We are ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that it were rashness, and a limiting of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
One, to say that he must institute a particular form:
if we were not otherwise satisfied that he hath done it.
But being convinced of that; we may be very much
confirmed in our Opinion, by the consideration of these
arguments, that hold forth, how fit, and how sutable
to the wisdom of God, and the Administration of Christs
Gospel Kingdom it is, that he should take this course;
and not leave the affairs of his House to mans will, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57560:26"/>
lust rather. This is not prescribing to him; but
a declaring of the fitness of what he hath done. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
we do not, neither ever did we argue barely from
the necessity of a particular form to be instituted by
Christ, considering the thing it self only: but from some
Scripture ground holding forth the necessity of it. Now
if the Lord in the contrivance of the Gospel hath made
it necessary to his design that there be a form of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and hath signified this to us by his word: it
is no rashness to assert the necessity of it; even though
we could not (through our darkness) certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what is that form, in all the particulars of it. But I
come to examine what he hath said against the Reasons
that our Authors do bring for the fitness of a particular
form of Christs instituting.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The first of them is taken from comparing Christ
the Lawgiver under the New Testament, with <hi>Moses</hi>
under the Old Testament; and it is thus instituted, <hi>Heb.</hi>
3. 2, 5, 6. That as <hi>Moses</hi> was faithful in that House, as
a Servant; much more was Christ as a Son; if then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
was so faithful as to declare the Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Government of the Church, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
what Form should be used, we must not think
that Christ hath left this undone. To this he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
1. <hi>Faithfulness is the discharge of a Trust: So that the
faithfulness of Christ and</hi> Moses <hi>lyeth in doing the Work that
the Lord laid on them: and this was to be Mediators, the one
Typical the other True.</hi> Moses <hi>had the Pattern shewed him
in the Mount, and therefore faithfulness required that he
should settle that Form, and no other: But it cannot be
made appear that Christ hath any Command from his Father
of setling one Form of Government.</hi> So he, <hi>p.</hi> 176. To
which I reply, 1. Our Argument may be so laid, as this
Answer doth not at all touch it, thus; <hi>It is the Will of
God</hi> (and so entrusted to the care of Christ) <hi>that there
should be a Government in the Church;</hi> as is confessed by
our Author: This Government must be managed, <hi>hic
&amp; nunc,</hi> in some particular Form, as sense and reason
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57560:27"/>
teacheth: Now that Christ might be faithful as <hi>Moses</hi> was
in the discharge of this Trust, it was needful that he
should set down a particular Form to be used by all; or
appoint some who should determine what the particular
Form should be. But according to this mans opinion, he
hath done neither of these: Not the first, for that he
pleadeth against: Nor the second, for our Author can
shew us no Scripture where it is intrusted to any: And
if we should require a plain and direct Law for this, in
express and formal terms, as he doth of us in the like
case; he would find it a hard task: Besides, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
Scripture, there is far more to be said for the power
of the Church, than for the power of the Magistrate in
such a determination: And reason also may, at least, set
them in equal competition, if not cast the Scales in the
favour of the Church, it being a matter purely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,
that is contended about; and yet this man
giveth the deciding power in this to the Magistrate. It
is strange if the Government of the Church under the
Old Testament be so plain, and that under the New be
left at such uncertainty.</p>
            <p>§. 3. 2. That <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ are compared as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators,
I do not deny: but this maketh nothing for, but
against what he intendeth: For their Mediatory Work
taketh in the management of all the dealings that are
between God and his People; and (as it is here spoken
of) is chiefly meant of outward Administrations, of
Teaching and Ruling: For the inward Administrations
of satisfaction for sin, and communicating the Spirit to
Believers, are not applicable to <hi>Moses:</hi> Now the setling
the Government of the Church cannot but be a part of
this Mediatory work, it being of so much and so
near concernment to the spiritual good of believers:
Wherefore Christ and <hi>Moses</hi> are here compared in their
faithfulness, in setling of Church-Government as well
as in other things. This is clearly confirm'd out of the
5th <hi>v.</hi> of that <hi>chap.</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Moses was
faithful in all his house:</hi> Then the Law of Comparison
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57560:27"/>
saith that Christ is also there said to be faithful in all
his House, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all the matters of the Church: Now
it cannot be denyed, but Church-Government is one,
and that a main one, of the matters of the Church.
Wherefore Christ and <hi>Moses</hi> are here compared in their
faithfulness, in this Administration. 3. His Answer
doth not well hang together, when first he will have
them here compared as Mediators, as if the matter of
Church-Government were impertinent to that wherein
they are compared; and yet subjoyneth, that <hi>Moses
his faithfulness lay in keeping close to the pattern shewed
him:</hi> Whereas <hi>Christ had no such command laid on him,
nor pattern shewed him.</hi> If the faithfulness of <hi>Moses</hi> did
ly in keeping Gods command, about Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
how is he only spoken of as a Typical Mediator?
and how is Christ's faithfulness compared with this
faithfulness of <hi>Moses,</hi> seeing he received no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</p>
            <p>§. 4. 'Tis false, <hi>that Christ received no Command about
the Government of the Church:</hi> for the Scripture is clear
that he is made <hi>head of the Church; hath the Government
laid on his shoulders; hath received all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and in Earth, &amp;c.</hi> If he be by his Office King
of the Church, sure it is his Office and Trust to
settle the Government of his Church. This reply he
maketh to himself, and answereth to it <hi>(p. 177.)</hi> in
two or three things: First, he granteth that <hi>Christ is
King of his Church, and doth govern it outwardly by his
Laws, and inwardly by his Spirit; but we must not therefore
say that one Form of Government is necessary, whether it be
contained in his Laws, or dictated by his Spirit or not.</hi> To
this I reply, 1. Neither do we make any such Inference:
If we prove not one Form to be contained in his Laws,
we shall pass from this Argument. That which we say
is, that because he is King, and a faithful King, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
was, who setled a Form of Government, therefore
a Form is contained in his Laws: Not that it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whether it be contained in his Laws or not. 2. If
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57560:28"/>
Christ be King and Governs the Church by his Laws, and
that outwardly; how can it be that the particular Form
of its Government is what many may think fit, and not
of Christs Institution? For the Church is governed by
a particular Form, not by a general notion of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(for <hi>universale non existit nisi in suis singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus)</hi>
if then the particular form be of mans appointing,
the Church is not outwardly governed by Christs Laws,
but by mens; for men make the Laws, or Rule of its
Government. If a King should send a Deputy to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
a Nation, and give him leave to choose what Form
of Government he would, either by himself, or by a
Council where he should have but equal power with the
rest: it could not be said in proper speech, that that
Nation is Governed by the Kings Laws (for he makes
not the Laws of its Government) but by the Laws of
them who determines the particular Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Yea, suppose the King should make some Laws
about it, as that nothing should be acted contrary to his
Will, or Interest, that there should be Government,
and not Anarchy, that there should be Rulers, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
&amp;c. Yet the Nation may rather be said to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the Laws of him who determineth the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Form: seeing the Government doth essentially
consist in the management of a particular Form, and
not in some general directions. This is easily applicable
to our case: for our Author will have Christ to give
some General directious about Church-Government;
and men to determine and contrive the Form: Now let
any judge then, whether the Church in that case be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the Laws of Christ, or the Laws of men?
Wherefore I conclude that this Answer destroys it self,
while it denyeth a <hi>particular Form instituted by Christ,</hi> and
yet will have the <hi>Church outwardly governed by his Laws.</hi>
2. He saith, the <hi>main original of mistakes here, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of the external and internal government of the
Church of Christ: and thence, whensoever men read of
Christs power, authority and government, they fancy it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57560:28"/>
to the outward government of the Church of God, which
is intended of this internal Mediatory power over the hearts
and consciences of men.</hi> Reply. We are willing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
these; and I believe he cannot shew any of
ours who do confound them: yea, we will go further in
distinguishing the outward and inward Government of
the Church than he doth: and I may retort this charge
on himself, hoping to make it appear that he confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
these two, and that this is the ground of his mistakes.
The Government of the Church is then two-fold: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Outward: both these may be distinguished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to divers objects of this Government: for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Government is either that which is exercised in the
conscience; and so is invisible: or that which is exercised in
the Church, or in matters that are properly spiritual
and not civil; though they be visible to men, and so
outward in respect of the conscience. So outward
Government is either such in respect to the conscience,
and it is that we have now described; or outward in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> That that which is exercised
in matters relating to the Church, and yet are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Spiritual but Civil, and concern the Church, not
as it is a Church but as it is a Society. Or we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
thus, the Government of the Church is either
invisible, <hi>viz.</hi> in the conscience; or visible; and this
is either in things that are Ecclesiastical, and so it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in respect to the Church: or in things that are Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and so it is outward. The first of these is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
exercised by Christ; the second mediately, and
that by the Guides of the Church, as his Deputies; the
third by the Magistrate as a servant of Christ in his
Kingdom that he hath over all the World. I hope now
the outward and inward Government of the Church of
Christ is sufficiently distinguished, and not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
as to be the cause of mistakes about it. But
now let us see whether he himself, who chargeth others
with this confounding, be not guilty of it; and doth
not here mistake the truth by confounding the Internal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57560:29"/>
and the External Government of the Church. It is very
evident that it is so: for, 1. He setteth down the bare
terms of a distinction between internal and external Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but doth not tell what he meaneth by either
of them: Whether the distinction be to be applyed to
the Conscience, and so be meant of invisible and visible
Government: Or to the Church, and so be understood
of Ecclesiastical and formal, or of Civil and Objective
Government of the Church: We are to seek in this,
for all his distinction. 2. He seemeth confusedly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to both these, as he here manageth the distinction;
or at least, some things seem to draw the one way,
and some the other: For when he denyeth Christs
power and Authority, spoken of in the Scripture, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the outward Government of the Church, this
must be meant of that Government which is Civil, not
of visible Ecclesiastical Government. I hope he will not
deny that to be a part of Christs Authority. Again,
where he granteth Christs internal mediatory power
over the Conscience; this must be meant of his invisible
Government; both because it is certain Christ hath such
a Power, and our Author here denyeth all other power of
Government to him: Also because no other power
is internal over the Conscience but this. But what-ever
be his meaning, this answer doth not take away the
force of our argument, for if he deny the Scriptures,
that speak of Christs power, Kingdom, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be meant of Civil power, but to be meant of
visible internal power in the Church; this is all we
desire; for if Christ hath such a Kingdom; then the
management of the visible Government of the Church
is his trust; in which his faithfulness would make him
settle a particular form as <hi>Moses</hi> did. Only I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how inconsistent this is with his Principles, seeing
he denyeth any visible power in the Church (save that
of Word and Sacraments, as it followeth immediately)
and putteth all other power in the hand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
as do all the rest of the <hi>Erastians.</hi> If he deny the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57560:29"/>
Scriptures, that speak of Christ's Authority and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to be meant of Visible Ecclesiastical Government,
and make them speak only of an invisible Government
over the Conscience; which is exercised by his Word
and spirit; in this first he is contrary to all men, for
even <hi>Erastians</hi> themselves do grant that Christ hath such
a Kingdom; but they would have it managed by the
Magistrate; whom they make Christ's Vicegerent in
his Mediatory Kingdom: and others do hold such a
Kingdom of Christ, and that it is managed by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of his Church. Secondly, he derogateth from
the Kingdom of Christ, denying that which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of the exercise of his Kingly Office:
What? is Christ a King, not only of Angels, but of
Men, united in a visible Society, the Church; and yet
hath no visible Government exercised in his name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them? this is a ridiculous inconsistency. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he is contrary to many Scriptures which speak of
Christs Kingdom and Authority; and must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of a visible Authority exercised in a visible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
such as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, 11. Setting up of Pastors
there mentioned is a visible act: and it is made an act of
his Authority, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. Christ's Headship is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
with a reference to the ordering the visible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of his Worship. Also, <hi>Psal. 2. 8. Psal. 22. 27.
Psal. 110. 3. Col.</hi> 1. 13. and many other places; which
it is strange daring to restrict to the invisible exercise
of Christs Authority in the soul. Fourthly, this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all these Scriptures which speak of the several
outward acts of the exercise of Christs Government;
as <hi>gathering a people to him,</hi> Isa. 55. 4, 5. Acts 15. 14,
15, 16, 17. <hi>giving them laws,</hi> Isa. 33. 2. Mat. 28. 20.
Mat. 5. 17, 19. Verses, &amp;c. <hi>setting up Officers,</hi> Eph. 4.
10. 11. <hi>giving them power of Discipline,</hi> Mat. 16. 19.
Mat. 18. 17, 18. John 20. 23. Fifthly, it is contrary
to himself; for Preaching and Administring Sacraments
are visible acts: if then Christ as King hath invested
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57560:30"/>
his Servants with this power (which he confesseth <hi>p.</hi>
177. where also he confesseth that he Governeth the
Church outwardly by his Laws) he must have a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Government as he is King of his Church. That
which he addeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that this is made known to us in
the word, but not the other; <hi>viz.</hi> that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a particular Form: this I say, 1. Beggeth the
Question. 2. Destroyeth his Answer, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
Christ's visible Government; for this is a part of
it, which he granteth.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Another Answer he frameth to our Argument
from Christ and <hi>Moses,</hi> p. 177. <hi>That if the comparison of
Christ and</hi> Moses <hi>infer an equal exactness of disposing every
thing in the Church; then we must be bound to all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as the Jews were: but there is this difference between
the Old and New Testament; that there all ceremonies and
circumstances were exactly prescribed; here there are only
general rules for circumstantial things; there, the very pins
of the Tabernacle were commanded; here it is not so, but a
liberty is left for times, place, persons, &amp;c.</hi> Reply, 1.
We do not plead for an equal exactness in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things: We know the Old and New Testament
state of the Church requireth a diversity here: but we
plead for the equal faithfulness of Christ with <hi>Moses;</hi>
now Christ was intrusted with setting up a Government
in the Church as well as <hi>Moses;</hi> whence it followeth
that he behoved to enjoyn the particular Form of it as
<hi>Moses</hi> did: seeing without this, great matters in the
Church, even that whereon its Union and Being, as a
Society, do hang, are left at a great uncertainty, and
exposed to the will of man, who may and readily will
erre. 2. The difference that he maketh between the
Law and the Gospel is most false, <hi>viz.</hi> That there all
circumstances of worship were determined, here not
so: yea, it is with more truth observed by some that
more circumstances of worship, were left to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57560:30"/>
of men under the Law, then now under the
Gospel: For every one of their actions imposed; as
sacrifices, washings, &amp;c. had of necessity abundance
of circumstances attending them; as when, how, with
what Instruments, &amp;c. Wherefore the more ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there were, the more circumstances undetermined.
There is indeed this difference; that God under the
Law did by his command place Religion in many natural
circumstances of worship; as in the day of Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of killing the Passover, &amp;c. and so set them above
the degree of meer circumstances, which he hath not
done under the Gospel: but it doth not follow that all
things, even of greatest moment to Church-Order, and
the worship of God are now left free, because we have
not so many Ceremonies as the <hi>Jews</hi> had; for those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
which are of Civil and common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Religion, and other actions, be left to pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and matters relating to the Government of the
Church, which are of that nature, be also left free:
yet we must not for that, think that the Government it
self, as managed, even the substance of it (which must
lie in a particular Form, seeing a general notion of
Government is not practicable) is left to the will of
men. I hope our Author will not say that the Form of
Government is a circumstance, neither ought he to
say that it is a thing of common concernment to the
Church and other Societies: The Church is a Society
singular, and of another Nature than others, <hi>Cant. 6. 9.
She is but one, the only one of her Mother,</hi> therefore her
Government must be sutable; wherefore it ought not
to be put in, in the same case with the Natural cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
that accompany all our actions; which
here the Author most unwisely doth.</p>
            <p>§. 6. For a third answer he bringeth reasons why <hi>all
punctillio</hi>'s (as he is pleased to speak) <hi>should not be now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
as they were under the Law.</hi> In this we do not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57560:31"/>
contradict him, as appeareth from what is now said:
<hi>Quere non respondes ad rem?</hi> Neither is it savoury to
account the form of Government, by which the visible
being of the Church doth stand, a punctillio: Such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive
expression is not without contempt. But
let us hear his Reasons: The first, <hi>p.</hi> 179. is taken from
the perfection of the Gospel-state above the Jewish:
<hi>That Church needed the fescues of Ceremonies to direct her,
and must have every part of her Lesson set her: This must
not be still</hi> sub ferula, <hi>and not dare to vary in any Circumstance
which doth not concern the thing it self. As boy a at School
hath his Lesson and the manner of learning it prescribed: At
the Vniversity, more general directions do serve. In that
Church every circumstance was determined; in this things
moral remain in force, but circumstantials are left more at
liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The point in question is not here touched:
'Tis not questioned whether the Gospel-Church should
be loaded with Ceremonies as was the <hi>Jewish;</hi> nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in every Circumstance she be bound by a Law (though
he doth falsly suppose that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church was bound
in every Circumstance, as I have already shewed) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whether she be bound in any thing besides the moral
Law: And particularly whether she be bound to a form
<hi>of Church Government.</hi> Such loose declamations as this,
aggravating some absurdities impertinent to the thing
in hand, are no solid refutations. I hope the Church
may be bound to a particular form of Government,
<hi>viz.</hi> to parity of Ministers, and yet have liberty in
abundance of circumstances. His example of a <hi>School-boy,
and one at the Vniversity; of a Son when a Child, and
when at Age,</hi> makes nothing against us: For in both
Cases they are in subjection to some positive commands
of the Master or Father: So is the Gospel-Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some such Commands, though not so many as the
<hi>Jews</hi> were. 2. Is it <hi>contrary to Gospel-perfection</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Commands of Christ as to a Form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57560:31"/>
and to be ruled by a way of his contriving?
This must be a strange kind of perfection that he
dreameth of. We believe that the Church is yet so
imperfect, and will be while on Earth, that she hath
need to be Governed by Christs Laws; and is far happier
in that Case, then if she were left to chuse her own way
in matters of so great Concernment as is the Form of
Church Government. 3. Is it not as contrary, and
far more, to the perfection of the Gospel-Church to be
under a form of Government, imposed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
(as this man would have us) then if it be imposed
by Christ? Sure Christs Yoke is easier then mens; and
his device must be better then theirs. Indeed in things
that concern one Church and not another, it is better
that the prudence of Governours doth determine, then
that there be an Universal Law binding all: But in
things that are equally good to all; it is better to be
under Christs General, then mans particular Law.
Now the thing in debate, Parity or Imparity among
Ministers is attended with the same conveniences, or
inconveniences, in all Countries and Conditions, and
while men are prone to Tyranny on the one hand and
to divisions on the other: Wherefore it is
no ways unfit that Christ should here decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by a general Law. 'Tis not like the Time or place
of meeting, which must vary in divers places: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can he shew us any reason, why it should be one way
in one Church, and another way in another, except mans
pleasure, which is a bad Rule in the matters of Christ.
4. Whereas he saith that <hi>in the Gospel Church things moral
remain in their force; but circumstantials are left at more
liberty:</hi> I suppose he meaneth Natural morality, or
things contained in the moral Law; and not things
that have any morality, or goodness by any Law of
God: for if he meant this latter, he doth but trifle; for his
meaning must be, that things which are not determined
by any command, and have neither good nor evil in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57560:32"/>
them, are left at liberty; which who doth not know?
Neither can he say that it was otherwise in the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Church as this his assertion must imply, if that be his
meaning. If he mean the former (as certainly he doth)
then, 1. it is an ill division of things that belong to the
Church, in Morals and Circumstantials: Be there not
Christs positive institutions which belong to neither
of these kind? The Lord's Supper is no moral
thing in this sence; neither, I hope, is it a Circumstantial
thing that is left at liberty. 2. If he call all things Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial
which are not thus moral; and assert them
to be left at liberty; he doth at one blow cut of all the
institutions of Christ, and will have the Gospel-Church
so perfect as to be under no law of God, but the moral
Law, and what Laws men please to add unto it. This
I hope he will retract when he considereth what he hath
here asserted: For I perceive, that even learned men
can say sometimes they know not what.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 7. His second reason,</hi> p. 180. <hi>is this,</hi> The Form of
government among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Levy</hi> was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the form of Government among the other Tribes; and
their Ecclesiastical Government was one of their Judicial
Laws: Wherefore, if in this we compare Christ with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
we must hold it needful that he prescribe also a form of
Civil Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. When we compare Christ with <hi>Moses,</hi> we have
very good cause to make an exception where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath evidently made it. We compare them then
as two Mediators, entrusted with managing the affairs
which concern mens Eternal Salvation; among which
are Church Administrations: Hence there is Warrant
for stretching that comparison made of them in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to their faithfulness in appointing Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but as to Civil Government the Scripture mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a plain exception, when it evidently holdeth forth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57560:32"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> a State Law-giver as, well as a Church Law-giver;
and it doth as evidently testifie that Christ was
not such; when he denieth his Kingdom to be of this
World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36. And that he is a Judge and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of inheritance among men, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 14. and his
mean condition in the World (unlike to <hi>Moses)</hi> maketh
this farther appear.</p>
            <p>Wherefore there is no necessity of comparing
them in Civil, though we compare them in Church-Administrations.
The Lord was pleased to make the
Government of <hi>Israel,</hi> in respect of Church and State
both, to be <hi>Theocratia;</hi> to give them both kinds of
Laws immediately from himself: That seeing he hath
under the Gospel done otherwise, as to State-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he hath also done otherwise as to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
what a mad kind of consequence is this?
And there is evident reason of this differing Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
under the Law, and under the Gospel. I suppose
if the difference of cases that arise from variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
did permit; it were the happiest case for
God's People to have all their actions and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
particularly determined by the Lord, who is
wiser then men: now the Lord doth thus with them,
so far as it hinders not their happiness, by a load
of multiplicity of Laws: Wherefore, seeing the Church
and State of the Jews were commensurable, being
in one Nation, it was as easie for them to have their
State-Laws determined by the Lord as their Church-Laws:
But it is far otherwise under the Gospel, where
the Church is spread over so many different Nations, of
divers dispositions and manners; to have determined
all things for the Civil Good of all these Nations, which
must be superadded. To the Determinations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Law, would have made the Bible a burthen to
men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57560:33"/>
But it is not so in Ecclesiastical matters, there is
nothing peculiar to the Church as a Church, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Society, but (supposing what Nature Dictates)
may without burthening People with many Laws, be
determined and imposed upon all.</p>
            <p>Hence is it that the Lord saw it for the good of the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Church, to give them both Civil and Church-Laws,
and for the good of the Gospel Church to give them
Church-Laws; but to leave Civil-Laws to prudence
guided by the general Rules of Scripture and Nature.
Neither do I think (as our Author seemeth sometime to
think) that it was <hi>any part of legal bondage to have
Laws from God, even in the least matters: and that which
is Christian liberty to be free from Gods Laws in these
things, when we are bound to the same by the Laws of
men:</hi> I should rather prefer their state to ours, thus
far: but their bondage was, to have many things
determined and imposed upon them which were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
indifferent, and so free: which the Lord hath
now left free under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is not to the purpose to tell
us, that the <hi>Government of the Tribe of</hi> Levy
<hi>was like that of the other Tribes:</hi> For Church-Government
was very different from Civil
Government for all that, <hi>viz.</hi> in this, that it
was in the hand of the Tribe of <hi>Levy,</hi> and no
other Tribe, which was a positive Institution
of God: that it did <hi>cognosce</hi> of other matters
than Civil Government did: that it did inflict
other censures. But let it be never so co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
with Civil Government, yet it was of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57560:33"/>
Gods Institution, which is all that is needful
to our purpose. That <hi>the Form of Ecclesiastical
Government took place among them, as one of their
Judicial Laws,</hi> is a groundless Assertion: Yea,
it is a begging of the Question, and also taking
away the Distinction of Church and State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jews, which is not needful here to
be insisted upon, till some man Answer what
Mr. <hi>Gillespie</hi> in his <hi>Aarons-rod</hi> hath written to
this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 8. His third Reason,</hi> ib. <hi>is,</hi> the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were
an entire People when their Church-Government was setled:
the Gospel Church was but in Forming in Christs and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times: they settled what was for the present need of
the Church in her first Constitution, as in appointing Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
this will not serve when the Church is grown, and
spread: her coat cut out for her Infancy must not be urg'd on
her when grown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This doth no way satisfie the comparing of
Christ's faithfulness with <hi>Moses;</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> gave Laws
in the Wilderness, not only for that wandring conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but for their setled state in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
Must we then think that Christ took care that the Church
in Infancy should have his Laws to be guided by, but
afterward to be left to the Dictates of men? Sure our
Lord was as careful to foresee future needs of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as to provide for present wants.</p>
            <p>2. The Church in the Apostles days, though not so
far spread as now, yet was so multiplyed and setled, as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57560:34"/>
that she was capable to be ruled by Parity or Primacy:
Might there not be a Bishop in <hi>Ephesus, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi>
and especially in <hi>Galatia,</hi> a National Church? Might
there not be a College of Presbyters then as well as
now? Wherefore, if the Apostles provided for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
need, they behoved either to determine either of
these two, <hi>ex ore tuo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. What is there in our case that maketh another
kind of Government needful, then what was needful
in the Apostles times? We have many Congregations
which all need their several Officers, and must be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in common; either by all these Officers, or by some
set above the rest: was not this their case too? I would
fain know where lyeth the difference: may be in this,
there could not then be one Head over all the Churches;
which now may, seeing the powers of the world profess
Christ. It is true, there was a time when Government
could not be setled, <hi>viz.</hi> When first a Church was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Believers very few: But I am sure it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in many places before the Apostles departed this
life.</p>
            <p>4. Must we say then that the Directions in the Epistles
to <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Pet.</hi> and elsewhere, concerning Church-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
do not concern us; but their force ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
with that time? I must see stronger Arguments
than any that this Author hath brought, ere I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of this: and yet it doth clearly follow, out of
what he he saith. Yea, we must say that these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
which tell us what Officers should be in the
Church, as, <hi>Eph. 4. 12. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8.
do not reach us: but it is lawful for the Magistrate (in
this mans opinion) to appoint what Church-Officers he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57560:34"/>
thinketh fit for this time, as the Apostles did for their
time. For he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 181. the <hi>Apostles looked at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of the Church, in appointing Officers.</hi> This I
hope sober men will not readily yield to: Yea, he is
against himself, as we have seen before, and may have
occasion further to shew afterward.</p>
            <p>§. 9. His fourth and last Reason is, <hi>p.</hi> 181. the Jews
lived under one civil Government, according to which
the Church Government was framed and contempered:
but Christians live under different civil Governments;
therefore if we compare Christ with <hi>Moses</hi> in this, we
must say that Christ did frame the Church Government
according to the Civil; and so it must not be one but
divers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is here boldly supposed, but not proved that
the form of the Jewish Church Government, was framed
according to the Civil, which we deny, and so raze the
foundation of this Reason. And whereas his assertion
wants proof; our denial shall stand on surer ground:
for the Civil Government among the Jews was often
changed: they had Judges, Kings, Governors under
their Conquerors: but we read not of changing their
Church Government, which behoved to have been,
had it been framed according to the Civil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither must Christian Church-Government be
formed by the Civil, but by Christs Institution.</p>
            <p>§. 10. To these answers to our Argument, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>ex abundanti,</hi> as he speaketh, some Arguments to
prove the Antithesis, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ did never intend
to institute any one Form of Government. He might
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57560:35"/>
have spared this his supererrogation, except he had had
more to say for taking off the strength of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then we have met with. But to his Arguments,
the first <hi>p.</hi> 181 and 182. he frameth thus; what binds
the Church as an Institution of Christ, must bind as an
Universal standing Law: one Form of Government
cannot so bind, <hi>ergo, prob. min.</hi> what binds as a Law
must either be expressed as a Law in direct terms; or
deduced by necessary consequence, as of an universal
binding nature: The first cannot be produced; The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is not sufficient; except the consequence be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and also the obligation of what is drawn by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
be expresly set down in Scripture; for conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
cannot make Institution, but apply it to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cases: because positives being indifferent, Divine
Institution must be directly brought for their binding;
so that no consequence can bind us to them, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
declaration that it shall so bind. This is no new
Argument, it is proposed by him <hi>p.</hi> 12. and answered
by us <hi>p.</hi>—to what is said there, I shall add a little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to his Argument, as here framed, his <hi>major</hi> is
not so evident but that it needeth a distinction to clear
it. What bindeth as Christs Institution must bind as
an universal Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all times and places, <hi>negatur,</hi>
for there are cases in which the Lord will admit, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
will impose a dispensation with some of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
as I exemplified before in the case of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
keeping the Passeover; <hi>i. e.</hi> in all times where
God or Nature doth not make a clear exception; or
where the present case doth not exempt it self from the
intent of that, as being given in a far different conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>conceditur.</hi> Hence there were some of Christs Laws
for the Church, temporal; some peculiar to some cases:
these do not bind us, all the rest do, where they are
possibly practicable. That the Laws for parity of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Church are of the latter sort, we maintain.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57560:35"/>
For his <hi>Miner,</hi> we deny it, and for the disjunctive proof
of it we are ready to maintain both the parts which he
impugneth. And, First, That there is express Law of
Christ for parity: which I wonder he should so barely
deny that it can be produced; when he knoweth or
might know that it is brought by our Writers out of
<hi>Mat. 20. 25, 26. Lu.</hi> 22. 25, 26. But what he hath to
say against the evidence brought from these and other
places, we shall examine; when we come at them.
2. Though there were no express Law for it, we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that there is abundant evidence drawn by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from Scripture to shew that this is the Will and
Law of Christ: as for these two conditions that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
in such a consequence; the first we own and
maintain, that it is inferred by clear consequence from
Scripture that there ought to be a parity among Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
thus; what was the practice of the Apostles in
framing Church Government, should be ours also, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the case be different; but the Apostles did settle
the Ministers in equal power, without a Bishop over
them: neither is there any difference in our case that
should cause us to do otherwise; <hi>ergo,</hi> we ought so to
practice. It is not needful to insist here on the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this Argument, seeing we are here only asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that this conclusion may be proved; not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the proof of it: which is fully done by Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Writers, and which we are ready to defend against
what this Author will object. For the second conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> that what is drawn by consequence be expresly
set down in Scripture as binding: this is unlike Mr.
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s ability to require such a ridiculous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for if it be expresly set down in Scripture as bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then it is not a consequence but an express Law;
and so belongs to the former part of his disjunction.
And besides, it is a hard task to put any one upon, to
find out a consequence so deduced in Scripture:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57560:36"/>
What if <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who deny consequences from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the point of Institution, should put Mr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>
to prove Infant Baptism by such a consequence as
this: where something is said in Scripture, from which the
duty of Baptizing Infants doth clearly follow; and
where it is expresly said in Scripture, that it doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from this, that Infants must be baptized; he
would find this an hard task, and yet he requireth the
same of us. What he saith for the warranting of this
strange Doctrine, wanteth force. It is true Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
cannot make an Institution, yet they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
an Institution: we may gather the Will of Christ
in matters of Institutions by Scripture consequences as
well as in points of Truth. And though Positives be
indifferent, it is not needful that Divine Institution be
directly declared; for their binding; seeing it is the
Will of God revealed that bindeth us, not his Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in such or such terms. He were a bad Servant
that would do nothing of his Masters Will, but what
he declareth to him directly, and in the Imparative
Mood: such Servants to God this Author would have
us, that so we may have the greater latitude to be the
Servants of Men; taking their Will instead of Divine
Institution.</p>
            <p>§. 11. His second Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 182. is this; All the
standing Laws for Church Government in Scripture may
be applyed to several forms, <hi>ergo,</hi> there is no one Form
prescribed. For proof of this, he reduceth all the Laws
about Church Government to these three heads.
1. Such as set down the qualification of Officers. 2. Such
as require a right managing of their Office. 3. Such
as lay down Rules for the managing their Office. On
these he insisteth distinctly. Before I come to what
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57560:36"/>
he saith on these three Heads; let me answer general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Argument. And first by standing Laws, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he meaneth such as are expresly set down in the
form of Laws: and then we deny his consequence, for
though these do only respect Government, in its more
general consideration, yet that doth not hinder but the
species of it may be determined another way, <hi>viz.</hi> by
Apostolick practices, or consequences drawn from
Scripture. 2. Though we should grant that all the
Laws set down in Scripture are equally applicable to
either form, yet the one Form, <hi>viz.</hi> Parity may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in Scripture thus. Parity and Episcopacy do
agree in many things; suppose then they agree in all that
is commanded in Scripture; and that Episcopacy be so
far warrantable: no wonder that they be not discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by these Laws; but then here comes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
Parity requireth no more for its establishment,
but these Scripture Laws: and so it holdeth it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of Divine Institution; but Episcopacy
goeth beyond this boundary, by setting up a new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in the Church which the Scripture knoweth not;
and so one Form is determined, though not by any Law
condemning the other expresly; yet by the Laws that
warrant it; and the want of any Law to warrant the
other. 3. We deny that all the Scripture Laws redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to these three Heads, do relate to either Form, in
that wherein they differ. But let us hear his proofs.
He beginneth with the first Head, <hi>p.</hi> 183. where, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that all the qualifications of Persons which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
may be applied to either Bishop or Presbyter.
But then, 1. This is an Argument that Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
are one, or rather that there is no such distinction
by the Will of Christ; for sure there are distinct qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
required, the one being to Rule, the other to
Obey: wherefore if the Apostles had thought there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57560:37"/>
might be both Bishops and Presbyters in the Church;
surely he would have set down the qualities of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
as he is distinguished from a Presbyter, as well as
he setteth down the qualities of a Presbyter. <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
a man may be a well qualified Presbyter acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Bishop, and yet not qualified to be a Bishop:
wherefore if the Apostle had thought it lawful to set
the one over the other, his qualifications of Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are very lame, seeing he doth not shew us who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Presbyters is fittest to be made my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
as well as he sheweth who among the People
are fit to be Presbyters. 2. The Laws concerning qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
do require in all Presbyters an ability to
rule the Church, and do suppose them to be rulers of
the Church; as is clear, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4, 5. this is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to Episcopacy, for in Episcopacy it is not needful
that Presbyters be able to rule, seeing they have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of that Faculty: as God createth nothing in vain,
so he doth not require any qualifications of men in vain.
Is it imaginable that if a man be well qualified to
Preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet unfit to rule; that the Lord will
have that man kept out of the Ministry for that want
of a ruling ability, seeing he should have no use of that
faculty if he had it? <hi>Ergo,</hi> these qualifications are not
applicable to Episcopacy, where the Bishop alone ruleth.
If it be said, that this maketh the sole Jurisdiction of
Bishops unlawful, not their being Rulers together with
the Presbyters; <hi>Ans.</hi> If Bishops be set over Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they must either be only <hi>Praesides,</hi> which is not
contrary to Parity (for we speak of Parity or Impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Jurisdiction) or they must have Authority above
and over their Brethren; and if so they may rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Brethren; seeing they may command them and
make that power void which Christ hath given his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and so the force of what I have said doth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57560:37"/>
return. Again, if Presbyters under a Bishop have Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Power, either they may determine without, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his consent, or not; if so, the Bishop is but a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident;
if not, the Presbyters are but Cyphers, seeing the
Bishop may do in the Church what he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. He cometh <hi>p.</hi> 184. to the Laws concerning a
right managing of their work, which I do not deny to be
applicable to either form; and no wonder, for faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a commanded duty in what ever station God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a man: But our Author taketh occasion here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the indifferency of either form. 1. Because <hi>Paul</hi> did
not determine in his Epistles to <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> (which
chiefly concern Church-Government) whether any
should succeed to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> in <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet.
Ans.</hi> It is a bad consequence, for the thing did determine
it self, for they were Extraordinary Officers, immediately
called by God, being Evangelists; therefore they were
to have no Successors, unless the Lord did so call them.
Further, they were not fixed in these places, but for a
time: they did not live and die there; which shewed
that there was no need of Successors to them in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Again he argueth, that the Apostle did not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
how the Pastors of several Churches should order
things of common concernment; which, considered with
the former, would seem a strange omission, were either
of these forms necessary. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is no strange omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor should it so be esteemed by this Author, who
maketh all that is requisite for the right managing of
affairs by the Pastors of several Churches, to be of the
Law of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should meet, that one
should moderate, that there should be Appeals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I
observed out of him before. 2. We deny that it is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
yea, this Author in saying otherwise, contradicteth
himself; for he will not deny, but there are directions
in these Epistles for Church-Government; and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that they are applicable to either form, <hi>Ergo,</hi> to
Pastors acting in Parity; neither was it needful that there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57560:38"/>
should be directions to them, which are not applicable
to Bishops governing, because the managing of the work
is the same in both ways, except what Nature maketh
necessary to a Society, or a single person governing,
which also it doth teach. 3. The matter is determined
even in these Epistles, <hi>viz. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 14. where it is not
obscurely held forth, that <hi>Tim.</hi> was ordained by a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery;
which inferreth, that Presbyters ought so to be
ordained, and not by a Bishop alone. 4. Though the
matter were not determined in these Epistles, it is no
wonder, they being written to particular men, but it is
determined in other Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> where Christ giveth
the Keys, not to one, but to all the Apostles then, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Church Officers; and where <hi>Paul</hi> committeth the
care of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not to one Bishop, but to
the Elders in common, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. Of this he saith,
<hi>p.</hi> 184. it is equally a duty, whether we understand by
Overseers some acting over others, or all joyning in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.
But by his leave, when the Apostle giveth this
charge peremptorily to all the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (for to
them he speaketh, not to these of other Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
as he dreameth the Text may be understood, upon
what ground I know not) there is no doubt left, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he maketh it the duty of them all in common, or
of some one set over the rest: And may we not think
that this Command is a standing Rule, reaching even to
us, as he himself saith, <hi>(p. 185.)</hi> of what is contained
in the Epistles to <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.?</hi> and if so, then all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
are Bishops or Overseers, not one over the rest by
Apostolick Authority. He argueth thus, <hi>p. 185. Tim.</hi> is
charged to commit the things he had heard of <hi>Paul</hi> to
faithful men, who might be able also to teach others,
<hi>2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2. Had it not been as requisite to have charged
him to have committed his power of Government to
them, <hi>&amp;c.? Ans.</hi> 1. Yea, he doth here commit power of
Preaching, and of governing, joyntly to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to be
transferred by him to others; for of both these, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57560:38"/>
               <hi>Tim.</hi> had heard from <hi>Paul:</hi> why then must we
here understand the one, rather then the other? in that
he mentioneth Teaching, not Ruling, it is because
Teaching is the main business, and hath the other power
necessarily joined with it, by divine Institution. 2. It is
not always needful to mention Governing Power, where
ever the power of a Minister is mentioned, and here, it
cannot be deemed needful, because the Apostle had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
instructed <hi>Tim.</hi> that he choose none to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
but they who are able to Rule too, whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that when he biddeth him commit to them
the Pastoral charge, he intendeth Ruling Power as a
part of it; else to what purpose should he require
ability to Rule in them? To the same purpose is what
he saith of <hi>Tit.</hi> 
               <q>That he bid him ordain Elders, but
told not what Power did belong to them; a Negative
Argument from one place of Scripture,</q> is in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
such as this is: From the Superiority of <hi>Tim.</hi>
and <hi>Tit.</hi> 
               <q>(I pass his clearing of it, from being an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for Episcopacy) he inferreth two things, <hi>p.</hi> 186.
187. First that the Superiority of some Church Officers
(he should have said Presbyters, for of Officers it is not
Questioned on either hand) over others, is not contrary
to the Rule of the Gospel. 2. That it is not repugnant
to the Constitution of the Church in Apostolical times
for men to have power over more then one particular
Congregation. These saith he follow, though their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
be supposed extroardinary; and that they acted as
Evangelists.</q> 
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It will follow indeed from these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that Superiority is not contrary to Nature, nor to
the Nature of a Gospel Church: Also it will follow, that
it is not contrary to Gospel Institution, that the Lord
should immediately, when he seeth cause, appoint such
Superiority; and what if we say it followeth, that it is
not contrary to Gospel Institution, that in some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
cases, that Superiority may be allowed for
a time. But none of these are the thing in Question:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57560:39"/>
for this doth not follow, that because the Lord did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
call these men, and gave them Extroardinary
Power over others; therefore he hath not instituted,
that the ordinary way of Church Government shall be
by Pastors acting in Purity, which is here disputed.
His third head of Laws, formerly mentioned, he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>p.</hi> 188. and bringeth instances of some General
rules for Church Government, which I confess are not
peculiar to one form: But this doth not hinder that
there may be other Rules which are such; which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
instanceth; as, that complaints be made to the
Church: it is an odd exposition to say, <hi>i. e.</hi> Tell the
Bishop. The Church implieth clearly a Plurality. <hi>p.</hi> 187.
<q>had it been the will of Christ, saith he, that there
should be no Superiority of Pastors,</q> there would have
been some express and direct prohibition of it. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.
Might not a prohibition by Consequence serve turn?
This is very peremptorily spoken. 2. What needeth
any prohibition, when Christ had instituted a way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with it; this was a prohibition of it: now
this he did by giving Ruling power to all Presbyters, as
hath been already shewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. He bringeth another Argument of his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites,
<hi>p. 189. Viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it is of equal necessity, that
Christ should Institute a certain Form, as that any other
Legislator that moderates a Commonwealth should do.
His first. <hi>Ans.</hi> To this is, that Christ hath instituted
such an immutable Government in his Church as is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the succession and continuance of it; which
is all that founders of Republicks looked after, <hi>viz.</hi>
That there be such an order and distinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and subordination, that a Society may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
among them. Till then it be proved that one
form is necessary for the being of a Church, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can prove nothing.</q> Reply, it is false, that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators
looked after no more but that, we find none
of them, who setled not a particular Form: yea this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57560:39"/>
was necessary; for these Generals could not be practised,
but in some particular Form, this or that: and of these
we find they choosed what they thought fittest: even
so Christ not only appointed Generals, but knowing a
particular Form is only practicable, he chose that which
he thought fittest; mans choise in this is alterable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
other men may have as much wisdom and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as they; Christs choise is not so, for the contrary
reasons. His second <hi>Ans. p.</hi> 190. <q>Is, what is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to the being of a Church, is in
Christs liberty, whether he will determine it or not:
even as when I hear, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and others did form
a Republick; I conclude there must be Government:
But not that they Institute Monarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this must
be known by taking a view of their Laws.</q> Reply,
we acknowledge that Form of Government to be in
Christs liberty whether he will determine it, or not;
but we think it like, that he hath determined it: as for
other reasons, so because even men have not appointed
the Generals of Government, without a form in which
they should subsist: much less would the wise God do
so; if they being wiser then others, did think it fitter
to choose the Form then to leave it at other mens will,
much more would he. What he saith, of inferring,
that they did appoint this or that Form, from their
modelling a Common Wealth; is not to the purpose:
for that they did appoint a Form we know by History;
and, I suppose, that every one thinketh that they did
wisely in so doing; and that their doing so was for
the good of the Republick: hence we infer that it is
like Christ did so, seeing he sought his peoples good
more then they; and the Church is less able to choose
for her self, then those Republicks were; seeing Church
Matters are of spiritual concernment, and so lie further
out of the Road of mens Wit then the affairs of State
do. I yield to him that we could not know, what Form
Christ hath instituted, but by looking into his Laws;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57560:40"/>
yea, and but that way, we could not certainly know
that he hath determined any one form; yet this doth
not hinder, but such Arguments as this may have
their own weight. The Testimony he bringeth out of
Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> is answered from what hath been said, and
I am to meet with it elsewhere: He mistaketh our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in such Arguments, and falsly supposeth that the
form we plead for is not found in the Bible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. He bringeth another argument, <hi>p.</hi> 191.
from the similitude of a Vine which must have its
Dressers; and a House, and a City, which must have
Government: it was very easie for him to answer the
Argument thus propounded; I know not who ever
did so manage it: But it might have been thus impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
a wise Master of a Vineyard will not let his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
do what they please, but will appoint them his
work in his Vineyard; and a Master of a Family, or
a King in a Country or City, will not let the Servants
or Subjects chuse in what they shall be governed; <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
if the Church be a Vine, a House, a City, and Christ
be the Head and Ruler of it, it is not like that he hath
left the choise of the way of governing it to men, but
hath appointed it himself: If he had thus propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Argument, it had not been so easily answered.
The same way he useth the next Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 192.
taken from the difference of Civil and Ecclesiastical
Government; the one of which is called the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of man, and the other is Gods Ordinance;
therefore though that be mutable, this is not. I chuse
rather to frame the Argument otherwise, out of his
own Concession he maketh difference between these
two Governments, the one is for a Political, the other
for a spiritual end; the one for a temporal, the other
for an eternal end; the one given to men as men, the
other to men as Christians; the one to preserve Civil
Right, the other to preserve an Eternal Interest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Then, however the Lord let men chuse the way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57560:40"/>
political and temporal ends, and provide for
their own standing as men, and preserve their Civil
Rights; yet it is strange to think, that he hath left it
to mens choise to take this or that way for attaining
their spiritual and eternal end, for procuring their
standing as Christians, for preserving their spiritual
rights: though the one be the Ordinance of man, sure
the other must be the Ordinance of God: But the
form of Church-Government is the way to attain
these, because Church-Government is the mean, as is
confessed, and it cannot be acted but in a particular
form, and the form is the way of managing that
mean, and so attaining the end; yea, it is such a way
as hath exceeding influence upon attaining these ends,
seeing a wrong form may more hinder than promote
them; man, I suppose, may chuse a way that may do
more hurt than good; it is strange then if Christ hath
left this which is of such high concernment, to such
high ends, to the will of corrupt men: and this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
may have the more weight <hi>ad hominem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Author is often endeavouring to shape
Church-Government according to the Civil, which is
very unsuitable to what he asserteth of their differences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. Another argument <hi>p.</hi> 194. is, if the form of
Church-Government be not in Scripture determined
immutably, then it is in the power of the Church to
make new Officers which Christ never made. To this
he answereth: 1. These Officers are only said to be
new which were never appointed by Christ, and are
contrary to the first appointment of Christ, but one
set over many Pastors is not such; for besides the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
practice from the first Primitive times, Christ
himself laid the foundation of such an Office, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
Apostles. <hi>Reply.</hi> Here are many things hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together, to excuse Episcopacy from Novelty,
which we must examine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> severally. 1. They are not a
new Office, would he say, because Christ instituted such
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57560:41"/>
an Office, <hi>viz.</hi> Apostles. <hi>Reply.</hi> I hope he will not
say, that the Office of an Apostle, and of a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
is the same Office; for the Apostles had much
power, which Bishops have not, and were Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Officers, immediately called by God, so are not
Bishops: and however there may be some resemblance
between them, yet if they be not the same Office, it
must be a new Office from what Christ appointed:
It is not the want of Similitude, but the want of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity,
with what hath been before, that maketh a
thing new; neither need we enter the dispute with
him, what way extraordinary, and what not, in the
Apostolick Office, nor doth the Question lie in that, as
he alledgeth; for we maintain (and I think it will not
be deni'd by him) that the Office in <hi>complexo, viz.</hi> as it
did subsist in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi> was extraordinary, and is
ceased; and therefore whatever Office is made up of
some part of the power they had, without the rest of
it, must be a different Office from that, and so new.
Indeed if Christ had given them their power by
halves, and made the one half of it common to some
Officer appointed by him to continue in the Church,
<hi>viz.</hi> power over Presbyters, and the other half of it
peculiar to them, then Bishops having power over
Presbyters, though they had been a new Office from
the Apostles, and not the same, yet should they have
had the same Office with these others that we suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and so had not been new simply; but there being
no such thing, they must be in another Office than
Christ ever appointed, and so simply new. Wherefore
it is an unreasonable demand of the Author, <hi>p.</hi> 195.
that we must prove power over Presbyters to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
before we say it must cease: For it is
enough that the whole Office be extraordinary, that
it be not a patern for any other Office that should
be the same: Yea, we can easily prove that that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as in the Apostles, and making up the Complex
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57560:41"/>
of their Office, was extraordinary, because it cannot
survive the Office it self under that notion; and we
can also prove, that Christ never instituted any such
power by it self, and without the other parts of the
Apostolick Office: whence it clearly followeth, that
such a power by it self (which is a clear description
of the Episcopal Office) is divers from all the Offices
iustituted by Christ, and so is a new Office: What he
saith of the ceasing of this power with the Apostles,
as to its necessity, but not as to its lawfulness, is most
impertinent, and a begging of the Question; for the
conclusion of the Argument is, that it is unlawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath no institution, that institution which it
had in the Apostles being ceased. His confirmation of
this his distinction containeth a manifest falshood, <hi>viz.</hi>
to make a thing unlawful, saith he, which was before
lawful, there must be an express prohibition forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the use of such a thing: This, I say, applied to
the matter in hand, is most false, for we speak of
things which have their lawfulness only from institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi> Authority given to one over others: now
that which is thus lawful, becometh unlawful, meerly
by the withdrawing of the Institution, though no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
prohibition of it be made. As is evident from
the like case among men, when a King giveth a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to a Judge, it is lawful for him to act in that
capacity: now if the King shall call in his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
though there be no express forbidding of the
man, I suppose it is now become unlawful for him to
act. Just so is our case; one Pastor can have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over another, unless it be given him by Christ,
who ascended up on high, and received these gifts for
men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Now Christ had given once such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apostles, this he hath now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
by not giving such Commission to any others,
but the Apostles; for I suppose (to follow the former
example) that when a Judge which had a Commission
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57560:42"/>
dieth, it is a sufficient withdrawing of his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the King doth not give it to any other who
may succeed him: wherefore any who take that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to them, do it without Commission from Christ,
which is unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. Another Answer he bringeth to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<hi>p.</hi> 195. on which he insisteth much, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
tending to establish his whole Cause, but I hope
it shall prove a ruinous foundation. The Answer is
this; <q>The extending of any Ministerial power, is
not the appointing of any new, but a determining
the extent of that in <hi>actu secundo,</hi> which every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hath in <hi>actu primo.</hi> For clearing this, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
two things. 1. To shew that the power of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Minister doth primarily and habitually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Church in common, which I do freely
yield to him. 2. P. 197. That the Officers of
the Church may in a peculiar manner attribute a
larger and more extensive power to some particular
persons, for the more convenient exercise of their
common power.</q>Before I come to examine what he
saith to this purpose, let me note: 1. That he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
here in a new strain, before he had attributed this
power of determining to the Magistrate, now the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Church must have it, which I confess is
more fit: But he soon repenteth, and in the end of
the same page maketh it lye between the Pastors and
Magistrate, whether he please. It is strange to see
how those who loose hold of the truth, hang as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,
and know not where to fix. I take notice;
2. That whereas the former part of his undertaking
(which he knew to be out of controversie among
them against whom he disputeth) he establisheth by
five strong Arguments; but for that part where the
stress of the matter lieth, he hath not brought so much
as one reason to evince what he saith, but some few
bare Assertions for the clearing of it; and indeed it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57560:42"/>
is sometimes easier to prove the thing that is not, than
the thing that is denied, even to such able men
as Mr. <hi>Stillingfl.</hi> But let us now attend to what
he saith for his Opinion: <hi>We have seen,</hi> saith he,
<hi>that their power extendeth to the care of the Churches in
common; that the restraint of this power is a matter of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and decency in the Church.</hi> Here are two things, the
former of which we have heard, and seen solidly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but the latter I have not yet seen, where he hath
done any thing but asserted it, as he here doth: but
sure, it being a matter of such concernment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
needed some more proof; wherefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pass it so slightly as he hath done. We may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
a twofold restraining (the same holdeth in
enlarging) of the exercise of the power of Church-Officers,
<hi>viz.</hi> in respect of the Object of it, and in
respect of the acts of it. Restraint, in respect of the
object of this power, may be subdivided: First, when
that power is permitted or appointed to be exercised
over more or fewer objects of the same kind, which
it doth respect by the appointment of Christ; as that
a Minister should have a narrower or larger bounds
for his Parish, or more or fewer people to watch over;
and so of the limiting of Presbyteries, Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This restraint, or enlargement of power in its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
we acknowledge to be a matter of order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and may be determined by the prudence of the
Church. Secondly, when it is extended to the objects
of another kind, or restricted from the whole Species
of these objects that Christ hath appointed it for; as
when a Bishop by himself, who by Christs Institution
hath only power over the people, getteth power, given
him by man, over his fellow Pastors; and when a
Presbyter, who by Christs Institution hath a power
over the Flock to rule them, is hindred from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this power altogether, and is set only to
feed, and this ruling power, as to its exercise, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57560:43"/>
devolved upon another: This we deny to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of order and decency committed to the Churches
prudence. Restraint and enlargement, in respect of
acts of power, is when some acts which may be by
Christs Institution exercised by all Presbyters, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
permitted to be exereised by some, and not by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
as Ordination, Church-censures: and when
some are authorized to do some acts of power that
Christs Institution giveth them no Commission unto;
this, together with that restraint mentioned in the
second member of the subdivision, we prove, not to
be matters of order, left to the prudence of the
Church, but to be the setting up of a new Office in the
Church. 1. Order that the Church is commanded to
look after, requireth the right circumstantiating of
these acts which Christ hath appointed to be done in
his Church; as that they be done in fit time, place,
method, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither can this ordering of things reach
beyond the determination of circumstances, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is more than this, is not an ordering of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto which the circumstances do belong, but an
instituting of a new action; because (for example)
the right order of reading doth not require prayer, or
singing to be joyned with it, but respecteth only the
circumstances of reading it self: now, such restraining
or enlarging of the exercise of power, is no right
circumstantiating of it, but some other thing; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no circumstance of the exercise of Pastoral pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whether he shall rule or not, but an essential part
(I mean as to the integrality, it being an integral
part) of that power which Christ hath given him, as
is confessed: also, giving the exercise of that power
to one which belongeth to many, is not adding of a
circumstance, but a supernumerary part of power (as
to its exercise) above these parts that Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them; <hi>ergo,</hi> this is no ordering of the exercise of
power, but setting up of it a new. 2. Order that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57560:43"/>
to the prudence of the Church, is that unto
which confusion is opposite; then is that order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
when all confusion is avoided; but confusion
may be avoided, without this restraining and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Church-power by men, else it were in no case
lawful to let power be exercised as it is instituted by
Christ, because we must always be careful to avoid
confusion; <hi>ergo,</hi> I confess restraining of the exercise of
power, as to objects of the same kind, as fixing of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
is necessary to avoid confusion: but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said of taking power of ruling out of the
hands of Presbyters, and giving it to Bishops; else we
must say that Episcopacy is necessary, which destroyeth
this mans Hypothesis. If it be said that sometimes
it falleth out that this is necessary to avoid confusion,
and then Episcopacy is necessary. <hi>Ans.</hi> If we should
grant that it is sometimes useful to avoid confusion,
as that which may be the fruit of Parity, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said that Parity it self is confusion: now, it
is not in the Churches power to take her own way, to
avoid whatever may have a bad effect (for the best
things may be such) but she must shun that which is
evil by a right managing, not by laying aside that
which is good: wherefore seeing Order is consistent
with Parity, and Parity with the Institution of Christ,
and Imparity goeth at least a step beyond the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and taketh that from men which Christ gave
them, and giveth it to some to whom he gave it not,
this cannot be a right ordering of his Institution, but
rather setting up some other thing in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
3. The right ordering of the exercise of that
power which Christ hath given to men, must consist in
determining of these things which he hath not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and yet are necessary to be determined, as
time, place, extent of Parishes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for if men either
take upon them to determine in these matters, which
he hath already determined by his Institution, or to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57560:44"/>
determine things that he hath left at liberty, because
the determination was not needful to his design, they
then, would be wiser then he, and do not order his
Institutions, but set up their own. Now this which
our Author calleth Ordering is guilty of both these;
for Christ by giving Ruling Power to all Presbyters
hath declared his Will that they shall all Rule, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
by requiring an ability for this, as a necessary
qualification of them, who should be put unto that
Office: do not men then, by appointing who should
Rule, pass their determination on what he hath already
determined, and that contrary to what he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Again, Christ hath not appointed any Superiority
and Inferiority among Presbyters; neither is it needful
this be, the Church may be without it, and yet men
take upon them to appoint it. Is this then to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Government that Christ hath appointed, and
not rather to set up new Officers that men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. Next he subjoyneth a strange assertion.
<q>Now, saith he, in matters of common concernment,
without all question, it is not unlawful, when the
Church judgeth it most fit for edification, to grant to
some the executive part of that power, which is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
and fundamentally common to them all.</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
If it be so, all this pains that our Author is at, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and his Book to no purpose: For I mistake much,
if the main business in it be not to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this, which here he asserteth to be unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
lawful. For he confesseth that ruling power is
given by Christ to all Presbyters: then, we must either
say that it is his institution that they all exercise it and
so parity is his institution: or, that the executive part
of it may be given to some, or may be common to
them all; and so the form of Government may be left
indifferent is the scope of this Book. Now if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable,
what needeth all this pains about it.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57560:44"/>
But I conceive, this confident assertion is put instead of
the Arguments, whereby this undertaking of his should
have been confirmed: It is an easie thing, when one
cannot find proofs for their opinion to say, it is out
of Question, but it is an unhandsome way of disputing,
especially unbeseeming the person, who could not but
know that this is denied by his Opposites, and is the
main hinge of the Controversie in hand. We do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this Antithesis, that it is the Question between us
and them who are for the indifferency of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
whether the exercise of Ruling Power may
be taken out of the hands of Ministers, and given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one, to be Bishop over them: and we maintain the
Negative as that which should be out of Question: and
this we shall not barely assert, as Mr. <hi>Stilling f.</hi> hath done
his Opinion. 1. Then, this taking the exercise of
that power from men, which Christ hath given them is
unwarrantable; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is unlawful; I hope, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
will not be denied: for what we lawfully do
must be some way warranted, either by a Command or
a Permission. The Antecedent I prove, because a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for such a practice cannot be shewed, and further,
if there were any warrant for it, it must either be from
Christs command, or 2. From his express Permission,
or 3. From the Law of Nature, or 4. From want of a
Law forbidding it: But none of these do warrant it,
not the First nor Second, for our Opposite cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
such Command or Permission, either directly let
down or drawn by consequence from it. Nor the
Third, for then they must produce some dictate of the
Law of Nature which giveth leave to do this; but
what that shall be I understand not. Nature indeed
teacheth, that a Society may use means, for its own
Peace and Order: but this may be without hindering
the exercise of that power, the Supreme Governour
giveth to any of his Officers: there may be this in the
Church where Presbyters Rule in Common. Nature
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57560:45"/>
also teacheth that when more have a Common power,
they may consult about the best way of Managing it;
but it doth not teach that they may mannage it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then it is committed to them by him who gave it;
which they must do if they put it into the hands of
one, which is given to more: especially, when it may
be managed well without such crossing the Institution
of it. Besides all this, Nature can never warrant this
alienation of the Power that Christ hath given to his
Servants; because Nature doth only warrant us to step
beside Christs Institution (in his matters) where Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
is not sufficient to attain that which is naturally
necessary; or when the Acting only by Institution
would cross Nature: but there is no natural necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of giving all power to a Bishop, which Christ hath
given to Presbyters: neither doth leaving the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of it in common cross Nature: <hi>Ergo</hi> Nature doth
not warrant this practice. Neither can the fourth
warrant it, for then it should be in the power of men
to take all the power that Ministers have from Christ
out of their hands and give it to one, so that only my
Lord Bishop might preach, baptise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as that
he only may rule; for their is no Law forbidding the
Church, to lay all the parts of Pastoral power on one,
more then forbidding to lay one part of it on one. Sure
sobriety and due reverence to the Institutions of Christ
would teach us to think, that while he hath given equal
power to many it should be a sufficient forbidding, that
any be so bold as to lay the exercise of that power on
one, taking it from the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. 2. I prove it thus. When Christ giveth a
power to his Servants to manage the affairs of his
Church, it is not only a Licence, whereby they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
to do such work, if they think fit, but it is a
trust: they get it as a charge that they must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of, as is evident from the command to this
purpose given them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. take heed to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57560:45"/>
Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you
Overseers: here is a Command to Overseers to do that
work, and they must give an account of this their
charge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Rulers who must be obeyed are
such who must give an account. Now it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for one, who getteth such a Trust, to lay it on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
neither may any take it out of his hands to bestow
it upon another without his leave, who gave that trust:
when Christ hath Commanded Ministers to rule, and will
seek account of them, may they lay their work on a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop?
will it be well taken in the day of Account, to say,
they committed their Flock to another to keep, who
left them to the Wolf, or scattered, and slew them:
will not the Lord say to them why did not ye feed
them your selves? Sure Christ will require account of
them to whom he gave the charge, and that is of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
neither will he ask Account of Bishops, except
for their Usurpation. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not lawful, to take the
exercise of Church Power out of the hands of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and give it to a Bishop. 3. Proof. If Presbyters,
who have received Power from Christ may put the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it into the hands of a Bishop alienating it from
themselves; why may not Bishops devolve their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on one who shall be over them, and so we shall have
an Universal Bishop the Pope; in whom shall rest all
Church Power, and at whose direction it shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised?
If that may be done, there is no shadow of
Reason why this may not be done, for if once the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be taken out of the hand of them to whom Christ
hath given it, then prudence must be the only Director
to teach us who must have it: now prudence will as
well say, that Bishops must have one over them to keep
them in Order and peace, as that Presbyters must have
one over them. Neither is there here any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is not there; for that one may turn to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as well as the other: and a Bishop cannot oversee
his charge, without substitutes, more then the Pope
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57560:46"/>
can do: the one may substitute Bishops, Cardinals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as well as the other may substitute Dean, Prebends,
Archdeacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, I hope, Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> is not
come to that, to think the Papal Office an indifferent
Ceremony. <hi>ergo.</hi> neither should he think so of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
4. If Presbyters may devolve the exercise of that
power that Christ hath given them into the hands of a
Bishop, then they may also give away with their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the very Office that Christ hath given them:
But this they may not. <hi>ergo</hi> I prove the Major, for
when they devolve the exercise of their ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on the Bishop, they not only consent, that they
shall rule the people, which they might do: But
they make it unlawful for themselves to rule, yea, they
give up themselves to be ruled and commanded by
them, so that he is their Judge and cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, in case of male-administration (at least
this is true <hi>de singulis</hi> if not <hi>de omnibus)</hi> but this is to
give away the very power; for if I may not act, how
have I a power to act; if both I and the people be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of another, so that I may not act
any thing in reference to the People but by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
how have I power to rule? sure a power is the
possibility of the act <hi>(quantum est ex parte causae)</hi> and
a moral power is such a lawfulness of the act, but in
this case Presbyters want that possibility, or lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that exercise of Ruling; and that so, as the
defect or hindrance <hi>ex parte causae,</hi> is in themselves,
who should put forth the acts, <hi>ergo,</hi> they want not
onely the exercise but the very power of Ruling,
which Christ gave them, in such a case. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Argument is evident; for such an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were a clear contradicting of Christ: he saith it
shall be lawful for you (such a one being lawfully
put into the Ministry) to rule: he by this alienating
saith, it shall not be lawful for me to rule. If it be
said, that Christs gift maketh it lawful for such a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57560:46"/>
one to rule, but not in all cases; as suppose the good
of the Church requires that this power be taken
from him; his alienating maketh it onely unlawfull
in this case, when for the good of the Church, he hath
quit his right: so that here there is no opposition;
Christ giveth him a <hi>jus in actu primo,</hi> he alienateth
onely this <hi>jus in actu secundo,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> doth
express it. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. However there may be some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of reason why this may be done in some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
cases; when Christs institution (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to ordinary cases, and must ordinarily take
place) cannot reach the end of Government: yet to
say that it may be done ordinarily, cannot but clash
with Christs institution: for when Christ giveth rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power to Presbyters, though we may think that
it is not his will, that they must needs exercise it in
all cases, yet must we think that he intendeth they
should exercise it ordinarily: for why giveth he them
a power, which they as readily never as ever act, and
that as men please to determine? we must not think
that it is the intent of Christs Commission to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that men may without the force of necessity
laid on by an extraordinary Providence (and then
God doth it and not men) hinder the acts of it as
as they will. 2. It is supposed without ground that
the good of the Church can ordinarily require the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
power given by Christ; for if we speak of
what is ordinarily good for the Church, how can we
better discern that than by looking into Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution?
wherefore, seeing by this equal power, at least
<hi>in actu primo</hi> is given to Presbytery; we are to think,
that the exercise of this power is best for the Church;
though ambitious men, and they who would flatter
the Magistrate, think otherwise; yea though the best
of men should dissent, sure Christs giving such a
power saith more for the goodness of the exercise of
it then mens opinions, though seeming to have a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57560:47"/>
on some inconveniencies of it can say against
it: especially considering, what ever way beside, men
devise, is attended with as great, if not greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
of another nature. 3. I have already
made it appear, that this alienation of power given
by Christ doth not only reach the <hi>actus secundus</hi> of it,
but even the <hi>actus primus;</hi> seeing a man is not in
capacity to recal his deed, and reassume the exercise
of his power, though it were improved never so much
against the end of Christs giving, and his alienating
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. 5. Proof (which is directly against enlarging
the exercise of Church Power in the hands of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what Christ hath given them) if the exercise of
that power, which Christ hath given to all, may be taken
from the rest and given to one, then that one getteth
a power both <hi>in actu primo &amp; in secundo,</hi> which he had
not from Christ, but this is unlawful, <hi>ergo</hi> The Major
I prove: for it is clear he getteth power <hi>in actu secundo,</hi>
which he had not from Christ, <hi>ergo</hi> he getteth such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in <hi>actu primo,</hi> seeing <hi>actus secundus</hi> cannot be without
<hi>primus,</hi> nor lawful exercise of power without the <hi>jus</hi> or
power it self. If it be said, that Christ giveth only the
<hi>actus primus,</hi> and that so as it extendeth to the whole
Church: and therefore no <hi>actus secundus</hi> of power can
be given to one, which doth extend further than this.
<hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is true, he giveth formally only the <hi>actus
primus,</hi> but the <hi>actus secundus</hi> doth result from it, and
therefore he giveth both. 2. It is true, the power
that Christ giveth doth extend to the whole Church,
but this must be understood with a twofold distinction.
<hi>Dist.</hi> 1. Disjunctive it is true, that is, every Minister
hath a power to rule whatever part of the Church, this,
or that, or another; so that no part of it is without
his Commission, as that he should go beyond his bounds
in being set over it. Conjunctive, it is false, that is,
Christ hath not given so much of the <hi>actus primus</hi> of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57560:47"/>
power to rule all, or many Congregations. <hi>Dist.</hi> 2. When
Christ giveth the <hi>actus primus</hi> of power to a Minister,
extending to the whole Church; it is to be understood
in adequate, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he hath a share in that power so
extended; and may in conjunction with other rule the
whole Church: not adequate, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any such a power, as that he by himself or with
a few excluding the rest, who are also in the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
rule the whole Church. So that when ever any
one exerciseth authority by himself, or excluding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who have the same power granted by Christ,
over more than his particular Congregation, over
which he may have personal inspection; he taketh
a power in <hi>actu secundo,</hi> where Christ hath given him
no <hi>jus,</hi> nor <hi>actus primus</hi> of power. The Minor of the
argument is manifest; for when both power and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of it is given to a man, which Christ hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
this is setting up a new Office, which Christ hath
not set up: for what is an Office in the Church, but
a power and a lawful exercise of it? but this our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
confesseth to be unlawful, <hi>ergo</hi> 6. Proof. 'Tis
presumption even among men for a servant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that work to another to do, which his Master
hath given him to do, except he know, that he hath
his Masters leave so to do: this is so well known, that
I need not insist on it, <hi>ergo</hi> it is much presumption,
when Christ hath committed the ruling of his house
to every Minister, that some should devolve that work
on a Bishop to do it for them, unless they could shew
Christs warrant for this, which if Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> or
any other will do, we shall acquiesce. If there be
any disparity in this comparison, I am sure it will
tend to the strengthening, not the weakening of our
argument, for we are more absolutely under Christs
command, than Servants are under their Masters; his
commands are more perfect and effectual to compass
their end, without our taking our own way in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57560:48"/>
obedience to them, then mens are: also, the
there is a greater tie to cleave scrupulously to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
than to mens: also the matters about which
they are, be of more weight, and miscarriage in them
more dangerous, then mens commands. All which
make it more absurd to commit the exercise of our
power, that he giveth to others, than for Servants to
do so with their Masters work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. For better understanding of what he had
said, our Author subjoyneth a distinction of a twofold
power belonging to Church Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> a Power of
Order in preaching the word, visiting the sick, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this he maketh to be
inseparably joyned to the function; and to belong to
every ones personal capacity, both in <hi>actu primo,</hi> and
<hi>actu secundo,</hi> and a power of Jurisdiction, in visiting
Churches, overseeing particular Pastors, Ordination,
Church Censures, making Rules for decency: this he
maketh to be in every Presbyter <hi>quoad aptitudinem</hi>
and habitually, so as he hath a <hi>jus</hi> to it in <hi>actu primo;</hi>
but the exercise and limitation of it, and some further
power of choise and delegation to it, and some further
Authority besides the power of Order. And when this
power, either by consent of the Pastors of the Church,
or by the appointment of the Christian Magistrate,
or both, is devolved to some particular persons; though
<hi>quoad aptitudinem,</hi> the power remain in every Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
yet <hi>quoad executionem,</hi> it belongs to them who
are so appointed. To this, I reprove a few things
briefly. 1. I take notice here of a contradiction in <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
to what he taught, <hi>Part. 1. c. 2. p.</hi> 41. and we
refuted <hi>p.</hi> there he made the power of Order pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Ministers and power of Jurisdiction peculiar
to the Magistrate, describing both powers no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then he doth here, and yet here he giveth the
power of Jurisdiction as well as of Order to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
2. Seeing he acknowledgeth both powers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57560:48"/>
               <hi>quoad jus</hi> to be equally given by Christ to all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
it is strange that he should deny that men
may restrain the one (for he confesseth the <hi>actus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus</hi>
of it to be inseparably joined to the Office)
and yet doth boldly affirm that they may restrain the
other; without giving the least shew of permission
that they have from Christ who gave both powers, so
to tamper with the one more then with the other. If
Christ hath made no difference between these (and if
he hath it should have been produced) how dare men
do it? I confess, Nature maketh a necessity of restrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the power of Jurisdiction: for if every one should
Rule, when and where he pleased, there would be
confusion; and therefore it is needful that every one
have their own charge which they exercise this power
over: but this is common to the power of Order also
(though with some difference) for it is not fit that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Minister should preach and baptize where and when
he pleaseth, without any limitation. Neither
could this be without confusion. Also Christ hath
made a limitation of the exercise of the power of
Jurisdiction; for by giving it to many, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it relate to things of common concernment,
he hath, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> determined, that none of these who
have it, shall exercise it by himself nor without the
concurrence and consent of them, who are equal in
Commission with him. This limitation of the exercise
we confess to be warrantable: but what reason there is,
I cannot understand, why men should take away the
exercise of ruling power from many, and give it to
one, more than they can take away the exercise of
preaching power, and so give it to some, as it shall
not be lawful for them to preach, but only to rule,
more than they can take away the exercise of both
powers, seeing Christ hath equally given them.
Sure it is an impregnable Argument that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
here furnisheth us with against himself; men
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57560:49"/>
may not restrain the exercise of the power of order,
further than Nature maketh it necessary; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they
may not any further restrain the exercise of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Jurisdiction, because Christ hath not made such
a difference in his giving these powers to men. If it
be said, that the restraint of the power of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is sometimes necessary, because Parity breeds Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and many are unfit to rule. <hi>Ans.</hi> Even so,
letting all preach, doth often breed Heresie, many
preach false Doctrine, and many are unfit to preach.
So this argument must either plead for the restraint
of both powers, or of neither. Let us then see what
must be the remedy of this abuse of the power of
order, and the remedy of the abuse of the other must
be proportionable: sure the remedy is not to restrain
the exercise of the power of preaching (except it be
for a time, in expectation of their amendment, which
holdeth also with reference to ruling power) but to
put such unfit men out of the Ministry. Were it fit
to lay the work of an Heretical Preacher upon a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and let him still have the charge of the Flock,
though his Curate doth the work for him? No, but
he should be removed, and another put in his place:
Even so, they who are unfit to rule, must not have a
Bishop do it for them, but be removed, that other fit
men may be put in their place; seeing ruling abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are a necessary qualification of a Minister, as well
as preaching abilities, as was shewed before. If Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
breed Factions, we must censure the guilty, not
cross Christs Institutions in the exercise of that
power he hath given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. 3. It is not good sense that he saith,
(speaking of the power of Jurisdiction) that though
it belong habitually, and in <hi>actu primo</hi> to all, yet in a
constituted Church, some further Authority is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
besides the power of order. Whether this be the
Printers fault, or the Authors, I know not: but sure,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57560:49"/>
the power of order is no part of that Authority by
which the power of Jurisdiction is exercised. 4. He
leaveth us in suspence about the power of restraining
the exercise of the power of Jurisdiction; for he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,
that it may be done by the consent of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
or by the appointment of the Magistrate, or
both. If this power that Christ hath given his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
may be taken from them in its exercise, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fit we should know to whom the Lord hath given
leave to do this. I believe, and have proved that no
man may do it; but if it may be done, sure it is not
thus left at randome, that it should be <hi>primi occupan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi>
Pastors themselves cannot do it, for they have got
the charge; and they, not the Bishop whom they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust,
must give an account: The Magistrate may not
do it, for he is no ruler of the Church; but this is
the highest act of ruling the Church, and of ruling
and disposing of the Rulers of it as he pleaseth; and
if neither may do it, both may not do it, seeing the
reasons brought exclude both from any measure of
power in that thing. I do not stand on the Authority
of <hi>Camero</hi> (which is all the proof he hath for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
cited <hi>p.</hi> 198. viz. <hi>Ordinatio non fit à Pastore
quatenus Pastor est, sed quatenus ad tempus singulare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem
obtinet:</hi> Neither shall I strive to strain it to a
sound sense; but be satisfied with the truth, that we
have upon better grounds than <hi>Camero</hi>'s Authority e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Ordination, and other acts of
Church-power, are done by Pastors, not by virtue of
any superadded power, or Delegation that they have
from men, above what Christ hath given them in
their Pastoral Office, but by vertue of that power he
hath given to all Pastors, though the conveniency of
exercising it, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> requires the concurring of
some more circumstances: <hi>Ergo,</hi> that other Pastors
joyn in Ordination; that it be not without the limits
which are fixed (for order) for the inspection of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57560:50"/>
that Society of Pastors, whereof such an one is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
or if it be without these limits, that it be not
without a special Call from them, who should there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their Authority. The Conclusion of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
needeth small Animadversion, supposing what
hath been already said: By this, saith he, we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
understand how lawful the exercise of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
power may be in the Church of God (yea,
by what we have said may be seen how unlawful it
is) supposing the equality of the power of order:
(But we must also suppose (and it hath been yielded)
the equality of the power of Jurisdiction, at least in
<hi>actu primo;</hi> and that may shew us the unlawfulness of
Episcopacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And how incongruously they speak,
who supposing an equality in the Presbyters of the
Church at first, do cry out that the Church takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her the Office of Christ, if she delegates any to a
more peculiar exercise of the power of Jurisdiction:
Yea, we have made it appear, that they speak most
congruously to the thing; for it is Christs Office to
give the exercise of power to such men, by giving
them the Office on which it followeth; and therefore
they who take it from them, and give it to them
to whom he gave it not, do take his Office. But it
is a mincing of the matter, to talk of a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
exercise of the power of Jurisdiction; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
setting up of a Bishop, is a laying others aside
from the exercise of it at all, and suffering them to
do nothing that way, but by his Authority: yea,
that which we have all this while disputed against,
is yet less intollerable than is our case, where Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
have most absolute and Lordly powers, and
delegate it to whom they will, Lay-men or others,
and Presbyters have no power at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. Another Argument he propoundeth,
<hi>p.</hi> 198. from the perfection of Scripture, from which
it doth much derogate, to say, that in it Christ hath
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57560:50"/>
not laid down an immutable form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
This Argument he almost tusheth at; but
that is easier than to answer it solidly: Unto it he
bringeth three Answers, all which will not make
up a satisfactory one. The first is the perfection of
the Scripture here meant, is in reference to its end
(this I grant) which is to be an adequate Rule of
Faith and manners, and sufficient to bring men to
Salvation; which is sufficiently acknowledged to be,
if all things necessary to be believed or practised, be
contained in the Word of God: Now that which
we assert, not to be fully laid down in Scripture, is
not pleaded to be any ways necessary, nor to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Faith, but something left to the Churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
<hi>Reply.</hi> I perceive it to be ordinary with this
Author (I observed it before) to slight with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that which he hath little to say against in
reason. What a pittiful come off is this? that the
not determining the form of Government is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the perfection of the Scripture, because it is
not a thing necessary, but left to the Churches liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
What it is to beg the question, if this be not, I
know not; for the question is, whether the form be
determined in Scripture, or left to the Churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
the latter he maintaineth, we assert the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and prove it, because otherwise the Scripture
were imperfect: He answereth, it doth not follow
that the Scripture is imperfect, because the form of
Government is left to the Churches liberty. Is this
the easie dispatch of this Argument which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised?
2. If the end of Scripture be to be an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Rule of Faith and manners; then sure, in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
way, of Religious manners or practises, among
which is the way of managing Church-Government,
being a Religious thing; for we speak of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as it is peculiar to the Church: hence then it
must belong to its perfection to lay down this, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57560:51"/>
seeing the Scripture hath told us, that this is
one of its particular ends, to direct the Pastors of
the Church how to behave themselves in the House
of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. but this it cannot do compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without setting down a form of Government, for
general Rules will not tell a Pastor whether he must
exercise his ruling power with others, or lay it over
on my Lord Bishop; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the want of this form in
Scripture doth derogate from that perfection which
our Author confesseth to be in it. 3. By things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
I hope he doth not mean only necessary to
salvation, but necessary to these particular ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in the Scripture, one of which is the right
managing of Church-Government. Now if all things
necessary to this be laid down in Scripture, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
want a form of Government in it, for without
that Government cannot be managed. His second an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, that the doing of a thing not contained in
Scripture, with an opinion of its necessity, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Scriptures perfection; and so in that sense
every <hi>additio perficiens</hi> is <hi>corrumpens;</hi> such are the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Traditions; but the doing of a thing without
the opinion of its necessity doth not destroy it. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
This is a poorer shift than the other: For 1. It is
not the adding of a form of Government to what is
in Scripture that we make unlawful, or against the
Scriptures sufficiency; for sure if it be not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it must be added, seeing Nature maketh it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
but it is the opinion of its not being in
Scripture that we plead against; and therefore this
Answer doth not at all touch the Argument, neither is
the example of Popish Traditions to the purpose; for
we do not say that they are against Scripture perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because they are held not to be found in it, (for
that is most true) but because they are thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be added to it. 2. It is against the perfection of
Scripture to say any addition to it is necessary for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57560:51"/>
its end; whether that particular thing added
to it be necessary, or its defect may be as well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by another thing of that kind; as if any should
maintain that we must have more Sacraments than are
in Scripture, and should not think this in particular
necessary, but leave it to the Churches liberty, what
particular Sacrament should be superadded: But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Opinion maketh an addition necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there be a form of Government which
is not in Scripture, though it leave the particular form
to the Churches liberty; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Scripture; and this addition being of a
thing in its general nature necessary to an end that
the Scripture aimeth at, <hi>viz.</hi> the right governing of
the Church, and not being found in Scripture, so
much as that men may determine it, it is such an
<hi>additio perficiens</hi> as the Author confesseth to be <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpens.</hi>
3. By this Answer, none of the Popish Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are additions to the Scripture, or imply its
imperfection; for though they be held necessary in
the general, yet in particular they cannot so be held;
for either they were freely determined by the Church,
and so they might not have been, and therefore are
not necessary, or the Church was necessitated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
them by some antecedent objective truth in
the things: if so, they must be the Dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are no additions to Scripture; wherefore
this Answer destroyeth it self. 4. At least, by this
Answer, all the Popish and Prelatical Ceremonies,
and whatsoever superstitious men can devise to bring
into the worship of God, is no addition to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor a blot upon its perfection; for these are not
held for necessary things, but indifferent, and only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
when commanded by Authority; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
I suppose, Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> will plead for to his
form of Government. Now this Consequence I hope
he will not own; wherefore he may be ashamed to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57560:52"/>
own that from which it doth so clearly follow. His
third Answer is yet of less weight, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
of Church-Government are in Scripture, not
the Circumstantials. <hi>Reply.</hi> If he meaneth, as sure he
doth, the Essentials of Government in its general
and abstract notion, in which it is not practicable
without a particular form, he saith nothing to the
purpose: The Scripture may be an imperfect rule for
Church-Government, though it have these; if he
mean the Essentials of a particular form, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
his own cause. Now we maintain, that to
the perfection of Scripture there is required not only
a general notion of Government, but so much as is
sufficient light to direct the practice of Government:
this cannot be without the institution of a particular
form, for Government otherwise is not practicable. If
it be said, that the general rules in Scripture about
Government want nothing requisite for the compleat
practise of Government, but the determination of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
which cannot belong to Scripture perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<hi>Ans.</hi> This we deny (if by general Rules he
means, as sure he doth, such as do not determine a
particular form) it is some more than a circumstance,
whether Pastors exercise that power Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, or commit it to a Bishop. I hope it is
more than a bare circumstance in Civil Government,
whether the power be in the hand of one, or a few,
or all the people, even so 'tis here: yea, herein lieth
the very Essence of a form of Government; if this
then be not found in Scripture, the Essentials of a
form are wanting; but a form is essential to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
considered as practicable; <hi>Ergo,</hi> some of the
Essentials of Government are wanting.</p>

            <p>HAving refuted as he supposed the general Arguments,
for a particular Form of Church-Government to
have been laid down in Scripture; he cometh now to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Arguments, which are brought for some one Form,
and many he taketh much pains to refute in this Chapter,
which I am confident never any did make Use of to prove
what he opposeth. We shall let him pass with his supposed
Victory over these, and only take notice of what opposeth
the Truth we hold, or the Arguments by which it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
I shall only note, not insist upon his large Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
by which in the beginning of this Chapter, he
chargeth all who are not as Sceptical about Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as himself, with prejudice, and following custome
and education, rather than truth, and being loth to quit
that opinion, though false, which once they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in. To which I say nothing, but let every one
search his own Conscience, and see what grounds is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
standeth upon. I hope the sincerity of many will
be able to bear them out before God, and the solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they are able to produce will make them stand before
men, against such reproaches of this Adversary. Neither
shall I retaliate this his charity with the Jealousies of many
who fear that they who cast Church-Government thus
loose, that the Magistrate may dispose of it at his Pleasure,
do fetch the strength of their Arguments, and the life of
their perswasion, from no better Topicks then design to
please them who can reward this their pains, or to hold
fast that which is good (as some have spoken of their fat
Beneficts) what ever side of the World be uppermost, to
which end this opinion is a notable mean. I desire to
judge no man, the Lord will ere long judge our opinions
and motives too: but this I am sure of, we have no World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
baits to allure us at this time, to plead for the Divine
Right of Presbyteral Government, and if the Interest of
Christ did not more move us than our own; we might
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57560:54"/>
with much Worldly advantage yield the cause. We do
not insist on any of Christs acts towards the <hi>Apostles</hi> in
calling them, sending them out either first or last, as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for the Form of Church-Government; knowing
that their Office being Extraordinary and Temporal, can
be no Rule for the ordinary cases of the Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I pass over all that he writeth in this Chap. till <hi>p.</hi> 218.
Where he undertaketh to vindicate two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from determining Parity or Imparity in the Church.
The first is <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25. to which is parallel <hi>Luk. 22. 25.
The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Authority over them, and
they that exercise authority over them, are called Benefactors;
but ye shall not be so.</hi> Though I confess, there be other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
more unquestionable to our purpose; yet I see not the
weight of what he hath said against this place, being
brought as an Argument against Imparity. His Answer is
made up of two, First, he asserteth, and solidly proveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Papists,</hi> that it is not the abuse of Power that is here
forbidden, but that the Power it self spoken of is forbidden,
as incompetent to Church-Officers; his Proofs for this I
need not repeat, I accept it of him as a Concession. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
He saith it is only Civil Power that is here forbidden;
and so it doth not make against Imparity in Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<hi>Reply.</hi> He keepeth his wonted way here, which is to
take much pains, to prove what is least in debate with the
adversaries he dealeth with: we do not question but the
Power it self, not the abuse of it is here spoken against:
but that it is Civil Power only we question; and that he
hath not spent one word to prove. We affirm that Christ
is here making a difference between his Apostles and Civil
Governors in this; that one of them should not have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over another, as it is among Rulers of States and
Kingdoms; and so that there should be no Imparity of
Power among them; to prove this, I borrow the <hi>3d</hi> reason
by which Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> militateth against the abuse of Power
being here meant, <hi>viz.</hi> This only can answer the Scope
of the Apostles contention, which was about Primacy. The
Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> would have been set over the rest, <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57560:54"/>
20. and their Strife was, which should be <gap reason="foreign">

(so <hi>Drusius</hi> cited by <hi>Leigh Crit. Sac.)</hi> that is, who
should be Pope over the rest: now, though we deny not
but theirs might be upon a Civil and Coactive Power, they
dreaming of an earthly Kingdome of Christ, yet sure, this
was neither mainly nor only in their design: not only,
because they could not but know that Christs Kingdome,
in which they were to be Officers, should be Spiritual, and
conversant about the things of another life though, they
thought it might be Worldly to, and therefore it could
not be; but they designed a Supremacy in that respect also,
not mainly, both because they could not but know that
their main work both in teaching and ruling, was to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the things of Eternity: as also it is evident from <hi>Luk.</hi>
22. 24. that their contention was about Supremacy in a
Power that then they had begun to be partakers of,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but they knew very well
that yet they had not Civil Power: seeing then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
about Ecclesiastical Supremacy, and Christs answer is
suted to their Intention, and doth wholly discharge that
Power whereof it speaketh: the first of which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
the two latter Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> hath confessed: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that Christ doth here forbid all Superiority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
one over another: so that not only Christ had not set
one over the rest, but he will not permit themselves to do it
if they would: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a Simple forbidding of it.
Hence I inferre the Argument to our purpose thus, if the
Apostles who had received equal power from Christ, might
not delegate that Power to one whom they might set up as
chief; then Presbyters may not do this neither, <hi>Ergo</hi> Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Presbyters is unlawful. The consequence is evident,
the antecedent I prove from parity of Reason: it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable
that Presbyters may set one of themselves over
themselves: and that Bishops may not do the like, and
Apostles the like; seeing order may require the one as well
as the other. Yea, Secondly, if there be a disparity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it maketh much for us, for sure the Apostles had more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57560:55"/>
liberty of managing that Power, they had received from
Christ, by prudence, than Pastors now have; wherefore they
might far rather restrain the exercise of it in themselves,
if they saw cause, than we may do. 3. I hope it will not
be denied, that what is here said to the Apostles is not said
to them as Apostles; but as Officers of the Church, who
have received the same Power from Christ: that it is no
Temporary, but an abiding precept: and therefore if it
forbid superiority among the Apostles, so doth it among
Presbyters, Mr. <hi>Still. p.</hi> 220. objecteth thus; `this place
doth no waies imply a Prohibition of all inequality among
Governours of the Church; for then the Apostles Power
over ordinary Pastors should be forbidden. Ans. <hi>concedo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi>
we also grant inequality among Pastors and Elders.
But that which we plead is, that here is forbidden an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
among them who are of the same Order: that when
Christ hath given men the same Power and Office, as he
did to the Apostles; they may not usurp power one over
another, nor take it though others would give it them.
This is clearly proved from what hath been said. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it may be hence also concluded, that the inequality
which is among Church-Officers ought not to be such as
is among the Governours of the World, where a single
Person may have his under-Officers at his command: but
that inequality must be of one order above another in place
and rank, both which do concur jointly to the ruling of
the Church; and thus also Episcopacy is here made unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
That Pride and Ambition is here forbidden, I readily
grant him: but that these are not only forbidden, is clear
from what hath been said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The next place that he considereth is <hi>Mat. 18.
15,</hi> 16, 17. Where, after private admonition is used in
vain, we are commanded to tell the Church, and they
who do not hear the Church, are to be counted as Heathens
and <hi>Publicans.</hi> That which he first bringeth for an Answer
to this place is, <q>That because men of all Opinions about
Church-Government make Use of it to establish their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</q>
therefore no Argument may be drawn from it for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57560:55"/>
any opinion. This unhappy way of reasoning I have met
with before and insist not now on it. It is the Devils way,
I perceive, to raise contentions about truth among some;
and having done this, to tempt others by these contentions
to Schism and slighting of truth. But we must not quit
the light held forth in this Scripture, because men have
darkened it, by their raising dust about it: let us search the
more soberly and carefully, not cast away the truth for this.
Yet for all divers Opinions that have been broached about
this place, Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> hath a new one of his own, which
I shall briefly examine. <q>The difficulty of the place (he
saith well) lyeth in these two. 1. What are the offences
here spoken of. 2. What is the Church mentioned. For
the first, he asserteth (with more confidence than strength
of Reason, when he saith, it is evident to any unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
mind,) that the matters are not of scandal; but of
private offence and injurie: this he proveth <hi>p.</hi> 222.</q> (his
Arguments we shall consider after.) For the Church, he
proposeth at length the <hi>Erastian</hi> opinion, as very plausible:
yet at last rejecteth it <hi>p.</hi> 224, 225. and returns to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<hi>p.</hi> 226. <q>which though he makes to be private diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and quarrels; yet he will not have them to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
nor Civil causes; but such differences as respect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and not things. And then he determineth <hi>p.</hi> 227.
that the Church is not here any Juridical Court acting
by Authority; but a select Company, who by arbitration may
compose and end the difference: and so concludeth <hi>p.</hi> 228.
that here is nothing about Church-Government; though
by Analogie some things about it may be hence drawn.</q>
This is the sum of this opinion, which I shall first refute and
then consider his grounds for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. And first of all I cannot but wonder that this
learned Author should with so much cofidence deny this
place to speak of Church-Government; and not say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in answer to the many Arguments for establishing a
Form of Government, which are drawn from it by many
Learned men; as <hi>Gillespy</hi> in his <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in
his <hi>Jus Divin Reg.</hi> Eccles. Beza de Excom. &amp; Presbyt. Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57560:56"/>
of Church-reformation; and other Presbyterians: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
many Authors of other judgments. What? are all their
Arguments unworthy to be taken notice of, and easily blown
away with Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> his bare Assertion? for what he saith of
the matters of offence spoken of in this place, he seemeth to
aim at a new opinion, but I cannot see wherein it differeth
from what the <hi>Erastians</hi> hold, save in its obscurity: for
when he hath with them, made them to be no Scandals,
nor Sins against God, but private injuries against our
Neighbours, he will not have them to be Civil causes, or
Law-suits; but such differences as respect Persons, not
things. What these can be I cannot understand, for what
wrong can I do to my Neighbour besides scandalising him
by Sin against God, for which he may not Sue me at Law?
if he mean not matters of Money or <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> but
other injuries against ones Person, as beating, reproaches,
slanders &amp;c. (as I guess he doth, so far as I can see his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
through the midst of his words) these are yet Civil
causes, and matters of Law-Suit: and this is the one part
of what the <hi>Erastians</hi> here understand: neither do I see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reason for understanding these here, and not other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Injuries, as the <hi>Erastians</hi> do: for is it imaginable that
Christ would prescribe this course for redress of wrongs
in our own Persons and names, and not also for wrongs
in our Estates? but it may be he meaneth that though the
injuries here meant, be in matters Civil; yet the design of
the place is not to prescribe a way of making up the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but of taking away the animosities, and quarrels that
these injuries breed among Christians; but this cannot hold;
for sure the best way of allaying the animosities that arise
about injuries done by one to another, must be by deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
what is the due of each, and who doth, and who
sustaineth the wrong, and so making reparation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done. We must not then think that Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
one course for repairing the wrong; and another
for taking away contention about it: but it is his Will
that Christians in such cases, either let their wrongs be
judged by the arbitration of Friends; or if that cannot be,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57560:56"/>
by that law: and whethersoever of these waies the matter
be determined; that they should acquiesce, and not contend
any more. Besides this, when I receive a private injurie
from another, it is my duty to lay aside all grudge and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity
against him, which if I be willing to do, why should
the matter be brought before others, or to the Church? if
I be not willing to do it, it is not like that I will bring it
thus to others, who may persuade me to lay aside animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
against him. I cannot understand how I can bring a
matter of private wrong to be judged by others, except it
be in reference to the getting of some reparation of that
wherein I conceive my self to be wronged. If he mean
that I should bring the matter before others, not that my
animosity may be laid aside (that being my duty without
such adoe) but that they may persuade him who hath
wronged me to lay aside his grudg, and be reconciled to
me: sure this cannot be the Scope of the place, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ giveth another rule in that Case, which will
sooner attain that end, <hi>viz.</hi> Forgive him, <hi>Lu.</hi> 17. 3. and indeed
it is a more compendious way to allay his fury, to carry it
dutifully, friendly and kindly to him, than to convent him
before others. Also because it is a strange reflection of the
Sence of the expression, Trespass against thee <hi>i. e.</hi> refuse to
be reconciled to thee: sure there is no Warrant in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or reason from the notation of the word, thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it. And besides all this, this exposition destroys the
Authors opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that this place is not meant of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals;
for when one hath wronged me, and I am willing to
forgive him and be at peace with him, and he refuseth to
be reconciled to me; this is a Sin against God, and a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of an high nature. Now why the place should be
meant of taking away this sort of Scandal and no other
(seeing other Scandals also are Sins against the Scandalized,
as is clear 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.) I think it is hard to conjecture
except Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> must say so to make up the opinion that
he intendeth to defend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. But I shall now prove that this place speaketh
purposely of Scandals, or Sins against God, whereby the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57560:57"/>
Consciences of others are offended; and not of private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.
And that briefly because this is largely and fully
performed by all our Authors who write against <hi>Erastians.</hi>
2. Our Lord had spent the former part of the Chapter
about Scandals, especially in pressing your shunning to give
offence, and in shewing the danger of offences; both to the
offended, and especially to the offender, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. Now in all
this discourse he had said nothing of the means of taking
away of Scandals: wherefore seeing he joyneth these words
we dispute about, to the former discourse of Scandal; it
may be out of question that he is here laying down that
way of removing these Scandals when they should arise in
his Church, that the evils he had spoken of may not ensue
upon them. 2. The design of this Remedy here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
is to gain the faulty Person: now this expression of
gaining Men from that which is Evil, is in Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used in reference to Sins against God, which are apt to
destroy men, and whereby they are lost. 3. this evil from
which the Person is to be gained, is Sin or Scandal. If it
be said that it is gaining of a brother, when he is Persuaded
to lay aside animosity against a brother, and to be reconciled
to him: this is true only and so far as such animosity is Sin:
for on no other account, freeing of one from it can be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
gaining him in Scripture-Phrase; and if there animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
be here spoken of only as they are Scandals, then the
Scope of the place is to redress Scandals; for <hi>à quatenus ad
omne valet consequentia.</hi> 3. To sin against a brother is (in
the Phrase of the New Testament) mainly, if not only, to
wrong his Conscience or Spiritual Estate by Scandal. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
8. 12. or to be guilty of Sin against God in his sight or
conscience <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 18, 21. so <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 3, 4. Neither can
any instance be brought where it signifies a private injury
as such; therefore it must be meant of Scandal. 4. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of private Injuries in a charitable way, it is not
usual to lead Witnesses: but these belong to a judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
but here the matter is to be established by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
<hi>Ergo</hi> it is a matter not to be transacted in such a way
as this Author would have these private Injuries. 5. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57560:57"/>
that Christ would have us count our Brother a
Heathen or a Publican, and would have him bound in
Heaven for persisting in a fact that either is no sin against
God, or which is not considered as a sin against God:
doth the Holy Ghost any where speak so of private inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
considered as such? no sure; but if private injuries
are to be thus noted with censure by God and Men, it is
under the notion of heinous sins as they offend God and
scandalize his people, and if so: then Scandals are here
meant; for if such injuries be here spoken of for that
which is common to other Scandals, and especially pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
injuries not particularly mentioned, but set down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the general name of Sin; what a boldness is it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
other sins, and make these only to be here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Next, I come to consider his Notion about the
Church, to which these offences must at last be brought
for remedy: <q>It is, saith he, no juridical Court, but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
company called together by the party offended, who
by arbitration may compose and end the difference.</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Conceit I bring these Reasons: 1. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is to be called together by the offended party; for the
Text carrieth the whole managing of the business to be by
him; and it is very like the stubborn offender will not be
active in this: now, is this a way that our Lord would
prescribe for taking away the distemper of a galled mind,
that his Adversary (so the stubborn offender looketh upon
the other) should chuse the persons before whom he is to
be convented, and who should judg him? this I cannot be
induced to believe, except I see more proof of it than our
Author's bare saying it is so. 2. We must conceive that
these three steps of proceeding here prescribed, have some
notable difference one from another, and are remedies of
different Vertues and operations applyed to this stubborn
Disease. Now the first step is secret Admonition: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is Private and Charitable, not Judicial; the third then
must be different from both: which I cannot conceive how
it is, if it be not authoritative. In this Authors opinion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57560:58"/>
it is no more but this, when two or three Friends cannot
accommodate the matter, then take a few more, having no
more but the same power the former two or three had: now
what great influence can 5, or 6, or 10 have to persuade a
stiff offender, more than 2 or or 3 using the same motives?
'tis not to be imagined that the difference can be such as
Christ intendeth when he prescribeth this as a remedy of
that evil the other could not cure. 3. When Christ is here
prescribing a cure for offences which may fall out among
his people, and is so exact in describing all the steps of it
and final result thereof; we must conceive that his last cure
will be such as will effectually root out that evil so, as, that
it do not any more hurt his Church or those who are harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it. Now if the last mean be only arbitration, and no
juridical authoritative act, this end can never be attained:
for neither is the stubborn offender gained, nor is he taken
away that he may not the same way trouble the other party
as before. What great matter is gained if the wilful party
will not hear this advising Church our Author dreameth of?
he is still a Church-member, enjoying the publick fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the people of God, for all that these arbitrators can
do: and suppose some do withdraw private intimacy with
them, yet we cannot think that all are obliged to it by the
authority of private arbitrators declaring him stubborn,
when all do not know the causes which made them so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
nor the proofs that did convince them of the truth
of what was alledged against him. It is then evident that this
last Remedy of the miscarriage (be what it will) of a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
offender which Christ here prescribeth, is an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
act, and therefore the Church here is no company of
private men for arbitration. 4. Though we grant that the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifieth any company called together, yet here
it must be of more restricted signification; and must needs
signify a company called out of the World by the Gospel to
worship God, and to serve him in the managing of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and institutions; which is not applicable to a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of arbitrators called by a man, not by the Gospel, to
agree contending parties, which is a work of duty common
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57560:58"/>
to all the World, and none of the special works of the
Church as distinguished from other Societies. Now that
the word <hi>Church</hi> must be thus understood, and not as Mr.
<hi>Stilling.</hi> would have it, I prove 2dly; It is constantly
so used by the Writers of holy Scripture; neither can an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
be brought in all the New Testament where any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put <hi>Ecclesia</hi> for a company met about any business, save
that the Town-Clerk of <hi>Ephesus</hi> used it otherwise, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.
39. and <hi>Luke,</hi> speaking of him in his own dialect, useth it
as he did, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. But when Christ here speaketh of a
Church to which he sendeth his offended people by a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law for the redress of their grievances, we must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conceive that he will have them by the <hi>Church,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that which is ordinarily known by that name in
the New Testament; for how should they know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an ambiguous word, but by the constant Use of it in
the Scripture? 2. The demonstrative article added in the
Greek putteth the matter beyond all question, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
signifieth a particularly designed Church, which they to
whom it is said, have pointed out unto them: not any
Church, this or that, an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> or such a Church
as themselves may particularize or pitch upon: it is not
[a] Church, but [the] Church, Now a company of
Arbitrators chosen <hi>ad libitum</hi> by the grieved party, are not
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> [the] Church particularly, as <hi>individuum
determinatum</hi> designed by Christ; they are at best but [a]
Church, and should be here designed only <hi>confusè,</hi> or <hi>vage,
huic aut illi ecclesiae,</hi> which the word cannot bear. Now
if we take it for a Ruling-church, or whatever Church in
Scripture-sense, it is here determined what Church we
should bring the matter to, <hi>viz.</hi> that particular Church we
live in (at least in <hi>prima instantia)</hi> and it is not left to our
liberty to chuse what Church of many particulars we will
complain unto. Or if we take the article here prefixed to
denote the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of that Church here spoken of, and to
determine the word to its <hi>famosius significatum;</hi> it hath
the same strength of an argument: for, not a company of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57560:59"/>
private Arbitrators, but Christians, or their Representatives
met for the worship of God, or administration of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of his House, are that Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. I come now to examine what Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi>
hath to say against this interpretation of the place, or for that
which himself hath devised. <hi>P.</hi> 222. he undertaketh to
prove that the Offence here spoken of is not any scandal or
Sin against God, but a private injury. <q>His arguments are,
1. from the parallel place, <hi>Luke 17. 3. If thy brother tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
againts thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him;</hi>
this is private injury, because a private Brother may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
it, which is not in his power were it a scandal to the
whole Church, unless we make every private person to
excommunicate and release one another.</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That
<hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3, 4. is parallel to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. I do not
question; and indeed all the Commentators that I have
met with, make them relate to the same passage of Christs
preaching: but this (if we may lay any weight on the
judgment of men) doth make much against Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> for
he understandeth <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. not of Scandals, but of the
bare injury, so then must this place also, but the Text and
context both do make it evident, as I conceive, that this place,
is not meant of Private Injuries (but in so far as they are
Scandals) but of scandalous sins: I say the context doth
prove it; because our Lord is there speaking of Scandals:
it is the very purpose that he is upon <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. The Text
also proveth it, for the first remedy to be applyed to this
evil, is Rebuke: which is known to be a more proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for Scandal than private wrong: and then, the fruit
of this remedy, Repentance, doth relate to Scandals rather
than to private wrongs. Neither doth it follow that it is
private injury, because a private person may forgive it; for
we must understand it of private Scandal, not such as is
publick, and a scandal to the whole Church, as Mr. <hi>Still.</hi>
supposeth. Now when the Offender repenteth upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Rebuke, the Rebuker may forgive him 3 ways: 1. By
not charging him any more with guiltiness, but looking on
him, as one whom the Lord hath pardoned. That this is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57560:59"/>
called <hi>forgiveness</hi> in Scripture, is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 10.
where the whole Church is commanded thus to forgive the
excommunicated man who had repented. 2. By exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that Christian familiar love toward him, which we
ought not to exercise towaad them who live in sin. 3. By
forbearing to bring the matter to any more publick hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which, had not the party repented, had been his duty.
Now this giveth not a power of Excommunicating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing
to a private person; but only a power of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Use of our own charity. His second Answer is the
same, only built on another Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. <q>Where
Christ in answer to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Question, bids us <hi>forgive our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as oft as he repenteth.</hi>
               </q> The answer is also the same;
for we must forgive a scandalous Brother (in the way but
now laid down) as oft as he repenteth; and not bring him
to publick Rebuke, but in case of obstinacy. His 3d. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this, If this be matter of Scandal that is here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of; then might a matter of Scandal be brought before
the Church when there is no way to decide it, there being
but one privy to it, who is the Accuser, he affirmeth, and
the Offender denyeth. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Doth not this same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
follow if the matter be a private Injury? May
there not in that case be no way for the Arbitrators to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the matter, the Offender denying, and the injured
party affirming, and that where himself is the party? The
Objecter then is as much obliged to answer this argument
as we are. But 2dly, This inconvenience is easily avoided
thus: if the grieved person be the only witness of the fact,
and the offender deny the fact, it ought not to come before
the Church, neither is this injunction to be understood of
such cases: but where either the fact is known to more
than one (for even so it may be a private and no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
offence) or where the Offender doth not deny the
fact; but denyeth that it is wrong: in that case, first two
or three, then the whole Church must endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him. It is a bad consequence; some works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for want of witness, cannot be decided by the Church;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> We are not commanded to bring scandals before the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57560:60"/>
Church. That which he addeth <hi>p.</hi> 223. <q>That Christ here
speaketh as to an ordinary case, and in allusion to what
was then in Use among the <hi>Jews;</hi> which was to reprove
one another, commanded <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. and for neglect of
which, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was thought to be destroyed by <hi>R. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
               </q>
This I say, is nothing to the purpose; for I suppose
these Reproofs, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. and which are mentioned by
that Rabby, were not only for private Injuries, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for sin against God: wherefore this consideration ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not a little against the design for which it was
brought. <hi>P.</hi> 224. <q>He will not have the Church here
spoken of to be the Christian Church; because, saith he,
Christ is speaking to a present case, and layeth down a
present Remedy. Now if he lay down Rules for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
his Church; this could not be, because there
were yet no Ecclesiastical Courts for them to appeal to: if
then the case had presently fallen out, they were left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a redress, having no Church to tell it unto.</q> 
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It
cannot be proved that Christ here layeth down Rules for a
case presently practicable, more than he doth when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powereth
his Apostles, and chargeth them concerning their
work, <hi>Matth. 16. 19. John 20. 23. Mal.</hi> 28. 19. and yet
will have them to delay a while before they should put all
that power in act. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. And indeed we have far
better cause to think that he is telling his people what to
do in the after and ordinary times of his Church, than what
they should do in that present and extraordinary case, when
the Church was not yet framed, and when they had himself
personably to go to for direction. 2dly, However we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this Rule, as it serveth for our times, so might it
serve for that time in which it was spoken: for if the case
had then fallen out, though there were not the ordinary
Ecclesiastical Courts to go to, that now ought to be, yet
there wanted not a visible Church-power residing in the
person of Christ, and after in the Apostles, to whom did
succeed the ordinary Judicatures: so that the offended par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wanted never a Church to make his complaint unto. I
do not say that <hi>[Tell the Church]</hi> doth directly signifie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57560:60"/>
any other to which the complaint was to be made, but the
ordinary guides of the Church; for our Lord accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his terms he useth to the ordinary cases in which this
Law was to take place; but by Analogie, it is applicable
to any who in extraordinary cases act the part of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Guides of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. I agree to the argument of Mr. <hi>Gillespy,</hi> cited by the
Author, that unless we understand the word Church as usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
it would be no easie matter to know what Christ here
meaneth by the Church; for seeing this was to be a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law in all Ages, 'tis not imaginable that the Lord
would have us otherwise understand the terms of it than
they are ordinarily used in the Bible, which he intended
should constantly be in his Peoples hands. Neither is that
of any weight which our Author opposeth to this; that
such as so argue would do well to consider, how those
to whom Christ spake, should apprehend his meaning, if
he spake in a sense they never heard of before. We consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they may easily understand Christs words, because
he had often before spoken to them of the Gospel-church
that was to be set up, and even in this very term of a
Church, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. and frequently under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> which they might easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
to be meant by the Church. Wherefore the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
did not well consider what he said, when he supposed
this language to be unknown to the Disciples. Hence all
that he saith of the way of understanding Scripture in the
sence of the words then common, is not to the purpose;
for, Christ had made this sense common among them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must we understand the word as it was then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehend among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but as it was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among Christs ordinary Hearers, who were in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another Church, and another way of Government
in it to be set up, than was then among the <hi>Jews.</hi> I find
no more in the Author that is argumentative either against
our opinion of this Text, or for his own. He concludeth
<hi>p.</hi> 228. that this place, though it speaks not of Church-government,
yet it may have some influence on it by way
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57560:61"/>
of Analogy, <hi>viz.</hi> in proving, 1. Gradual Appeals, 2. Church-censures,
3. The lawfulness of Excommunication. This
he yieldeth at least, that something of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be inferred from this place: then <hi>ex concessis,</hi> it
is not so impertinent to this purpose as he would have
made us believe in the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. But let us see if we can draw any more out
of it than he will yield us. We have already proved it to
be directly meant of Church-Government, and to give
Rules for the right managing of it: now I assert, that it
doth implicitly determine the form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it ought to be by Parity, not <hi>Episcopacy;</hi>
which I thus make out: The first Authority before which
the complaint of the grieved party is to be brought, is the
Church, (and it is also the last:) but if the Church were
governed by Bishops, this should not be, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church
ought not to be governed by Bishops. The Major is clear;
for after secret and private admonition (which are not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative)
immediately succeedeth <hi>[Tell the Church:]</hi>
sure this Church must be that Authority which we must go
to <hi>prima instantia,</hi> and also that which must finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the matter; seeing Excommunication doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
so low upon Disobliging this Authority. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
I prove thus: in the Episcopal way, the complaint
must be brought to the Bishop or to his Delegate or Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
(which is all one as to the matter of Authority) and
he must be the last that must determine, and on disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him followeth Excommunication: but the Bishop
is not the Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi> In the Episcopal way complaints
cannot be made to the Church, nor doth the Church fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
decide the matter. The Minor of this last Syllogism
is evident; for neither the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure of the word, nor Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Use
will bear, that one Man shall be called the Church.
If it be said that Episcopacy be so modelled, as the Bishop
with the Presbyter may judg of the offence, and they may
well be called the Church. <hi>Answ.</hi> In that case, either the
Presbyters have a decisive Vote as well as the Bishop, or
they be only his Advisers. In the first case the Bishop is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57560:61"/>
only a <hi>Praeses:</hi> which is not that Episcopacy pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
though we judg it inconvenient. In the 2d, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is the only Power, and therefore there is no such
Church as here meant, for the Church here is a Church
cloathed with Authority, whom the party ought to hear, <hi>i. e.</hi>
obey, and for contumacy against which he is Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated:
but the Bishop and his counsel is not such a Church;
for his counsel hath no Authority, and himself cannot make
a Church; and therefore both taken together, make no
Church having Authority.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <p>HERE Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> doth undertake to lay aside Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
practice from being a pattern for us in the
matter of Church-Government; What success he hath in
this attempt we now examine. His two main scopes in
this Chapter, are, that it cannot be known what the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Apostles was in this; and that if it were known,
it is no binding example to us; which desperate assertions
do, not a little, reflect upon the Scripture and tend to the
casting loose the Government of the Church. The latter
of them I have spoken to before, and purpose to examine
what he saith for it. Concerning the former, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
but this to our trying of his proofs, that it is very
strange the Spirit of God in Scripture hath written so much
of their practice, both Historically, and implied it in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal
assertions and Precepts, if for all this we cannot
know what it was; which if it do not accuse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-relation
of things of great imperfection, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
for I am sure the Scripture doth purposely set down
much of their practice, both in Preaching, administration
of Sacraments, ordination of Officers, directing these Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in their behaviour in the House of God, censures
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57560:62"/>
and other parts of Government: if yet we cannot know
by Scripture what was their way in Ruling; the account
given of these things must be very imperfect. I believe it
would be imputed to any Writer of the History of a Church,
if out of his History could not be gathered what was the
Government of that Church: shall we then think that
the Sacred Writers, who have undertaken to give us an
account of the acts of the Apostles, are so deficient? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
many of the writings of the Apostles themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added by the same Spirit; out of which much may be
gathered to this purpose. But let us hear how he makes
out this his strange opinion. I insist not on what he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of the Apostles Commission; I confess the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not expressed in it: though we have ground
to think, that when Christ chargeth them to teach his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to observe all he commanded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.
that it was his Will that they should not leave so great a
matter as is the form of Church-Government to mens
Will; but that his Institution should be observed in this:
especially seeing he spent 40 days with them before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3. speaking of the things pertaining to
the Kingdom of God, that is the Gospel-Church: it is
hard to think that among all his Instructions to them then,
he told them nothing of his Will about the way of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Church. Neither do I take notice of his large
Discourse about the Division of Provinces among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
nor of his too true observation, that looking on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
practice through the Glass of our own customs, hath
bred many mistakes: only I wonder at his bringing that
for an instance, that Lay-Elders are proved from the name
Presbyters: I believe there was never any that used such
an Argument, seeing the name is common to them and
Preaching-Elders. He will find stronger arguments than
this for that Order of Church-Officers, if he please to read
the Assertors of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. For clearing what was Apostolical Practice he
layeth down this as a foundation, <hi>p.</hi> 239, &amp;c. <q>That the
Apostles in the forming Churches did observe the custom
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57560:62"/>
of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogue.</q> About this Notion he spendeth
a huge deal of pains, as if the strength of his cause lay
here; but to what purpose it is, except to shew his reading
and skill in Antiquity, I know not. Doth it follow, the
Apostles imitated the <hi>Jews</hi> in the matter of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> we are not obliged to imitate the Apostles?
I should think that the contrary consequence might rather
be inferred; but whatever be of that, this we are sure of,
that whether there was any coincidency or similitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Apostolical and the Jewish way, or not; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostles in what they did had an eye at the Jewish
Example, or not: they were acted by an infallible Spirit,
which did both guide them unerringly, and warrant them
unquestionably to do what they did in the management of
Church-Government, so that it is not the occasion of
their taking such or such a way that we are to look to,
but the morality of it, that should determine us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, because we know it is the will of Christ. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I might pass without any more notice all that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in many sheets of the modelling the Government of
the Church by that of the Synagogue. Yet for further
clearing the matter, I shall lay down a few Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. First, I take notice how inconsistent this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is with himself in this Point; for <hi>p.</hi> 322. he assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<q>That the Apostles did not observe (in probability)
one fixed course of setling the Government of Churches,
but setled it according to the several circumstances of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and persons which they had to deal with.</q> I hope he
will not deny, but the Jewish way of Government was
one and the same every where: How then did the Apostles
imitate that, if they were so various in their setling of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
sure if they did not stick to one form, they
did not stick to the Jewish form. But I perceive he would
fain say any thing that might cast Church-Government at
an uncertainty; however the ways he taketh to this end,
do clash one with another. 2. All this pains he taketh,
tendeth either to prove nothing, or to prove that which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57560:63"/>
himself will not own: for suppose that he had evinced
that the Apostles did imitate the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Church-administrations:
if any thing follow, it must be this, that
these things which were done by the Apostles on such an
account are not now binding, but are indifferent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
by men: and that as the Apostles had their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in imitating the <hi>Jews,</hi> or not, so we have our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in imitating the Apostles, or not, in them. Now this
I am sure he dare not own in most of these things which
he maketh to have been taken up from the Jewish customs:
for he speaketh, <hi>p.</hi> 240. <q>of Christs taking many Rites of
the Lords Supper from the <hi>postcoenium</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and the Use of Baptism from the Baptisms used in initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Proselytes, and Excommunication from their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of the Synagogue; and afterward he maketh
building of Churches, to be taken from the Synagogues:
publick reading of the Scripture, and Pastors from the
<hi>Archisynagogi:</hi> Ordination from that used among the
<hi>Jews:</hi> Will then Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> say that all these are now
indifferent.</q> That Baptism, Excommunication, Pastors,
nay Ordination are no Institutions of Christ; and that as
the Apostles took them from the <hi>Jews ad placitum;</hi> so
we may take them from the Apostles, or leave them, as we
list. Sure he will not say it: and if he saith not this, he
saith nothing, but <hi>magno conatu nihil agit: parturiunt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
nascetur ridiculus mus.</hi> 3. It is needful to distinguish
the things that the Apostles did by imitation take from
the <hi>Jews,</hi> by confounding of which Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> hath
mired himself and his Reader too. There are 1. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
that are the dictates of Nature and Reason: as that
publick assembling be ordinarily in some one convenient
place: that in a Society there be Rulers and Ruled: that
where many Rule they meet together for that end: that
in their meeting one preside, to avoid confusion, &amp;c.
2. There are other things which be the commandments
of God concerning his moral Worship; as that Prayers,
Praises, pulick reading of his Word, with opening of it,
that his people may know his Will, be performed in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57560:63"/>
solemn meetings of his people. 3. God's ceremonial Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which consisteth in the observance of Rights sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
or peculiar to Religion, without which all that
Worship of God might well be performed, which is, and
hath been of moral and perpetual Obligation. 4. Such
things as receive their usefulness and fitness from custom:
as Words, Habits, Gestures, &amp;c. Now for the first two
sorts, though there was co-inciding in them, between the
Jewish and Apostolical way (and indeed it could not be
otherwise, Nature and what is of moral Obligation being
the same unto all) yet that the Apostles were determined
in these by the Jewish Example, we deny. For the 3d,
It is clear, that the Apostles used no such things with the
Jewish Church, except a few for a time to avoid Scandal,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. 29. Yea, they are declared unlawful to be
used, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9, 10. and 5. 1, 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. which I
am elswhere to shew more at length. The 4th sort of
things we hold to be in themselves indifferent, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
by the laudable custom of every place. Neither
do we deny the Apostles to have in many of these imitated
the Jewish Church; and no wonder, because they lived
among them. Now Church-Government having in it
some things of all these sorts, it is clear from what hath
been said, how far we confess the Apostles to have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Jews</hi> in it; and how far not. That wherein we are
likest to controvert with Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> is, about things of the
third sort, which I must yet distinguish: they were either
such as the Lord had commanded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or such as
they without his command did take up. The former, he doth
not alledg that the Apostles followed the <hi>Jews</hi> in. The
latter he asserteth, and we deny it; and shall anon hear
what he bringeth for his Assertion. But for further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this and the whole matter, I lay down a fourth consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<hi>viz.</hi> to make it out, that the Apostles did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the <hi>Jews,</hi> there are two things required. 1. To shew
the co-incidency of their practice. 2. To shew that this
co-incidency did proceed from a design of conformity, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the Apostles were determined in such things by the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57560:64"/>
Jewish Example: for the former without the other is no
imitation, because in imitation, the former practice must
have some influence on that which followeth; such as the
exemplary cause hath on the <hi>exemplatum.</hi> Now if the
Apostles did (in some of these) the same things with the
Jewish Church, only accidentally, or upon other motives;
and did not (as Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> phraseth it) copy out the
Jewish way of Government, 'tis no imitating of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. From what hath been said, it will be easie to
maintain against Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> large Discourse, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did not in the Government of the Church imitate
the Jewish Synagogue as their Pattern; I shall touch such
things in his Discourse as seem to prove it. And 1. I take
notice of that which was occasionally touched before, <hi>p. 240,
viz.</hi> 
               <q>That Christ delighted to take up the received practices
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the <hi>Postcoenium</hi> he turned to the Lords
Supper, Baptism of Proselytes, imitated to Christian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
casting out of the Synagogue to Excommunication.
And this he saith he did with Rites, not which were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
founded on <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law; but which were brought
in by a confederate Discipline among themselves. This,
saith he, hath been abundantly manifested by many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men; of which he cited some in his Margin.</q> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
many learned Men, especially such as have spent their
pains in Critical Learning, have done but bad service to
Christ and his institutions, while to serve their <hi>Phoenomena,</hi>
and make their critical Conjectures the more plausible, they
have made Mens devices like <hi>Maezentius</hi> his bed to curtail
or stretch out Christs Institutions by them at their pleasure.
But the Authority of such Men, though never so learned,
shall not perswade me (what their Reasons may do I say
not, till I hear and consider them) to think that Christ had
such delight in Mens inventions in the Worship of God,
as to make them the Pattern of his Gospel-institutions;
and that rather than the Ceremonies, which of old were
of divine Authority: shall we think that he who condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Mens Doctrines in Gods Worship, as vain, <hi>Mal.</hi> 15. 9.
and especially in that Chapter, condemneth a Ceremony
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57560:64"/>
brought in by confederate Discipline, which in it self was
as harmless as any of these mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> often Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
shall we think, I say, that he had such pleasure in
these things? sure he cannot be so unlike himself. Neither
I am sure can the Assertors of this Paradox, shew any such
difference between that Ceremony and these here instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as that Christ should hate the one, and delight in the
other. For that often alledged, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> placed
much Religion in their often Washings (besides that the
thing simply, not their opinion, is condemned in the place
cited) it cannot be made out, that they placed more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in this, than they did in their <hi>Postcoenium,</hi> washing of
Proselytes, &amp;c. For further Answer to this Assertion of our
Authors, I add, that supposing Christ did make his Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to consist of some material acts, like to these of the
Jewish uncommanded observations (for this is the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest,
that the Authors consideration can pretend to prove)
it doth not follow that he approved of these inventions:
neither that we may mould the affairs of the Church
by our Reason and skill without Scripture; and that for
these Reasons: 1. From Christs Wisdom. 2. From his
Authority which did warrant him to do such things, and
doth not make it lawful for the Church now to do them.
1. I say, from his Wisdom: he is an able and competent
Judg of what is suted to Gospel-worship, and what not:
and therefore of these unwarranted Observations in Use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Jews,</hi> he could chuse what was fittest for his
designs (the things being indifferent in themselves) and
appoint them in his Church: we cannot so well judg of the
fitness of a thing to his design in the Gospel-model of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
and therefore must not take such liberty in doing
what Man hath done without a special institution of Christ.
Moreover, he knew well how in the depth of his Wisdom
to make such a choice in his institutions serve unto two
great ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the gaining of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by making as
little diffrrence between the old way (to which they were
wedded) and the new Gospel-way, as could be: and the
adorning of his Gospel-service with most fit and excellent
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57560:65"/>
Ceremonies: this cannot be pretended for devices of Men
in Gods Worship, whether found out by themselves, or
wherein they imitate others. 2. For his Authority, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
these Observations being uncommanded were on that
account unlawful to the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet the things materially
considered being indifferent, and Christ having absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to institute particulars in his Church, he might
well chuse these, and seal them with his Authority, and so
make them both lawful and duty to us: this no Man can
do; they must have his Command for Institution; and not
make them by their own authority. Wherefore Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Jewish Customs for Patterns to his Institutions (if
he did so) maketh nothing for Men's setting up their insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
in the Church; or for the indifferency of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
peculiarly to the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. That which he saith <hi>ibid:</hi> maketh little to his
purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That even when God did determine the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives
of Worship, he left the Morals to the wisdom and
discretion of his People: which he instanceth in building
and ruling Synagogues.</q> Ans. this is true of such things
as are of common concernment to Religion and other Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
we also allow such parts of Church-Government to
be managed by Christian Prudence: his instance proveth
no more; for we permit also the building of Churches to
prudence. But the question is about things proper to the
Church as it is a Religious Society: these things we deny to
have been left to prudence among the Jews, or to be now
so left among Christians. I cannot yield to what he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to aim at, when he saith, <q>that though the reason of
erecting Synagogues was builded on a command, <hi>viz.</hi> Of
having holy Convocations, yet they were not built for a
long time after they came to the Land:</q> I cannot think
that the building of Synagogues was indifferent though the
place and manner was: for the same command that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
holy Convocations, requireth that there be a place
fit for them. If they were at first long of building, it was
either from some impediment, or from inexcusable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
Much less do I agree to what followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57560:65"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> requireth the duty of Assembling, yet he
prescribes no Orders for the place of meeting, nor for the
manner of spending these dayes in Gods service, nor for
the Persons who were to superintend the publick work.</q>
Ans. the first of these, as to the Circumstances of it, is left
to Prudence, it being meerly a natural Circumstance of
Worship, the second for substance is in the law, <hi>viz.</hi> What
duties they should spend the day with, <hi>viz.</hi> Sacrificing in
the Temple, reading the Law, and Teaching the People in
other places: the natural Circumstances of this are also
left to prudence. The third is falsly asserted: are not the
<hi>Levites</hi> appointed to superintend that work when they are
made the Publick Teachers of the People? Wherefore all
this maketh nothing for his design, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Church-Government was left to Prudence, and that the
Christian should be so. Their reading of the Law we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove;
but deny it to have been voluntary but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
their curious dividing of it, and leaving out some
of it we disprove, as the fruit of the superstitions of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages of that Church: and indeed it may be compared
with the frame of our Service-Book, though it was not so
bad by far. I insist not on his guesses about the Government
of Synagogues, which he taketh much pains to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be like the Government in the Apostolick Church,
that he might make us believe, that this was taken from
that. I only observe that the product of all his pains is not
<hi>operae pretium:</hi> both because of the uncertainty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, that there were such Officers so employed in
the Synagogues: as also the far off resemblances that are
between them and Officers in the Christian Church; as any
attentive Reader may observe. And so I pass to <hi>p.</hi> 253.
where he sheweth how far the Apostles in forming Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Churches did follow the Jewish Pattern.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. I smile indeed to consider how Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
this his notion, and judgeth this birth of his own
Brain, as that which with his Improvement <q>(such as it
hath yet received from no other) will be more conducible
than any he knoweth to the happy end of composing our
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57560:66"/>
differences about Church-Government.</q> I hope I have said
as much of this notion. <hi>p.</hi> 186. &amp;c. as will make it to be
of less esteem with unbyassed men. I profess I cannot yet
understand, for all that I have meet with in this Author a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, how this Notion should have any such effect, for the
Question is not what pattern the Apostles followed, so
much, as whether what they did was the Institution of Christ,
and whether we ought to follow them as our pattern: and
to the determining of this I see very little or no Use of this
notion which he so much crieth up. But to make it get
entertainment he taketh much pains. First, he promiseth
some general considerations to make it probable: and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
next how the Apostles did imitate the Synagogue in 4
particulars. Let us hear what probability it getteth from
his Considerations. The 1 is, <q>That Christ and his Disciples,
and Christians afterward went under the name of <hi>Jews;</hi>
that they kept Communion with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and observed
their Customes, not only which were commanded of God,
but which they had taken up themselves, if they were not
contrary to Gods commands.</q> Here are 3 or 4 considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
jumbled together, some of which are false, others true,
but prove not the Point. I shall answer them more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than he hath set them down. And first for the name,
it is no wonder they were called <hi>Jews,</hi> for they were so
by nation: if at any time they owned themselves as of the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, that proveth nothing; for this they might
do, because the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, as commanded of God, was
the same in Substance with the Christian, see <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 22.
It doth not from this follow that there were the same Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations
in the <hi>Jewish</hi> and Christian-Church. And if
in after-times the Jews and Christians were both reckoned
as one body by the Heathens (for which he bringeth some
proof <hi>p.</hi> 255. and 256.) yet it doth not follow, which he
there inferreth, <hi>viz.</hi> That they observed the same Rites and
Customes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this mistake of the Heathens did proceed part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the agreement that was between Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as to most great points of Religion: partly from the
Agreement of their Rites in this, that both were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57560:66"/>
the Heathen Rites. Neither did the Heathens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the difference between Jews and Christians, though
wise men among them knew that there was a difference:
this may be gathered from <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 15. and <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 19,
20. It doth not follow from this, that the Rites were the
same. 2. For their keeping communion with the Jews, this
doth far less prove the point: and that because, 1. the
time when they kept Communion with the Jews was
when the Jewish Church was yet standing, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
not framed nor erected: our Author cannot prove
that they kept Communion with them after the Christian
Churches were set up: for their going to the Temple and
the Synagogues to Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, proveth nothing. For that they
did because the People were there met, not because they
would join in their Service. 2. Because it was fit for that
time to yield to the Jews so far as was possible, that they
might be gained to the Gospel: hence they observed even
some of the legal Ceremonies, they being then indifferent:
but it followeth not that they did settle the ordinance and
abiding practices of the Church by the Pattern of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.
<hi>Paul's</hi> being freely admitted into the Synagogue
to Preach, proveth no more than we have granted: his
condescending to them did procure this, not his framing
Gospel-Churches according to their mould, much less
is this his design proved by the mistake of the believing
Jews about the conversion of the Gentiles, and their being
zealous for observing the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> yea and grant that
they were zealous for the uncommanded Customes of their
Father, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he alledgeth. For this proceeded from their
being bred up in these things, and their Ignorance of the
mind of God in abolishing them, and in calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
and the Apostle's yielding to the Jews as far as might
be for a time, was because he had not yet shewed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Gospel and Jewish Church, because they
could not then bear it: but with what shaddow of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
doth it follow from this that the Apostles did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
frame the Christian Church after the model of the
Jewish? For the <hi>3d.</hi> it is a bold and most false assertion,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57560:67"/>
that Christ and his Disciples conformed to the uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Customes of the Jews: yea they are accused for Non-conformity
in this point <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 2. And Christ defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them in it, and meerly on this Account, that these
customs were the traditions of men, and humane doctrines:
which is true of all uncommanded Customes in Religion.
But how proveth he this Assertion? he bringeth Instances;
Christ observed the Feast of dedication: this is Impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said; he walked in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 22, 23. that
he might have occasion to teach the People: but did he
offer a Sacrifice, or observe any other rite or Custome of
the Feast? we read no such thing, going to their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and teaching there was no uncommanded Custome.
Washing the Disciples Feet a custom used by the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the passover (saith Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> but others say it was
done between the 2 courses of the passover) this Christ did,
and giveth a Mystical reason for it. <hi>Jo.</hi> 13. 5. but that he
did it in Conformity to the Jewish Custome <q>(if any such
there was) let it be proved, appointing Baptism I hope
hath a better Foundation than the Jewish Custome,</q> but
of this before; thus what he saith in prosecuting his First
consideration, is answered: neither is it as yet probable
that the Apostles imitated the Jewes in framing the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. His <hi>2d</hi> consideration <hi>p.</hi> 257. is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
framed Christian Churches out of Jewish Synagogues:
what solid Proof for this he bringeth let us hear. <q>We see
saith he, how fearful the Apostles were to offend the Jews,
and how ready to condescend to them in any thing that
might be; and if <hi>Paul</hi> would yield to them in circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Tim.</hi> (a thing which might seem to cross the design
of the Gospel) would he scruple to retain the old Model
the Synagogue, when there was nothing in it repugnant
to the doctrine of the Gospel?</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostles at
first did yield very far to the <hi>Jews,</hi> because they could not
at the beginning digest the taking down of the old frame
of Worship, and setting up a new; hence they did conform
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for that time, as much as might be in their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
and occasional practices: but this reason did no way
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57560:67"/>
oblige them to frame their constitutions and practices of
the Church that were to abide afterward, by the Jewish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
because then the Gospel was fully promulgated, and
the Will of Christ known to the new Gospel-Church, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from the old; and in this case we are rather to think
that the Apostles did not conform to the Jewish way in
things not necessary; because as at first, their work was to
bring them to Christ, and so they yielded to them as much as
might be; so afterwards now their work was tobring them
from <hi>Moses,</hi> and to this end it was fit to bring them off all
those customes and waies which might keep that their Idol
yet in their minds, as sure the Jewish customes might do; Here
is more then a shew of reason (which our Author requireth)
why the Apostle should slight the constitution of the Jewish
Synagogues; and besides, it is reason enough why they should
do this, if it be not proved that they did otherwise, seeing
they were guided by an infallible Spirit, not led by mens
Customes in their Actions. I find no further proof of
this consideration, but that they did not only gather Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
out of Synagogues, but that in probability whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
in some places were converted. What ground
there is for this probability I know not; we read nothing
of it, as we read of whole Houses converted: neither see I
any reason to think that the Apostles did respect Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
in their reforming Churches: they made the Churches
of them who had before been in the Synagogues; and that
I believe they did according to the Peoples best conveniency
for partaking of ordinances together: but that their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
were their Pattern I see not. Another argument
from the Jewish and Gentiles <hi>Coetus,</hi> he would fain be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by; but finding it weak, disputeth against it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we lay it aside, and come to his <hi>3d</hi> consideration <hi>p. 260.
viz.</hi> 
               <q>the Synagogue-Model was most agreable to the State
of the Churches in Apostolick times; because it was so
ordered, as that it needed not depend on the Secular
Power for attaining the end of Government.</q> 
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
Wherein the Synagogue-Model was, in the nature of the
thing fitted to the State of the Gospel, we do not say that
the Apostles would reject such a good thing because used
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57560:68"/>
by the Synagogue; only we deny that they used it because
the Synagogue used it: so this proveth nothing. Further
it proveth only co-incidency between the Church and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogogue-Government
in this general that both were such
as might consist without Secular power: but divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
forms may be of this nature; so that there is no need
from this consideration that the Church and the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
be governed by the same Model.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. We see how probable he hath made this his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion:
he cometh <hi>p.</hi> 261. to shew what particular pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the Synagogue, the Apostles did take up and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and first he speaketh of their publick service in the
Church: where all that he can attain to is this, <q>that there
was in the Church, as there had been in the Synagogue,
solemn Prayers, Praises, reading of Scripture, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aching
of the People out of it:</q> all which are parts of Moral
worship; and would have been in the Church though there
had never been a Synagogue to take example by; he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to acknowledge a considerable difference, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>omitting
the reading the Sections of the Law as was done in the
Synagogue, and celebrating the Lords Supper, which was
not in it:</q> which one consideration destroyeth all that he is
at so much pains to establish: for if Christ and his Apostles
had made the Synagogue their pattern, they might easily
have conformed to them in reading the Sections of the
Law and taking the Lords Supper, from some of their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
as well as they did Baptism, as this Author alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Next he cometh <hi>p.</hi> 264. to ordination: about which
he maketh a great deal of do, but to no purpose: for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<hi>i. e.</hi> a Solemn setting of men apart for the Office of
the Ministry, doth naturally follow as necessary to Order;
supposing that some should be in that Office and the work
be not common to all, which I believe should have been in
the Church whatever had been done in the Synagogue; as
for the Rite of it; laying on of hands, whether it was used
in the Synagogue or not is not worth our enquiry, for it
will not thence follow that the Apostles took it from the
confederate discipline of the Synagogue <hi>(i. e.</hi> from their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57560:68"/>
men-devised Customes) as our Author confidently asserteth:
but all that he discourseth proveth not this, but only, if it
prove any thing, that it was used in the Synagogue. I assert
with more warrant that it was taken up both by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
and by the Apostles from the ancient custome of
blessing, or dedicating any thing to God by this Ceremony:
of this Judgment is <hi>Calv. Inst. lib. cap. 4. Sect. hunc autem ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
fluxisse arbitror ab Hebraeorum more, qui quod benedictum
aut consecratum volebant, manuum impositione deo quasi reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentabant:
sic Jacob benedicens Ephraim &amp; Manasse, eorum
capitibus manus imposuit: quod sequutus est dominus noster,
cum super infantes precationem faceret: eodem ut arbitror sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatu
Judaei ex legis praescripto suis sacrificiis manus impone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant:
quare apostoli per manuum impositionem eum se deo offerre
significabant quem initiabant in ministerium: quanquam usui sit
etiam super eos, quibus visibilis spiritus gratias conferebant.</hi> We
see then it was not the practice in Synagogue-Ordination
only: but in many things else, and it is most probable that
this Rite so constantly used in all Ages of the Church, in
all cases of blessing or consecration hath something more in
it then humane Institution in the Synagogue: the constant
use of it by men infallibly guided, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Apostles,
Christ himself; the commanding of it in the like case of
consecration under the Law cannot but give it a stamp of
divine Authority. Yea we find the Levites thus ordained
<hi>Num.</hi> 8. 10. wherefore all this his pains doth not prove
that Gospel-Ordinance was taken up from the humane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Synagogue. A few things in this his discourse.
I shall further shortly take notice of. <hi>p.</hi> 264, 265. he will
have Gospel-Ministers not to succeeed (no not by Analogie)
<q>to the Priests and Levites, but rather to the Officers in the
Synagogues: for the Priests were not admitted by Solemn
Ordination; but judged of their fitness, as to birth and
body by the same ordination: but the Rulers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
were admitted by Ordination: and if any of the
Priests came to that Office, they as well as others had their
peculiar designation and appointment to it.</q> Here I reply.
1. I believe that Gospel-Ministers did not properly succeed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57560:69"/>
to either of these; but stand upon another foundation, <hi>viz.</hi>
Christs Institution: and so it is needless to enquire which
of them they should succeed to. I yield also, that the name
of Priests under the Gospel hath brought in the thing it self,
and even the Mass: which ought not to be. 2. What can
he design by this Discourse? Would he make the Office of
the Ministry stand on no other bottom but imitation of the
Synagogues Rulers; and these Rulers to be brought in by a
confederate Discipline, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be a humane invention? If
he say not this, he saith nothing to the purpose; but I hope
he will not say it. 3. It is false, that the Priests were not
solemnly set apart for their Office; though they had it by
birth, yet they behoved to be solemnly initiated to it; and
I am sure Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> would not have said, that they were no
otherwise set apart but by the judgment of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>
of their birth and body; if he had not in this so consulted
Antiquity, as that he forgot to look into the Bible. I do
not deny but there was such a Judgment to pass on them,
(neither ought Ministers be now admitted without tryal)
yea the Scripture (which is surer than the <hi>Talmud)</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us so much. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 2. 62, 63. Yet we find also their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
setting apart to the Office described, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 41. and
29. 1. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 2, &amp;c. And spoken of, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 18. Yea
the very Idol-Priests would not want this solemn setting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
2 <hi>Chron. 13, 9. Jud.</hi> 17. 5, 12. Yea, our Authors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
everteth it self; for to what purpose was a publick
judging of them before their entry on the exercise of their
Office, if there was no solemn admission of them to it;
sure a solemn declaring them such as God had appointed
his Priests to be (if there had been no more, they being
kept from exercising the Office till this was done) was a
solemn admission. 4. I would know who these others
were who were Rulers of the Synagogue, and so Teachers
of the people; at least Superintenders over Gods publick
Worship (as he elswhere phraseth it) beside the Priests?
if they were only Levites, or others also, as he seemeth to
imply: and if any other but Priests and Levites were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to that Office, I would know <hi>quo warranto:</hi> sure
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57560:69"/>
the Scripture speaketh of these as old Testament-Teachers,
<hi>Neh. 8. 9. 2 Chron.</hi> 17. 8, 9. and of none else, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inspired Prophets. But I see Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> looketh more
to Rabinical stories in these matters, than to the Bible: and
to the customs of the Synagogue in the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
than to the commands of God, as he gave them,
though they be rare who are made mad by too much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yet there are whom too much reading (without hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Scripture as the Rule) maketh to dote. I need
not insist on what he writeth, <hi>p.</hi> 268, &amp;c. of the Rite of
laying on of Hands; enough hath been said, to shew that
it proveth not what he intendeth: nor on the persons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
in the Synagogue and in the Church; of which
he, <hi>pa.</hi> 272, &amp;c. for in both he confesseth abomination to
have been done in common by those in Power; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
without divine Warrant restrained to one: if Christ
hath given power to all Presbyters to do it; we must have
some warrant to restrain this Power ere we dare do it; but
of this enough before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. In his further prosecuting the correspondence of
the Apostolick Church with the Synagogue: he speaketh
<hi>p.</hi> 285. of the Order setled by the Apostles in the Churches
planted by them, for ruling of them: and first he maketh
a work about the name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is the same
with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> used in the Synagogue; but from his own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
it's clear how little weight is to be laid on this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
as to what he intendeth: seeing that name was
ever used to denote Power and Dignity, whether in Church
or State, and so doth no more belong to the Synagogue
than other things. I take notice of what he saith in the
end of <hi>p.</hi> 286. If his design is not to dispute the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of of either party, <hi>(viz.</hi> those who conceive the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
setled the Government of the Church in absolute
purity, or else by Superiority and subordination among the
setled Officers of the Church) but to lay down these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which may equally concern both, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.
But I humbly conceive, it was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon him to answer the arguments of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57560:70"/>
and they must be answered to us before we be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to receive his Doctrine (of which anon) that we
cannot know what form the Apostles setled, and that they
setled not any one form. For as long as arguments brought
by either of the controverting parties do stand untaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
to prove that the Apostles setled this or that form:
the Judgment can never acquiesce in his opinion, that they
setled none; or that we cannot know what they setled.
This is a strange way of disputing, especially when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is to satisfie the Conscience in order to peace, and
yielding up its opinion: to lay down such Principles to
this end, with strong arguments standing against them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
or answered. 'Tis like Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> thinketh that
when he hath furnished Men with some probabilities, that
may encourage them to comply with what Government
shall be set up in the Church; their interest and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
should resist the strength of all arguments against it:
for he will furnish them with no help in this; but they
must have very pliable Consciences, if Will be furnished
to an opinion so maintained. His Principles in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
or all that he will say of the Apostles Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he draweth into 3 Propositions, <hi>p.</hi> 287. which
in sum are these: <q>That we cannot know what was the
Apostles practice: that it was not always the same: that
whatever it was, we are not obliged to observe it. Let us
hear how he maketh these out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. His first Proposition he setteth down thus:
<q>That we cannot arrive to such an absolute certainty what
course the Apostles took in governing Churches, as to infer
from thence the only divine Right of that one form which
the several parties imagine come nearest to it.</q> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is not so ingenuously nor clearly set down as need
were; wherefore I shall a little remove the mist cast on the
Truth by his words, which may make simple Souls mistake
it. And 1. There is some ambiguity in <hi>[absolute certainty]</hi>
if he mean so much certainty as amounteth to Plerophory,
and doth dispell all degrees of darkness and doubting, this
we assert, not that every one may attain (such is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57560:70"/>
of Mens minds (neither is it needful to this that we
look upon what the Apostles did, as being <hi>juris divini.</hi> If
we mean, so much certainty as doth incline the mind to
the one part, and not leave it in suspence: we assert, that
this may be attained in reference to what is in Question.
2. The matter in debate, is very obscurely, if not fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
expressed by these words <hi>[what course the Apostles
took in governing Churches]</hi> the Question is not, whether we
can know every thing that they did in this, (for many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
are comprehended in this general expression) but
whether we can know if the setled Presbyters acting in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or Bishops acting with authority over Presbyters, as
the ordinary Officers of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. It is not fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to imply (as this Proposition doth) that we infer the
only divine Right of one form from bare Apostolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
he knows that we walk upon other grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> we
take Christs command of imitating the Apostles: the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between our case and theirs, which may make the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of our practice to be the same with theirs. 4. It is
not the one form which several parties imagine to come
nearest to Apostolical practice: but that which is proved to
be really the same with it, we plead for: it's not mans ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
but Scriptural grounds which we establish that
correspondency upon, we are asserting between Apostolical
practice, and what we would have to be now in the Church.
The antithesis then which we maintain against this his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
is this, <q>That they who search the Scripture may
come to be satisfied on good grounds, whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in planting Churches did setle Presbyters acting in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or Bishops ruling over Presbyters as their ordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers:
so as they may (considering the duty laid on us to
follow them, and the parity of our case with theirs) infer
the divine Right of that one Form (of these two) which
was used by the Apostles.</q> For proof of this our antithesis
I refer to the consideration laid down, <hi>p.</hi> 184, 185. about
the perfection of Scripture-history, and its design to instruct
us in this point: which doth so far prevail with me, that I
look upon the Authors Proposition as such a reflexion on
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57560:71"/>
Scripture, that any but a Papist may be ashamed of. To this
I add, that the arguments brought for Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by the Assertors of it, do evidently destroy the
Authors Proposition, and do establish our Antithesis: which
seeing he doth not intend nor endeavour to answer, we need
not insist upon. A further confirmation of our Antithesis,
shall be to take off the arguments that he hath brought for
his Proposition, which I now come to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. His first argument is, <hi>p.</hi> 287. from the equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the names and doubtfulness of their significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from which the form of Government used in the
new Testament, should be determined. He saith, That it is
<q>hotly pleaded on both sides, that the form of Government
must be derived from the importance of the names <hi>[Bishop</hi>
and <hi>Presbyter]</hi>
               </q> and that there can be no way to come to
a determination what the certain sense of these names is
in Scripture. He maketh out the uncertainty, by laying
down four opinions about the signification of these names:
and from this variety of interpretation, inferreth that we
cannot know what sense they are to be taken in. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. when
he saith that it is pleaded on both sides, that the form of
Government must be derived from the names of Bishop and
Presbyter; this is a misrepresentation; for 1. There be
arguments from which it might well be derived, though
these names should never be mentioned. 2. When we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
from these Names, it is not from the bare force of the
word; but from this, that the Scripture doth often apply
these names to the same thing, never to divers Officers in
the Church: and therefore, there is no ground for asserting
the difference of Bishop and Presbyter. This is a surer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
than what can be drawn from the importance of
Names. <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is most false and injurious to the Spirit
of God speaking in his word, to say, that there can be no
way to determine what is the certain sense of these names
in Scripture. We must then say, that the Spirit of God
speaketh that which cannot be understood, if he use names
and words to express some thing to us, and it is impossible
to know what is meant by them. When we hear of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57560:71"/>
and Presbyters in any place of Scripture; either we
must say, that these words signifie nothing, or that they
mean somewhat, but no man can know what it is, or that
we may come to know what is meant by them. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
two are foul reflexions on the Author of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
yea, it were a reflexion on a Man to speak or write
(in a Book designed for instruction) that which either hath
no meaning, or such as cannot be known. The 3d, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth
our Authors Assertion. His proof of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the signification of these Names, we have met with
before in the like case: it is a most unhappy and inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential
reason; Men have divers ways understood these
words of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot be understood
at all. They must have a meaning, and it is our duty to
search it out, however Men differ about it. There are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reasons brought by Presbyterians, to prove that these two
Names signifie the same thing; which was incumbent on
this Author to answer, and not to shift the matter with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that other Men think otherwise. I shall give but this
instance, or hint, which may satisfie any what is the meaning
of these words in Scripture. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. The Apostle leaveth in
<hi>Crete Titus</hi> to ordain Elders or Presbyters, <hi>verse</hi> 5. and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him how they must be qualified, <hi>verse</hi> 6 and giveth this
reason, why they must have such qualifications, <hi>verse</hi> 7.
for a Bishop must be blameless: If a Bishop were another
thing than a Presbyter, to what purpose were this reason
here brought? <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are one and the same thing. And
if any affirm, that these words signifie different things in
any place of Scripture, let him prove it, and we shall yield
the cause. I might also shew, that the same Office and work
is every where in Scripture laid on both these; and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any thing is given to the one, but what is given to the
other: but this hath been done, and other arguments ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
fully by our Writers against Episcopacy; neither hath
Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> had the confidence to answer them, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
this his Assertion, and therefore I shall supersede
this labour. For the name of <hi>[Angels of the Churches]</hi> the
argument brought from it is not ours, but our opposites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57560:72"/>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. His 2d. Argument for the uncertainty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
practice, <hi>p.</hi> 290. is, <q>That the places of Scripture
most in controversie about the form of Government, may
be without any incongruity understood of either of the
different Forms,</q> which he maketh out by going through
the several places. The first is, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 30. where it is
said, <q>That the relief for the Brethren of <hi>Judea</hi> was sent to
the Elders. There is nothing here, saith he, to shew whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were the local Elders of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the several Churches of <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
why he should have brought this as the first, or as one
of these few Scriptures that he undertaketh to answer,
(for, the most part of the most pungent Scriptures against
his design, he doth not so much as mention) for, I think,
it is very little insisted on by either party: nor can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that I have met with it; as brought to prove either
Parity or imparity. Yet I do not doubt but at least some
probability may be hence brought, that the Apostolick
Churches were governed by the Parity of Elders; for which
I lay down briefly these grounds, First, The Elders here
spoken of, are the Governors of the Church; this he doth
not deny. 2dly, They were the Governors of the Church
of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This he saith, is not sure; for they might be the
Bishops of the Churches of <hi>Judea.</hi> But against this I argue;
1. It is not enough to say, they might be; but what ground
is there to think that they were the Bishops of <hi>Judea,</hi> we
bring probable grounds for what we assert; but what can be
said for the contrary? It is a bold way of expounding Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to say such a sense it may have, when there is no
ground to think that it hath such a sense; but some ground
to the contrary. 2. However, the Relief ought to be sent
to all the Churches of <hi>Judea,</hi> yet it is delivered at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
to be sent abroad: for it is delivered to these Elders by
<hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> whom it is not like they sent through
the several Churches of <hi>Judea:</hi> 'tis spoken of as one single
act of theirs, delivering the others to a company of Elders
met together. Now it is not imaginable, that all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Judea</hi> were met together on this occasion: for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57560:72"/>
what needed such a Convention for receiving Alms? Yea,
we have no ground to think that it was so natural to them
before-hand, as that they could meet about it. Neither hath
that conceit of some, any probability; that these Bishops
did reside at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> such Men did not begin so soon to
slight their particular Charge, but of this after; These El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
then were the Elders of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> 3. We find a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Elders ordinarily at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not only <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 6.
Which might be upon the solemn occasion of the Council;
but <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 18. That these were the Elders of <hi>Judea,</hi> come up
with their flocks to keep the Feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Still.</hi>
guesseth) is a most irrational conceit: for though many of
the <hi>Jews</hi> were zealous of the Law; shall we think that the
Apostles had set Teachers over them, who were no better
instructed in the Gospel than so? And besides, these belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Jews, ver.</hi> 20. who are said to be zealous of the Law,
can neither be proved to have been then present at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
for they might hear of <hi>Paul</hi>'s condescendency to their
Customs, though they were not there: neither that they
were those of the Country of <hi>Judea;</hi> they might be of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
it self: but I incline rather to the first. Now we
find not any other company of all the Elders of <hi>Judea</hi> met
in one place: these were then the Elders of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> 4. It
is then observed, both by the ordinary gloss, and by <hi>Lyra</hi> in
<hi>loc.</hi> That this famine was mainly like to be in <hi>Jerusalem:</hi>
the Believers there being spoiled of their movable goods in
the persecution about <hi>Stephen;</hi> and therefore this Relief
was chiefly to them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are the Elders of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
which here received it. Now from these grounds it
easily followeth what we intend, <hi>viz.</hi> If there was a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Elders who were Rulers of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi>
then this Church (of the rest there is the same reason) was
not governed by a Bishop, but by Presbyters acting in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It is strange, if the Elders of the Church should be
spoken of, and no notice taken of My Lord Bishop (if there
were any such person) in such a matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. The <hi>2d</hi> place is <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23, <q>when they had
ordained them Elders in every Church, to which he join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57560:73"/>
the <hi>3d, Tit.</hi> 1. 5. that thou shouldest ordain Elders in
every City. Of which places he saith that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifie no more but <hi>Ecclesiatim</hi>
and <hi>oppidatim;</hi> so that the places may well be understood
of ordaining one Elder in every Church and City, or of
more, but doth not determine whether one or more were
ordained in them.</q> But granting all that he alledgeth, a
strong Argument for our purpose may be brought from
these places, thus: there was at least in every Church one
Elder, in the Apostles times, and such an Elder as was also
a Bishop and had governing Power over the Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by comparing <hi>vers.</hi> 7. of <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. with this <hi>vers</hi> 5.
But there could not be in every Church a Diocesan Bishop
ruling over Presbyters: for one of these are over many
Churches, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Church was then governed by the
Elders of the several Churches acting in Parity: for if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church had its Elder, or Elders, and these all were Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
then the Rule was not in the hand of one Superiour
over many Churches. Nothing can be questioned in this
Argument, except it be said that every Church here is not
every congregational but Diocesan Church. But this can
in no wise be, for there was a necessity of an Elder or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every Congregational Church for the Peoples In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
if these then did rule, the Church was ruled by
the Elders of Congregational Churches. <q>The next place
is <hi>Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 20. 17. And from <hi>Miletus Paul</hi> sent and called
the Elders of the Church.</q> These, say we, were Elders of
the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to whom in common <hi>Paul</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ruling of the Church, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. not to one Bishop
over the rest, so that Church was governed by Parity of
Elders. To this place he answereth by shewing some Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
for both meanings, <hi>viz.</hi> That these were the Elders
of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and that they were the Bishops of <hi>Asia:</hi> but
taketh no pains to Answer what is said on either hand, only
concludeth, that because there is probability on both hands
there is no fixed truth on either; which is most detestable
Scepticism: for if there be Arguments for both parts, sure
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57560:73"/>
both cannot be true, seeing they are contradictory, neither
can both be false for the same reason, for <hi>contradictoriarum
altera semper est vera, altera semper est falsa:</hi> then it was
his part either to shew that neither of the arguments prove
any thing, by answering to them, or to hold to the one as
true, and not to hang between two. But I prove that these
Elders were the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not the Bishops of <hi>Asia.</hi>
1. (which Argument he mentioneth but he answereth not)
the Article in the <hi>Greek</hi> maketh it clear, it being demonstrato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
doth apply his Speech to the Church which he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in particular: where when it's said that he sent to
<hi>Ephesus</hi> and called for the Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it might
well be translated [of that Church:] it pointeth out that
Church and no other. It is an unheard of way of speaking
when a particular thing or person is mentioned, and the
demonstrative Article joined to it, that that Speech should
be understood of any other but that. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> sent to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
for these Elders, not through the several parts of <hi>Asia.
Ergo.</hi> They were at <hi>Ephesus</hi> not in other Churches. That
he did not send through other places to gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is evident both because the Text mentioneth sending
to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not other places; and it is strange if he sent
through all <hi>Asia</hi> and mention be only made of sending to
one place not to any other: also because <hi>Paul</hi> was then in
hast passing by them <hi>vers.</hi> 16. wherefore 'tis not like that he
could stay for the convening of a Synod of Bishops from
many remote parts. That which is alledged by some, that
the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> did reside at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and thence were
sent for by <hi>Paul,</hi> is most absurd; for 1. There is not the
least shaddow or reason to think that non residence of fixed
Officers did so soon creep into the Church. Let us see
any Instance or Warrant to think that any who had a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
charge did leave it long, or often, or at all, but upon
some weighty and extraordinary emergent. 2. What could
be their business at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> their work lay elsewhere, and
there they could do nothing except to meet and consult
about matters of common concerment: which will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ordinary residence there. 3. The work of these Elders
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57560:74"/>
was particular inspection over their Flocks; vers. 28. [over
all the Flock] which they could not have if they resided at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> and had their charges lying up and down <hi>Asia,</hi> for
that probability which he bringeth for the contrary, it is none
at all, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It is said <hi>vers.</hi> 18. That he had been with them
at all Seasons; but he was not all the time in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but
abroad in <hi>Asia</hi> as <hi>Act. 19. 10, 22, 26.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> [at all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons]
must not be taken in such rigour as if he had never
stirr'd a Foot out of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> but that he had his residence
and Preached most th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re, which is evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1,
9. 10. he disputed daily in the School of <hi>Tyrannus;</hi> this
was at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> and it is said that it continued 2 years, <hi>i.
e.</hi> for the most part of the time he was there, and yet might
sometimes Preach elsewhere. For the humane Testimonies
he bringeth for either part, I we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e then in the same ballance
with him and shall be content to lay no stress upon them.
As for the 1 <hi>Tim. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1. which is his other place, we make
no Argument from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but maintain that it speaketh not of a
Diocesan Bishop: let them who assert the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rary prove
it. <q>His discourse <hi>p.</hi> 293. is a very unsavory comparing
of some Philosophical Problems which cannot well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</q>
(and therefore we may hesitate about them) with
points of truth revealed in Scripture; as if we might also
be Sceptick in these. But sure the Comparison is misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
lame, for 1. These do not concerne our Faith or duty
as these other do, and therefore there is much less hazard
in Scepticism about the one than the other. 2. Even in
those points the motion of the Earth or Heaven, the Flux
and Reflux of the Sea, there is some truth in them, though
men through darkness cannot see it: neither must we say
that nothing there is, because there is nothing certain to us
in these things; or that men may impose on our belief
what they please in them: hence men are the more studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in searching out these Secrets and give them not over
as being destitute of all objective truth. But he dealeth
worse with the things of Church-Government; he will
have no objective truth in it, and no duty to lye on us in
searching out the truth, but that we must believe what men
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57560:74"/>
say of it. For conclusion of what I would say to this ground
of his Scepticism about Church-Government, I will but
mention several Scriptures. on which the truth in this is
built <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostolick form was parity, which Mr.
<hi>Still.</hi> hath not so much as touched: neither need I insist
on them, seeing Arguments from them are established by
our writers, and not enervated by him. One place is 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. where <hi>Tim.</hi> is said to be ordained by a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
or company of Elders joyning with <hi>Paul</hi> in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
this could not have been if Elders had not had a Parity
of Power. Another is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. where excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is transacted by the Authority of a Community, not
of a single Person: and so is the relaxing of that Sentence
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. 10. Also 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. They who ruled that
Church, who were over them, and must be obeyed, were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
not one Person: yea that work and the work of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
among the People and admonishing them are made
to be the business of the same Persons; which is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
that the Presbyters of that Church did rule in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and not a Bishop over them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. proveth
also the same thing most clearly. Other places might be
brought, but these Instances may shew that Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to shew that no place in Scripture determineth
what was the Form of Government in the Apostolick
Church, doth not touch the most considerable places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
brought to that purpose: but hath mentioned a few,
and those which are least insisted on by them whom he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
and even to them he hath said nothing to scare any
from using them as Arguments afterward. His third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for the uncertainty of the Primitive or Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Form of Government, taken from the insufficiency of
the Testimony of Antiquity, is this; I pass it, because we
have ground enough for the certainty of it from Scripture,
and what he saith proveth no more but that antiquity is
not sufficient to bear witness to it: also because all or most
that he there discourseth proveth that it cannot be gathered
from ancient records that Episcopacy was the Apostolical
form, which we willingly yield.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57560:75"/>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. I come then to his <hi>2d</hi> proposition mentioned
before, which he layeth down <hi>p.</hi> 322. Thus, <q>That the
Apostles in probability did not observe any one fixed course
of setling the Government of Churches; but settled it
according to the several circumstances of places and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which they had to deal with.</q> This assertion he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> not as a Foundation of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but a doctrine of probability, which may tend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
differences about Church-Government. To clear our
way in this dispute with him, let it be observed, 1. That the
question being only about Parity and Imparity of Pastors,
all other differencies in Apostolick practices that may be
alledged are impertinent to this purpose. 2. It helpeth not
him, nor harmeth our cause, if we should grant, that the
Apostles did in some extraordinary cases vary from their
ordinary course: for it is what they did ordinarily, and
where no extraordinary cause moved them to do otherwise,
that we inquire about. 3. Our question is not about the
Government of the Church that was for a time exercised
by extraordinary Officers immediately sent of God: but
what was the way the Apostles settled that the Church
should be governed in by her Ordinary and abiding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
Wherefore it maketh nothing for his purpose if it
be made out that the Church was some times governed
one way by extraordinary Officers, at other times or places
another way by ordinary Officers. Taking these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
along with us, I come to hear the Proofs of this his
proposition. The first is taken <hi>p.</hi> 323. from the different
state, condition and quantity of the Churches planted by
the Apostles, and here he premiseth 3 things, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That
God did not give the Apostles equal suceess of their Labours
in all places, that a small number of believers did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the same number of Officers to Teach and Govern
them that a greater Church did. 3. That the Apostles did
settle Church-Officers according to the probability of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Believers, and in order thereto, in some great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</q>
About these I shall not controvert with him; only
the <hi>2d</hi> must be understood with this distinction, else we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57560:75"/>
grant it; that a fewer number, if formed into a Church-Society,
though it did not need as great a number of Officers
of every kind, as Teachers, Elders, Deacons; yet would it
need as many sorts of Officers; and the reason is because all
those acts are needful to be done to them which must be
done to greater Congregations: they must be taught, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and their Poor cared for; and therefore they must not
want any of these sorts of Officers whose work these acts
were: I mean where such Officers could be had: for Christs
Institutions tye not to impossibilities. From these Premisses
he inferreth these two conclusions to make out his propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the first is <hi>p.</hi> 325. <q>That in Churches consisting of a small
number of believers where there was no great probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Increase afterwards, one single Pastor with Deacons
under him were only constituted by the Apostles for the
ruling of these Churches.</q> On this conclusion (before I come
to his Proofs of it) I shall make these remarques. 1. Here is
nothing here for the Imparity of Presbyters, or the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Bishop over Presbyters; if where more Presbyters
could not be had, one was to do the work, this doth not
at all say that the Apostles ever did, or that we may set
one over the rest, where many may be had to rule the
Church. This conclusion then proveth nothing. 2. These
Deacons that here he speaketh of either had ruling power
or not: if he say the first I doubt, if he can prove that ever
any such Deacons were in the Apostolick Churches, where
the Deacons work was to serve, not to rule that Church:
and if they had ruling power they were not only Deacons
but ruling Elders, both works being laid on the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for want of men to exercise them distinctly; which
maketh nothing against Presbyterians. If the second, first
I question if any instance can be given of a Church so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by the Apostles. 2. If it was so, it was necessity,
not choice that made them be without ruling Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. But how proveth he this his conclusion? by
3 or 4 Testimonies out of Clement, <hi>Epiph.</hi> and others. What?
hath he so soon forgot himself? he had immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
spent about 30 pages in proving that the Testimony
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57560:76"/>
of the Fathers is not sufficient to prove what was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Practice; and that by making out the defectiveness
ambiguity, partiality and repugnancy of the Records of the
succeeding Ages: it is strange then that to prove this his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
concerning Apostolick Practice, he should bring no
other Argument at all but such as he had set that <hi>Nigrum
Theta</hi> upon. Neither see I what those Testimonies prove
contrary to us. The Testimony of <hi>Clement</hi> saith no more
than what is implyed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. That the Apostles ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bishops and Deacons: and our Author himself maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that those were not by their constitution any more than
Presbyters: whatever they might after get by mens Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
proveth not what was Apostolick constitution. For
the Testimony of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> he confesseth its intricacie and
obscurity, and therefore (by his own Argument, of which
before) it is not to be laid weight upon: but he taketh a
great deal of pains to explain it and make it speak this, in
sum: <q>that at first there were only Bishops and Deacons
(by Bishops he meaneth Presbyters, as appears from his
Subjoyning immediately that there was necessity for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
and Deacons) and that by these all Ecclesiastical
Offices might be performed: but afterward where there
was need and there were found any worthy of it, there
was a Bishop appointed: but where there were not many
to be Presbyters; they were content with a Bishop and
Deacons.</q> Here are 3 cases; Presbyters and Deacons; a
Bishop and Deacons; this in case of necessity where more
Presbyters could not be had: this Bishop, as hath been
shewn before, could be nothing above a Presbyter; none of
those cross our design: for the third, <hi>viz.</hi> a Bishop set over
Presbyters, first <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth not say it was so appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Apostles, but [it was done] it is like he meaneth
by succeeding Ages. 2. He doth not say that this Bishop
was set over Presbyters with jurisdiction; he might be
meerly a <hi>praeses,</hi> so there is nothing here to prove that the
Apostles ever setled any thing contrary to Parity of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.
The Testimony out of <hi>Clem. Alexan.</hi> even with
<hi>Salmasius</hi> his commentary proveth no more but that in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57560:76"/>
some places were more Presbyters, in some fewer, in some
but one. His last Testimony saith nothing at all to the
purpose: only that the Apostles settled things by degrees,
not that ever they set up Bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. The 2d Conclusion that he inferreth, <hi>p.</hi> 332.
<q>That in Churches consisting of a multitude of Believers, or
where there was a probability of a great increase by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel, the Apostles did settle a College of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
whose Office was partly to govern the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
formed,</q> and partly to labour in converting more.
This we close with, and from it, and the former Conclusion
which make up his whole Argument, infer the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his design, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles kept a most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
course, (so far as necessity did permit) in setling the
Government of Churches: and that they setled the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the hands of Presbyters acting in a Society where
they could be had, and singly where more could not be:
and that they never setled it in the hand of a Bishop Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
over Presbyters. All this is evident from what hath been
said. He taketh occasion, <hi>p.</hi> 336, &amp;c. to speak against the
Office of Ruling-Elders in the Church: in which Dispute
he toucheth not any (except one Scripture) of those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are brought by the Defenders of that Office:
which is but a slight way of disputing against any Opinion.
It is not needful to our Design to handle this Debate fully,
till that be answered which is writen by the Author of the
Assertion of the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi>
by the Author of the Treatise of Ruling-Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons:
by the <hi>London</hi> Ministers in their <hi>jus divinum Reg.
Eccles.</hi> and in their Vindication of Pres. Gov. by <hi>Smect.</hi>
by <hi>Calv. Just. lib.</hi> 4. c. 4. sect. 8. and <hi>lib.</hi> 4. c. 11. sect.
6. by <hi>Peter Martyr, Loc. com. clas.</hi> 4. c. 1. <hi>num.</hi> 11. and
many others. Wherefore I shall only answer what this
Author hath said against the Truth in this Point. Whereas
among many other Scriptures proving this Office, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.
17. is brought as one, there being implied there a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Elders that Rule well, and are to be honoured
with double Honour; into such as labour in the Word and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57560:77"/>
Doctrine, and another member of the distinction not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
which can be none else but Elders who rule and do
not labour in the Word and Doctrine, <hi>i. e.</hi> whose Office it
is only to Rule, not to Teach publickly, as Pastors. Of this
Scripture he pretendeth to bring a full, clear and easie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That of the Elders that were ordained
in great Churches, (who had power to discharge all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
acts, but did not all attend equally the same part of
the work) some did most attend the Ruling of the Flock
already converted; others laboured most in converting
others by Preaching; and that according to their several
abilities: now these last deserved greater Honour, both
because their burthen was greater, and their sufferings
more.</q> This is no new, though it be a false interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for the Author of <hi>Asser. Govern. Ch.</hi> of <hi>Scotl. p.</hi> 48,
46. bringeth it as one of Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> Answers to the same
place: or rather two of them which by our Author are put
together. But against this exposition of the Text, I thus
argue: 1. This Gloss supposeth that there were Elders,
whose Office it was to Teach and to Rule: and yet they
did ordinarily neglect the one part of this their work, and
contented themselves with doing the other: Is it imaginable
that the Lord allows any Honour at all upon such? and
yet the Text alloweth double Honour, even on unpreaching
Elders, though the Preachers have it more especially. This
Reason is strongly enforced, if we consider that Church-Power
communicated by Christ to the Officers of his house,
is not only a Licence or Permission (as we noted before)
but a charge of which they must give an account: as it is
said of Church-rulers <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Neither do I see how
any who by their Office are Preachers of the Gospel, can
free themselves of that wherewith the Apostle chargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16 Necessity is laid upon me, yea wo is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me if I Preach not the Gospel, and of that charge laid on
<hi>Timothy</hi> (who was as much taken up with ruling as any)
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. that he should Preach the word, be instant in
Season, out of Season: May men when Christ hath put
them in Office and given them a charge; choose what part
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57560:77"/>
of the work of that Office and Charge they will do, and
what not? But I perceive, this Man's principles lead him to
subject all Christs Institutions to Mens will, to cut and carve
of them as they please: Christ hath given Pastors a charge
that they should Teach and Rule his Church. He had
pleaded before the Ruling-power may be taken from some,
and laid on others; now he affirmeth the same of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-power:
this is intolerable boldness. 2. We have no
better ground for judging of the diversity of Officers in
the Church, than by considering divers sorts of work which
some did ordinarily with the Lord's approbation, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did not, but were employed in other work. What
better Note can we have to know what is a Mans Office;
than his work which he is ordinarily employed in, and that
with God's own approbation? Wherefore, if some Elders
Preached, others preached not, but Ruled; we must think
that these were distinct Officers, and that their Office led them
only to do what they did. 3. This learned Author should
have brought some reason for what he alledgeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That
these unpreaching Eledrs, who Ruled, had power to preach;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, shall not persuade us of it: neither is there
the least shew of warrant for such an Assertion. If it be said
that they preached sometimes, and therefore could not be
without Preaching-power. <hi>Answ.</hi> It cannot be proved that
there were any Officers in the Apostolick Church, who had
Preaching-power, or did sometimes Preach, and yet were
so taken up with Ruling, that they did not ordinarily
Preach. 4. We may with as much (yea the same) reason say,
That every Officer in the Church had all Church-power,
and might occasionally exert it; though some according
to their gift did ordinarily exert one part; others, another:
and that Deacons might preach, and do all the work of
the Pastors, though ordinarily, being better gifted for that,
they served Tables: but this is to jumble together what the
Lord hath made an ordinary separation of. 5. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
maketh the different work that Church-Officers are
employed in, not to proceed from distinct Office or Power,
but from different gifts, which would bring a Babel of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57560:78"/>
into the Church; For 1. As Men think they are gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so will they take up their Work; and so most will readily
incline to the easiest work, and think their gift lieth that
way, to the great neglect of the difficult and main business;
and because Ruling is sweet to an ambitious mind, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
preaching is painful; we shall have abundance of
Rulers, but few Teachers. 2. By the same reason one
may neglect all the parts of his work, that he may neglect
one: pretending that his gift is not for this, nor for that,
and that they may be done by others. If it must be said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Church must appoint them their work, and not leave
it to their choice. <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Church appoint <hi>Timothy's</hi>
work to be to Rule, and exempt him from preaching or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily;
I see not how he differeth from the Ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which this Author disputeth against, notwithstanding
his supposed power to Preach; which to him is an idle
Talent (I mean, if this be done warrantably: otherwise it is
not done) especially, if the Church give him no more
power than Christ hath given to every Pastor, that is, to
Rule over the flock with the equal concurrence of his fellow-Presbyters;
not to rule over Presbyters by himself singly:
for that they cannot give him this Power, I have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
6. If the Elders that preach, because of the greatness
of their work and sufferings, have more honour than they
who only Rule; then the Bishop being of this last sort,
must be inferiour in honour to those other Presbyters: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
this must hold in the opinion of this Author, who
holdeth, That Bishop and Presbyter differ not <hi>jure divino:</hi>
but this I suppose will not well please his Lordship
and indeed is very unsuitable to the dignity of one who
Ruleth over others: sure the dignity of Church-Officers is
to be reckoned by the dignity of their place; where it is
different: as it is by the discharge of their work where
their place is the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. To strengthen this his Conceit, he brings a
testimony out of <hi>Chrysost.</hi> affirming, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the fixed Officers of particular Churches,
<q>who were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57560:78"/>
inferiour to them, who preaching the Gospel, travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
into divers places.</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is not at all to the
purpose: for they who so travelled abroad, were Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists;
no fixed Officers: but of the former, the Apostle
doth not at all speak here; <q>It rather appeareth</q> (saith the
Author, <hi>Asser. 1. Gover. Ch. Scotl.)</hi> that Elders were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
in every City, there to abide with their particular
charges, <hi>Acts 14. 23. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. He argueth also thus
against Ruling-Elders: <q>These Elders are not the Bishops
<hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. For these must be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>verse 2. l.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Author now cited, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
this Argument brought by Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> and citeth
<hi>Beza,</hi> answering to <hi>Sarav.</hi> who had used it. Passing his
first Answer, I make use of the 2d, which is <hi>Beza</hi>'s, That
the Ruling-Elder, though he ought not to Teach publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Pastor, yet he ought to Teach privately, and occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
according as the need of every one requireth: it is
his part to oversee the manners of the people, and to bring
miscarriages to the Church, to be censur'd; but first he is
to labour to reclaim the Offender by private admonition,
according to Christ's Rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. and that
not only <hi>ex charitate,</hi> as every Christian ought to do; but
<hi>virtute Officii</hi> and authoritatively: and for this cause he
ought to be a Man of Understanding above the common
sort, both able and willing to Teach (so the word bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
so far as his place requireth. Again, he argueth from
<hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <q>All the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> had a Pastoral charge,
for they are bid take heed to the Flock as Overseers: but
this is inconsistent with the Notion of a Lay-Elder, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
there were none such at <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Major is
false: they had a charge and oversight: but every oversight
is not Pastoral. Ruling also falleth under this Notion,
which is the Office of the Elder we plead for. He confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>p.</hi> 338. the weakness of that argument from Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which he saith <q>brought <hi>Blondel</hi> quite off from
Ruling-Elders, in that place of 1 <hi>Tim. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 17. It is true,
<hi>Blondel de jur. Pleb. in Reg. Eccl. p.</hi> 77, &amp;c. alledgeth,
That these Elders are not there meant, because Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57560:79"/>
(implied in double Honour,</q> as is clear from <hi>ver.</hi> 18.
compared) is due to these, but not to Ruling-Elders.
Yet the Argument, with all the enforcements of that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author, will not prove what he designeth. For 1. Some
famous Interpreters understand this double Honour, only
of a degree of Honour beyond these spoken of before, <hi>viz.</hi>
Widows, so <hi>Calv.</hi> in <hi>loc.</hi> 2. How shall it be proved, that
Maintenance is not due to Ruling-Elders, or the <hi>seniores
plebis,</hi> as <hi>Blondel</hi> calleth them? His arguments taken from
the difuse of it, will not conclude this: neither what
he saith of the want of Power in any to remit it: for
where it cannot be had for them, necessity excuseth the
withholding of it: where it cannot be had, let the Inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of Church-Rents answer for it, if such necessaries be
not supplied to the Church: neither do I blame him for
blaming <hi>(p. 83.)</hi> these Protestant Nations, who have cast
out Abbacies which abounded in Riches, have rather taken
the Revenues into the State-Treasury, than allowed it for
such good Uses as this. I add for further answer out of
<hi>Asser. Gover. Ch. Scotl.</hi> p. 105. That a stipend, though due,
is not essential to the Office, either of Elders or Ministers;
and therefore the want of the one, can be no argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the other; But neither is <hi>Blondel</hi> against the Office
of Ruling-Elders (though he deny them to be spoken of
in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. but disputeth strongly for it, yea, and
groundeth it on the Apostles practice, <hi>p.</hi> 85, which is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Divine Right. The next thing Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> saith
against Ruling-Elders, is, <q>That if we remove from the
Scripture to the Primitive Church, we shall find the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
difficulty to trace the footsteps of a Lay-Elder through
the Records of Authority for the first 3 Centuries especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We look on the Scripture as a <hi>surer Word
of Prophecy,</hi> and therefore are unwilling to pass from it, to
that which Mr. <hi>Stilling</hi> hath above proved, to be utterly so
insufficient to determine in matters of Church-Government.
2. Others are of another mind that this Author. <hi>Blondel. de
jur. pleb. in Reg. Eccl. p.</hi> 85. <q>aliis igitur, saith he, <hi>firmamentis,

               </q>
And <hi>Asser. Grov. Ch. Scot. par. 1. c.</hi> 8, 9. Unpregnable
and abundant Testimonies out of Antiquity are brought for
this Office, which seeing Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> hath not Answered,
it is needless to insist on them. 3. But, and if in many
places in the Primitive times this Office was difused, it
was their fault, and taken notice of by the better sort,
<hi>Calv.</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. speaking of this Office, saith, <q>
                  <hi>Hunc

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. His second proof of his second Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles took diverse courses in Ruling
Churches, is <hi>p.</hi> 340. <q>from the multitude of unfixed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
residing in some places, who managed the affairs
of the Church in chief, during their residence: such were
Apostles and Evangelists. In some places, saith he, these
were, others not, and in some places no Officers but these.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is obviated by our 3d Observ. For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is only about Government by ordinary and abiding
Officers, and that only where they could be had, of whom
this proof doth not speak. His 3d Proof, <hi>ibid.</hi> 
               <q>is from
the different customs observed in the Church after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times.</q> This is most inconsequent: yea, one might
as well reason thus: In after-times they set up Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
and at last a Pope, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was so in the Apostles
times. We say then, That diversity in after Ages flowed
from this; that Men (following Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> Principles)
did not follow divine Institution, or Apostolick practice,
but their own Wit and Reason. Beside, the diversities he
here instanceth in, are not to the purpose; for he doth not
shew us that Parity was in one place, and imparity in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but that in one place the Presbyters chused their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
in another not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. We come at last to his <hi>3d</hi> proposition about
Apostolick practice <hi>p. 341. viz.</hi> 
               <q>That a meer Apostolical
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57560:80"/>
practice being supposed, is not sufficient of it self for the
founding of an unalterable and perpetual Rite for the Form
of Government in the Church which is supposed to be
founded on that Practice.</q> This doctrine he laid down
before <hi>par. 1 c. 1. p.</hi> 23. And we examined <hi>p.</hi>

We lay no obligation on any by a meer Apostolical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
but by their Practice considered as done in the same
case that we are in. Neither 2. do we say that such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is sufficient of it self to bind us, for it hath Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Imitation, of which before; and equal Morality of
that action to us and then to concur with it in this. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we say. 3. That their Practice doth found a Riet:
it doth but declare what is founded on the will of Christ
as that which we must do. Most of all his Arguments are
obviated by what is already said. <q>The first, that they did
many things without intention of obliging others, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad to Preach the Gospel unprovided;</q> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> not
taking wages <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This doth not touch the point, seeing
these things were for a peculiar reason. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is the <hi>2d</hi> Argument <hi>p.</hi> 343. (which indeed is but the
same Argument) that they did many things on particular
<q>occasions, emergencies and circumstances; as <hi>Pauls</hi> celebate,
Community of goods,</q> Preaching in private Houses, Fields,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That which only is worth the noticing in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is <hi>p.</hi> 344. <q>That he requireth, before Apostolical
Practice be obligations, that it be made appear that what
they did was not according as they saw reason depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the several circumstances of Time, place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but from some unalterable Law of Christ.</q> 
               <hi>Answer.</hi>
This we are able to prove, as to ruling the Churches by a
Parity of Elders, for they did ordinarily so practice, and
that where the place, persons and times were not the same:
neither can it be shewed that ever they did otherwise, <hi>i. e.</hi>

der) this Mystery of iniquity had begun to work, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
2. 7. It is no wonder then, that soon after it began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:
and when some had thus miscarried, and others stuck
to the Apostolical frame of things, this might quickly breed
a diversity. 3. It will easily appear to any who readeth
this Chap. that all the Authours discourse tendeth to prove
that the ancient Churches thought not Episcopacy to be
<hi>jure divino:</hi> let them who are concerned answer him in this
if they can; I am convinced of the truth of what he saith. But
let us take a short view of the grounds on which he establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
what he asserteth in this Chap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The first is, <q>That the extent of the Power of
Church-Officers did increase meerly from the enlargment
of the bounds of Churches: which he maketh out in 4
steps or periods.</q> The first is, when Churches were the
same with Christians in a whole City. And here he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
3 things, first he sheweth that the Primitive constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Churches was in a Society of Christians in the same
City: <q>where he will have the name [Church] in Scripture
to be only given to that, not a particuler congregation
meeting in one place.</q> I do not deny but the name is
given as he saith, because of that confederacy in discipline
among divers congregations in one City: yet neither the
name nor the nature of a Church must be denied to a single
congregation; for a Church in Scripture-Language is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
met together to serve God: now this agreeth well
to a single Congregation; seeing in it not only word and
Sacraments are administred, but also discipline is exercised,
as shall anon appear. All that he saith proveth the former
Use of the word; but nothing against this latter. 2. He
speaketh of the Government of these Churches <hi>p.</hi> 352. <q>And
that 1. before Parishes, or distinct Congregations were
settled. 2. after they were settled (about which he large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disputeth when it began, which is not to our purpose)
in both cases, he saith, they were ruled in common; and
<hi>p.</hi> 354. That it is a weak conceit to think that after the
setling of Congregations, every one had a distinct Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to rule it, and <hi>p.</hi> 356. this crumbling saith he, of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57560:81"/>
Church-Power into every Congregation is a thing abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
disowned by the greatest and most Learned Patrons
of Presbytery beyond the Seas, as may be seen in <hi>Calv.
Beza, Salmasius, Blondel, Gerson, Bucer</hi> and others.</q> I do
readily yield to him, that it is most probable that in times
of Persecution, particular congregations could not be soon
settled: and than then, where there were in one City more
Christians then could meet in one place, they were ruled
only in Common, yea and had their meetings for worship
occasionally as they could. Also we grant that when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
were settled, the several Congregrations in one
City were ruled by one common Presbytery made up of the
Officers of them all: but that they had not their distinct
Presbyters that ruled them severally in subordination to
this superior Presbyters we utterly deny; and I look upon
it as a too supercilious assertion, to call this a weak conceit-seeing
it is well known that it hath been the Judgment of
men with whom, for ability, I think Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> modesty
will not suffer him to compare himself. But what ever be
of the ability of them who own it; there is reason for it
so weighty, as may excuse it from weakness; which is this:
Single Congregations meeting ordinarily together for the
worship of God, cannot but have many affairs that do only
concern them, not the other Churches or Congregations
in the same City; as admission or exclusion of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
from the Lords Supper, rebuking them, consulting about
the time and ordering of their Administration <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis
very unfit to bring all these things, in <hi>prima instantia,</hi> to the
Presbytery that ruleth in common. This I confirm out of
what himself hath written, <hi>p.</hi> 368. He saith <q>that Country
Churches had their own rulers who ruled them, though
with subordination to those in the City:</q> is there not the
same reason why particular Congregations, though in City
should have their Rulers? 'tis as really inconvenient to
bring every matter of a City-Congregation, at the first hand,
to the common Presbyters, as it is to bring the matters of
a Country Parish to it. Yet we acknowledge that it is to
be ordered according as it conduceth most to the good of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57560:81"/>
the Church: neither if we should yield all that he saith, is
it any thing against the Divine Right of Parity. What he
saith of these worthy Divines disowning this Power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations, we have cause to suspend our belief
of it, till he bring some testimony of their own writings to
prove it, which he hath not so much as essaid. It is like
they were against Independent Power of Particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
not their subordinate Power: for the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that he bringeth they prove no more than what we
have granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Congregations were ruled in
common: not, that they had no particular Government in
each of them; as any may easily see by considering them.
Neither is it any wonder that the records of Antiquity speak
of the acts of those greater, not of the lesser and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational
Presbyteries: seeing matters coming before the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were of so private concernment; such as use not often
to be so much taken notice of. The <hi>3d</hi> thing he speaketh
of in this first step of the growth of Churches, is, <q>what
Relation the Churches in several Cities had one to another,</q>
and to the lesser City, that were under them: and here he
<q>maintaineth that Metropolitans are not of Divine Right;</q>
to which we agree: I add, that in the first and more pure Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times they had no Being at all, as is clearly made out
by <hi>Diocl. Altar. Damasc.</hi> c. 2. Where he sheweth that
<hi>Justine</hi> and <hi>Jreneus</hi> have nothing of the different degrees of
Bishops: and that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the middle of the third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
doth often assert their Parity. The second step is, <hi>p.</hi>
368. <q>When Churches took in the Villages and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
adjoining to that Citie: he saith, that the City-Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
did Preach in these places, and adjoined the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to the City-Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till after, when they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in Villages they got peculiar Officers set over them,
who did rule them, yet with subordination to the City-Church.</q>
This last I only dislike: neither do I see it
proved by him, for the Titles of <hi>matrix ecclesia, et Cathedra
principalis</hi> signifie no more but a greater dignity and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Order, not of Jurisdiction. What he saith of that
<hi>Eulogie,</hi> sending abroad consecrated pieces of bread, doth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57560:82"/>
not prove the point: and also it was a superstitious custome:
the bad improvement of it appeareth in the <hi>Popish</hi> adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their <hi>Hostia.</hi> His next step is <hi>p.</hi> 372. <q>When Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
did associate in one Province: where he speaketh of
Provincial Synods once a year, and sheweth that no Bishop
had power over another, but that their Honour depended
on their Sees. Thence he cometh to the last step, when
the whole World became Christians, and the Bishops of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> did strive for the place of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Bishop.</q> I hope it appeareth to any who consider, that
there is nothing yet said by him which can overturn the
Divine Rite of Parity, even to have been maintained in
the Primitive times (I mean not of the last step he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of, when Papacy it self began to appear) for all that
hath been said sheweth that Imparity was never judged of
necessity; and that the Imparity which was used was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Order than of Jurisdiction, which is nothing against
the Divine Rite of that Parity we plead for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. His <hi>2d</hi> Argument <hi>p.</hi> 374. is, <q>That the same
Form was not of old observed in all Churches: where he
sheweth that in many places, there were no Bishops; as he
proveth of <hi>Scotland</hi> and other places. This we accept of,
and add,</q> that where there were Bishops, it is not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be by him proved, that they had any Superior Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but only Precedency: and so the Divine Rite of Parity
may stand for all this. His <hi>3d</hi> Argument <hi>p.</hi> 377. is, <q>That
the Government of the Church was conform to the Civil
Government, which he saith is insisted on by Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
on all sides; especially after the division of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire. And he giveth some Instances of it in the
correspondency of Civil Prefects and Arch-Bishops in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places.</q> To all this let me say a few words. 1. This
Argument destroyeth it self: for in the first antiquity which
was the surest, the Powers of the World were not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and so the Church could not conform to the state in
her Offices. 2. It is here confessed, that this Conformity was
especially (I believe it may be said <hi>only)</hi> after that division
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: but those were the times when the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57560:82"/>
man of Sin had almost got into his chair; and therefore
their practice can prove nothing of the mind of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church. 3. If this notion hold, then it must be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as a lawful and prudent expedient, that there be
one Pope as there was one Emperor. This Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> must
maintain, or he saith nothing. 4. If this was their Rite of
old, then the Church behoved to be under two chief Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
when the Roman Emperor was divided into two.
But this he doth not alledge, but rather sheweth how it
was divided into 13 Diocesses. 5. If we receive this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
then in a Kingdome there must be one head, who
must have his Councel of Bishops, without a charge of the
several Diocesses (for the Kings Council hath not Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of several parts of the Country) and they must au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
their deputies, like Sheriffs, yearly <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in a
Common-wealth there must be Independant Government:
but this I hope the Author will not own. 6. It is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to say that the Church-Government should be
conform to the Civil; because they are conversant about
things and aim at ends so different: the one respecteth things
that are most different in several Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> Mens Civil
Interest, and Customes and Inclinations: the other respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that which ought to be every where the same, <hi>viz.</hi>
Religion. His 4. Argument <hi>p.</hi> 379. is, <q>That other Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Government was settled in the Church, yet Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Ordination was looked on as valid.</q> This is not
againt us. His last Argument <hi>p.</hi> 382. is, <q>That several
restraints were laid on by Councils about the Observation
of Rites and Customes and something of Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;</q>
but what is this I pray to Parity or Imparity? we
are not against determinations of Indifferent things that
concern order and decency: though we think that the
Form of Government is determined by Christ, not left to
the will of man.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
            <p>IN this Chapter our Author would make us believe, that
all the world was ever of his Opinion: and indeed this
is so common for men to alledg, whatever be their
singular notions of things, that we are not to lay much
weight upon it. <hi>Videlius</hi> took as much pains to make all
reformed Divines to speak for <hi>Erastianism.</hi> I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
my self from medling any further with this last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his. 1. From the needlesness of the thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do not build the Divine Right of Presbytery on
mens Opinions, who we know can err, and therefore if
all the world were against it, if the Scripture be for it
so must we. 2. From the disadvantage I lie under as to
this part of the dispute with him. If I had been of
Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> opinion in this point in controversie, I might
through compliance with courses have been furnished
with a good Library and other conveniencies of study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the want of which doth incapacitate me to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the opinions of those worthy men which he citeth:
in doing whereof, I hope it would not be difficult to
shew that some of their Testimonies are made to speak
otherwise than they thought; and others of them are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
with what themselves have elsewhere writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Notwithstanding we shall essay briefly to say
as much to his allegations, as may take off that edge
they seem to have, for cutting asunder the cause which
we maintain. <hi>P.</hi> 384. he hath a confident assertion. <q>I
believe, saith he, there will upon the most impartial
survey, scarce be one Church of the Reformation
brought which doth embrace any form of Government,
because it looked upon that form as only necessary by
an unalterable standing Law: but every one took up
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57560:83"/>
that form of Government which was judged most suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the state and condition of the several Churches.</q>
I wonder to see this so confidently asserted, without
proof. It had been incumbent on Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this his dream, to have gone through the confession
of the several reformed Churches; and let us see on
what ground they then built their Church-Government;
for it will not sufficiently prove what was the judgment
of these Churches, that some eminent men in them did
assert such things: which latter of the two he only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
on, and that to little purpose too, as I hope shall
appear. But the falsehood of this Allegiance I will
make appear afterwards, when I have tried the strength
of the Testimonies he bringeth for his opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. He beginneth with them who have asserted
the mutability of the form of Government <hi>in Thesi</hi>
where he maketh it his chief business to shew, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> of old was of this opinion. To
which I answer, That those worthy men having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their eye but Episcopacy; their work was to
oppose the Divine Right of that: there was never an
other form brought in competition with it, nor much
minded by them: and therefore we agree with them in
their design. Of Foreign Divines, his first Testimony
is of <hi>Chemnitius:</hi> to which I cannot give a particular
answer, because not having his book I cannot try it:
only this consideration I shall lay down, to take off the
strength of it. Neither Mr. <hi>Still,</hi> nor any man else
ought to lay weight on this Testimoney to the purpose it
is brought for: for either he meaneth that the degrees
of Church-Officers in respect of precedency are left free,
or in respect of Jurisdiction: if the first, it is nothing
contrary to what we hold, for we acknowledg it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
whether there be a standing Precedent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
or not. If the second, he is directly contrary to
Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who maintains, that the Church may
set up no new Officers but what Christ hath instituted;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57560:84"/>
as we have seen before: now an order of Officers with
jurisdiction above what Christ hath instituted, cannot
but be a sort of Officers that he hath not instituted:
wherefore Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> could not make Use of this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
neither ought any else, for it crosseth the Scripture;
which <hi>(Rom. 12. 6, 7, 8. Ephes. 11. 1. 1 Cor. 12. 28.)</hi>
doth on purpose enumerate the Officers of the Church in
all their degrees. I dispute not now what they are; but
sure they are not left at liberty; seeing the Lord hath so
often declared his mind in this Point: to what purpose
is it said that the Lord hath in his Church such and such
Officers; if men may at their pleasure set these or others,
more or fewer of them in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. His next Testimony is the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of
<hi>Magdeburge,</hi> but it containeth an answer in its forehead,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it speaketh not to the thing; for they say no
more but that it is neither Recorded, nor Commanded,
how many Ministers should be in each Church; but
that their may be more or fewer, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church. What is this to their parity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity?
'tis a token that he is very scant of Witnesses,
when he calleth in them who say so little to his purpose.
The next Testimony is of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> which he maketh to
speak very fair for him: but he hath unhandsomly
concealed that which is the Key to understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Author; for the Reader may evidently see
his drift, if he first look into <hi>Sect. 9. (de Relig. c. 25.)</hi>
where he asserteth that Christ hath only given to his
Church two sorts of ordinary Teachers, <hi>viz.</hi> Pastors
and Doctors: the same he asserteth, <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <q>and yet
(which is his modesty) he will not condemn the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who had other Orders of Officers: but what his
meaning is, in this his condescendency, he explaineth
<hi>Sect.</hi> 11. That whereas in after Ages, one Pastor was
set over the rest <hi>(non ut Dominus, sed ut Rector in Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia
reliquis Collegis,)</hi>
               </q> this he thinketh was lawful,
and yet setteth this note upon that practice in the same
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57560:84"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>Sect. Qua de re Hieronymi tum alibi, tum in Epist.
ad Evagr. &amp; in Commentar. Epist. ad Tit. c. 10. Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
&amp; sententia nobis probatur, dicentis totum hoc ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
ex consuetudine quam ex dominicae dispositionis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
profectum esse.</hi>
               </q> Which is as much as to say, He
thought it rather somewhat tolerable through neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
than allowable. Which small glance at the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerableness
of a Precedency in the Church (if it may
pass for so much) was not well taken by other
Worthy Divines; as appeareth by <hi>Zanchius</hi>'s own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
on this his Confession (which Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
taketh notice of, but passeth what might make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him) for <q>
                  <hi>Magnus quidem vir,</hi>
               </q> as <hi>Zant.</hi> calleth
him: who was well satisfied with the rest of his
Confession, excepteth this which he had said of the
Arch-Bishops and Hierarchie; and that not only as
what did dispease himself, but was unsutable to the
harmony of confessions that the Protestant Churches
were then drawing up: as appeareth by a part of an
Epistle of that <hi>Magnus vir,</hi> to <hi>Zan.</hi> which he insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Preface to his Observations. So that it
seems, this was generally disliked by Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
contrary to what Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> would make us
believe, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Protestant Churches thought
the form of Government indifferent. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid together, let any then judg what great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
Mr. <hi>Stilling</hi>'s cause hath received from this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Zanchie.</hi> Especially, if we consider with what
Weapon <hi>Zan.</hi> defendeth this his Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That
it was generally practised by the Ancient Church;
and he would not take upon him to disallow them:
as may be seen in his Observations on Chap. 25. of
his Confessions.</q> We see he bringeth no better War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
than the practice of Men who might, and did
in many things err. But Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> telleth us
of the same Opinion of <hi>Zan. de 4to praec. loc. 4. qu.
2. p.</hi> 943, &amp;c. and indeed he teacheth the same thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:57560:85"/>
but with some advantage to our design: for, after he
had made the ordinary Officers to be of three sorts,
<hi>viz.</hi> Pastors, and Doctors, and Ruling-Elders (whose
Office he proveth from Scripture, and asserteth as
the Opinion of the Reformed Divines generally)
and Deacons: and had proved at length <hi>p.</hi> 950, 951,
952. Presbyters and Bishops to be the same in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
He sheweth <hi>p.</hi> 952, 953. That in after-Ages
one of the Presbyters was set over the rest: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
to qualifie it <hi>p. 953.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Idcirco damnari haec, piae
vetustatis ordinatio &amp; consuetudo non potest, modo plus
sibi authoritatis non usurpet Episcopus quà habent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqui
Ministri, ut recte monet Hieronymus.</hi>
               </q> Here he
overturneth all Mr. <hi>Stilling</hi>'s design, for such a Bishop
is but a meer President. He thinks he hath gain'd
another Testimony from M. <hi>Bucer,</hi> whom <hi>Zan.</hi> in those
his observations citeth: but Mr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> hath not
told us wherein <hi>Bucer</hi> speaketh to his purpose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take this account of <hi>Bucer</hi>'s Opinion out of <hi>Zanch.</hi>
He citeth two large Testimonies of <hi>Bucer:</hi> the first
is out of his Commentary on the <hi>Ephes.</hi> where he
speaketh of seven kinds of Teaching, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>By Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Interpretation, Instruction, <hi>(Doctrina)</hi> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
Catechisms, Disputing, private Admonition:
from which he saith, That in the Ancient Church
they brought in seven kinds of Teachers.</q> Now
what is this to the Parity or imparity of Ministers?
He speaketh nothing here of setting a Lord-Bishop o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Brethren, as a thing lawfully practised in
the ancient Church. Yea, if we consider his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
well, we shall find that these were not divers
Offices, but the work of the Pastors divided among
more, where there were many Officers in one Church:
yet so as all might exercise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all these Duties; and so
here is no multiplication of Offices beyond Christ's
Institution. Though I do not deny, that this distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
of the work of Ministers did afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57560:85"/>
to be looked upon, as making several orders of Officers:
but this he doth not approve of. The second Testimony
of <hi>Bucer</hi> is out of his <hi>de Discipl. Clerical.</hi> The sum of
which is this (for the words are too long to be transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That in the Ancient Church they set up a Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Presbyters; <q>
                  <hi>Vt Consul inter Senatores,</hi>
               </q> (this is
devolving their Power into his hands, which Mr. <hi>Still.</hi>
pleadeth for) That these Bishops and Presbyters did
meet when occasion required, in Synods; that one was
over the Synod to convocate and moderate it, (this is
not to have Jurisdiction over the rest) who was called
<hi>Metropolitan,</hi> from the chief City, where he used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side:
then over the Metropolitans were set up Patriarchs
(but behold how careful he is to protest against impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as to Jurisdiction) of whom he saith, <q>
                  <hi>His tamen
Primatibus Episcopis nihil omnino juris erat in alios Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopos
aliasve Ecclesias, ultra quod dixi cuique Metropolitae
in Ecclesias atque Episcopos suae provinciae:</hi>
               </q> Which, we
took notice before, was to convocate and moderate the
Synod. At last he sheweth how among these Patriarchs
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was set up as Chief: and then how
all good Order went to ruine. Now let this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be considered, and we shall hope for more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by it, than Mr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> could expect. From it
we draw these two Conclusions: 1. That <hi>Bucer</hi> looked
upon setting up a Precedent over Presbyters, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
length that the Primitive Church did or could go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the making of imparity among Ministers. 2. That
even this their practice, though not unlawful in it self;
yet is so inconvenient, that it was the Method and Mean
that Antichrist got into his Chair by.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. He cometh next to the <hi>French</hi> Divines, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
with <hi>Fregevile,</hi> whose Testimony we think not
worth the Answering, seeing as Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> confesseth, he
was Episcopal. His opinion did not suit well with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that Church he lived in, as we shall see after. The
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57560:86"/>
next is <hi>Blondel,</hi> that learned writer for Presbyters, as he is
called: whose words cited by Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> are not at all to
the purpose; as any may see at first view; seeing he saith
no more, but, that it is in the Churches Power to make a
perpetual Precedent or not. For <hi>Bochartus</hi> his opinion, that
neither <hi>Presbyterialis</hi> nor <hi>Episcopalis ordo</hi> is <hi>juris divini:</hi> if
he mean the difference between them in jurisdiction, and
not only in Precedency: I see not how it can be defended,
and not having his Book I cannot determine how consistent
it is with his own principles. For <hi>Amiraldus,</hi> whom he
bringeth next, his design of Union with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
I believe, did either stretch his opinion or made him stretch
his affections to an excess of condescendency; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excused but from his good Intention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Our Author cometh next to those who look on
Parity as the Primitive Form, and yet allow Episcopacy
as a very Lawful and usefull constitution. Concerning
those, I premise 2 general Remarques. 1. That what these
worthy Divines say to this purpose is to be understood,
not of <hi>Episcopus Princeps,</hi> but <hi>Praeses,</hi> according to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
very common among them. This we must hold
as only consistent with their principles, till the contrary be
proved out of their own writings. 2. That many things
said by them to this purpose were the over reaches of their
desire to be one with them who differed from them in this,
but agreed in most things as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and some Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Divines: they did often (as <hi>Smect.</hi> saith of <hi>Spanhem</hi>
to the same purpose, <hi>p. 65.)</hi> deliver a Complement rather
than their Judgment. But to come to particulars: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
with <hi>Cracanthorp,</hi> who excuseth all the Reformed
Churches from <hi>Aerianism,</hi> because they held not Imparity
to be unlawful. But this man was a Son of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> (as they speak) and wrote in her defence against
<hi>Ant. de Domin.</hi> wherefore his Testimony of the opinion of
the Reformed Churches is not to be taken, being willing
to have them all think as he did. They are better defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57560:86"/>
from siding with <hi>Aerius</hi> by <hi>Smect.</hi> p. 79. where it is
proved, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was condemned for his Arianism and
other Errors, but not for holding the Divine Right of Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and that <hi>Jerome, Augustus, Sedulius, Primatius, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,
Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact,</hi> were of the same
opinion with <hi>Aerius</hi> in this. Next he bringeth the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane</hi>
confession: of the Testimony of which I have these
3 things to say. 1. This was not a confession of them who
are ordinarily called the Reformed Churches; but of the
<hi>Lutherans;</hi> for at the same meeting at <hi>Augusta</hi> did <hi>Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
and the <hi>Helvetians</hi> give in their confession apart, by
themselves: wherefore it is no wonder, if these worthy
men, who were a reforming, but had not attained to that
pitch of it which others had, did retain some small tincture
of the way according to which they had been bred in this
point. 2. <hi>Luther</hi> himself was not well pleased with this
confession, as appeareth by the Relation of <hi>Pezelius,</hi> who
<hi>(Mellifie. Histor.</hi> par. 3. <hi>p. 336.)</hi> saith thus. <q>
                  <hi>Autor vero
confessionis cum Luthero qui in Pontifioiis concessum Stomacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur

ad meridiem, id quod ex ipsa apologia apparet.</hi>
               </q> 3. All that is
said in this confession, is no more but an expression of their
desire to conform and condescend to the Papists in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
order of the Church: but this was no more but
the Precedency of Bishops; the confession speaketh not of
the Lordly power of Bishops as it then stood; that they
could yield to that: so that even the furthest they go, in
their complemental condescendency, doth not help Mr. <hi>Still's</hi>
cause; who pleadeth for the sole jurisdiction of Bishops as
lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. In the next place, he is not ashamed to force
<hi>Calvin</hi> to speak for the lawfulness of Episcopacy, which he
could never comport with while he lived. He bringeth
his Instit. <hi>lib. 4. c. 4. sect.</hi> 1. &amp; 4. in both which Sections
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57560:87"/>
he alledgeth no more out of him but this; That the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Bishops had almost nothing in their Canons which
was beside the Word of God: and that they used no other
form of Governing the Church, than was prescribed in the
Word. What doth this help his Cause? The Ancient
Bishops in <hi>Calvins</hi> judgment, were no more but <hi>Praesides:</hi>
These, he saith, were not constituted beside the word of
God. This is nothing to the scope of our Authors Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
I hope after to shew that <hi>Calvin</hi> was far from His
mind. At present let it suffice to observe, that the very
words cited by Mr. <hi>Still.</hi> do make against him. For when
<hi>Calvin</hi> saith, <q>
                  <hi>Si rem omisso vocabulo, intuemur, reperiemus
veteteres Episcopos non aliam regendae ecclesiae formam voluisse
fingere ab ea, quam deus verbo suo praescripsit:</hi>
               </q> It is not
evident, that he supposeth God in his Word to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
a form of Church-Government. And 2dly, That
he asserteth, that the Ancient Bishops (if we look to the
thing, and do not understand the name <hi>[Bishop]</hi> as now it
is used for the Prelate) did stick close to this Form; what
could be more directly against Mr. <hi>Still.?</hi> Neither is he
more happy in the citing of <hi>Beza</hi> for him: for <hi>Beza</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of Bishop is well known, <q>in <hi>Divinus,</hi> i. e. Presbyter;
<hi>Humanus,</hi>
               </q> i. e. &amp;c. a President or constant Moderator; <hi>&amp;


Diabolicus,</hi> i. e. a Prelate with sole jurisdiction. The indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
of the 2d he asserteth, and will not prescribe that
Form used at <hi>Geneva</hi> (which was without such a fixed
President) to other Churches: but what is this to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
It is a pity to see a Learned Man at so much pains,
and lose his labour. It being so as hath been shewed. Mr.
<hi>Still.</hi> doth fouly misrepresent the state of the Controversie
about Church-Government, that was between the Church
of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Geneva</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time: it
was not, as he alledgeth, whether Parity or Episcopacy
were more convenient: but whether Prelacy putting sole
jurisdiction in the hand of a Bishop, or giving him power
over his Brethren, were lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57560:87"/>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Next he bringeth <hi>George Prince</hi> of <hi>Anhalt, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Melancton,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> professing their readiness to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Bishops, if they would do the duty of Bishops. All
which amounts to no more than this, That if Bishops
would keep within bounds, not usurp Authority over their
Brethren, nor use it to the destruction of Religion, they
might be born with; but this maketh nothing for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Prelacy, which these Men did ever detest. For <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Heerbrandus,</hi> I am not acquainted with his Principles,
nor his Book. <hi>Hemingius</hi> (who cometh next) speaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of <hi>dispares dignitatis ordines,</hi> not <hi>authoritatis;</hi> and so
cometh not up to the thing in Question. For <hi>Zepper</hi> his
judgment of the necessity of a Superintendent, it destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Authors Hypothesis; for if it be necessary, it is not
indifferent. If in any case such a thing be necessary, it is
in that case lawful, <hi>(nam necessitas quicquid coegit defendit)</hi>
in other cases it is unlawful. What he saith of Bishops in
some <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, as <hi>Sweden, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. doth
not weigh with us, knowing that they err in greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
also. What he saith of other Churches that have their
<hi>Praepositi</hi> or <hi>Seniores</hi> enjoying the same power with Ancient
Bishops; proveth nothing of the lawfulness of Prelacy;
We think their way lawful: and whether it be convenient
to them, or not, we judg not, but to us, sad experience
hath proved it most inconvenient. The next thing that he
insisteth on, <hi>viz.</hi> Episcopal Divines, holding Episcopacy
not necessary, it doth not concern us to Answer, and so
we see to what amounteth the strength of these Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which he would fright us with, as if all Men were
of his judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. Having now seen of what force are our Authors
Witnesses, brought for the indifferency of the Form of
Church-Government; let us see if there can be more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Authority brought for the divine Right of it. I do
not question but many sheets may be filled with pertinent

Citations to this purpose, by one better stored with Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of our Reformed Divines, and having leisure to search
them. I shall give some instances, such as my poor Library
doth afford, both of Churches and of particular Divines.
And before the Restorers of the Truth, I shall mention
those famous Conservators of it in the darkest times of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism,

this is nothing of the particular Form of Government,

absolutely deny that That is to be setled by Prudence; but
by the Institution of Christ; though many Circumstances
in Government must be determined by Prudence, guided
by Scripture-light. For his advice in order to Peace, it
containeth many good things; yet cannot we fully close
with it, till he establish on better grounds than we have yet
