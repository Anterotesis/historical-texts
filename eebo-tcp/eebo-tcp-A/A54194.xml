         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Would not have any to imagine that my design is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this sheet to publique view, as a Trophy of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Good Old Cause</hi> its Resurrection; neither would I
have it do pennance therein, lest the products of its San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
Complection, should prove worse then <hi>Menses Profluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and consequently leave such an illutable stain, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a Sheet, it should deservedly be called <hi>Pannum men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strualem;</hi>
but my intention, rather is to have it in a readiness
at the time of its Funerall Solemnities; for it is much suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that though our new imagined Common-wealth may have
Twins struggle in its Womb, yet that it will at last only bring
forth a single person (which single product, (the Reliques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more dangerous then <hi>Mola in utero)</hi> may well cause the
death of the Mother) for the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ffecting of which there will not
be wanting such Mercenary Midwives, as will put to their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
hands, for the production of any thing though never so
monstrous. Now what greater Monster can be produced, then
a new Protector of another Family and Interest then what we
have already? But when this Tympanie of Pride and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is swelled to the height, we shall have the bowels of our
<hi>Good Old Cause</hi> break into a Protectorship, or some other title
equivalent, and more Tyrannical. <hi>O' P.</hi> was as much for this
<hi>Good old Cause</hi> as our new Pretenders, till he saw an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of setling himself in the Saddle, and then the Keepers of the
Liberty of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in England; looking upon him as their lawfull and
supreame Govenour (the family of the <hi>Stewarts</hi> being extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by these continuall new Modellers,) But <hi>Astra regunt homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> being most predominant, at that very time when
the signe was in the stomack, down goes <hi>Richard</hi> without an
aspect of Opposition. It is very probable, that had his little
finger been heavier then his fathers loines, he had not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
been heav'd out; for <hi>Similis simili gaudet,</hi> and one oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
would help to maintaine another, especially whilst their
interrest run parallel; but he seeming, to decline oppression,
Oppressors decline him, and make bold to practice that in
their own Names, which they cannot have licence to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection of another, so that now every private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
aspires to the dignity of <hi>Dux omnium malorum,</hi> and blushes
not to affront such, as maintaine them and their blush colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Coates.</p>
            <p>But it seemes the days of mourning are over, and their black
buttons, will no longer put them in mind of their old Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor;
the old King-killing Cause standing in Competition
with his posterity, so that now tis as bad to be a Protectorian,
as twas in the days of yore to be a Cavalier.</p>
            <p>And thus are we emptied from Vessell to Vessell, and every
day more and more slaves to our own Countrymen, which is as
base in us to suffer, as tis in them to impose: And yet all
must be done Machivilian like under a pretence of Religion,
and the liberties and priviledges of the people, when as dalie
experience teacheth us, that nothing less is intended, every
plaine Countryman, being so far become a Politition, as that he
can easily discerne the face of these fallacies in the glass
of his own woes, and Geographer like will give you a
shrewd description of most of the high-wayes, at <hi>Westmister,</hi>
in which though he never wrought or traveld, yet he hath faith
enough to beleeve, that they are well mended in time of year
of a long Parliment where there hath not heretofore wanted
workmen, that would take more then ordinary paines in the

               </gap>s, so that they might save their
own soyle.</p>
            <p>And seeing they have an opportunity offered of making Hay
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60149:3"/>
whilst the sun shines, let us go into the shade that have nothing
else to do, but to sing <hi>Solamen miseris &amp;c.</hi> which dolefull dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is the onely solace as I know now extant, and is like
to continue till we turne our swords into plough-shares, and
our speares into pruneing hooks; which is not like to come to
pass, whilst some of us are so prone to dissentions, that we
must needs create disturbances in the Nation, on purpose
to render the sword usefull and necessary: Whereas we were
in a faire way of safety, and might very well have put our
selves into a posture of defence according to our old Method,
without that intollerable and needless burthen of a constant
Army, which would be insupportable to any but Asses
backs.</p>
            <p>But we see Customes in Martiall affaires, as well as Law,
are not so easily broken, where uses are transferred <hi>ipso
facto</hi> into poss<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ssion, without help of the Statute of 27. H 8,
and a peice of a long Parliament Feoff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s in trust, which are
as Conduit pipes; I cannot say to lead the uses, because the
uses lead them; But however they serve to convey the sweet
hony from the laborious Bee to the idle Drones, and if
themselves get a taste by the way, tis onely in Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the Proverbe, <hi>That tis an ill Cook that will not lick his
own fingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no more of that least I should set them on a stomack,
that never had an appetite, for we have Task-Masters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
who will expect their tale of Bricks, though they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no straw, and will exact taxes, though they distract
Trading; who, so that they may make themselves great, care
not how despicable, or to what extremities they expose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But sure such have little reason to promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
safety, in their private Cabbins, when the Ship is in
danger of sinking, or to dream of a perpetuity in that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
others have had so small a continuance, the Wheele of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
being apt to turne, when it stands most steady: our late
trans<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ctions testifie as much, and may tend to the setting the
right Spoke uppermost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60149:4"/>
Tis an undeniable Maxime in Divinity; That whatsoever is
of God shall stand: And most true it is, <hi>Si Deus nobiscum quis
contra nos!</hi> but yet he may suffer many things which he doth not
allow, and then they must needs fall; the pleasant success not
deciphering the goodness of a cause, though it be never so old:
For I never thought good and old Correlatives, because I have
often observed that the older the worse, and we all know that
a thing relinquished and forsaken, being new swept and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
is fitter for the reception of more Devils then ever.</p>
            <p>I must really confess that I am so much, what I profess my self
in the front of this sheet (and I wish for quietness sake we were
all of the same mind) that for the welfare of my native Country,
I could think a Republique good, so that it did not degenerate
from a Commonwealth, and a Protector better, so he parted not
with that like a fool, which some say (his father got like a knave,
&amp; a King best of all, that title being most agreeable to our Laws
&amp; Nation) so he were not a Tyrant &amp; nullified all good Votes,
with his Negative voice, or stand so much upon his Prerogative
till he loses his place: but from a Democracy <hi>Libera nos Domine,</hi>
that our Parliaments may be no longer over aw'd with swords,
like a dog with a Cudgell, nor take any more such strong Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as so purge out the Members instead of the Humors, which
must needs render them an imperfect body, not worthy the
name of the peoples Representatives, but rather the stawking
horses of some preticular persons, to catch their prey the more
easily.</p>
            <p>We use to say of two evils the least is to be chosen: I wish
our new created Parliament may observe the same method, and
seeing in this juncture of aff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ires, they could do no less then
what they have done: I hope that in their progress they will
make choice of Aristocracy, rather then an Oligarchy, that an
executive power (seeing it may not be in one) may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a few of the best, though not for the present of the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and that such whose breeding and parts makes them onely
guilty of multilequence, may not be impeached by bones only
ratling with Magnanimity, which have nothing in them
but the downright language of the Sword, whose Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
makes them despise that which they understand not,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60149:4"/>
and whose Covetousness makes them desire that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
possess, who delight in nothing less than peace,
because it is no time for Plunder, and care not what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
they introduce, so they produce their profit and keep
the Nation still (Monster like) with the Tail where the Head
should stand, which sight hath cost every <hi>English</hi> man a vast
deal more, then many a Show that is not worth two pence: I
speak not this to extenuate the honour due to Martial Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
which may tend much to the glory of a Nation, nor to
derogate from the worthiness of such <hi>Martigons</hi> whose merits
may sufficiently manifest that my speech is not intended of
them, though it be in some sort directed to them, only to this
end that it may the more conspicuously appear that they have
drawn the Sword for their Countries good, by being willing
to lay it down for their advantage; and as opportunity shall
offer it self, to send those Mercinaries under their command
(that will fight on any side for 6. d. odds) to their quondam
imployments, whose desire is only to make a Trade of War, and
to live upon the ruins of others, being not willing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
non-proficients under their late grand Tutor, who was
so well experienced in the Game at <hi>Put;</hi> that by the advantage
of a few spots, cunningly rendred the King an inconsiderable
Card; and these illegitimate Births of that corrupted Parent
are grown to that maturity that they are ever ready to run the
hazard of a forcible entry, and in imitation of their old Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
put honest men out of doors, though they have nothing but
a Knave to shew fort. But we are now at <hi>One and thirty,</hi> a Game
that (without disparagement) may be plaid at a Council Table,
where if the Gamesters be not self-seekers, this miserable cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nation may be the greater Winners.</p>
            <p>But now to turn to our <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> which being new
come to Town, may justly take exceptions, that I have been so
long averse, &amp; not exercised towards her Ladiships those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
civilities, that are usual to all Strangers, as to solicite their
stay, though they never desire it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I must beg an excuse,
not being bred up in the Academy of Complements; therefore
not apt to flatter, neither can I speak Ironically, though I have
learned the Figure, being more apt to <hi>Tom Tell-Troths</hi> Dialect,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60149:5"/>
and to speak what I think. But to tell you true, and which is a
bad Omen, there are so many <hi>Anabaptists, Familists, S<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>kers,
Quakers, Cum multis aliis,</hi> that rejoyce at this new Ghuest, that
I thought my entertainment would not be acceptable; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notorious Company of <hi>Gotamites,</hi> which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I had almost forgot, <hi>viz.</hi> our Church Antagonists, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure the sight of a holy Sister in a Steeple-house, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
they must have a convenient meeting place, where they
may mingle together in Friendship to beget Reformations.
These sensless brood of Hypocrites, or (at best) blind Zealots,
together withal the spurious issue of Jesuitical impostors; bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as one saith in another case) a sacred hatred to whatever is
comely and decorous, do in a perpetual scorn to it distort all
their Actions to the contrary Mode, applauding themselves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in an unlimited liberty, and of doing whatever either their
fond or foul imaginations suggest to them. As for their outward
garb, tis a cloak of Religion, lin'd thorow with fair hypocrifie
which <hi>Irish-man</hi> like, is never off in the basest imployments; their
Conscience they carry in their pockets <hi>loco crumenae,</hi> which they
can stretch upon all covetous occasions, even to the Reception
of all Revenues, that tend to the incouragement, either of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or Religion. But to hang by these Ideots, let us wish
this <hi>Good Old Cause</hi> better Favorites, that seeing there is such
fair pretences we may see some performances equivalent, and
that those in Authority may more regard the Publique than
their private Commodity: that so the good People of this
Nation may be as much satisfied with the effects of this Change,
as they are for the present discontented. That a Learned and
Godly Ministry may be countenanced: so that Court and
Church be not at once destroyed, nor the Universities be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to follow <hi>Whitehall,</hi> which (they say) is to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Iews,</hi> and I hope no true Christians will meddle
with the other.</p>
            <p>To conclude, If this <hi>GOOD OLD CAUSE</hi> puts us not into
a bad new Case and Condition worse then ever, we might well
forget the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> if the greater deliverance, might
justly obliterate the less.</p>
