            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN
ACCOUNT
Of the Proceedings at Weſtminſter-Hall, on the
29th and 30th of June, 1688. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Indictment when read, was very much excepted againſt, on
the account of its Form, in that it did not mention all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
they were Indicted for: there was not either the Title of
it expreſſing to whom it was directed (viz. To the Kings Moſt
Excellent-Majeſty, was omitted,) and the prayer afterwards (We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not there; which being cloſely purſued by the Biſhops
Council, ſeemed to invalidate the whole buſineſs. Then it was not and
could not be proved by the Kings Council, that the Biſhops preſented
the petition to the King. They had in the Court the Original, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poena'd
ſome of the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops Chaplains, Servants, and
others, to prove their hands, which was not done very clearly upon moſt
of them; all the proof of the Kings Council had for the preſenting the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to His Majeſty, did not directly prove it upon them: The moſt it
amounted to, was either that the King told them, he had it from the ſaid
Biſhops; or, that my Lord Chancellor did ask them, if it were theirs (when
they were ſummon'd before the King and Council,) and that they then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd
an averſeneſs to own it; ſaying before the King, that if His Majeſty
did inſiſt on it, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat it ſhould not be improved to their diſadvantage,
or produc'd in evidence againſt them, that they would be plain, and leave
it to His Majeſty. Upon this the Biſhops Council had ſome reflections
which my Lord Chief Juſtice told them he muſt not hear. But this did not
amount to a full proof of the point. Then the Biſhops Council did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſiſt upon the Indictment being laid in a wrong County; for it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon Oath, that the Arch-Biſhop was not out of his Houſe for a very
con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiderable <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40164:3"/>
time before he was ſummon'd to the King in Council. Now what
was alledg'd againſt them, was done at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and therefore in <hi>Surrey</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
ought to have been laid, which ſeem'd much to affect them. After
this, the Biſhops Council objected againſt the term Publiſhing; whereas
what was ſaid to be done by them, was in the privateſt way that could be, and
given only to the King, which cauſ'd a long debate between both parties,
of things requiſite to denominate a Publication; all did ſtill appear favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
on the Biſhops ſide: and here things were going to a concluſion, and the
Judge was entered upon ſumming up the Evidence; but Mr. <hi>Finch,</hi> (one
of the Biſhops Council) interrupted my Lord Chief Juſtice, ſaying, there
was one material Evidence remaining: Whereupon, my Lord deſiſted, tho
with ſome ſeeming diſatisfaction to the reſt of the Biſhops Council; For
the Judge was going on very favourably for the Biſhops cauſe; ſome of the
Biſhops importun'd my Lord Chief Juſtice to proceed, but he would not;
And ſo it brought on more diſcourſe about the former Subjects, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
the ſending for my Lord Preſident: who came into Court after it
had ſtayed an hour for him: The Evidence that he gave upon Oath, could
not fully prove the delivery of the Petition to the King by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:
When before, for the proof of this, the Solicitor
did very greatly importune ſome Witneſſe for the King,
(that had upon Oath delivered, what they knew about this matter, which
was as aforeſaid) by putting to them very intricate queſtions, my Lord
Chief Juſtice reproved him, ſaying, it was not to be ſuffered; adding,
that if he went on thus, he would let the Biſhops council looſe on him.</p>
            <p>After theſe things, my L. C. J. ask'd the Biſhops council, what elſe they
had to plead; whereupon they proceeded to that part of the Indictment
that call'd the Biſhops Petiton, <hi>A</hi> ſcandalous Seditious Libel, &amp;c. Which
occaſion'd very great, ſolemn and moſt pleaſing debates. For, hereupon
they entered into and diſcuſs'd the lawfulneſs of the Declaration and the
Diſpenſing Power, which were harang'd by every one of the Biſhops Council in
moſt brisk, home and admirable Speeches, for the ſpace of three hours, ſhewing
the Declaration to be againſt and contrary to Law, which no power could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
or abrogate, but that which made it, (viz. a parliament) and that
the Eccleſiaſtical Laws had the ſame foundation as the Civil, and could be
therefore no more diſpens'd with, That the Declaration did evacuate the
Laws for Sabbath-breaking, Fornication, &amp;c. and let looſe the reins to the
moſt extravagant Sects and licentious practices; and that all Laws might be
diſpens'd with, as well as ſome: That the Biſhops were ſworn to maintain the
Eccleſiaſtical Laws; and in repreſenting the Caſe thus to His Majeſty, they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40164:3"/>
had done both as the Law directed them, and according to prudence, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Conſcience. There were hereupon publickly read ſeveral Acts of
parliament, Records of the Tower, and parliament Records, among which
one Act of parliament was obſervable; that gave the King power to diſpenſe
with a Law for a ſtated time: So that what Diſpenſing power he ever had,
was both given and bounded by parliament. From what they produc'd out
of the parliament Records and otherways they greatly confi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m'd what was
ſaid in the petition of the Diſpenſing power, having been often declared ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
in Parliament, and particularly in the years 62 and 72. and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Majeſties Reign, which was in 85, when the parliament declar'd the
Popiſh Officers could not be diſpen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d with, but that it was contrary to Law
to do ſo, tho they were willing by Act of Parliament to indemnifie ſuch as
His Majeſty ſhould nominate, &amp;c. And they ſhew'd how the like Diſpenſing
Power upon the ſame occaſion was accounted illegal in 62. and 72. both by
Parliament and the King himſelf, who offered the Seal to be tore off, and
gave the teſtimony of his diſowning ſuch a Diſpenſing Power. To which the
Solicitors chief Anſwer was, that the King then lacked Money, and that ſuch
Acts as aforeſaid (whatever they might ſay) did confirm, not give the
King's Diſpenſing Power. In ſhort, the Biſhops Council behav'd themſelves
in this weighty matter with a great deal of gallantry and plainneſs, no wiſe
inferior to moſt mens expectations and deſires. The chief of the managers
for the King, was the Solicitor W. Williams, who as was apprehended, did
no great wonders for invaliditating the foregoing Arguments. He was very
hot and earneſt (if not paſſionate) in proving it a Libel, ſaying, It would
be ſo, tho it were done by them to redreſs a certain grievance: whereupon
my L. C. J. asking what courſe then they ſhould take, or what they ſhould
do in ſuch circumſtances; he anſwered, Acquieſce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which occaſioned a very
great Hiſs over the Court) He added farther to prove it Libellous; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating
Expreſſions of gaining the populace, by ſaying, <q>It was not for want
of due tenderneſs to diſſenters, in relation to whom, we are Willing to
come to ſuch a temper, as ſhall be thought fit, when that matter ſhall
be conſidered and ſettled in Parliament and Convocation, ſaid he, what's
the meaning of that?</q> But here my L. C. J. gave him a check, and reftrain'd
what he ſeem'd greatly diſpoſed to vent againſt it. There was not very
much ſaid by the reſt of the Kings council, at leaſt, nothing more conſiderable
than this. The King's Attorny General was pretty moderate; Sir Barth Shores
ſpoke a little, but was preſently ſilenc'd, (in the vacancy of ſtay for my Lord
preſident, my L. C. J. ſaid to Sir Barth-Shores, Now Sir Bartholomew,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40164:4"/>
we have time to hear your Speeches) Serjeant Baldock's Argument againſt
the Biſhops, was chiefly upon their refuſing, the King requiring ſuch a ſlender
matter ſo eaſily to be done; for they were not enjoyned to read, but only
to ſend about and diſperſe it: Yet this they would not do. It concluded
with the Kings Council.</p>
            <p>Then my Lord Chief Juſtice ſumming up the buſineſs, was favourable
to the Biſhops in the former part of the Tryal, and could not ſay the
matter of Fact was fully proved upon them, but was inclin'd to make the
Petition a Libel; becauſe of its accuſing the King of Flaws in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
He ſaid but little to oppoſe what had been brought by
the Biſhops Council againſt the Declaration and Diſpenſing Power. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him ſpoke Judge Holloway, and very much in the Biſhops behalf;
giving it as his judgment, that it could not be a Libel, being done
from a conviction of Conſcience by ſuch Perſons in ſuch an humble modeſt
manner. Then Judg Power ſpake to the ſame effect, giving it as his opinion, that
it could not be a Libel, being the only way to redreſs themſelves: He had
alſo ſome ſmart expreſſions to confirm what the Biſhops Council had urged
againſt the Declaration and Diſpenſing Power, So that Judge Powel gave
his opinion alſo in favours of the Biſhops. Then Judge Allibon ſtanding
up, profeſſed he would not meddle with the Diſpenſing Power (tho it had
been ſo much Canvaſs'd and pleaded againſt) but would only ſpeak to the
buſineſs of the Paper being a Libel; and he did accordingly, urging it to
be ſo, not barely becauſe it was a Petition: For, ſaid he, any one under
grievance may Petition his Majeſty, but not about affairs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for that would tend to very bad conſequences, and promote Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
or worſe in the Nation. Nor (as he added) can the pretended
fairneſs, as to the manner of it, be an excuſe; For the more it hath that
way, ſo much the worſe; and ſo concluded it in his ſenſe a Libel. But
urging a Precedent to confirm what he had ſaid, he was partly miſtaken in
it, as Judge Powel and the Biſhops Council ſhew'd him, and he himſelf
acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Then the Court broke up, the Jury went together, and the Biſhops with
all the privacy they could, to their reſpective abodes; but wherever the
people met with them, they huzza'd and humm'd them in a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
There was a prodigious full Court and Hall, a very great many of
the Peers and Nobility preſent, and alſo the Biſhop of Cheſter, of whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40164:4"/>
they took no kind of notice: The Biſhop of Rocheſter did not meet with
much better regard.</p>
            <p>The Jury ſat up all night, tho they were very ſoon unanimous in their
Verdict, which they prudently reſolved to give in open Court; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
next day about Nine or Ten they brought them in</p>
