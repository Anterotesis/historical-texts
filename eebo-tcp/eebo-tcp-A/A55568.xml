            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I take a View of the Wonderfulness of Gods Providence in bringing me first among you, together with those Bonds of Love, by which I am held so fast, that it is my quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and daily study, how I may be further capacitated to serve you, and the Church of my Lord Iesus; Verily, I must confess, you are the People that have all my thoughts: And besides this, you are those who have the greatest interest in my Prayers; Others have some of my heart, but next to God you have all my heart, I have heard much of the love of a Minister to his People, as that I could scarce give credit unto
<pb facs="tcp:61141:3"/>
it; but I do now believe it, because Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has taught me so, though that by which I am obliged unto you is not the same as with a Minister and his People, it being only a sincere Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by my frequent, painful and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Preaching unto you, without any further charge, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how do I love you, and pray for your happiness in this World, and the World to come; I can't endure to think of your damnation, no, not any of you. I am sick at the heart (many times) through fear, lest I should rise up in judgement against some of you, because there are those amongst you, that seem to takeiittle notice of God, Christ, and their immortal souls, though through grace all of you are not molested with the Contagion of this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is so Epidemical, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in foreign Places, but likewise in our <hi>English</hi> Island, as that it doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times occasion Floods of Tears to run down from the eyes of Gods precious Servants, who, as so many
<pb facs="tcp:61141:3"/>
               <hi>Lots,</hi> do bewail the iniquities of this Land. Sirs, I have thought good to reach you with my Pen, when my Tongue cannot; and hence it is, that I dedicate this unto you in part, though it is possible I could have found out many others, whose Names I might affix in the Frontispiece of this Book, only my Love is most endeared to you; and wherefore do you think it is, that I should concern my self so much with you; would you know, take then these few Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because God made me not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together for my self, but for you and others; we were not made for our selves, and therefore we act most like beasts, when we only minde our selves, and not others, who are our Kinsfolk, according to Creation; but when that goodness that is in us is so diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, as that it leads us forth to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour those who srand in need of our help, then we act as our selves, and like rational creatures, it is God that created me, and why did he create me, but that I should serve him, and in what

               <pb facs="tcp:61141:5"/>
better way can I do it, then in the first place to seek my own salvation, and after that, the salvation of you and others. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, the End of my Creation is not all by which I am induced to concern my self thus with you, but likewise the End of my Redemption requires me so to do; I, you, and all of us were no sooner created, but we fell from God; and through Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Devil, lost that glorious Image which he had invested us with, and thereby forfeited the favour of God, and so became the Children of Wrath; but now Iesus Christ, that immaculate and spotless Lamb of God, who knew no sin, became sin for us, by assuming the humane nature, and taking upon him the guilt of all our transgressions, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. How then can I, you, or any of us, be slothful in Gods service, when he hath done so much for all of us as he hath done; May we not say as <hi>Bernard</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ,<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Thou hast loved me, Oh Lord, more then thy self!</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:61141:5"/>
now the End wherefore Christ did all this was, that we might be restored to Gods Image again, and to serve him in all manner of holiness; And in no better way can I do this, then in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after my own soul and the souls of others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the End of my Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not only require me thus to concern my self with you, but likewise the End of my Sanctification.</p>
            <p>I am sanctified (as I hope) and am washed with the water of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now it is the duty of those who are sanctified, to lead other in the way to Sanctification and obedience of the Spirit; This our Saviour lays down as a Rule to <hi>Peter,</hi> That when he was converted,<note place="margin">

            <p>Fourthly, the very End of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry requires me to have a diligent care of your souls; 'Tis a duty of us who are Preachers of the Gospel, to pity and look after poor souls that are in their blood; and God, yea, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and my own Conscience do bear

               <p>Thus, after a little Contemplation upon him, he goes home; falling down upon his knees, saying to God, Lord have mercy upon me; and this was all he could say for an hour together, (somtimes it was) Lord have mercy upon me a sinner, and pardon my sins; thus continuing for the space of many weeks, despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods mercy to his soul; and being also convinced of his former ignorance, he is now glad to receive good Counsel from any body, his minde and will being changed, makes him to believe, that there is salvation only in Christ, and looks now upon

all his duties, (as a <hi>Pauls</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) accounting them but dross and dung compar'd with our Lord Christ.</p>
               <p>But one day more than the rest, praying to God, does earnestly beg of him for a pardon of all his sins; Thus Expostulating with God for the attainment thereof, <hi>Lord,</hi> (saith he,) <hi>Thou hast given a Pardon unto some, and why not unto me? what way and course therefore may I take for the obtainment of the same</hi>; and immediately at his request, (after the performance of duty) the Lord was pleased to give in this Text of Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for sake his way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon</hi>; from hence he gathers hopes of Gods mercy unto his soul, but in temptations his hopes vanished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again; as to those other Scriptures
