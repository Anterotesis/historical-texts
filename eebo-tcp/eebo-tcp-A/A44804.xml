            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GReat hath been the havock and spoyle that the old Dragon hath made since he was thrown out of Heaven, and many hath been the floods which he hath cast out after the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and great hath been the waves which he hath made to rise up in the sea; yea, the Nations that hath been as waters, he hath gathered on a heap, and made them burst out in a foaming rage, to overflow, and to drown, and to swallow up the woman, which was made to flye into the wilderness for many dayes, having a retired place there which God hath prepared for her, for a time, times, and half a time; and the remnant of her seed hath he made war with every where, and hath also given great Authority to the Beast who rose out of the sea, to kill with the sword, to cut off, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all that worshipped him not, and his Image; and he hath had power over both small and great, and hath killed them, and hath compelled them, &amp; forced them to worship him; and all whose names have not been written in the Lambs Book of life, have worshipped him; for all hath wondered after him; and all the Nations have drunk of the Whores Cup of Fornication, and have been enflamed therewith; and all have partaked with her in her whoredoms, the Kings, the Rulers, the noble men, the Captains, and all, both small and great, who have drunk of her Cup, hath made war, and hated the free-woman and her seed; and all the deceivers, false prophets, and seducers, hath traded with her merchandize, and have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Nations with her Sorceries, and they have the sheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the outside, and are inwardly ravened.

and perverteth all the creatures from that end which God made them, to serve his end, vvhose life stands in discord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, wrath, and unrighteousness, and whatsoever is evil; and herein is the children of God made manifest, and their Works, and the children of the Devil, and their Works; they that love God, loves the Workmanship of God, and cannot hate his Brother, but hath eternal life abiding in him; but he that's of the Devil, destroys Gods Workmanship, kills his Brother, (a man-flayer) and hath not the love of God dwelling in him. And this Seed of the Serpent hath spread it self forth over all the earth since the transgression, both amongst <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> professors, and prophane; them that had the Law, and them that were vvithout the Law; them that have had the Scripture, and them that had no Scripture; and in that which is called Christendome, as well as they which are called Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; as well amongst the highest professors, as amongst the grossest prophane, in all times since the foundation of the World, that the Lamb hath been slain, and the seat of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty raised up, and this seed hath been made manifest by its fruits throughout all ages and times, throughout all Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Tongues, Regions, Countreys, and Kingdoms; and by the fruit which is brought forth in <hi>New-England,</hi> they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may read their stock, and off-spring, and fruits, a little of which, (which is brought to light, and evident) hereafter I shall declare, which when they come to view over their Work again, shame may cover their faces, and astonishment fill their hearts, that such fruits should be brought forth by them who are so high professors of God in words, and of the Scriptures to be the Rule of their obedience and Faith; now shall you be tryed by the Scripture, your Rulers, your Teachers, and your Church-members, and the life of the Saints that gave forth the Scripture, will stand a Witness against your Doctrines and cursed practises for evermore; you may read your example, <hi>Cain, Herod,</hi> Murderers, &amp; Men of blood, the persecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> who were zealous for God as they thought, who persecuted to death, and said they had a Law, and by that Law Christ ought to dye; but you are worse then they, for you had no Law which would take hold upon the righteous and faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56185:5"/>
and the motion of his eternal spirit, we have born our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against the Apostates and Deceivers, (who retain the Words, and has lost the life and power) to the intent that all that believe in the light which Christ hath lighted every man withall, that people might wait to receive power from on high again, (which all the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> hath lost in the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) that as many as receive the power, may come out of the transgression; and for this end hath God chosen and seperated many contrary to their own Wills, and from whatsoever was dear unto them in the outward, to deny it all, and to answer the pure motion of Gods spirit whither soever he leadeth, and in so doing, many have found the power and presence of the Lord going with them, and before them, and he hath prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Work in their hands, and hath brought many out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and out of <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> to Christ the Mysterie, and to the Mysterie of Faith which is held in a pure Conscience.</p>
            <p>And we were not ignorant of this, what opposition we should receive from Antichrist and his Ministers, Satan and his Messengers; and how that the whole World lay in Wickedness; and how that Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and People, had drunk the Whores Cup; and how that all hirelings, deceivers, false prophets, and seducers, would withstand: Neither were we ignorant that the Beasts power which got up in the Throne of Iniquity and exaltation, since the Man-child was caught up unto God, &amp; the Woman fled into the Wilderness, wherein he hath compelled all (both small and great) to worship him. Neither were we ignorant of his strength, and of his great Authority that he had in the Nations, and how that the Whore (the false Church) rode upon him; (and also we knew that the Nations were as Waters) nor of the great Waves which would lift up themselves; nor of the multitude of Merchants which makes merchandize of souls for dishonest gain, who are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of filthy lucre; nor of the multitude of ships in which they carry their merchandize and deceitful Ware; neither was the servants of the Lord; who hath thus deeply suffered (as I shall hereafter make mention) of the Spirit that ruled in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors and Teachers of <hi>New-England</hi>: Notwithstanding all

to the Magistrate, and kept me a prisoner in his own house, while he himself went to his Worship; many staid and heard the Truth the fore-part of the day declared; After he came home, and see so many with me, and could not stop my mouth, he wrote a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that Magistrate that committed me, took his Horse, and rode away to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governor to make his complaint; but the other Magistrate, and most part of the Town, would not joyne vvith him against me, but some few of the ruder sort. There was I kept a prisoner till the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the <hi>Dutch</hi> sent a Guard of twelve Musketiers, and the Gaoler, and the Sheriff came about twenty miles; so I was committed to them, and they searched me, and took away my Knife, Books, and Papers, and pinioned me vvith Cords; the next morning they took two Women, one having a young child sucking, and committed them also, and more if they could have found them; and thus they entertain strangers in <hi>New-England.</hi> And then a Warrant vvent forth to bring those people that did receive us; and so he fined them, and commanded them to pay, within six Weeks, or else depart the Jurisdiction; and one man he committed, and laid Irons upon him, and fined each of them three pounds. So I being pinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till I came near vvhere the <hi>Dutch</hi> vvere, being tyed vvith a Rope to a Cart-tayle, thorough the Woods near 30. miles, and then I vvas cast into a Dungeon so odious as I never savv, for vvet, dirt, and nasty stink; and the next day I was brought to Examination, and an <hi>English</hi> Captain there to interpret, and took in Writing in their ovvn Language, committing me again to the Dungeon, suffering not any English to come to me. The next Court calling me out again, reading my Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in their Language, the Captain interpreted some of my Accusation, and thus said before the Court, <hi>That it is the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals pleasure, seeing I did behave my self thus, that I must pay</hi> 600. <hi>Gilders,</hi> (which is 50. pound) <hi>or else to serve at a Wheel-barrow, lock'd with a Chain.</hi> I did ask him if I might give an Answer; and they answered, No; but shut me up in a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56185:7"/>
So on the second day in the morning they took me forth, and lockt me to the Wheel-barrovv (amongst the slaves) to work; I told them, <hi>I was never used to that work</hi>; and they took a hard Ship-Rope, (near four Inches about) and commanded a Black-More to beat me with it; so he beat me so long till I fell down, and the Sheriff commanded him to take me up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and beat me again; so it was judged by the standers by, that he gave me an hundred blovvs: Then they forced me to go into the Fort where the Governor lived, and went to know what they should do vvith me; so they sent a Moor to gather Rods to vvhip me; and so with the blovvs, and the heat of the Sun, I sunk down vvhere I stood in the Fort, and there I vvas till the seventh hour in the night; When the Gaoler came to unlock me from the Barrow, I was so sore swollen, that it was as much as I could do to stand, and was put that night in the dungeon; the next morning I was taken out about the fifth or sixth hour, and vvas lockt to the Barrovv till the seventh hour at night, vvith a Century over me, that none should speak to me, and if I spoke to any, they told me they would punish me more; yet for all this, my mouth was opened to declare the Word of Truth. Afterwards they shut me up in the Dungeon about a Week, and then brought me forth again; and then they stript me to the Waste, and hung me up by the hands, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Clog to my feet, the Gaoler being full of Wine and the Black-Moor a strong man, came vvith Rods, and whipped me, (the stripes cannot be numbered) back, sides and breast, which was cut very sore; and then I was put into the Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two nights, and near two dayes, giving me neither Bread nor Water; the Gaoler being drunk and asleep, two Souldiers got in at the door, and got me some Water; so aftervvards they took me forth again, and asked me if I would pay the Fine; I told them I could not: They asked me if I would work, or be whipped every day; I asked them vvhat I had done, or vvhat Law I had broken, and to know my Accusers; So they took me and hanged me up again, (as they had before) and put my body to great pain, in keeping my body so long hanged, and giving me about ten stripes, and then asked me if I vvould work, and then gave me stripes again, four or five times, then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56185:7"/>
they let me down, and put me into the Dungeon; then a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to me, and washed my stripes, and afterwards part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, and went home to her husband, and letting him know how it was with me, he proffered the Sheriff a fat Ox if he would suffer me to come to his house; for his Wife after she parted from me, looked when word should come that I was dead; but the Governor would not suffer me to come forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the whole Fine was paid; there were many friendly (both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi>) that would have paid it, but I could not consent; and then afterwards (within three dayes) I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to work, and was made able and strong within three dayes after I was so sore abused, (as the first going into prison) which did much confound and torment them to see me work; Many <hi>English</hi> came to me to have my consent the fine should be paid, and grieved to see me made a slave; but I could not yeild that any should give one penny. But after I had wrought one week, I had liberty to speak to many that did resort to me; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Williams</hi> (one of my greatest Adversaries) said I should be freed, for he had lost the love both of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi>; and so for his own benefit, he begg'd my release of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, a man more fit to be ruled over, then to rule: And this is the fruit of the Governor and Sheriff, who would be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christian Magistrates; but the Mercies of the wicked are cruel. But in all this the Arm of the Lord did support me, wherein I had peace in the inward man; and so I was brought to <hi>Road Island.</hi>

courage for God, I made my vvay, with my beloved Brother, <hi>John Rous,</hi> who had drawings thither, and did accompany me; The strength of darkness being on their parts, and their late-made Laws being so abominable and wicked, the few dayes we had to visit the Seed, we were forced (so as in the Wisdom of the Father) to keep hid in the Wilderness, and to have the Church to meet us there, it being against me (if I could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it by lawful means) to go bound to <hi>Pilate,</hi> but that in the Povver and Authority of God we might at their Court appear, in which time the particulars vvere presented to me, vvith the truth of every thing, vvhich I sent before me to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Magistrates, to make vvay for me by a Constable, with a line to him to this purpose, <hi>That neither the Governor nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable needed to seek any further after me, for it was my intent (with</hi> J.

My answer was to the Governour, That part of my grounds I had sent before me, with his name (and several other of the Magistrates names) upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and asked him whether he had received it, or not? Which thing he vvould neither acknowledge, nor deny; upon which I tendered him another Copy of the same, and required that it should be read in the audience of the Court, and that I might have liberty to declare the rest of my grounds, the which he would neither receive, nor suffer to be read; afterwards I made way that I might read it my self, and he caused me to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down, and haled forth, and abused both me and <hi>Iohn Rous,</hi> with his tongue, and caused us to be haled to prison again.

               <p>MY dearly beloved Friends, about the last of the sixth Month, 1657. I came from <hi>Barbado's,</hi> with another Friend with me, an Inhabitant of the Island, and according to the appointment of the Father, landed on <hi>Road-Island</hi> in the beginning of the eighth moneth, on an out-part of the Island, but the Vessel went for <hi>Boston</hi>; and being come thither,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56185:11"/>
I heard of the arrival of Friends from <hi>England,</hi> which was no small refreshment to me; and after I had been there a little while, I passed out of the Island into <hi>Plymouth-Patten,</hi> to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and several other Towns thereabouts; and after some time I was in <hi>Conecticut-Patten,</hi> with <hi>John Copeland,</hi> where the Lord gave us no small Dominion; for there we met with one of the Disputers of <hi>New-England,</hi> who is a Priest of <hi>Hartford,</hi> who was much confounded, to the glory of Truth, and his shame; and after some staying there, we returned to <hi>Road-Iland,</hi> (where <hi>H.N.</hi> was) and after some stay there, we went to <hi>Plymouth-Patten,</hi> and they having a Court, we went to the place where it was, (having sent before, the grounds of our coming) but we were straightway put into prison, and after twice being before them, (where we were much railed upon) they judged us to be vvhipt, H.N<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> received twenty three stripes, and I fifteen, (with Rods) which did prove much for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Truth, and their disadvantage; for Friends did with much boldness own us openly in it. And after we were let from thence, vve returned to <hi>Road-Island,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Boston,</hi> and bore vvitness (in their Meeting-House) against their Worship, in a fevv Words, till they haled us forth, and had us to their house of Correction, and that evening vve vvere examined, and committed to the prison; and on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day in the evening they vvhipt us vvith ten stripes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, vvith a three-fold Whip, to conclude a vvicked Weeks Work, which vvas this; On the second day they vvhipped six Friends; on the third day the Gaoler laid <hi>William Brand</hi> neck and heels, (as they call it) in Irons, (as he confessed) for six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours; and on the fourth day the Gaoler gave <hi>W. Brand</hi> one hundred and seventeen strokes vvith a pitch Rope; on the fifth day vve vvere put in prison, and on the seventh day vve suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So on the seventh day vvas a Week after our first whipping, four of us received fifteen stripes a-piece, and on the fourth day after, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased: So we returned to <hi>Road-Island,</hi> and continued there a

But we are kept in the Dominion of the Lord, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all our Enemies.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56185:12"/>
you? We answered, The Lord hath commanded us, &amp; we could not but come: Then he maliciously said, The Lord commanded you to come? it was the Devil. Then he urged us to prove our call by the Scriptures; Our ansvver vvas, Our Names are not vvritten in the Scriptures. The Governor (whose name is <hi>John Indicot</hi>) said, he did believe we spoke true, for he did think our Names vvere not vvritten in the Scriptures; and farther said, It vvere something if you could make it appear to me that you are sent of God. We answered, That vvhile he stood in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, though vve speak never so plain to him, yet he would not believe it. Then one <hi>Nathaniel Williams</hi> standing by, said to this effect, Seeing that you knew we would not receive you, it must needs be out of malice that you came. Our answer was, That the Lord God who searcheth the hearts of all, knows that we came not in malice, but in obedience to him. Then <hi>J. Indicot</hi> asked us, Whether vve did believe that Christ's body vvas in heaven? <hi>Ans.</hi> We knovv that his body is in heaven. So he sent for the Gaoler, and bid him take us avvay, and said we should hear from them to morrovv. So he had us away; and put us in the House of Correction, as they call it. So on the morrow (being the fifth day of the sixth month) they had a Court at <hi>Boston,</hi> before vvhich we were brought; When we came before them, they caused our hats to be taken off, and throvvn on the ground; Then <hi>J. Indicot</hi> said, You were before me yesterday, and I asked you to prove your call, but you did not, because you said I would not believe it; therefore I ask you to prove it before the people, &amp; it may be they wil believe you. Then we asked them if they vvould believe us when we spoke the truth? <hi>I, I, if you prove it by Scripture, we must as before.</hi> To prove our call hither by express Words of Scripture, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, because our Names (neither this place) is not mentioned in Scripture; but that vve have examples in Scripture from the Prophets and Apostles, who in obedience to the Lord travelled from place to place, as we do, that we can prove. Then <hi>I. I.</hi> laughed, and said, Are you Prophets and Apostles? Then he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked us, whether we did believe that Christ had a body in heaven distinct from the body of his Members. VVe answered, That Christ's body is divided from his members, we do not believe.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56185:13"/>
                  <hi>I.I.</hi> turned to the people, and said, They mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then we said, VVe know no such word in Scripture as My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, and put them to prove by Scripture that Christ had two bodies. Then one stood up (like a Priest) and asked us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we did not believe that Christ had a body in heaven made of Sinews, Flesh, and Bone, distinct from the body of his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Then we asked what the body of his Members was? To which they gave no ansvver. Then the Secretary made a speech to this effect, saying, That these men have been here twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and have received the Law, and was sent out of this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and now are come the third time; And so vvrote an Order, and delivered it to the Governor, who delivered it to the Gaoler, and bid him take us away, and keep us according to his Order; but they read not the Order to us then. So he had us away to the house of Correction again; and the next morning the Gaoler came to us, and asked us to work; Then we required to see his Order; so he shewed us it: The Order was to this effect:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then he asked us again to work, and said, As you are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, I would wish you not to put your bodyes to so much sufferings, saying, he had an Order to have us whipt twice a Week if vve vvould not work, and shewed us the Order that vvas made for the other Friends that vvere in the prison before us, whereby they were whipt; but we answered him not: Then he said, he would not be harsh vvith us, but vvould give us time to consider of it till noon. So after some time, he came to us again, and asked us as before; then we answered, We were shut up, and vvere not at liberty to vvork; Then he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us, and had us into the room where the Work vvas, and kept us there till night, and then had us into the Common Gaol, and on the morrow had us down again where the Work was, and said he would keep us there till our backs were slash'd, and set Bread and Pottage by the Work, but vve had not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56185:13"/>
to meddle with it neither. So at night we were had into the Common-Gaol again, where we were shut up in a close Room, and had Bread and Pottage set by us, but they said they vvould not take any thing for it but Work; in which place we remained eight dayes, they not knowing of any thing vve did eat. Then the Gaolers Wife came to us, and said, if we would have Milk, we might have it bought for us; and if we would have Beer, we might buy it of her; So from that time the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends who were in the House of Correction, (some time after) was suffered to bring us what we did want, in at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Some time after C.H. and J.C. were put in prison, I <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> was commanded of the Lord to go <hi>Boston</hi> also, and as way was made, (according to the Will of God) I prepared to go thitherwards, and on the 25. of the sixth Month, (in the Evening) I came to <hi>Boston,</hi> so I went into an Inne, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to be a snare to any man, I declared who I was, to the man of the house, who fetched the Marshal, and the Marshal had me to the Governor; and when I was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governor, he came towards me in a lofty manner, and said, Put off thy hat; I answered, I cannot; so my hat at his command was taken off. <hi>J.I.</hi> asked me why I came to town? I said, To visit my Friends that were in prison; and (if I may have liberty) if they want any thing, to minister to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities. He answered in derision, That was a charitable deed; Why did not <hi>Humphrey Norton</hi> come? He asked me if I had any Letters; To which I vvas silent. So he bid the Marshal search me, who did according to his command; and <hi>I. Indicot</hi> took se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Papers out of my Letter-case, and kept them. And after some questions about the body of Christ, (to which I answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him according to the Scriptures) and telling me that was no new thing we held; for (he said) if he had time, he would shew me out of Books which he had in the house, that several hereticks (before us) held the same Opinions. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him little, (knowing that the Spirit of God is pure from all Heresie, whatsoever blind men m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56185:14"/>Again, on the seventh day of the seventh Month, we three were sent for (from the prison) before the Court of Assistance held at <hi>Boston,</hi> who (when we came) commanded our hats to be taken off, the which being done, (after some time) <hi>I.I.</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us one by one, Whether we knew the Law against <hi>Quakers?</hi> We answered, We knew their Law. Then he asked us, Why we came hither? We answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Lord (whose Law is just) required it of us to come, in obedience to him we came. Then one called Major <hi>Denison,</hi> asked us, Whether every man is not Master of his own house? We answered, The Lord God is Master of Heaven and Earth, and he can send whither he vvill, and vvhom he vvill: Then J. I. said, Were you not here before, and vvere sent away, and vvere vvarned not to come again, and now are come a third time, (to which <hi>Rich.

Then Major <hi>Denison</hi> said, If a man should forewarn another man from coming into his house, and should stand with a Pike (or a Sword) at his door, and yet for all this, the other should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to come into his house, and should be slain, Would not this man's blood be upon his own head? <hi>Ans</hi> If the Lord sent a man to such a man's house, to warn him (or any in his house) to repent, or of the judgements that vvas to come; if this man vvas slain, he was innocent in the sight of God, and had cleared his conscience towards the man, and his blood would be upon his head that slew him. Then some Words passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, whereby the Governor was called by his Name; then Major <hi>Denison</hi> spake to this effect, It was not fit for us to call him by his Name; [Mark but the pride of this man's heart] To which it was replyed, He might have shewed more Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for hís Name is <hi>John Indicot,</hi> and mens Names are given for men to be called by.

                  </gap>ct of persons. They were answered, They that respects persons, commits sin. Then one said, That is in Judgement. To which it was replyed, Now you are in judgement, Why do you then plead for it? If you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56185:14"/>
were Magistrates of God, you would speak in the Majesty of God; but they were light, and vain, and laugh'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Indicot</hi> asked, What is the honor that you would have given to men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Love is the honor due to all men; and further said, How can you believe, that receive honor one of another? If you were believers, you would not seek it; but the unbelieving Pharisees sought it, and were reprehended by Christ; and the same reproof reaches to all men who are seeking the same. <hi>Denison</hi> said, It might be ignorant people vvould wonder that we should make so much a-do about putting off the hat, and seeking honor to our persons, for therein lyes the ground of contempt of Authority. Both ignorant and wise may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it indeed, that you make such a do about the hat; is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of hats, and bowing the knee, obedience to the higher Power? Is that the honor from above? Nay, Christ saith its below. And though <hi>Denison</hi> said, they fought not honor to themselves, yet (<hi>Reader)</hi> thou maist judge by their late Act, (which hereafter I shall mention) that they were so unvvilling to lose this honor, (which is corrupt and below) that rather then they will want it, death and banishment shall come upon him that vvill not give it them. And further, <hi>Denison</hi> (out of the pride of his heart) said, We are stronger then you, look to your selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lord is stronger then all, and he shall reign.</p>
               <p>Then one of them said, We were deceived and deluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If we were deluded, and out of the way, you had more need to pitty us, then do as you do.</p>
               <p>One of them said, We pitty you, while we punish you. [Mark the deceit of this Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] Then after some more words, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they call'd us bold boys, and blasphemers) J. <hi>Indicot</hi> said, You come in a way, and shew of love and humility, and the spirit of meekness, but you are such as Christ spoke of, vvho outwardly have sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans</hi> Christ there speaks of a people very like your selves. Then J I. made a speech unto us, to this effect: Exhorting us to make our peace with God, saying, That the way we walked
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56185:15"/>
in, (deceiving of people, and speaking against Ministers and Ordinances, and despising of Magistrates) is the way that leads to hell; and said, [the Boaster] I speak from heaven, but you will not believe me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Nay, we do not believe thee, (he who is a man of blood, speaks from the pit of darkness, where his residence and abode is) but as for deceiving of people, and speaking against Ministers of Christ, and despising of Magistrates, we are not guilty. So they bid the Gaoler take us away, the which he did; and this is the substance of our Examination at that time.</p>
               <p>Again, on the tenth day of the same Month, we were called before the Court; And when we came before them, the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Governor made a Speech to this effect:</p>
               <p>These men have been formerly here, and they have been sent avvay; and though they know the Law, yet are come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in contempt, and to revile Magistrates and Ministers, and to break all order in Churches, and deceive the people; and so what ever become of them, whether loss of ears, or loss of life, your blood be upon your own heads. [Mark, worse then <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the envious <hi>Jews.</hi>]</p>
               <p>To which he vvas replyed, you heap false accusations upon us, and God will heap his judgements upon your heads; and if we suffer either loss of member, or loss of life, our blood will be required at your hands, for the Lord hath sent us hither. <hi>J. I.</hi> said, Prove that, (and said) Christ's Messengers were to pray for them that persecuted them; but you prophesie his judgements upon us. We have not done any thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves either death or bonds. Then <hi>Indicot</hi> said, You are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Enemies to us, then those that come openly, while you come under pretence of peace, to poyson the people. Then one of us said, It grieves me to hear thee speak so many false things. Then they urged us to prove that we were sent of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That vvhich you do unto us, doth prove that vve are sent of God; for the same things that Christ said should be done to his Disciples, (by those that were contrary to him) have you done unto us, as vvhipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To vvhich Major <hi>Denison</hi> said, Then evil-doers that are whipped, suffer for Christ's sake. To vvhich <hi>Iohn Rous</hi> replyed, If we were evil-doers, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56185:15"/>
of God would he heavier upon us then that which we suffer by you; but not being evil-doers, we have peace with God, and his peace keeps us above all sufferings. To which Major <hi>Denison</hi> replyed, Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> (for so I may call you, having heard your father is a Gentleman) what judgement of God do you look for greater (then is upon you) then to be driven from your fathers house, and to run about here as a vagabond, with a company of deceivers, except you look for a Halter, or to be stricken with a Thunder-bolt? [Reader, do but mark this Christian-Magistrate, for so he would be called.] <hi>Joh. Rous</hi> said, I was not driven from my Fathers House, but in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Lord I left it; and when the Lord shall have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me of this Land, I shall return to it again. Then J. <hi>Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> called to the Secretary to read the Law, then he read this Clause in it, <hi>That if any that had suffered the Law, should presume to return again, they should have one of their ears cut off</hi>; (worse then the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Apostles came again into a City after they were commanded not to come, yet when they came, they cut not off their ears) Then J. <hi>Indicot</hi> did as he used to do, spoke many words in derision; Then one of us said, More gravity would become thee. To which J. <hi>Indicot</hi> said, Do you come to reprove us? Major <hi>Denison</hi> said, If you could shew unto us your commission, as plain as we can shew you that you trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress our Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [Reader, take notice, they had no Law at all when the Quakers came into <hi>New-England,</hi> till they consulted with the Prince of darkness to make one.] Whether you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us, or no, from the Lord we have received our command, and his Spirit is our Seal. Then J. <hi>Indicot</hi> said, They have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove it by, but the Spirit within them, and that is the Devil. <hi>Ans.</hi> Take heed of blaspheming the Spirit. J. <hi>Indicot</hi> said, You come in contempt. <hi>Reply,</hi> The Lord God (who knows the hearts and reins of all mankind) judge betwixt us and you, whether we came in contempt.</p>
               <p>So after some words, we spake something to them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Law, and said, We have seen some of your Laws that have many Scriptures in the Margent, but what example have you in Scripture for cutting off ears? J.I. said, What Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have you for hanging then? M. <hi>Denison</hi> said in way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56185:16"/>
Yes, they would be crucified. So they hastened the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to dispatch us quickly, who spoke to the Secretary to read the Law to us three; so he called us three by our Names, and (as he was going to read it) the Governor and Magistrates whispered together, and (while we were expecting to have the Lavv read against us) J. <hi>Indicot</hi> turned suddenly about, and in great haste and bitterness passed his sentence upon us three, in these Words, <hi>It is the Sentence of the Court, That you three shall have your right ears cut off by the Hangman.</hi> Then we seeing their unjust proceedings against us, and that they were both our Accusers and Judges, we were stirred in Spirit to appeal to the chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> the vvhich Appeal we made one by one; but they made a light thing of it, and hastened the Keeper to take us away; so we were had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and put into the prison again; and the same day was <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Southwick,</hi> and <hi>Casandria</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Josiah</hi> their Son, called before their Court, who had been prisoners in the house of Correction eleven Weeks, for being taken in a Meeting at <hi>Salem,</hi> who have been imprisoned here before; So they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with them, saying, This man was a member, and this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a member; Then <hi>Josiah</hi> asked them, What error he held? They said, You do believe and hold forth, That there is that in every man, that if he will, he may be saved by it. <hi>Josiah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, There is no power in any mans Will to save himself. <hi>Laurence</hi> said, The reason why you gave me admonition, was because I entertained two men in my house; They answered, They were <hi>Quakers.</hi> He replyed, It was <hi>Christopher Holder,</hi> and <hi>John Copeland.</hi> So they were had to the house of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again, and on the morrow a Bond was sent them for to sign, (of vvhich a Copy followeth) for the signing of which Bond, liberty was offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We,</hi> Laurence Southwick, Josiah Southwick, <hi>and</hi> Casandria Southwick, <hi>do bind our selves joyntly and severally, in the sum of</hi> 40. l. <hi>to the Treasurer of the County; The Condition is, That we, and every one of us, will forthwith depart the jurisdiction of the</hi> Masatuthers; <hi>or that we, or any of us, shall publish or maintain any of the diabolical Opinions of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>or entertain any of their sect
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56185:16"/>
that resort unto us from other parts.</hi> The which Bond they cannot sign, and therefore they remain prisoners still.</p>
               <p>So on the 16. day of the 7<hi>th.</hi> Month, 1658. the Marshal (with a company of blood-thirsty men) came to the prison where we were, &amp; when they had let in so many as they thought meet, they lock't the door, &amp; did not suffer one friend to come in, though some did much press it, especially one Friend who was moved to come from <hi>Rhode</hi>-Island to bear witness against their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the time of their executing of it on us. So when they had made the doors fast, the Marshal (vvith some others) came into the room where vve vvere, and read an Order to this effect, as follows.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>To the Marshal General, or to his Deputy; You are to take with you the Executioner, and to repair to the House of Correction, and there see him cut off the right Ears of <hi>John Copeland, Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Holder,</hi> and <hi>John Rous,</hi> Quakers, in execution of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court of Assistance, for the breach of the Law, tituled <hi>Quakers.</hi>

               <p>So they had us forth into another room, vvhere vvas more light; <hi>Ioh. Rous</hi> said to the Marshal, We have appealed to the chief Magistrate of England; He answered, He had nothing to do with that. <hi>Christoph. Holder</hi> said, Such Execution as this should be done publikely, and not in private. One called Cap. <hi>Oliver,</hi> replyed, We do it in private, to keep you from twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. So the Executioner took C.H. and when he had turned aside his hair, and was going to cut off his Ear, the Marshal he turned his back on him, because he would not see it; the which I. <hi>Rous</hi> taking notice of, said, Turn about, and see it; (for so was his Order) and the Marshal (being filled with fear) turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and said, Yes, yes, let us look on it. So in the fear of God we suffered boldly, saying, Those that do it ignorantly, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire (from our hearts) the Lord to forgive them, but for them that do it maliciously, let our blood be upon their heads; and such shall know in the day of account, that every drop of our blood shall be as heavy upon them as a milstone.

I asked him for his Warrant; he said he had none; Then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to go with him. Then he bad the Constable command some friends (that were present) to aid him. They refused, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Constable had no Warrant. <hi>Batters</hi> willing to drive on his Masters Work, went out, and brought two other men (which he had ready near the House) to force us away, but stil we refu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed to go with him, unless they would carry us by force; though they hailed us, and forced off our clothes, yet we went not; (See the fruits of <hi>New-England</hi>-members on their Sabbath, which they pretend to be so zealous for) So they went away without us.

And vvhen we came to <hi>Boston,</hi> vve were seperated into several rooms in the Prison, and we into a room that the bloody Gaoler had provided to put us in, he hearing we were taken, resolved (in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart) to torment our bodies, or to make us bow to their wicked and cursed Law, (as he said to us.) He took us up into a high room in the inner, Prison, had stopped it so close, that he left not a hole for any air to come in, nor suffered any to come at us; and stopped all necessaries from us, as Food, and whatsoever might be serviceable to us, neither let us have any Victuals for our money; but after some time he brought a few Pottage and a piece of Bread; We would have given him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for it, but he said, he would have nothing but Work for

So after I spoke a few words against their bloody Law, (which lay upon me to witness against) by which we suffered, he locked us up again, (as before-mentioned) and about an hour after he came to signifie to us, That we were clear, (according to the Law) and might pass away if we would pay the Marshal to go with us out of the Collony: [Oh inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane! We to pay a man for banishing of us!] the Answer was, If he would set open the doors for us, we would pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; And after he demanded, Whether we would work his work? We refused: Then he began to threaten us what he would do to us, and said he would put me in Irons that night; so the next day he came with his Irons, and put one Iron on each thigh, and another about my neck, and he locked them together with a Horse-Lock, that there was no more liberty between the Irons then the Lock allowed, (so that my body was crumbled together, my head close to my thighs) those Irons was upon me from about the fifth hour in the morning, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ninth hour at night; (which was sixteen hours.) And when I lay in the Irons, I was strengthened in the power of the Lord. The next day in the morning he came as he did before, to know vvhether I had occasion to go dovvn, I vvent dovvn, and vvhen I came into the lovver room vvhere his Mill stands, he haled me tovvards the Mill, and bid me go to vvork; he took a Rope about an inch thick, and laid upon me as hard as he could lay upon my back and arms, until his Rope untvvisted, and then he left off, and (as it vvas said by the Prisoners) he gave me about twenty blows at the least, so that with those blows, my back and arms were swelled. Then I went up into the room, (where we were locked in) then he brought another Rope bigger and stronger then the former and haled me down again into the lower room, and said (as he often did) that he would make me bow to the Law of the Countrey; he bid me work, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I could not do for all the worlds frowns or favours.

It being in the heat of Summer, I had nothing but a Searge Cassock upon my shirt; then he began to lay on again (vvith his Rope) upon my back, that had been vvhipped but tvvo days before, and the day before lay in Irons, and had laid so many blovvs upon me (before) that morning; but he (like an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man) had no compassion, but vvith violence laid four-score and seventeen blovvs more on me, as hard as he could lay them on; and if his strength (and his Rope had not failed him) he vvould have laid more on; but he threatned to give me as many more the next morning, if I vvould not bovv to the Lavv, and also that friend that vvas vvith me, if he vvould not yeild; but the Lord prevented this cruel man of his purpose. So he locked us up in the room, (as at the first) and yet the Lord did bear me up, that I fell not under the strokes of this vvicked man, being kept from dyet five dayes, and my body vveakned both for vvant of ayre and dyet, and having lain in Irons so many hours, and receiving so many blovvs, that soon after I vvas laid dovvn upon the boards, I felt the parts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture decaying, and natural strength to fail me, that my body vvas turned as cold as the earth, and a striving there vvas in nature for life, (vvhich vvas near departed from me) so that at last all my sences vvere stopped, that I had neither seeing, feeling, nor hearing, for some time, but the Povver of the Lord broke through me, and life broke through death, and the breath of the Lord breathed into my nostrils, and a noise went forth into the Town, among the people; so the vvickedness that vvas intended, (and murder in secret) vvas manifest open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many came into the prison to see vvhat vvas done both small and great) vvhich vvhen they savv, their eyes afflicted their hearts; for they savv my back and arms bruised, and black, and my flesh become as a jelley, and svvelled vvith the blows, and the blood hanging as in bags under my arms, vvith the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el beating having received an hundred and seventeen blovvs, (at the least) as vvas told by them that heard and saw them And what the Lord hath done, is to make this profession and hypocrisie of theirs manifest, that all that fears the Lord may come out from among them.

So it was entered into the Court-Rolls, that he should make his appearance at the next New-Commons.</p>
               <p>Now there was one <hi>Laurence Southwick</hi> and his Wife, was sent to <hi>Boston</hi>-Prison for entertaining these two strangers; the man, they let come home again, because the Church was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him &amp; cast him out; but the Woman was kept 7 vveeks in prison, although they had no law then made against the thing.

She owning of it, was fined forty shillings, and so let her go.</p>

               <p>Now about this time there was one <hi>William Shattock</hi> in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> (a poor man that did refrain from the publike Meeting) was had to the Court, who (because he had not to pay the five shillings a-Week-Fine) was put in prison, [they judged him a friend to <hi>Quakers</hi>] he was (by the Courts Order) whipt, and kept prisoner from his Family; and the Gaoler took all his Work for himself, allowing his Family not a penny. He at last sent to the Court to know what they would do; he had this Word sent to him, That if he was able to pay five shillings a Week, he might stay; but the Deputy-Governor said, Seeing he had no house of his own, into his house he should not come, [for he was his Tenant] &amp; that none should receive him into their houses, therefore he must abide in the House of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The case being so hard he desired that he might then look out for a habitation in another Jurisdiction: So they gave him

but two or three dayes time to depart the Collony; so he was forced from his Family, having his Wife and four small Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>The time proved so troublesom, that it was the desire of some to look out for a habitation in <hi>Road</hi>-Island Patten, So there went three from <hi>Salem, John Small, John burton, Josiah Southwick,</hi> towards the Island, and the first night came to a Town called <hi>Dedham,</hi> and went to the Inne to lodge, they had not been long there, but the Captain of the Town came (his name is <hi>Cushar</hi>) and examined them of matters of Religion, and whether they owned their Churches and Ministers; Who being not free to answer according to his will, told them he would send them where they should. They told him upon what account they went; but he got them secured that night, and the next morning sent them back to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this, there came two men more to <hi>Salem,</hi> (of those called <hi>Quakers</hi>) and it was their desire to have a meeting with us; so there was a meeting, and about twenty persons (and upwards) of the Inhabitants, and whilst we were peaceably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there came one <hi>Edmond Batters</hi> (a Commissioner) with a Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

saying, Thou art one, because thou comest in with thy hat on; He replyed again, That was a horrible thing to make such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el lawes of whipping, and cutting off ears, and burning tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the tongue, for not putting off the hat: So we were sent to the house of Correction, and four of us was whip't, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two was before whipt, as is before-mentioned, <hi>Lawrence Southwick</hi> and his son, but his wife was whip't the second time; and the names of the Inhabitants were <hi>

               <p>Now besides the six Inhabitants, they sent the two strangers to prison, the one was <hi>William Brend,</hi> that was a dweller in the city of <hi>London,</hi> and the other was an inhabitant of <hi>Barbado's,</hi> his name is <hi>William Leddra</hi>; Now the strangers were put into the Goal, and the inhabitants in the house of Correction, the Goaler (a cruel tyrant) he required the strangers to work, but they refused to do his work; and for the cruelty the Goaler exercised on <hi>William Brend,</hi> (the passages are before mentioned) some of their own society vvas dissatisfied, because the Goaler vvas a Church-member, and would have had him been cast out of the Church; but vvhen he vvas called before the Church, <hi>Iohn Norton</hi> the Teacher vvould hardly suffer any to blame him, but did countenance him in it; so he vvas past by, and let alone. Now the same Week came one <hi>Humphrey Norton,</hi> a stranger, and one <hi>Iohn Rous,</hi> they were put in prison also; so the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor required them to work, but they refused, and did desire to eat their own bread, so they were cruelly whip't; and because they would not work, <hi>Iohn Indecot</hi> Governor, and <hi>Richard Billingham</hi> Deputy-Governor, wrote an Order of cruelty to the Goaler, That all the <hi>Quakers</hi> then in prison should bee severely whip't twice a Week, beginning with fifteen lashes, (with a cruel Whip) and every time to exceed three; which was barbarous cruelty, which they put in execution; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion was in some of the towns-men, that they paid their fees and released them; now in the end of three Weeks some of the inhabitants were released, such as had not been in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son once before; now these cruel acts made more of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Salem</hi> with-draw from their Assemblies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

their hands were defiled with blood.</p>
               <p>Now about three Weeks after the former Court at <hi>Salem,</hi> the Court did again sit, and had divers persons brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them (upon this account) for not comming to the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the General Court having now made a Law, the first Law was, to pay five shillings a Week for not coming to them; now to adde to that, we must pay ten shillings every time we meet (to worship the Lord) together; and if any one spoke in our Meeting, they must pay five pounds a time, (each person:) Amongst those that were presented, came in one <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Philps,</hi> vvith his hat on, vvho hearing them say that the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny Magistrates, and having a Paper in his Pocket that did express under some of their hands, that they ovvned Magistrates, did give it to them; they asked if he vvould own it? He answered, Yea; then they fined him forty shillings for ovvning that, and for not putting off his hat, sent him to <hi>Ips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> Correction-house, where he was whipt at first entrance; the Gaoler requiring him to work, he told him, if he would let him go home to his Work, he would vvork; for he thought it unreasonable for them to require him to vvork for them, and for the Gaoler to take eight pence out of every shilling that he got, and he (the mean time) to hire men at home about his own Harvest; and told them, Houses of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (in <hi>England</hi>) vvere for such as vvas not fit to guide themselves, idle persons, and Vagrants, and not to take men from their Families and Employments, that did help carry on the common charge of the Countrey. But they vvhipt him for not vvorking; he vvas vvhipt three times in five dayes, a poor, vveak, crooked man.</p>
               <p>These Courts vvas carryed on by <hi>Simon Broadstreet,</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, Major <hi>Denison,</hi> and <hi>William Hathorne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now about six or seven Weeks after that, there vvas some of us quietly and peaceably met together to worship the Lord, and shut the door, (about a mile from the Town;) the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (and one more) came and required us to open the door, but we answered them not; so he took an Ax, and broke up the door upon us, and took notice of our Names; and soon after vvas <hi>Ipswich</hi> Court, vvhere some of our Names vvere sent in;

the Magistrates chusing out four of us, sent for us, vvho vvere carryed by the Constable thither, and vvas there apprehended for not coming to meeting to their publike Assembly, &amp; vvas fined five shillings a Week; and for meeting by our selves, vvas fined ten shillings a time; and for coming in vvith our hats on, vvas again sent to prison as <hi>Quakers,</hi> and vvhipt, and at the first entrance hardly used.</p>
               <p>Those that was committed, was <hi>Samuel Shattock, Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Philps, Josiah Buffum</hi>; &amp; continued in <hi>Ipswich</hi> Gaol about three Weeks, and three dayes, (it was then the time of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court in <hi>Boston,</hi> the second Sessions of it:) So three days after the Court began, there passed a Warrant out under <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rawson</hi>'s hand, (Secretary) to the Gaoler of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> to bring away the prisoners (that was <hi>Quakers</hi>) with speed, to deliver them up to the Master of the House of Correction in <hi>Boston,</hi> to keep in safe custody. So thither we were brought, and the same day that we were put into the Correction-House at <hi>Boston,</hi> we were called forth before the Court, [<hi>Reader,</hi> take notice that the Law that they made against <hi>Quakers,</hi> was thus exprest; <hi>That they was a cursed sect of Heretick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iring a fair hearing of things. Now when we desired a fair hearing of matters, the Magistrates that had been our former Judges, Major <hi>Denison,</hi> and <hi>Simon Broadstreet,</hi> did then the more set themselves against us, to make good their own actings towards us; but vvhen we desired a fair hearing according to the Lavv, (by which we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and held them to it, to prove us Blasphemers, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, (they could not at all prove any such thing against us) they said, We <hi>were not punished for matter of judgement, but for Fact</hi>: We desired to know what was our Fact?

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56185:23"/>
and by that did manifest our selves enemies to all Government in Church and Common-wealth.</hi> It was answered, That we sought not the hurt of any of them; &amp; for that as they called fact, their Laws had already taken hold of us by Fines; but seeing that their Lavv run upon Heresie and Blasphemy, we desired to be tryed according to it; but they would not hear us, so we were sent back to prison. Now the next day was <hi>Boston</hi>-Lecture-day, vvhereon <hi>Chansey</hi> (Master of their Colledge) preached; and seeing they could justly prove not any thing against us, (as the Law speaks) did thus deliver himself, <hi>Suppose</hi> (said he to the Magistrates) <hi>you should catch six Wolves in a Trap, you cannot prove that they have killed any Lambs, or sheep, and now you have them, they will not bark nor bite, yet they have the plain mark of Wolves; whether you would let them go, yea or nay</hi>? [There being six of us then in prison upon that account.] And this is the Doctrine of one of the false Prophets in <hi>New-England,</hi> whose hands is full of blood, and hearts full of deceit and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which the Lord sees and takes notice of.</p>
               <p>Novv vvhen they wanted to make us appear to be what was exprest in the Law, the Priests vvent thus to vvork, that seeing they could not prove that, therefore their plot was (as we heard) that on the Lecture-day the Magistrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters combining together for to call us forth, &amp; went to work; (about half an hour after we were thus informed,) So we vvere called forth, and a great company of their Teachers vvas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and the General Court made <hi>John Norton</hi> their mouth to examine us, who put questions to us, but we refused to answer him, because we referred our cause to the Court to be tryed, and he being not one of them, we was not free to give him answer; When he saw that, he then put questions in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates mouths to ask us, but durst not trust them with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of them neither; So we told the Court it was a great disparagement to them, and that they did much undervalue themselves, as if they were not wise enough to propound their own questions to us, vvithout the help of him; but he would not be put by, but put forth many subtil ensnaring questions, to catch advantage, and no Scripture-answers would in the least give him satisfaction; but he could not at all accomplish
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56185:23"/>
his ends at that time by us; so when they could not have their wills, did then address themselves by petition to the Court, (as we were informed) to forward their designs for death and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and presented particulars to the Court for tryals; so at last it was concluded by Vote among the Magistrates, that such and such persons should be banished upon pain of death, (as their Law doth express.) Now when it had thus past, it was sent to the house of Deputies, desiring their consent; but it met with hard service amongst them, for those of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst them, judged it absurd and ridiculous; but at last when it came to be voted, they that that was against it judging their side the greatest put it to Vote, and it so fell out, that there was twenty seven of them in all at that time, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen was for it, and the Speaker and twelve more was against it; one of the Deputies that was against it, was sick, he desired the Speaker to send for him when it was put to Vote, but the Speaker concluded that they should carry it without him, &amp; let him alone, &amp; the want of his Vote cast the Case, which when it was cast, the man hearing of it, was exceedingly distressed in his spirit, that his absence should occasion the passing of such an unrighteous Law.</p>
               <p>Now after this, it was in question, Whether all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Law, should go to make one transgression; but that was rejected; So that one of these (if the Judges please) may expose to death or banishment, the not coming to their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not putting off the hat to a mans equals. So the Court released us at present, onely we were to be gone by the Court of Ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion in <hi>May.</hi> Now before the conclusion, we sent into the Deputies, That seeing the chief offence was not putting off the hat, we desired to know if our punishments had not been sufficient for our offences, some of us had been twice impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ten Weeks, and twice whipt, one of us had been four times whipt; three had been tvvice imprisoned, and tvvice vvhipt, and the last time kept prisoners tvventy Weeks, that vvas Husbandmen the time of Hay and Harvest, their things lying upon spoile all the chief time of Summer, that had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cattel to look after, who was imprisoned from the first of the fifth Month, <hi>July,</hi> till towards the latter end of the ninth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56185:24"/>
Month, called <hi>November,</hi> and nothing could be charged on us, but for meetting together on the first day of the Week, and coming before them with our hats on. Now in the time of our imprisonment, one of us (<hi>Josiah Southwick</hi>) sent to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Magistrates at their meeting, &amp; desired a little liberty to go home, (his goods being on the spoile) and he would give bond to come again faithfully to the prison at their appointed time, but they denyed it.</p>
               <p>Now there was one <hi>William Marston</hi> that lived at <hi>Hampton,</hi> they finding two little Books in his House, one was <hi>John Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>'s little Book sent to his Wife from <hi>Dover-Castle,</hi> and the other was a Sheet of Paper of <hi>William Dewsberry</hi>'s, called, <hi>The mighty day of the Lord</hi>; for the vvhich they took from him ten pounds; this man withdrew from the publike meeting at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> they rated him three pounds to the Priest for his Wages, and took it violently from him, and was also fined five pounds for not coming to their Meeting, and took away a Barrel of salted Beef that he had provided to send to sea, more moneys they took from him, but the true account of all we yet had not; besides many other particulars (which would be too tedious to mention) which the Inhabitants of the <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusets</hi> endure, with what more, may be expected in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of this unjust and unrighteous Law, which if there may not be an allowance of Appeals from the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the Inhabitants, their Subjects in <hi>New-England,</hi> it's like to be a bloody time amongst us; for they have not onely combined to kill and banish amongst themselves in the <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusets,</hi> but (as we hear) have by all means used to hedge up all wayes of succor to us in the Neighbour-Collonyes, which some of them had more tenderness then themselves: But our trust is in the Most High, vvhose living presence is the fulness of all satisfaction to us in all outward straits.</p>
               <p>All these particulars have been since <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1657. to this present writing, 28. of the 9<hi>th.</hi> Month, 1658. in which time they drunk thirty and two draughts of cruel whippings of strangers and Inhabitants; and three strangers they cut their ears off: All these vvhippings and ear-cuttings, vvas done pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, in the private Prison-Houses.

Nay, though your deceit was never so apparently manifest, as now, some might be deceived, (and judge you were a pure reformed Church in the time of their ignorance) now who are but moderate, cannot but see you a synagogue of Satan, and a Cage of uncleanness, and cannot but seperate from you, as the believers did from your fore-fathers the <hi>Jews,</hi> who cryed up their Temple, and Ordinances, and Assemblies, and the Law, and yet slew the Heir, and did unto his Servants then, as you do now; and (just as they) thought they did God service if they brought them into bondage, and did kill them, and persecute them, even as you do now; I say,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56185:33"/>
they fulfil the Scripture in this, and upon that generation all the blood was required; and you are in the same footsteps; you have forgotten the Law of God, Even as you would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them, Would you be so dealt with? Would you be whipt again, and again, with knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Cords and Ropes? Would you have your houses robbed and spoiled because you go not to their Meetings? Would you be banished, and would you be put to death because you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not submit to other mens wills? Let the light in all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences answer: Well, the same measure that you have measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out to others, even the same will be measured to you. And do you think that these proceedings wil affect people to submit to your Commandments and Government? Would you have such Laws made against you, or executed upon you? If not, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of your doings, and amend your wayes; for though this may keep people in slavery a moment, yet all who fears God, or minds but the witness of God in their own consciences, they will see you, and seperate from you, and not partake with you in your evil deeds. And would you be called Magistrates for God? Then do the work of God, and abuse not your selves with mankind, and turn not your swords against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, which should be against transgressors; but you being in envy, makes Laws contrary to the Law of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the witness of God in every mans conscience, and then you cry, They have transgressed our Laws, and breaks the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56185:34"/>As for <hi>Gurden,</hi> he is manifest to be one of the same race with thee, in <hi>Cain</hi>'s way, in envie and wrath, and hath manifested his follie in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> so that all sober people abhors and detests his practises, and is counted no other then a peevish, wilful, blind, ignorant man, before whose face the fear of God is not; and his proceedings will never bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to him, but rather infamie, and reproach, and perpetual shame; and truly the least of the children of light (&amp; them that have but moderation as men) are ashamed of his practises, both superior and inferior; and thou that rejoicest and art glad of his proceedings, (and also some other whom thou writest to, which is one with thy spirit) thy rejoicing is not good, and thy joy shall be turned into mourning, and shame shall cover thy face when the Lord God of Heaven and Earth ariseth in his righteous judgement, then shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion shall cover your faces.</p>
               <p>Thou saist, <hi>They are a formidable people, and not to be neglected, for many follow their pernicious wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, They are a people whose beginning hath been but small, who hath come through great tribulation, whose end shall be great; they are the heritage whom God hath chosen to place his Name in, and to reveal his power unto, and to be witnesses of his salvation unto the ends of the Earth; and they are, and have been, and shall be a dread unto all their Enemies; and though thou maist seek to oppose, and use all thy diligence, and neglect no opportunitie to withstand them, yet it is but as if thou shouldest set Thorns and Briers in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel against the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thou saist, <hi>If the Lord hath given these Hereticks commission to kill the witnesses, they are malignant enough to make it the most direful execution that ever befel Gods people.</hi>

And in the day when he ariseth to judge all the Earth in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, he will justifie us, and clear us, and condemn thy malignity, and thy hard speeches, and vain thoughts, which lodge in thy corrupt heart, from whence all these unsavourie words hath been uttered forth; and is that <hi>New-England</hi>-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to teach persecution, that thou art so impudent to own it in words?

               <p>And (<hi>Iohn Indicot</hi>) thou saist, <hi>The quakers trouble us very much; though we cause them te be whipt, and sent away again, and again, yet they return again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:56185:38"/>Thou maist see there is another spirit in them, then was in you, when you fled from old <hi>England,</hi> (from under the Bishops) you would suffer nothing for the truth, and therefore were you given up to the same spirit that was in the persecutors here in <hi>England,</hi> this is entered into you now, and become ten fold stronger; but now he that is stronger then all hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and is coming to trouble you, and disquiet you of your rest which you have taken up in the Earth; What, hath your Gospel (and the Ministers thereof) no more strength in them to convince the gain-sayers, then gain-sayers have to seduce them that are in the truth? The daie of your trouble is come, and the beginning of sorrows is kindled upon you, &amp; a greater wo follows after; for the Rod of God is stretched out over you, and shall reach unto you, and turn your counsels back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and confound you in the midst of your combinations; Where did any Christian-Magistrates whip and imprison any for Religion's sake or conscience-sake, or cut off their Ears? Where is your Law? Did any Minister of Christ perswade the Magistrate it was lawful for him to do so? Give us some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and let us see your rule, and by what Authority you do these things, and from whence you have your Authoritie? I am sure God never authorized it, Christ, nor his Ministers, nor no Christian-Magistrate (that ruled for God) never countenanced any such thing, as to whip again, and again, to beat with Ropes till men fall down as dead, till mens flesh becomes as jelley, as some of your own Nation have said; and shall not the Saints be bold to tell you, that this is of the Devil, who was a lyar and a murderer from the beginning, in whose footsteps you are, who shall receive a reward according to your works.</p>
               <p>And thou saist, <hi>Divers of you do think, that unless the Court do make a Law to banish them, and not to return upon pain of death, this Collony will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Nay, nor then neither, though you make covenant with death, and agreement with hell, and shake hands with the Prince of darkness, your Covenant shall be broken, and your Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie disannulled, and you confounded in the midst of your counsels; What, have you your Law yet to make to serve your

turns? It seems you act not by the Law of God, (which is made alreadie) which is equal, just, and good, and is for the transgressor of Justice, Goodness, and Equity, but takes not hold upon the just, equal, nor good, but you must now have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother invented to satisfie your envious minds, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish your wicked determinations; and you that think to make a Law to banish, and to put to death, your thoughts are vain, and wicked, and God will bring them to judgement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you for them; for Christ came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them; but the Devil makes Laws to destroy, and not to save. Read your example, and let shame cover your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and astonishment fill your hearts, that you should become so brutish and vain in your thoughts, as to think to limit the Lord of Heaven and Earth. Can you command the wind that it blow not? Can you stop the bottles of heaven that they pour not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orth water? If you cannot, no more can you limit the Lord. And if you make any such Laws to banish, or put to death, it will procure the indignation and wrath of God more speedily then if the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and all the Popish Princes in the World did enter into the midst of your Land. But this is come to pass that your hypocrisie and deceit might be made manifest in the sight of the sun, and that all men may see what profession of words is without the life of Christ to rule in men. If it should have been told you (when you fled from this Nation) what you would do (in the time to come) against God and his servants, you would have said, (with <hi>Hazael) Are we Dogs</hi>? But the heart of man is deceitful, (unconverted) and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hearts hath led you aside.</p>
               <p>Thou thinkest <hi>they are the worst Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thy eye being blinded, and thy understanding darkened, and thy heart full of envy, how shouldst thou think otherwise? But thy thoughts shall be discovered to thee, and thou shalt be convinced of the evil of them.</p>
               <p>Thou saist, <hi>One (whom many think is a Iesuit) pressed for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with one of our Teachers, called Mr.</hi> Norton, <hi>but the</hi> quaker <hi>was quickly weary of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You live by your thoughts, and knows nothing; if he had

been a Jesuit, it's like he might have had more favour from you; And the Minister might be very bold, knowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand no evil was like to befall him, having the Rulers (with their Clubs) on his side; the Prison-doors, and House of Correction, readie to receive the <hi>Quakers</hi>; the Gaolers and Task Masters with their Whips, and butcherly fellows with their Knives to cut off their ears, at the pleasure and wills of a company of envious men, before whose face the fear of the Lord is not. But it is like you will make the <hi>Quaker</hi> weary soon, if he would look out at your cruelty, if you did (as sometime some of your Priests and Rulers caused to be done in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> stop Napkins in their mouths, and bound keys over their mouths that they could not speak, and boast, and say, The <hi>Quaker</hi> had nothing to answer. Well, all these things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and are written as with a Pen of Iron, and they are engraved where they shall not be blotted out, and you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred among the uncircumcised, with <hi>Mesech</hi> and <hi>Tubal,</hi> the great Princes of <hi>Gog,</hi> which makes war against the Lamb and his followers; but the Lamb and the Saints shall have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and you shall be trodden as ashes under the Toles of their feet, for they shall melt away that hate the Lord.</p>
