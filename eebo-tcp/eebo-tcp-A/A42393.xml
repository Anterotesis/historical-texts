            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT would require more time than I have at preſent to ſpare in Writing, and I fear, more than the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament Aſſembled can now well ſpare, in deliberately Reading and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all that might be ſaid on this Subject, and particularly in Replying to what has been Anſwered to a Treatiſe, Intituled, <hi>An Eſſay on the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Trade;</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof, though no Trader, has written
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97047:3"/>
on the Point, with ſo much ſolid Judgment, that he is well able to defend it, if he thinks any thing conſiderable that is offered againſt what he has laid down. My Buſineſs at preſent ſhall be only to take notice of what ſeems to carry any weight in the laſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Eſſay.</hi> In a former, Intituled, <hi>An Anſwer to a late Tract, Intituled, An Eſſay,</hi> &amp;c. the Author ingenuouſly confeſſes, in his Addreſs to the <hi>Clothiers</hi> and <hi>Weavers,</hi> That he has not ſtrength of Judgment to manage Controverſies; which he has in his Anſwer fully enough proved, tho', I think, he gives but little Proof for the Cauſe he has undertaken; and almoſt his whole Book conſiſts of Quotations out of the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> and offers of overthrowing the Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> which he intirely miſtakes. So that upon the whole, that Anſwer has little in it, as they who will take the trouble of ſedately Reading and Comparing one with the other will find. The laſt Anſwer is more regular, and looks more plauſible, but being Examined will not, I think, with ſubmiſſion, appear to carry any great weight, and will be found to contain many Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>The Author aſſerts, <hi>That it has been ſaid formerly by the Advocates for the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Trade, That their Manufactures and Toyes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97047:3"/>
were not ſpent in</hi> England, <hi>but Tranſported to Foreign Markets, and thereby occaſioned the Importation of more Bullion than ever was Exported; and that therefore that Trade was no damage to</hi> England; <hi>but that the Truth is now owned, That half of the ſaid Goods are conſumed at Home, which,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>was formerly denyed.</hi> But he ought to have given more Proof thereof then only ſaying ſo, before he had grounded ſuch an inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereon; as if what is ſaid in Defence of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade needed to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Falſities. For my part, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there has been no other Argument made uſe of in its behalf, but what was then, and is ſtill true, That the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is the means of bringing much more Bullion into <hi>England</hi> than it carries out; which I ſhall indeavour to prove. And I muſt deny what he aſſerts alſo in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That the <hi>India</hi> Manufactured Goods do hinder the Conſumption of what are Fabrickt by our own People to that degree, or in that ſenſe, which he ſuggeſts. But with the Author I do agree, That the Landed Men are more concerned in this Conteſt than the <hi>Weavers:</hi> For if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Prohibition paſs it will only inrich a few Maſter <hi>Silk Weavers,</hi> and their Factors, and at the ſame time take away the Means
<pb facs="tcp:97047:4"/>
of Increaſing the Stock of the Nation, which alone can raiſe the Value of the Lands of <hi>England.</hi> I go on therefore to conſider the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Anſwer, <hi>pa</hi> 4. finds fault with the Computation of our Exports to <hi>India,</hi> and the Profit upon the Returns, and offers another Account, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very Erroneous, at leaſt it is far from warranting the Concluſion he draws, <hi>That this Trade has exhauſted</hi> 400000 l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>of our Treaſure, pa.</hi> 6. which ſhall be examined preſently; in the mean time, I can by no means agree with him, That nothing is the Treaſure of a Nation but Gold and Silver. The Treaſure of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only conſiſts in Money, but in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys worth. Silver and Gold ſerve as the meaſure of other Commodities, and is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable only in proportion to them. Jewels, Lead, Tin, Iron, Silks, Woollen Goods, Shipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be Valued accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their worth; that is, what they would yield in Money; and all go to make up the Riches and Stock of a Nation. The Nation that has in it Five Millions of Pounds Sterling Silver, and Ten Millions worth of any Goods or Commodities whatſoever one Year, and the next Year ſhall have Eight Millions of Money, and but Four Millions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97047:4"/>
worth of Goods, is poorer the laſt Year than the former, by Three Millions. If it were as the Anſwerer ſays, <hi>That Goods are not the Riches of a Nation, till by Exportation to Foreign Countries they are converted into Gold and Silver.</hi> No more then is Money Riches; for you are not ſure you ſhall purchaſe with that whatever you have occaſion for. There is no other uſe of Riches but to purchaſe what ſerves our Neceſſity and Delight, or to enable us to preſerve our Poſſeſſions when they are gotten; and ſome Goods are more acceptable in ſome Countries, at ſome times, than Money, and therefore are as well adapted to anſwer the aforeſaid ends, tho' as the Author ſayes, they are not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for Trade; and whether they are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable or not, their Value is according to what they will yield in Money.</p>
            <p>I think it does not concern the Truth of the Propoſition, That the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is Beneficial to the Nation, (though as to the <hi>quantum</hi> it may) whether the Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Eſſay</hi> be exact or no, nor to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Grounds of the Anſwerers Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; though, by the way, I muſt note, that the laſt Anſwerer, <hi>pa.</hi> 7. as well as the former, <hi>pa</hi> 14. quite miſtakes, in ſaying the <hi>Eſſay</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That the Nation did increaſe in Riches from</hi> Anno 1656 <hi>to</hi> Anno 1688, <hi>Two
<pb facs="tcp:97047:5"/>
Millions</hi> per Annum; and upon that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake both ſeem to triumph: But if they had peruſed the ſaid Treatiſe more carefully, they would have found, that the Author of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> only ſayes, <hi>That he believes from about</hi> Anno 1656 <hi>to</hi> Anno 1688, <hi>this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has every Year gradually increaſed in Riches:</hi> And that <hi>about</hi> Anno 1688, <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and addition to the Wealth and general Stock of</hi> England, <hi>ariſing from Foreign Trade and Home Manufactures, was at leaſt Two Millions Yearly:</hi> Which intimates only that about that time there was ſuch an Increaſe, and not Yearly from <hi>Anno</hi> 1656. So that all the Anſwerer ſayes, on that Miſtaken Head, falls to the Ground.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore leave both the Accounts, becauſe I think the certainty of the Sum does not ſo much concern the Point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as the Proportion; and I will take the Matter both wayes: Firſt, Suppoſe that One Thouſand Pounds be ſent out to <hi>India</hi> ⅛ to ¼ part in Goods, it will be allow'd me on all hands, that the Value of about Four Thouſand Pounds, that is, Four for One more or leſs, ſhall be Returned in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If all theſe ſhould be ſpent at Home, yet is not the Thouſand Pounds loſt to <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the ſaid Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſerve in the room, either of others that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97047:5"/>
are much dearer made at Home, and muſt elſe have been uſed in their ſtead, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>European</hi> Countries, which alſo come much dearer: So that here is Three Fourth Parts Additional Return, out of which the Shipping, and Proviſion, and Furniture, and Seamens Wages, and others employed therein, the Cuſtoms and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus is a clear Advantage to the Nation. But to this the Anſwerer, and others, who plead for the Prohibition, ſay, <hi>What Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities are ſpent in the Nation, add nothing to its Stock:</hi> And at the ſame time acknowledge, That what is ſpent at Home of our Manufacture adds nothing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Nations Stock; which is true: Only ſay they, <hi>By wearing your own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture you employ your own People.</hi> But if the Caſe be, as is owned by all, that we want People for our Work; and not Work for our People, then the bringing in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Manufactures at half the Price we can make them here at Home, whilſt at the ſame time we can find Imployment for our People, we by that Means ſave ſo much Money. This I take to be very clear. And the only Queſtion is then, What other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment we have for our People? And the Anſwerer ſayes in <hi>pa.</hi> 24. and again in <hi>pa.</hi> 31. that it ſhould have been told: Whereas
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97047:6"/>
the <hi>Eſſay, pag.</hi> 36, 37. does give ſufficient Hints, to which I ſhall add, That we want Seamen, we want Hands in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> we want Husbandmen, we want many more Hands in the Woollen Manufacture that it might be wrought Cheaper, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to ſuch a degree as it is capable to be improved; and the Linnen Manufacture which the Anſwerer thinks may do well here in time will employ more hands; not to mention the Fiſhery and other things.</p>
            <p>That there are many <hi>Weavers</hi> now that want work, I believe, and ſo there is of many other Trades: This tedious War falls heavier upon ſome than others, and when Perſons enter into a Trade they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take their Fortune in it. Some thrive moſt in time of Peace, and ſome in time of War. But what was it increaſed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Weavers</hi> ſo much? Was it not a good Trade which they had even at the time when <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods came in in greateſt plenty, and were ſold at half the Price they now are, as the Anſwerer alſo owns <hi>pag.</hi> 33. and did not the Trade viſibly fall off laſt Summer, when there was the greateſt Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods that has been known for many Years? The Seamen who have encreaſed in their numbers this War time, when it is over, may as well Mutiny if
<pb facs="tcp:97047:6"/>
Goods and Paſſengers are permitted to come and go by Land Carriage, and not by Sea; or that one fourth part of their number in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships are by the Act of Navigation allowed to be Foreigners, becauſe they are now become Seamen, and when Peace comes there may not be employment for them all, and ſome muſt ſtarve, or turn their Hands to ſomething elſe, but this complaint I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would not be countenanced, and it ſeems as unreaſonable now upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and uneaſineſs of the <hi>Weavers</hi> to Ruin a great number of People whoſe live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood depends not only on the fetching and vending theſe <hi>India</hi> Goods, but in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manufacturing them here at home for their ſake and advantage whoſe preſent want of Work, is apparently not occaſion'd by the late coming in of <hi>India</hi> Goods, but by the dearneſs of Silk, the alteration of the Coyn, and Calamities of the War, and the Diſtreſs brought upon a great many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by it. This as to what <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods are ſpent at Home.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Computation of what <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods are Exported to Foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, whether it be one half or no is not much material: All Merchants know that a conſiderable quantity goes abroad, and even to <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, though they, as we, do not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97047:7"/>
openly permit them to be brought in by any other Nation than their own. In this Caſe then, if only one quarter part goes abroad, that being the prime coſt in <hi>India</hi> upon the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſuppoſition; the other three fourths remaining to be ſpent in <hi>England</hi> is clear gains to the Nation, and the hands that would have been employed to make ſuch things as are ſupplyed by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, by that means are or might be uſed in other Work, which turns to the Profit of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerer ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. That it does not appear that 200000 <hi>l.</hi> worth <hi>per annum</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods were ever Exported to <hi>Spain,</hi> or any Country from whence we uſually Import Bullion; and thereby ſeems to inſinuate as if it were not the ſame thing whether we ſend them to <hi>Spain</hi> from whence Bullion comes, or to <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>France</hi> from whence it comes more ſeldom: But ſurely he underſtands that our general ballance of Trade and the Profit made by it, is to be made as the general Ballance of a Private Trader. If by the Courſe of our Trade to <hi>Holland,</hi> we take more Goods than we ſend, and ſo want Money there, we muſt ſend the ballance from hence in <hi>Specie,</hi> or have it remitted thither from <hi>Spain</hi> or ſome other parts where we have Effects. So that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97047:7"/>
if upon the general Trade of <hi>England</hi> to all Parts, we Export a greater value then we Import, the reſt comes in in Bullion; and on the contrary, if our Imports exceed our Exports, the ballance muſt be ſent out in Money. So that let our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods be ſent to what place ſoever, their produce will be anſwered to us in Money at long run, if our other Trades do not require that Money abroad; for all Goods now in all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> are ſold for Money. And if I ſend <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods to <hi>Holland,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Money for them, and may bring it over if I will; but if others upon their Trade for Goods from thence, or the King for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army, want the Money there, I deliver it to them, and receive it here; and to this purpoſe ſerves the <hi>Exchange.</hi> I think what has been ſaid, clearly removes the Objections <hi>pag.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerers, I think, both miſtake the <hi>Eſſay</hi> as to the Profit made by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, which they ſeem to take as meant ſo much Profit to the Company, whereas it is plain it is intended ſo much advance to the Nation; as in the ſaid <hi>Eſſay, pag.</hi> 52. it is expreſſed, That into that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance comes in the King for his Cuſtoms, Owners of Ships, ſuch as got by Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, Seamen for Wages, and laſtly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97047:8"/>
Factors and Servants both Abroad and at Home. And ſo diſtinguiſhes between the Gain made by the Company, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to the Nation. So that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers Obſervations drawn from thence are to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerers and Favourers of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition make a great cry, as if the Woollen Manufacture is prejudiced by theſe Goods; whereas the Woollen Manufacture has great advantage by it on ſundry Accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A great quantity of Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, and our Native Product, is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> and at <hi>China,</hi> which is a cold Country, they like our Woollen Goods, and the Expence thereof is like greatly to encreaſe, if we our ſelves be not the hinderance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It keeps the Workers of Wooll to their own Employment, which they would elſe in probability leave, and turn to the Silk-Weaving Trade as ſome have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Freedom of Trade here cauſes Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Flock into <hi>England,</hi> whereby the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our own Product and Manufacture is increaſed: Our Wooll needs not Fall to nothing as the Anſwerer ſays, <hi>Page</hi> 17. to keep on our Woollen Manufactury, but Wooll may bear a good Price, if the working it up be Cheap as it ought to be, and as every
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97047:8"/>
one agrees, and as the Committee of Trade in their anſwer to the Honourable Houſe of Commons have very well obſerved, and then there's no fear of looſing our Woollen Manufactury, but I am afraid that will not be the way to have Wooll wrought up cheap to employ the Hands that ſhould do it, in other Manufactures, and it is a ſign we want people and not work, ſince the price of Labour and Servants Wages is no where in <hi>Europe</hi> ſo dear as in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwerer by what he ſaid, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. about Wooll led me to that head before it came regularly on according to the Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Order and Method, but this was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned a full, exact, and methodical Diſcourſe for the reaſons mentioned at the beginning. However I ſhall not need to repeat any thing, only ſhall further add, That when thoſe who are of Opinion with me ſay, <hi>That it is not the Intereſt of the Landed Gentlemen that Wooll ſhould be dear;</hi> the Anſwerer, as many others have done, miſtook, when they ſuggeſt, that we do not think it moſt for the advantage of land for Wooll to be dear, if the expence would continue as great and the Price keep up, but our meaning is that it is not the Intereſt of Landed Men to raiſe their Wooll for a Year or two to a High Price, whereby the Expence would be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97047:9"/>
becauſe the Conſequence would be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that then it would fall much lower than before; and therefore all that is intended by not deſiring Wooll to be dear is, that it is beſt to be kept at ſuch a moderate Price as may not diſcourage the Working it up; and that being Wrought up, it might come ſo Cheap to Foreign Markets, that others might not under-ſell us, and ſo leſſen its future Vent.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerer is miſtaken in his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>pa.</hi> 21. <hi>That the generality of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants will own that they have not got by Trading in Woollen Goods for theſe Thirty Years paſt</hi> 6 per Cent. per Annum, <hi>the Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Adventures paid:</hi> The contrary whereof many Merchants know; and greater Profit might be made thereby, if our Wooll was Manufactured Cheaper: and the way to have that done, is not to draw off our People from that Imployment to other Manufactures: For, the Poor, if Two Dayes work will maintain them, will not work Three: And our Manufactures are never ſo well Wrought as in a time of dull Trade, when we pay leſs for Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and yet the Poor live as well then as in time of greateſt Plenty, if they have but a full ſtroke of Work. And it is too true what an Advocate for the <hi>Weavers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97047:9"/>
confeſſed before the Honourable Houſe of Commons, <hi>That in times of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (which is when the Price of Work is high) <hi>they will ſpend the more in Drinking, and thereby indeed increaſe the Kings Revenue,</hi> whatever the other ill Conſequences of it are.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerer <hi>pa.</hi> 21. deſires to know in what places we can conſume more Woollen Goods Abroad; and I muſt acquaint him that very often in <hi>Germany, Holland, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Spain, Italy</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> our Woollen Goods are ſcarce, and therefore ſold dear, and much more would vend if they were upon the place, and yet more conſiderable quantities if we could afford them Cheaper; which might be done by the Method the Author of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> propoſes, <hi>pa.</hi> 27. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Anſwerer ſayes, <hi>pa.</hi> 21. <hi>That the Manufactures of VVooll are increaſed in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland, France, Germany, Spain, <hi>and</hi> Portugal, <hi>and our Manufactured Goods become a Drugg beyond Sea.</hi> It is more than probable that the taking off our People from the Woollen Manufactury to other Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, has been in a great meaſure the occaſion of it. I confeſs I wonder to find the Anſwerer call it a Project, to work up our Woollen Manufactures Cheap, and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97047:10"/>
doubt whether that would increaſe their Expence Abroad, to the leſſening of that of other Nations. I wiſh there had been no more uncertain Projects ſet on foot in Trade in this Kingdom, and then, I am apt to think, our Trade would have been in a better condition. I think the Project of Ruining immediately a great number of Tradeſmen, and others, that depend upon the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, and putting the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to 3 or 400000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> certain greater Expence then at preſent it is at, and running the hazard of loſing all, or the greateſt part of our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, only to imploy People at Home in a Silk Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury that would be with more Profit to the Nation imployed in the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, is by far the more dangerous and doubtful Project. The Inſtance which the Anſwerer brings, <hi>pa.</hi> 23. of a Country Gentleman that hath all Conveniences about his Houſe of his own, and ſhould inſtead of uſing them for himſelf and Family, ſend his Money to Market to buy, and then ſend his Products Abroad in hopes of making Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of them, though he do not know of any Market or Buyer for them, will prove juſt the contrary of what he intends it for, if it be rightly applyed to our Caſe; for it is certainly the Country Gentlemans Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97047:10"/>
ſo to do, if he can buy at Market what will ſerve himſelf and Family for half the Money for which he can ſell his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts; which is plainly our Caſe: For we never want ſome Price or other for our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Manufacture. And if we can ſell them dearer to others then we can in their room purchaſe other Neceſſaries, it is a clear Profit to us.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerer does again, <hi>pa.</hi> 23, 24. as he often does beg the Queſtion, when he ſayes, <hi>That we ſpend</hi> Indian <hi>Goods at Home that we may ſave our Woollen Goods to have the more for Exportation.</hi> We ſay that the <hi>Indian</hi> Goods do very little interfere with our Woollen Manufacture; and by the bringing in of <hi>Indian</hi> Goods more of our Woollen Manufacture, which goes towards the Purchaſing of them, is conſumed, then would be at Home in their ſtead: And the Anſwerer himſelf, <hi>pa.</hi> 25. acknowledges, that the Conſumption of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth was never underſtood to be much prejudiced by theſe Goods. And then again he takes up the Miſtake of very great Gain made by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, taking it in another ſenſe then the <hi>Eſſay</hi> intends; and his Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions drawn from thence need not therefore to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97047:11"/>
The Anſwerer, <hi>pa.</hi> 25. and elſewhere, ſeems angry, without Reaſon, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are quoted in this Controverſie. Tho' they are our Allies, they alone are our chief Competitors in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade: And if they never had done any thing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant us in any part of our Trade, we ſhould have the leſs Reaſon to be jealous; but ſince their and our Intereſt in Trade is diſtinct, if not oppoſite, I think he ſhows himſelf no great Friend to <hi>England</hi> that will not calmly admit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to argue on that Head; and it is ſo natural and neceſſary a Conſideration to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all Foreign Trade, that I wonder any one ſhould be frightned at the mention of it, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer ſeems to be, <hi>pa.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſecond Head, <hi>pa.</hi> 26, 27. the Anſwerer again miſtakes the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> when he ſayes, <hi>Silks and Linnen Manufactured in</hi> India <hi>are no more the genuine Off-ſpring of this Kingdom, than our Silks and Linnen Manufactured at Home:</hi> For I take that to be a Miſtake in any one that writes, when by his Anſwer he perverts the deſign and meaning of him he anſwers. The <hi>Eſſay</hi> did not, as it ſeems plain to me, intend to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Silks to <hi>Indian</hi> Silks, as if the latter were more the genuine Off-ſpring of this Nation than the former, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
<pb facs="tcp:97047:11"/>
ſeems to take it; but he oppoſes <hi>Engliſh</hi> Silks and Linnen to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufacture, and thence argues, with great Reaſon, that the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ought above, and before all other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures to be encouraged.</p>
            <p>How it can ruin young Gentlemen (as the Anſwerer alledges, <hi>pa.</hi> 28) to ſpend Foreign Product that coſt them but half the Price, rather than our own, which coſts at leaſt double, I own is a Paradox to me; and I think there is nothing of boldneſs in the attempt, to perſwade the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do the like, whilſt our own will find vent Abroad, and our People Imployment enough at Home, as they may certainly do</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pa.</hi> 28. and 29. Again he falls to arguing upon his old Miſtake, of the Gains of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, being 300 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and asks why the Author of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> does no propoſe the opening the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade A Subject he was not upon. I may as well ask, why the Anſwerer does not in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe give Arguments to oppoſe a General Naturalization, if he thinks our People want work.</p>
            <p>What the Anſwerer ſayes about the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Manufacture, <hi>pa.</hi> 30. I paſs over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not lengthen out this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and cannot allow what he ſayes
<pb facs="tcp:97047:12"/>
               <hi>pa.</hi> 31. <hi>That the original or chief cauſe or means of Riches muſt be from the Labour of our People.</hi> By which, without doubt, he means the Labour of the Hand; for it is evident, that a People may grow Rich without much of ſuch Labour. It is the Product of the Earth, and the well and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Management of Trade in and to Foreign Parts that is a means and great means of inriching a Nation. I confeſs if a Nation be well Peopled, imploying the Poor in Manufactures rather than to live in Idleneſs is an addition to the Riches of a Nation: for what any one, or any number of Perſons get more than they ſpend, adds ſo much to the Stock and Riches of the Nation: And if 10000 People living in <hi>England</hi> could get more at the Years end by driving a Trade from <hi>Holland</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Country</hi> and back to <hi>Holland,</hi> then the ſame 10000 People could get by Working, or Manufacture, it is more the Intereſt of the Nation, and a greater increaſe to its Riches, that theſe People continue that Foreign Trade (whilſt their Gains come over to <hi>England,</hi> as it muſt do) then to imploy them in Manufactures. Nay, if they Trade on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Money, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> (if I may not offend the Anſwerer with naming them) will find at the winding up their Account,
<pb facs="tcp:97047:12"/>
that the Money they have during this War ſent over hither, and Lent the Government, and otherwiſe, at exceſſive Intereſt, will bring a conſiderable addition to the Riches of their State without the Exporting their Product for it, or the Labour of their People.</p>
            <p>What the Anſwerer argues under the Third Head, I think has not much in it, only the continual cry of ſending out Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> which is taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of before; and he, or any other, that will take the pains but to make up an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in Figures (and not looſely in their Heads by ſpeculation, which cauſes many Miſtakes) will find that 10000 <hi>l.</hi> ſent out in Specie to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and Returned in Goods to the value of 40 or 50000 <hi>l.</hi> and thoſe Goods Exported, or but one quarter part of them (though much more of them are ſent out) and the reſt uſed here at Home in the room of others to be Imported from Abroad, or in the room of others made here in <hi>England,</hi> whilſt our Hands may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imployed than in the Silk Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as certainly they may, though our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were double. I ſay, they will find that this is a certain Increaſe, even to the Money in Specie to the Nation. But it has been aſſerted in Tracts concerning this matter,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97047:13"/>
and the truth is as has been before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Importation of theſe <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Silks for wear in <hi>England,</hi> as well as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, has bettered the Trade of the <hi>Silk-Weavers,</hi> by lowering the Price of Silk, and whetting their Induſtry and Inventions, and on many other Accounts. But this, and many Arguments brought on the ſide of thoſe who are againſt a Prohibition, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party are pleaſed to take no notice of.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerer commends the frugality of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and no doubt it is a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, but where People grow Rich, they will ſpend more largely, and it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſhould do ſo than to ſlacken their Induſtry and Diligence in Trade. When the <hi>Dutch</hi> come once to enjoy their great Increaſe in a long Peace, you will find them extravagant in one kind of Expence or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as well as other Nations, but it would ſwell this beyond my intention to inlarge on this Head, therefore I will only add, that in diſcourſing of this the Anſwerer I think would have done well to have told what the <hi>Eſſay</hi> deſires to know why upon the ſame, and much ſtronger Reaſons we don't prohibit Wine, Fruit, Spice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but indeed three quarter parts of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there ſet down are left unanſwered, and therefore I ſhall not I hope be blamed in not
<pb facs="tcp:97047:13"/>
Replying particularly to every Paſſage in the Anſwer, though I think whatever is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial will have been Conſidered in what has been ſaid before, and what will be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd before I end.</p>
            <p>The Anſwerer again <hi>Page,</hi> 56, 57. again aſſerts what he ſhould have proved, that we ſend out 600000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in Bullion, and it has never yet been made out that thoſe Goods bring us back again in Bullion the Vallue of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> and then Argues upon it; whereas all Traders in the Exportation of <hi>India</hi> Goods know the Fact to be quite otherwiſe, and therefore not to ſwell this too much I ſhall only add ſome Articles which the Oppoſers of this Prohibition offered to the moſt Honourable Houſe of Lords to prove upon Oath before them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between what part of them the <hi>Weavers</hi> Advocates in their Printed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer allowed, and what part they Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, though the Perſons Concerned are yet ready to prove and make out the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That near half the Wollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture ſent to <hi>India,</hi> is vended at <hi>China, Surrat, Fort St. George,</hi> and the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Bengal,</hi> as well as at <hi>Perſia,</hi> and is uſed for Covering of Rooms, Tents, Covers for Camels, and abundance of other uſes, as well as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:97047:14"/>
And that the <hi>Indians</hi> like our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture ſo well, that the Vent thereof is Daily increaſing, and the Goods propoſed to be Prohibited, are in great part the Product of the ſaid Woollen Manufacture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Value of One Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> per Annum, <hi>in Woollen Manufacture, and other the product of</hi> England, <hi>has actually been Exported to</hi> India.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That a great Quantity of Money is ſent to <hi>Turkey</hi> to help off our Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, as well as to <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That in</hi> Holland <hi>there are many more Looms going than in</hi> England, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have a Manufacture of their own much nearer to the <hi>Indian</hi> than we, yet they not only Import theſe Goods from <hi>India</hi> themſelves, but permit them to be Imported into <hi>Holland</hi> from all other Parts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Weavers</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> ſome Years ſince, Petitioned the <hi>States</hi> to make ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition as is Propoſed here: But upon a full Hearing of the Matter, it was rejected.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the <hi>French</hi> have mightily Courted the Trade from <hi>India,</hi> and Settled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Trading thither, with great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and in <hi>France</hi> theſe Goods are every where Publickly Sold and Worn: <hi>So that either there is no ſuch Edict in</hi> France, <hi>as is pretended, or it is Diſpenſed withal, or ſome New Edict has been ſince emitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:97047:14"/>
7. That the <hi>Weavers</hi> had a good Trade here in <hi>England,</hi> and increaſed in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whilſt theſe <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods came over in greateſt plenty, and when they were ſold at half the Prices they are now at; and there is at preſent a Duty of 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon them more than was then.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That it is not the Importation of theſe Goods which decays their Trade,</hi> if it be Bad, but the Calamity of the War, Alteration of the Coyn, and Scarcity of Money, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually affects other Trades. For that upon the Alteration of the Coyn, our <hi>Weavers</hi> Goods fell in their Prizes, and their Work fell off; whilſt at the ſame time <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce, grew dearer and dearer.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>That at this preſent Time, at</hi> Norwich <hi>they begin to have a brisk Trade, and their Goods are Riſen</hi> 10 per Cent. <hi>lately, and in great Demand,</hi> notwithſtanding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies late Sale of <hi>Silks,</hi> which they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>That though</hi> Mercers <hi>beſpeak Goods of the</hi> Weavers, <hi>the</hi> Weavers <hi>will not make them,</hi> but keep their Men out of Work, that they may Clamour for this Bill.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>That it is only the</hi> Silk-Weavers <hi>that are concerned in this Matter, and not the</hi> Staple VVoollen-Manufactury, which this Bill will rather leſſen and obſtruct than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote:
<pb facs="tcp:97047:15"/>
So that the Clamour about the <hi>Woollen</hi> Manufacture is all out of doors in this Caſe. For if this Bill paſs, many <hi>Weavers</hi> of <hi>Wooll</hi> would turn to be <hi>Silk-Weavers,</hi> as ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>That the</hi> Weavers <hi>concerned in this Affair are nothing near ſo Numerous as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:</hi> And, That the <hi>Linnen-Drapers,</hi> and other Trades depending thereon, who would be Hurt by this Prohibition, are as Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, as thoſe who would receive Benefit by it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That the <hi>Indian Wrought Silks</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much Improved here by a further Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing; and great Numbers of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Employed therein.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>That the Poverty and Miſery amongſt the</hi> Weavers <hi>is very much miſrepreſented;</hi> and that it is no greater, in proportion, with them, than amongſt other ſort of poor Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That notwithſtanding all, the Maſter <hi>Weavers</hi> have in few Years laſt paſt got great Eſtates, and continue to Thrive well.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>That if</hi> Eaſt-India Silks <hi>are Prohibited, and not thoſe from</hi> Holland, France <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>and other Parts, We ſhall only Wear the latter in the room of the former,</hi> to the far greater Expence of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:97047:15"/>
17. That if this Bill paſs, theſe Goods will be made and imitated in <hi>Holland</hi> ſo like, that it will be impoſſible (when Sold here) for the <hi>Drapers</hi> to prove they are not <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That great Quantities of theſe Goods are ſold for Exportation to <hi>Cadiz, Lisbon,</hi> the <hi>Canaries, Mader as,</hi> and other Foreign Parts, under the Value of 50 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. That if this Bill paſs for Prohibiting the Selling and Wearing <hi>Perſian Silks,</hi> it is probable the <hi>Perſians</hi> will Prohibit Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactury, which will not only affect the <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That a Ship lately in <hi>China</hi> could not put off our Manufactury without taking their Manufacture: And that if this Bill paſſes, we ſhall probably loſe the Trade for <hi>Saltpetre,</hi> as well as the other part of the Trade to <hi>India.</hi>

            <p>I would not alter any thing from theſe Articles as they were deliver'd to the Lords and offered to be proved, only in the ſecond, after <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> is added, <hi>And other the Product of</hi> England, which was by overſight omitted before, but alters not the Caſe, for that <hi>Tin, Lead,</hi> and ſuch like is as well a Manufacture of <hi>England</hi> as Woollen Goods; and you have the Articles, or ſuch part of them as the Friends of the Bill in their Printed Paper deny, Printed in an <hi>Italic</hi>
