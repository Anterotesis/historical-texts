         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THat Poetry and Musick, the chief manifesters of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical Phancy, should produce such discordant effects in many, is more to be pityed than wonder'd at; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become a kind of fashionable wit, to Peck and Carp at other Mens conceptions, how mean soever their own are. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting therefore to fall under the Lash of some soft headed, or hard hearted Composer (for there are too many better at finding of faults then mending them) I shall endeavour to remove those few blocks which perhaps they may take occasion to stumble at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first may be the Title,</hi> OPERA. <hi>To this I must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That the word is borrowed of the</hi> Italian; <hi>who by it, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish their Comedies from their</hi> Opera's; <hi>Those, a short Plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid, the Comedians according to their different Theams given, Speak, and Act</hi> Extempore; <hi>but these after much consideration, industry and pains for splendid Scenes and Machines to Illustrate the Grand Design, with Art are composed in such kinds of Musick as the Subject requires: and accordingly performed. Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to which are these Compositions (the Reader being referr'd to the Book of the whole work for the particular Excellencies) Their nature for the most part being soft, easie, and, as far as my ability could reach, agreeable to the design of the Author: for in them you have from Ballad to single Air, Counterpoint, Recitative, Fuge, Canon, and Chromatick Musick; which variety (without vanity be it said) was never in Court or Theatre till now presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Nation: though I must confess there has been something</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94925:4"/>
               <hi>done, (and more by me than any other) of this kind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may justly wear the Title, though all the Tragedy be not in Musick: for the Author prudently consider'd, that though</hi> Italy <hi>was, and is the great Academy of the World for that Science and way of Entertainment,</hi> England <hi>is not: and therefore mixt it with interlocutions, as more proper to our</hi> Genius.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another may be,</hi> The extream Compass of some of the parts. <hi>To which, the Idols of their own imagination may be pleas'd (if possible) to know, that he who Composes for Voices, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their extent, is like a Botching Stult, who being obliged to make Habits for men, cuts them out for Children. I</hi> suppose <hi>it needs no Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next may be,</hi> The extravagancies in some parts of the Composition, <hi>wherein (as among slender Grammarians) they may think fix'd rules are broken: but they may be satisfied, that whatever appears so, is only by way of Transition from Time or half-Time Concords, and cover'd by the extream Parts: or to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Ear and Judgement, for satisfying both in the Cadence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then, against the performance,</hi> They sing out of Tune. <hi>To which with modesty it may be answer'd,</hi> He or she that is without fault may cast the first Stone: <hi>and for those seldom defects, the major part of the Vocal performers being ignorant of Musick, their Excellencies when they do well, which generally are so, rather ought to be admired, then their accidental mistakes upbraided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next (and I hope the last) is, or may be,</hi> Why after so long expos'd, is it now Printed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, to manifest my duty to several persons of Honour, who expected it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, to satisfie those Lovers and Understanders of Musick, whose business or distance prevent their seeing and hearing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that those for whom it was Compos'd (tho perchance ignorant of the Quality) by the quantity may be convinc'd, the Composing and Teaching it was not in a Dream; and consequently,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94925:4"/>
               <hi>that if the</hi> Expence <hi>they have been at, do not answer their big Expectation, the fault's their own, not mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, (by way of Caution) to prevent what differences may happen between them, and whoever they may have occasion to imploy for the future, that on either side there be no dependance on good Words or Generosity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Instrumental Musick before and between the Acts, and the Entries in the Acts of</hi> Psyche <hi>are omitted by the consent of their Author,</hi> Seignior Gio. Baptista Draghi. <hi>The Tunes of the Entries and Dances in the</hi> Tempest <hi>(the Dancers being chang'd) are omitted for the same reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Errata's in this Impression, which are not many, the Printer desires pardon for, it being his first attempt in this kind; and hopes if it fall into ingenious hands they'l Correct them: and is confident what he shall undertake for the future, shall be as free from Mistakes, as any thing that has hitherto been published.</p>
