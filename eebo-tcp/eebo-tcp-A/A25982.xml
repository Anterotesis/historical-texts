            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a truth in it ſelf, and very obvious to knowing men, that the uſe of language is for the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our conceptions; and that theſe are cauſed by exteriour objects, which are oftentimes ſuch, as do cauſe ſo violent an agitation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we may with but little skill in Phiſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſee the <hi>Tipes</hi> and <hi>Signatures</hi> of mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in their Countenances, and aſſure our ſelves of a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt from their faces, when their paſſions are moved (which do alwayes faithfully more or leſs imprint their characters in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts of the body) then we may expect from their tongues, which can cover the deceiptfulnes of a falſe heart, when yet the viſage diſcovers its motions and deſignes; for if a mans ſpeech belye his heart, yet his face ſhall belye his ſpeech, and the underſtanding can never ſo ſecretly work, but the ſences will perceive it: I may not but conjecture that Doctor <hi>Hamond</hi> is better learned in this kinde of ſcience then my ſelf, having vantage ground of me in years, ſtudy and experience, and yet he hath gone farther in diſcovering himſelf, and his paſſions then thus, in his Vindication againſt <hi>E. P.</hi> and (contrary to his profeſſed impaſſionateneſs) hath ſo far betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, as to tranſmit the Image and Character of the perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and paſſionate heat of his ſpirit, by his <hi>Pen,</hi> to the view of the world, as his ſaid Vindication will manifeſtly teſtify.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh this <hi>parti-coloured</hi> Doctor (that doth thus interlace excellent profeſſions with ſo little adequateneſs of performance <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

               <hi>words of Moſes in Terminis, Exod.</hi> 21. 6. but whether they do not widely <hi>range</hi> from them, I refer it to any man that hath his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding about him upon compare, to judge; I conceived this Doctors affirmation to be but his <hi>explication</hi> of that place, and beleeve the impartiall examiner of both places will eaſily finde it ſo; and I muſt tell this Doctor for all this, that he will alone lye under <hi>that Condemnation</hi> which, ſaith he, in his fifth Section, <hi>E. P. hath put him, and the Scripture under,</hi> too good a Companion to be of that mans ſide, that made and publiſhed the late <hi>Miſterium Religionis recognitum,</hi> which goodly ſtuff came out of this Doctors ware-houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond advantage is not onely as imaginary as the other, but palpably falſe and ſcandalous, contrary to the Candidneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuitie of a rationall man: 'This Doctor ſaith that <hi>E. P.</hi> hath two irreconſilable opinions <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. of his vindicacion: 1. Opinion, That it ſhould be unlawfull for the <hi>Iew</hi> to give up his liberty or freedome, and that ſervitude ſhould be unnaturall. Secondly, That it ſhould be in a mans own power to kill himſelf; I am aſtoniſhed that any man who hath his eyes in his head, or any conſcience to check him, or any ſencible movement of reaſon in him, ſhould affirm ſuch an <hi>untruth</hi> of <hi>E. P.</hi> Let this Doctor indigitate the place, and ſhew them <hi>in verbâ,</hi> if he can; but that the reader may know the truth, there is no <hi>ſuch</hi> opinions in <hi>E. P.</hi> his diſcourſe; and it is hoped this Doctor may receive credit according to the truth of what he affirms here, in whatſoever elſe he hath and ſhall have to repreſent to the world hereafter, who (it ſeemes) will leave no way unaſſayed, that may (right or wrong) promote the wicked diſigne of his party: I ſhall eaſily beleeve henceforward he may be ſo plyable a Courtier, as if his King or his party ſhall ſay it is night at highnoone, he will not ſtick to maintaine it; or if any ſhould be ſo ventrous as to deny it, that he is ſo cunning as to have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for himſelf, as to ſay he hath miſtaken the Moon for the Sun, yet I do not ſee for all his art, but he will have a long voyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come to the end of his expectation, by ſuch ſhamefull and unworthy ſtaining of his Antagoniſts.</p>
            <p>But for the firſt of theſe opinions he mentions, doth he not finde the contrary in <hi>E. P. pag.</hi> 18. and 19. and doth he not cite <hi>E. P.</hi> his opinion in <hi>page</hi> II. and <hi>Section</hi> 28. of his vindicacion, in theſe words: <q>
                  <hi>That God doth not allow any to take away mans life,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40106:5"/>
but thoſe whom he makes Gods (i. e.) Magiſtrates:</hi>
               </q> ſufficient to excuſe <hi>E. P.</hi> from this part of the Doctors charge, who with the ſame breath and pen he hath aſperſed that Author, doth (as you ſee) proclaime his innocency to the world; and for the other opinion charged upon the Author of <hi>E. P.</hi> That it was unlawfull for the <hi>Jew</hi> to paſs away his freedome, &amp;c. it is likewiſe denied by that Author; and this Doctor (who is his accuſer) cites alſo his opinion in this point in his vindicacion, <hi>Page 8. Section</hi> 28. <q>That an unreſerved reſignation of a mans native libertie into the hands of any mans whatſoever, without any juſt Condition, or adequate exchange, can have on origination from God or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nature:</q> Now whether this Doctor hath dealt ingeniouſly with <hi>E. P.</hi> let any man judge.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now come to make good what <hi>Eutactus Philodemius</hi> did urge in relation to this Doctors affirmation and Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E. P.</hi> in his aforementioned diſcourſe of the originall and end of civill powers (under the firſt head, <hi>page</hi> the fifth of that diſcourſe) <hi>viz.</hi> That the people were (under God) the originall and efficient cauſe of all juſt powers) was ſpeaking that the people could not paſs away their own native rights out of themſelves into any other hand, to their own evident damage, without any poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>recall,</hi> and no ſuch thing could be rationably gathered but of their conſent, to ſet up a Magiſtrate over themſelves, and in caſe the Magiſtrate ſo ſet up by themſelves over them, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon their rights, beyond the due limits of his commiſſion, and the mutuall <hi>pacts,</hi> either expreſs, or neceſſarily implyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, then God, nature, and reaſon did prompt unto the people, their own ſafety, together with the uſe of means to recover and retain it, when the interchangeable conditions between them were violated by their Governour.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall add this further to what was then ſaid. That the Governour and the Governed are relatives, and undergo (when they come to be ſuch) mutuall duties, the willfull breach whereof by either party makes the <note n="*" place="margin">Propter pactum non ſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quis jure ſuo. <hi>Bracton p. 2. l 1. c 4.

               <q>That the <hi>Iew</hi> under Gods own Government might wholly give up <hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>his freedome</hi> to his Maſters will (power of life only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted) <note place="margin">

            <p>The 2. Anſ. of <hi>Eutactus Philodemius</hi> was, That the boaring of the <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>That a Prieſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this boaring of the ear, becauſe he ſhould become thereby blemiſhed, and if his ear ſhould be boared, he could not be reinveſted again in his Prieſtly dignities:</hi>
               </q> Why this boaring of the Prieſts ears ſhould be a blemiſh, and this blemiſh exclude him from his dignities, I deſire the Doctor to tell me. In 25 <hi>Levit.</hi> 42. we may ſee in what love God is with the ſlavery and ſervitude of his people, who uſed much means to keep them from it, as you may ſee there, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Jews</hi> (God ſaith) <hi>They ſhall not be ſold as bondmen,</hi> and the fifth of <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. we have the minde of God in theſe words; <q>
                  <hi>We after our ability have redeemed our brethren, which were ſold unto the Heathen, and will you even ſell your brethren? and

               </q> &amp; I ſuppoſe the reaſon of that place of <hi>Cor. 7. If thou canſt be free, chooſe it rather,</hi> is very ſutable and conſiſtent herewith. And as it is not denied, but that the boaring of the ear was a <hi>Ceremony of the receiving, and admiſſion of ſervants amongſt the</hi> Jews, yet how the telling us it was a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> doth diſprove it was a <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> doth not appear to me; this Doctor tells the world, that the boaring of the ear was no painful thing; ſure I am, if <hi>Maymonie,</hi> and other Hebrew <hi>Rabbies</hi> may be believed (whom in this thing I had rather give credit to, then this Doctor) it was the Jews <hi>right</hi> ear that was boared, and it was through the middle it was boared, &amp; whether this was painful or no, I had rather this Doctor ſhould be Probationer, then I, who it ſeems is in ſo much love with Servitude, that as he knows not how to live himſelf in any other Element then this, ſo he would have no other man ſo happy as to be out of that condition; And for the place urged by the Doctor out of <hi>Pſal</hi> 40. 6. to inforce his opening about boaring the ear that Prophetical ſaying of <hi>David</hi> touching Chriſt, <hi>Mine ear haſt thou opened, (i. e.)</hi> bored (ſaith he) The Doctor ſaith it is acknowledged, that the opening of the ear there, <hi>doth denote that Chriſt took upon him the form of a Servant.</hi> I do not know how his opinion croſſeth mine, for as <hi>Chriſt</hi> took upon him the form of a Servant, <hi>were not the puniſhment of our ſins laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and was not his being in the form of a ſervant, part of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of our ſins? Let this Doctor tell me.</p>
            <p>But as to the Doctors Explication of the aforementioned place, <note place="margin">What the meaning of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the ear in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6 is.</note> let him not be offended if I be of another opinion, though he ſaith it is acknowledged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if he would perſwade the Reader there could be no appeal to a higher Reaſon, or a Liberty of a juſt inquiry into the Truth of Scripture beyond his line, and thoſe of his opinion: I conceive it is meant otherwiſe, and therefore do lay my opinion at the feet of the ingenuous Reader; The words are properly in <hi>Engliſh</hi> rendred thus, <hi>Ears to me haſt thou digged, (i. e.)</hi> opened or fitted, and not <hi>Mine ears haſt thou opened (i. e.)</hi> boared, there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in ſence between the word <gap reason="foreign">

But the Doctor ſaith that this <hi>Iew</hi> had by <hi>a voluntary refuſall of his liberty at the Sabbatick year, made himſelf a ſlave for ever,</hi> and had no benefit of any after releaſe, or manumiſſion; he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made himſelf uncapable of his freedome, and had no poſſible future remedy though his condition be never ſo miſerable, and he never ſo deſirous of returning to a condition of liberty again; this poor <hi>Iew</hi> is adjudged by this Doctor to be in a hard condition and ſo ſhould we all be, if this Doctor could have had his will, and ſeen the end of his deſire; this is but one Doctors opinion, without any proof, the <hi>Iew</hi> (ſaith he) did at the Sabbatick year, <hi>out of his love to his Maſter,</hi> voluntarily prefer ſervice to his Maſter, before his freedome, therefore he had no refuge or relief from the year of <note place="margin">The Jews ſurrender of himſelf to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, did not put him in an irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate.</note>

The magiſtrate can make no law whatſoever that can be good, which is not either expreſs or implied in the revealed will of the great Lawgiver, his work is onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and diſpoſe all humane actions to the Common benefit and preſervation of that publike ſociety over which he is, and to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument <note place="margin">Lex eſt quidem rationis ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio ad bonum commune. <hi>Aquinas.</hi>

of their wills, offending right Reaſon, and conſequently tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Will of God, the fountain thereof; and the Civil Magiſtrate is the inſtrument whereby that is done, and hath his immediate miſſion from the people for that end, and approbation from God, or his permiſſion at the leaſt, either of which (in reſpect of them that are ſubjects) is ſufficient to make him a Magiſtrate to command obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and compliance in order to theſe ends. This was the Author of <hi>E. P.</hi> his opinion in other words, as the Reader may eaſily find in the 18, 19, 20. pages of that Book. The place of Scripture to make his opinion good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. is acknowledged by this Doctor, 21. page of his <hi>Vindication, Sect.</hi> 55. wherein he is of that Authors minde: I muſt come to this cloſe (when I conſider this Doctors <hi>Vindication)</hi> and am of this opinion, that he was reſolved to charge the Author of <hi>E.

            </p>
            <p>And now (Reader) having done with this uncandid Antagoniſt, I turn my ſelf to thee, and wiſh thee, if wel-affected (as for others, I leave them their own way) to a civil Government, and there-under to enjoy thy ſelf, and thy properties in peace, according to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſtinct that is in every ſociable rational creature, that thou wilt not be carried away with the ſubtile inſinuations of them who are Wolves in Sheeps clothing, and lie in waite to deceive thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent Powers, and their Aſſertors; make uſe of thine own Reaſon, and be not hurled to and fro with the ſwinge and rapt of that Billingſgate Rhetorick, which proceeds from ſuch as this Doctor and his party, who chooſing to avoid the naturnal and ſober courſe of Reaſon, make Railings their Reaſonings againſt any that ſtand in the way to their Intereſts and Ends. This Doctor by a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Tongue and Pen hath done much miſchief in his way; his courſe of writing hath been like the Waterman, who looks one way, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40106:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rows another; Let any man almoſt judge of him that hath heard of him, or knows his Writings, whether though he gives the good man his left hand of profeſſion, the profane Cavalier hath not his right hand of fellowſhip; with that he is <hi>homogeneous</hi> in profeſſion, with this he incorporates; in his heart there is Royalty <hi>effigiated,</hi> and his ſpirit is ductile onely to that Intereſt, though with the pen of an Artizan he delineates and holds forth the fair face of Religion, and would be thought to be Indenizened her ſubject. I ſeriouſly think that Story of the Batt is moſt appoſite to this man; The Batt when he came among the birds; they would not own him, becauſe he had feet and teeth like a beaſt, and when he would be entertained among the beaſts, they would not own him, becauſe he had wings like a bird. It hath been the unhappy priviledge of this mans parts, not ſo much to act, as to teach diſobedience to the preſent Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Powers, and therefore I think that each fault in him (and ſuch as he is) is not ſo much a Crime, as a <hi>Rule</hi> of error, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to do evil. I ſhall now take my leave of thee (Reader,) and with a word touching preſent <hi>Powers,</hi> (not the lawfulneſs of obeying it, that is already proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but the commendableneſs of it, though in ſome things it may uſe power irregularly. Thou wilt ſay, That though Oppreſſers are removed, yet Oppreſſion in a great meaſure remains ſtill; for heretofore we had good Laws, but bad Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and therefore could not expect that ſecurity to our perſons and properties as was due to us. But now thou wilt ſay, we have good Magiſtrates, as well as good Laws, what hinders our Jubile of Peace, freedom, plenty, and ſecurity. I ſhall give thee this one anſwer. That thou muſt not expect while thou liveſt an <hi>even</hi> and a <hi>perpetual tenor</hi> of <hi>happineſs</hi> in the enjoyment of a <hi>throughly well-tuned</hi> Government; the fineſt, and moſt refined on earth will have ſome <hi>courſe thread</hi> of irregularity, nay, of <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> in it, it will have its Remiſſions and Intentions, ſome mixture of bad with good; Art thou not freed from much Oppreſſion, Tyranny, and lawleſs Intrenchments, upon ſoul and body? therefore bear a little, and forbear: The beſt of Magiſtrates, though called Gods, are but men, and ſhall die like men. Think that ſome <hi>inconveniences</hi> and <hi>miſchiefs</hi> (like Ivy, twiſting it ſelf about an Oke) will ſtick to the <hi>beſt</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and that a Roſe hath its <hi>prickles</hi> as well as its <hi>flowers.</hi> I muſt confeſs that that State is in a ſad caſe, which is like that under the late King, whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and diſtempers are (as the Phyſitian ſaith in another caſe of the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) <hi>Chronick</hi> and <hi>continuate,</hi> or ſetled, not <hi>errant,</hi> but fixed and grown to a habit, which no rational man can ſay of the preſent Government, it being too yong for malice to ſtain it with ſuch an Ignominy. I have now done with thee, onely I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that thou wilt diſmiſs me, with thy favorable cenſure of a well-meaning man, and that I did my beſt to ſatisfie thee, and I muſt tell thee alſo thus much, that though I did not what I ought, yet I did what I could.</p>
