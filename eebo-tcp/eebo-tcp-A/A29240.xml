            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But I am here to tender unto your <hi>Honours</hi> judicious view, a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> quite of an other garbe: a Compleat Academick, a Civiliz'd Scholler, and a Scholastick Courtier. One whose <hi>Education</hi> hath made formall enough, without apish formality: and conceiving enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out selfe admiring arrogancy. A good Christian in devout practising, no lesse than Zealous professing; yet none of the forward'st in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on Religion. For He observes (as long experience &amp; Select acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance have brought him to be a judicious Observer) that <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> hath so occupied the World, as it hath well-neere driven the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise thereof out of the World. Where most men have more of <hi>tongue</hi> than <hi>life</hi>: and more ready to <hi>dispute</hi> than <hi>live</hi>: Seeking rather to be accompted. <hi>Eloquent Orators,</hi> then <hi>Sincere Christians: Scholists</hi> than <hi>Practists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He esteemes such onely happy, who are of that number whom the <hi>World</hi> accounts <hi>Fooles,</hi> but <hi>God, Wise men.</hi> He understands, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is sought besides God, may so imploy the <hi>Minde,</hi> as it may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, but never satisfied. He observes the whole <hi>Fabrike</hi> of humane power; and he concludes with the Preacher; <hi>Ecquid tam vanum?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He notes how the <hi>Flesh</hi> becomming obedient, behaveth her selfe as a faithfull Servant to the Soule: <hi>This governeth, the other is governed; This commandeth, the other obeyeth.</hi> Finally, he summes up all his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations with this: He that <hi>Sigheth</hi> not while he is a <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> shall never rejoice when he is a <hi>Citizen.</hi>

At last Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> returnes and saith; <hi>Goe to Bishop, give me my</hi> depositum <hi>which I and Christ committed unto thee in the Church which thou gouernest.</hi> This <hi>Bishop</hi> was astonied, thinking that he had deceitfully demanded some money which he never received, and yet durst scarce distrust the Apostle.

Could not he have stamped thee to the most exquisite or absolute feature, if it had so pleased thy Creator? And wilt thou now controule thy Maker, and by art supply the defects of Nature? Beware of this evill: I can prescribe thee a better and safer course, how to rectifie these defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Hast thou a crooked body? repaire it with an upright soule.

                     </note> by expressing three grand Maladies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to <hi>Youth</hi>; whereof I purpose to dilate particularly, to move the <hi>Young man</hi> to be more cautelous of his wayes, in the mazie Labyrinth of this life. These three (for all the rest may be reduced to them) are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under <hi>Lust, Ambition, Revenge</hi>; of which briefly, according to our former Method, we purpose here to intreat.</p>
                  <p>SO exposed is <hi>Youth</hi> to <hi>sense,</hi> and so much estranged from the government of <hi>reason</hi>;<note place="margin">LVST.</note> as it prosecutes with eagernesse whatsoever is once entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with affection. This might appeare in the ruines of <hi>Troy,</hi> occasioned by the unlawfull love of <hi>Paris</hi>; where the violent intrusion and usurpation of anothers <hi>Bed,</hi> brought an irreparable fall to the <hi>Trojans.</hi> Some have given two reasons;<note place="margin">Two reasons why <hi>Youth</hi> is naturally subjected to illimited pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> Why <hi>Youth</hi> is more subiect to this illimited passion, than any other age. The first is, that naturall heat or vigour, which is most predominant in <hi>Youth,</hi> provoking him to attempt the greatest of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rather than suffer the repulse where hee affects. The second is, want of imployment: which begets this distemperature; whence the <hi>Poet.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Take away Idlenesse, and without doubt,</l>

                     </q>
This want of imployment was it, which moved <hi>Aegistus</hi> to shew himselfe more familiar with <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> than stood well with his honour; for had hee ranked himselfe with those valiant <hi>Greekes,</hi> whose resolute adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures gain'd them generall esteeme, hee had prevented occasion and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased himselfe equall renowne by his valour, as by vaine expence of time he incurred dishonour. Witty and proper was that elegant invention of <hi>Lucian,</hi> who faining <hi>Cupid.</hi> to invite the gods to an <hi>amorous feast,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with all of them to give way to <hi>Love,</hi> till he came to <hi>Pallas</hi>; but she was found conversing with the <hi>Muses,</hi> and would admit of no time to enter parly with <hi>Cupid.</hi> True it is, that exercise draweth the minde from effeminacie: and remisnesse feeds the desire, and addes fuell to unlawfull heat. And no lesse occasion gives wanton discourse, or Lascivious Bookes to the enraged affections of distempered <hi>Youth:</hi> so as, much more blessed were the State, if restraint were made of composing or publishing such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, where every leafe instructs <hi>Youth</hi> in a new lesson of folly. <hi>Alcaeus</hi> a man of good reputation and generall observance in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; what toyes wrote he of the love of young men? All the writings of <hi>Anacreon</hi> are onely of love. But most of all other, <hi>Rheginus</hi> even burned with love, as appeareth by his writings. Yea, even Philosophers (and that by the counsell and authority of <hi>Plato,</hi> whom therefore <hi>Dicearchus</hi> did worthily reprehend) became the commenders and honourers of love. Such Discourses should, bee throwne to the darkest corner of our studies, as that of <hi>Ovids</hi> was by <hi>Augustus,</hi> which tend to corrupt <hi>Youth,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his minde from the exercise of vertue. But alas! to what height of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious liberty are these corrupter times growne? When that <hi>Sex,</hi> where Modesty should claime a native prerogative, gives way to foments of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

loosenesse; by not only attending to the wanton discourse of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Lovers, but carrying about them (even in their naked Bosomes, where chastest desires should onely lodge) the amorous toyes of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>: which Poem, with others of like nature, they heare with such atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peruse with such devotion, and retaine with such delectation, as no Subject can equally relish their unseasoned palate, like those lighter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. Yea (which hath strucke me to more admiration) I have knowen divers, whose unriper yeeres halfe assured mee, that their greene <hi>Youth</hi> had never instructed them in the knowledge, nor brought them to conceit of such vanities, excellently well read in those immodest Measures; yea, and prompt enough to shew proofes of their reading in publike places. I will not insist upon them, but leave them to have their names registred amongst those infamous Ladies; <hi>Sempronia, Scribonia, Clytemnestra, Cleopatra, Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina, Messalina,</hi> whose memories purchased by odious <hi>Lust,</hi> shall survive the course of time; as the memory of those famous Matrons, <hi>Octavia, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Caecilia, Cornelia,</hi> shall transcend the period of time. To expresse what especiall motives tend most to increase of this <hi>passion,</hi> I thinke it not amisse: because I hold it necessary to propose the cause, before we come to cure the effect. For I thinke, according to the opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that then my instructions have brought forth good fruit, when by them any one shall be provoked to apply his disposition to the knowledge and practice of vertue.

Sure I am, as there is nothing which brings eithera publike or private State to a remisnesse of government sooner than peace or plenty; so nothing effatuates the understanding of man more than excesse in meat or drinke, subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the intellective part to the bondage of Sense.

                  <p>Some Countries I have read of, whose naturall basenesse, being given to all avarice, induced them to disesteeme all respects in this kinde, and to make merchandize of their womens honour.

Their <hi>Husbands</hi> are their <hi>Pandors,</hi> and when they see any stranger arrive, they will presently demand if he would have a mistresse: and so they make whores of their own wives, and are contented for a little gaine to weare hornes: such are the base minds of ignominious Cuckolds. Here is a dangerous <hi>Ile</hi> for our amorous <hi>Gallant,</hi> who makes his Travell (with griefe I speake it) too oft the ruine of himselfe and his estate.

                     <hi>REvenge</hi> is an intended resolve, arising from a conceived distaste, either justly or unjustly grounded. This <hi>Revenge</hi> is ever violent'st in hot blouds, who stand so much upon termes of <hi>reputation,</hi> as rather than they will pocket up the least indignitie, they willingly oppose themselves to extremest hazard. Now this unbounded fury may seeme to have a two-fold relation; either as it is proper and personall, or popular and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>personall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Revenge</hi> proper or personall, ariseth from a peculiar distaste or offence done or offered to our own person; which indeed hath ever the deepest impression: Which may be instanced in <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi>; where the honour of a Nuptiall bed, the Law of Hospitalitie, the prosessed league of Amitie, were joyntly infringed: Or in <hi>Antonie</hi> and <hi>Octavius,</hi> whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine hate grew to that height, as <hi>Antonies</hi> Angell was afraid of <hi>Octavius</hi> Angell.<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Revenge</hi> popular or impersonall, proceedeth extrinsecally, as from factions in families, or some ancient grudge hereditarily descending, betwixt House and House, or Nation and Nation. When <hi>Annibal</hi> was a childe, and at his fathers commandement, he was brought into the place where he made sacrifice; and laying his hand upon the Altar, swore, that so soone as he had any rule in the Common-wealth, he would bee a prosessed enemie to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Whence may be observed, how the conceit of an injury or offence received, worketh such impression in that State or Kingdome where the injury is offered, as Hate lives, and survives the life of many ages, crying out with those incensed <hi>Greekes</hi>;

                  <p>But you will aske me, how should this be prevented? Can any <hi>Gentleman</hi> suffer with patience his <hi>Reputation</hi> to be brought in question?

                  <p>Heare me, whosoever he be that frameth these Objections! I am not ignorant how many unjust and immerited aspersions shall be throwne upon men of eminent'st desert, by such, whose tongues are ever steeped in calumnie: But who are these, save such as the glory of <hi>Greece</hi> (the everliving <hi>Homer</hi>) displayeth in the contemptuous person of <hi>Thersites</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <p>But I imagine, you will reply; it is not only the report or scandall of these men of <hi>uncurbed tongues,</hi> (for so <hi>Pindarus</hi> termes them) but of such, whose eminent esteeme in the world, gives approbation to what they speake, which awakes my <hi>Revenge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they be as you terme them, Men of <hi>eminent esteeme,</hi> and that esteeme by merit purchased, (for all other estimation I exclude it:) I need little doubt, but the distaste which you conceive against them, hath proceeded in some part from your selfe; and that upon maturer consideration, you should find your own bosome guilty to be the cause of these aspersions. If otherwise it happen, (as I grant it may) that upon private surmises, or suggestions derived from some factious heads, these men of more eminent note and esteeme have brought your name in question, because (as they were informed) you formerly aspersed a blemish upon their Honour: I would not have you to erre so farre from your owne judgement, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further discussing the cause, to fall into desperat extremes: for were it not much better for you to sift the cause, how you both are abused, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that base suggestour might be duely censured, and your wrongs mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually redressed, than to vow <hi>Revenge</hi> ere an injury be offered? Yes Sir, beleeve it, much better and safer, and in the opinion of discreet men, wiser: howsoever our hare-brain'd <hi>Gallant,</hi> whose property is to act before hee resolve, esteeme it a derogation to expostulate on termes of disgrace, but to publish war ere the league be broken.

I might now in this Subject of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> inlarge my discourse by speaking of <hi>Anger,</hi> from whence <hi>Revenge</hi> may seeme to receive her originall being: which <hi>Anger</hi> the Poet termes a short fury:
<q>
                        <l>Anger is madnesse, and as strong</l>
                        <l>In force,<note place="margin">Horat. lib. <hi>1.</hi> epist. <hi>2.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For what differs an angrie man from a mad-man, save onely in this; his violence of passion continues not so long: for the time it is as vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and as violent. Excellent therefore was that precept of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration given and observed by that renowned Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> drawne (as may appeare in the like example of <hi>Augustus</hi>) from a former patterne: of whom it is written, that he would never in his <hi>anger</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to <hi>Revenge,</hi> or so much as shew any argument of distaste, till hee had repeated over the foure and twentie Greeke letters.</p>

                     </note> Let us now, according to our former
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45431:17"/>
purpose proceed in applying certaine <hi>Receits</hi> to cure these dangerous Maladies. Which briefly (to avoid all curious divisions) may be reduced to these two: <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Contemplative.</hi> The one in exercising and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the offices of our Calling: The other in practising workes of piety, exercises of Devotion, Meditation, Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>For the former, to wit, <hi>Active,</hi> every action hath two handles (to use the Philosophers words;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Omnis actio duas habet ansas.</hi>
                     </note>) the one whereof consists in plotting or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; the other in effecting. Without the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> is precipitate; and without the <hi>latter,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> is frustrate: both concurring, the <hi>Action</hi> becomes absolute. But to speake generally of <hi>Action,</hi> as it is the represser, so <hi>Idlenesse</hi> is the producer of all vice. Whence came that ancient Edict amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cicero</hi>; that no <hi>Roman</hi> should goe thorow the streetes of the City,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In lib. de leg.</hi>

Insomuch that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> speaking of the diligence of the <hi>Romans</hi> writeth; <hi>That all of them followed their labour.</hi> Now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I perswade my selfe, you will most of you object and say with the displaced <hi>Steward</hi> in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>We cannot dig</hi>: (and I could wish that many of our <hi>eminent ones,</hi> would adde unto it, <hi>and to begge we are ashamed.</hi>) It is true indeed; I know your <hi>Breeding</hi> hath beene otherwise: but admit you cannot <hi>digge,</hi> doe yee inferre hence that yee are exempted from all labour? In no case are you so to argue. There are other Taskes, other imployments besides Manual and Mechanicke labours, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire your furtherance. And these are <hi>Forraine</hi> or <hi>Domesticall: Forraine,</hi> as to benefit your Country by rare <hi>Discoveries,</hi> re-conveying the rich freight of knowledge (by conference with <hi>forraine</hi> Nations) to your Native soile:<note place="margin">What imployments deserve entertainment from a <hi>Gentleman.</hi>

Here are Labours fit to entertaine <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and nought derogating from men of eminentest descent or quality. For in <hi>Actions</hi> of this nature have the best and most renowned States and Princes in <hi>Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Contemplative,</hi> which participates more of the minde: I could wish all <hi>Gentlemen</hi> (as they claime a prerogative in height of bloud) so to erect their Contemplations above the Sphere of these lower and inferiour <hi>Mortals,</hi> whose cogitations pressed downe with rubbish and refuse of earthly preferments, cannot distinguish light from darknesse: that they may imagine (as in truth they ought) that whatsoever is fought besides God,<note place="margin">

                     </note> may possesse the minde, but cannot satisfie it. Now, of all exercises of Devotion, I must principally commend <hi>Prayer</hi>; being (as one excellently noteth) to be numbred amongst the chiefest and choisest workes of <hi>Charity.</hi> For by <hi>Prayer</hi> are digged forth those <hi>treasures,</hi> which <hi>faith</hi> beholdeth in the Gospell:<note place="margin">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45431:17"/>
howsoever, divers more curiously than profitably, precisely than wisely, have quarrelled about the place: excluding withall, some places as unfit for <hi>Prayer.</hi> But in a word, for the place of <hi>Prayer</hi> or Devotion, this shall be my conclusion; as there is no place exempted from <hi>tempting,</hi> so there is no place exempted from <hi>praying</hi>: and for the <hi>time,</hi> as wee are continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, so are wee exhorted to <hi>pray continually,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 21.36. Rom. 12.11, 12. Eph. 6.18, 19. Col. 4.2, 3. Psal. 25.7. Eccl. 12.1.</note> that wee may bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided to resist those temptations which are usually suggested. Amongst those many devout and divine <hi>Prayers</hi> commended to <hi>Youth,</hi> none more needfull or effectuall than that of the Psalmist; <hi>Remember not the sinnes of my youth.</hi> Nor any Memoriall more powerfull, than that of the Preacher; <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> For by the <hi>Latter</hi> are we put in minde of him, whose grace is to preserve us from sinne; and by the <hi>Former</hi> to call on him, whose mercy it is to forgive sinne.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> have I composed and perfected what I purposed touching my first <hi>Observance,</hi> entituled <hi>Youth.</hi> Wherein I have inlarged my selfe so much the more for two principall respects: The <hi>One,</hi> lest by being unprovided you should fly away naked (as the <hi>young-man</hi> in the Gospell) wanting sufficient instruction to informe your weaker under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings: which moved me to amplifie each particular <hi>Subject</hi> with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Morall</hi> reading; because I knew how such discourse would relish more pleasantly to a <hi>Young-mans</hi> palate, than graver or more serious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The <hi>other,</hi> lest wanting a convenient foundation to worke on, the maine building might shrinke. Now, <hi>this</hi> I purposely framed for the <hi>Basis</hi> or ground-worke, the rest as <hi>Stories,</hi> which are made to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the foundation: for in these <hi>Observances</hi> ensuing I intend brevity, yet with such perspicuity, as the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to whom I write, may the better understand himselfe, and direct his courses to that <hi>Bent</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> whereto all <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> actions are directed.</p>

And <hi>these,</hi> as with hardnesse they get it, so hardly will they lose it; for their difficultie in gaining, is supplied by a facilitie in retaining.

                  <p>Now to treat of the <hi>Dispositions</hi> of mens mindes; it is strange to see what difference appeares in them, (even by naturall and infusive motion.) <hi>Rome</hi> brought forth the <hi>Pisoes</hi> for frugalitie, the <hi>Metelli</hi> for pietie, the <hi>Appij</hi> for austeritie, the <hi>Manlij</hi> for affabilitie, the <hi>Lelij</hi> for wisdome, and the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicolae</hi> for courtesie.

                     </note>THe third and last marke whereby a true <hi>generous Disposition</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, is <hi>Fortitude</hi> or sloutnesse: being indeed the argument of a prepared or composed minde, which is not to be dismayed or disturbed by any sharpe or adverse thing, how crosse or contrary soever it come. Excellently is this <hi>Fortitude</hi> defined by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> terming it a vertue which standeth ever in defence of equitie: not doing, but repelling an injurie. Those <hi>Heires</hi> of true <hi>Honour,</hi> who are possest of this vertue, dare oppose themselves to all occurrents in defence of reputation; preferring death before servitude and dishonour. If at any time (as many times such immerited censures occurre) they die for vertues cause, they meet death with a cheerefull countenance; they put not on a childish feare, like that <hi>Bandite</hi> in <hi>Genoa,</hi> who, condemned to die, and carried to the place of execution, trembled so exceedingly, that he had two men to support him all the way,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But now to wipe off certaine aspersions laid on valour or <hi>fortitude</hi>: wee are not to admit of all <hi>daring Spirits</hi> to be men of this ranke: For such, whose <hi>Ambition</hi> excites them to attempt unlawfull things; as to <hi>depose</hi> those whom they ought to serve, or lay violent hand on those whom loyall fidelitie bids them obey; opposing themselves to all dangers to obtaine their purpose, are not to be termed valiant or resolute, but seditious and dissolute.

Sometimes likewise the enterprize may be good and honest; the cause for which they encounter with danger, vertuous; the Agents in their enterprize coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; yet the issue taste more of despaire than valour. Example hereof wee have in the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> in the death of <hi>Razis</hi> one of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a lover of the City, and a man of very good report; which for his love was called a <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> One, who did offer to spend his body and life with all constancie for the religion of the <hi>Iewes</hi>; yet being ready to be taken on every side, through the fury of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> who so eagerly assaulted and hotly pursued him, he fell on his Sword: yea, when his bloud was utterly gone, he tooke out his owne bowels with both his hands, and threw them upon the people, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit, that he would restore them againe unto him; And thus he died. Whence <hi>Augustine,</hi> that devout Father and most excellent light of the Church, concludeth, that this was done <hi>magnè, non benè,</hi> more resolutely than rightly: for hee was not to lay violent hand upon himselfe, though there were no hope of safetie, but imminent danger in respect of the furious and bloudy enemie.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Fortitude,</hi> whereof wee here discourse, as it is grounded upon a just foundation, so it never ends in basenesse or rashnesse: in <hi>Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> as in not daring; in <hi>Rashnesse,</hi> as in too inconsiderately attempting. It is so farre from any act of <hi>Despaire,</hi> as it hopes so long as it breathes; for to despaire, is to entertaine the extremest act of feare, which is farre from her condition.<note place="margin">The proper aime or end whereto the actions of true resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>Cicero.

                  <p>Now there are many motives to excite men to valour, as may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Histories properly and profitably tending to this purpose.

Or the <hi>passionate effects of Musicke</hi>; as <hi>S.

Or <hi>Conceit of the Generalls discipline and magnanimity</hi>; As may appeare by the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Swede,</hi> his late prosperous attempts, and numerous conquests: whose martiall discipline, and personall valour, hath (no doubt) begot in his Souldiers an emulation of honour. Or <hi>opinion of the enemies crueltie</hi>; as in the yeere 1562. appeared in <hi>Agria</hi> a City in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> engirt with long siege by <hi>Mahomet Bassa</hi> with an Army of <hi>Turkes</hi> amounting to threescore thousand, and battered with sixtie Cannons; in the Citie were only two thousand <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who with incredible valour repelled thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene most terrible assaults: resolved to endure famine, or any extremitie soever, rather than yeeld to their truculent and insatiable desires. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they never came to parley of truce, but to answer their Enemies fury with Cannons and Calivers. At last, when the <hi>Bassa</hi> had offered them many favours, they hung over the wall a <hi>Coffin,</hi> covered with <hi>blacke,</hi> betwixt two speares, signifying thereby, that in that Citie they would be buried.

But in my conceit, there is no one motive more effectuall, or divinely powerfull, to bring us to a true and perfect <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>our selves,</hi> than to observe with what <hi>passions</hi> or <hi>perturbations</hi> we are encountred; especially when through immoderate excesse, wee are in the cup of forgetfulnesse drowned. Which Saint <hi>Basil</hi> confirmeth, saying: That <hi>passions</hi> rise up in a drunken man, like a <hi>Swarme</hi> of <hi>Bees</hi> buzzing on every side. Which <hi>passions</hi> are not such as are prevented by <hi>reason,</hi> and directed by <hi>vertue</hi>: for these are not altogether to bee extinguished, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> supposed, but to bee provoked as movers of <hi>vertue,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teacheth. But rather such distempered or indisposed <hi>affections</hi> as are suggested to <hi>Man</hi> by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies: labouring to undermine and ruine the glorious palace of his deare-bought soule. Vpon which <hi>affections</hi> seriously to meditate, were to expell all selfe-conceited or opinionate arrogance; to become humble in our owne thoughts: concluding, that our <hi>knowledge</hi> is <hi>ignornet,</hi> our <hi>strength weakenesse,</hi> and our <hi>wisedome folishnesse.</hi> Being (as one well observeth) like a <hi>Spring-locke,</hi> ready of our selves to shut, but not to open; apter to shut grace from us, than to receive grace into us: or like stones upon the top of a hill, by reason of our heavie and earthy nature, ready enough to tumble downe, but without the helpe or motion of <hi>another,</hi> slow enough to mount up. Saint <hi>Anselme</hi> walking abroad in the field, and beholding a Shepheards Boy, who had caught a <hi>Bird,</hi> and tied a <hi>stone</hi> to her leg with a threed; and ever as the <hi>Bird</hi> mounted, the <hi>stone</hi> haled her backe againe.

                     <hi>Knights of post</hi> to all <hi>Newes-mongers,</hi> being no lesse ready to sweare, than they to report. I have casually fallen into the company of <hi>some,</hi> whose onely relation was novelty: these would entertaine no <hi>Discourse</hi> but forraine, speaking as familiarly of the states of Princes, and their aimes, as if they had new crept from their Bosomes. But alas, how ridiculous are these in the sight of judicious men, whose eyes are not so sealed, but they may easily discerne the arrogancy of these, who affect rather to be admired than beleeved? Excellent and proper for our present purpose, is that Fable of the <hi>Fowler</hi> and the <hi>Bird</hi>: A <hi>Fowler</hi> having taken a <hi>Bird</hi> in his snare, was humbly intreated by the <hi>Bird,</hi> that he would free her and give her liberty, and shee would requite this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie with three good Lessons; which (if duly observed) would profit him more than her small body. Vpon these conditions, the <hi>Fowler</hi> was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to release the poore <hi>Bird,</hi> provided, that the Lessons were so profitable and usefull unto him, as shee pretended. Which, in briefe, were these: <hi>Not to lose a certainty for an incertainety: Not to give credit to things beyond probability: Nor to grieve for that which is past remedy.</hi> These lessons received, the <hi>Bird</hi> was forth with released: who being now at liberty, and mounting aloft in the aire, and triumphing in so blest a freedome, chanted out this merry Madrigall;

Where the Poets smoothly, but tartly, used to introduce Beasts, Birds, and such like creatures; admonishing man, the noblest of all creatures, of his duty. Yea of Beasts, they made choice sometimes of the grossest and contemptiblest, as the <hi>Asse,</hi> to expresse the want of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Man</hi>; whose diviner parts drowned in the Lees of sensuall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or carnall security, become forgetfull of that, for which they were principally created. It were easie to enlarge this <hi>Subject</hi> with much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of examples; but my purpose is, in digressions, rather to touch than treat.

this <hi>Sobriety</hi> consists not onely in the pronunciation of <hi>Speech,</hi> but <hi>Sober</hi> carriage or deportment of the Body, which indeed addeth no little lustre to <hi>Discourse.</hi> I have observed in some, a kinde of <hi>carelesnesse</hi> in their forme of speaking; which, though it gaine approbation in men of <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ranke,</hi> it would seeme harsh and contemptible in men of <hi>inferiour condition.</hi> Others there are, who can never enter into any set or serious <hi>Discourse,</hi> but they must play with a button; or like some of our clodded <hi>Elders,</hi> who for helps to <hi>Discourse, milch</hi> their <hi>gloves,</hi> as if they drained their <hi>Subject</hi> from such trifling action: and these, me thinks, resemble our <hi>Common-Fidlers,</hi> who cannot play a stroke, to gaine a world, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or wagging of their head, as if they had rare <hi>Crochets</hi> in their braine: but this mimicke and apish action keepes small concurrence with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose <hi>Speech</hi> as it should bee free, native and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; so should the <hi>action</hi> of his <hi>body</hi> admit of no phantasticke <hi>imitation</hi> or servile <hi>affectation,</hi> which expresseth little, save a degenerate quality or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Others I have likewise noted, to conclude their <hi>Set speeches</hi> with winkes and nods, as if the understanding of the whole world were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the circumference of their braine: and these usually expresse more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie of conceit in the action of their bodies, than the motion of their tongues. For oft-times, through want of matter (being gravell'd with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected gravity) they are forced to trifle time in impertinencies, and leave that matter untouched for which they came. I could wish that <hi>Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> would principally observe this Lesson, to be <hi>sober</hi> in arguments of <hi>Discourse,</hi> but especially in <hi>reasoning</hi>: for there is nothing that darkeneth or obscureth the Light of <hi>reason,</hi>

But especially in publike assemblies, where difference of judgements oft-times racke our <hi>speeches</hi> to a higher pin, ought deliberation to be had: for there we cannot recall so soone what we have spoke amisse, as in private, where lesse premeditation may afford matter of satisfaction. I approve likewise of his opinion, who would have such, whose pleasant conceits minister content to the hearer, if they meane to jest publikely, &amp; force their wits to stem the streame of the worlds judgements, (which, I say, are different, and therefore more observant) that they use <hi>Pericles</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, who determining to speake any thing publikely, desired the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall gods, that no improvident word, should passe his mouth. Certainly, whosoever he bee that speakes and never meditates, may bee compared to the <hi>uncleane beast,</hi> who digests and never ruminates. Neither is it hard to gather this,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now to come to the cure; because Medicines provided and not applied, are fruitlesly imployed. Are ye naturally subject to <hi>vaine-glory?</hi> Labour to suppresse those motions even in their rising, by becomming vile and contemptible in your owne sight. Are yee affected to <hi>wantonnesse</hi> and effeminacie? Impose your selves a Taske, inure your bodies to labour, reserve some houres for reading, as well those exquisite Morall precepts of <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, as those blessed <hi>Patternes</hi> of continencie recorded in sacred Writ. Are ye slaved to the misery of a worldling? Wrastle with your affections, entertaine bounty, affect hospitality, so in time yee shall become weaned from base and servile Parcimony. To be briefe, as <hi>Vices</hi> are best cured by their <hi>Contraries,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist vices, by practising &amp; doing acts of the contrary vertues.</note> ever oppose your selves to that which your Natures affect most; for this is the way to make you, that were <hi>slaves</hi> before, <hi>commanders</hi> of your owne affections: which soveraignty surpasseth all inferiour command, for by this meanes you command <hi>those,</hi> who have had the greatest <hi>Monarchs</hi> in subjection.</p>
                  <p>Thus have wee proposed the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a <hi>Vocation,</hi> and what especiall rules were to bee observed in the undertaking of that <hi>Vocation</hi>: which observed, yee shall conferre no lesse good on your <hi>Countrey,</hi> who expects much good from you; than yee shall minister content unto your selves, finding all depraved or distempered affections buried in you.

or patternes of vigilancy, providence and industry, must not sleepe out their time under the fruitlesse shadow of Security. Men in great place (saith one) are thrice servants; servants of the Soveraigne, or state; servans of Fame; and servants of Businesse. So as they have no freedome, neither in their persons, nor in their actions, nor in their times. First, they, are <hi>Servants</hi> to their <hi>Soveraigne</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> for as they are by place sett neere his <hi>Person,</hi> so are they with due and tender respect ever to observe him, in affaires tending to the safety of his <hi>Person,</hi> and generall good of the <hi>State.</hi> They are <hi>Servants</hi> (likewise) of <hi>Fame:</hi> for howsoever the actions of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour men may seeme sleighted with neglect, or clouded with contempt, <hi>they</hi> are sure to have their deeds bruted by <hi>Fame,</hi>

                     </note> either to their glory or disgrace. Yea, <hi>these</hi> are also eager hunters after <hi>Fame,</hi> preferring opinion before all other inferiour respects, and wishing rather themselves to dye, than it should die. Whence it was, that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> telling <hi>Alexander</hi> that there were many worlds; <hi>Alexander</hi> wept, replying, <hi>That he had not wonne one</hi>: implying, that his <hi>Fame,</hi> being that which he principally tendred, having scarce yet dispersed it selfe to the circumference of one world; it would be long, ere it could diffuse or dilate it selfe to many worlds. Lastly, they are <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Businesse</hi>; being placed neere the <hi>Helme</hi> of the <hi>State</hi>: and therefore like wise and vigilant <hi>Pilots,</hi> must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lest the <hi>Rudder</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> be not shaken by their security.</p>
                  <p>Neither is their <hi>State</hi> so sure, that it should move them to be secure: for men in high places are for most part pursued by many Enemies, whose eyes are ever prying into their actions, which they invert, by labouring to bring the <hi>State</hi> in distaste with their proceedings. Now what meanes better to frustrate their practices, than by a serious and cautelous eye, to looke into their owne actions? <hi>Diogenes</hi> being asked, how one should bee revenged of his Enemie, answered; <hi>By being a vertuous and honest man.</hi> Which badge (I meane honesty) as it should be the <hi>Cognizance</hi> of every <hi>Christian</hi>; so should it shew her full lustre or splendour in these persons whom <hi>Descent</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> hath so ennobled. Now these Enemies of <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> if right use be made of them, may conferre no small profit to such as they hate. NASICA, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-weale was supposed to bee in most secure estate, because freed of their enemies, affirmed, that though the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both brought under the yoke of bondage, yet they were in most danger, because none were left, whom they might either feare for danger, or who should keepe them in awe. This wee shall finde verified even in our selves: for tell me, are wee not most circumspect in all our actions, wherein wee have to deale with our enemie? Are wee not fearefull lest by some inconsiderate or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate act, he take advantage of us, and consequently circumvent us? So as our <hi>Enemies</hi> may bee used as <hi>Tutors</hi> or <hi>Monitors</hi> to instruct us, warning us to bee advised what wee undertake, lest they take hold of us in our mistake.</p>
                  <p>There is also another benefit redounding to us, of which it were likely we should be deprived, if wee wanted <hi>Enemies,</hi> by whom this benefit is on us conferred. And it is this; wanting <hi>Enemies,</hi> wee many times make of our best friends, <hi>Enemies.</hi> Whence <hi>Oenomademus</hi> in a faction in the Ile of <hi>Chios,</hi> counselled his fellowes that they should not expell all their <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> but still leave some in the City, <hi>lest</hi> (quoth he) <hi>being void of all our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies wee should begin to quarrell with our friends.</hi>

Wherein I should thinke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, if we observed the selfe-same rule, which the members of our <hi>Body</hi> use in the due performance of their offices. For wee see not one of them incroach or intrude into anothers place or imployment: The <hi>Eye</hi> it sees, and handles not; the <hi>Hand</hi> it handles, and sees not; the <hi>Palat</hi> it tastes, and smels not; the <hi>Nose</hi> it smels, and tastes not; the <hi>Eare</hi> it heares, and walkes not; the <hi>Foot</hi> it walkes, and heares not.

Wee shall see in most places both at home and abroad, how such trades or <hi>Vocations</hi> are most used, as may best suit with the nature and condition of the place.

to other Countries by exportance. Againe, in our <hi>Townes</hi> lying fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within Land, the inhabitants use some especiall Trade to keepe their <hi>Youth</hi> in labour; whereby they become not only beneficiall to themselves, but usefull and helpefull unto others. Amongst which, I cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of the diligence of the Towne of <hi>Kendall,</hi> and worthy care which they have to see their very young children put to worke, being a labour which requires no great strength, to wit, <hi>Woolworke.</hi> Wherein, so approved hath their care and industry beene, as they have gained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no small esteeme in forraine places, who are made partakers of the fruit of their labours. For I have knowne a family, consisting of seven or eight persons, maintained by the worke of two or three stones of wooll, which amounted not above thirty shillings: and with this they maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned credit, living in an honest and decent manner. Whose labours as they were laudable, so have they beene no lesse furthered, favoured, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by our late gracious Soveraigne of renowned memory; who of his princely clemency, hath damned all such impositions or heavy taxations as might any way impaire or impeach the free use of that Trade. Since which time, upon renuall of their Charter, his Sacred Majesty hath beene lately pleased, not onely to enlarge their <hi>Liberties,</hi> but likewise to dignifie their magistracy with a <hi>title</hi> of more eminence: which had it stood with his princely pleasure, might have received high improvement by creation of a Burgesse. Albeit now of late, the Town of <hi>Kendall,</hi> so famous for <hi>Wool-work,</hi> by reason of a late decrease or decay of trade in those parts, is grown no less penurious than populous: so as (with griefe I speake it) such inhabitants as formerly by their paine &amp; industry were able to give an alms at their door, are now forced to beg their almes from door to door. The redresse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it hath been by the Prince and those prudent guides and guardians of our State, the Lords of his Privie Councell, duely intended; so no doubt, but by their wise care it shall be accordingly effected, and those poore people after so many miseries sustayned, wholly releeved; to the advancement of Gods glory, the supportance of many a needfull family, and the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renowne of his Majesty, to whom every subject oweth his life, love and loyalty.

The <hi>Satyre</hi> at the first sight of fire, would needs have kissed and imbraced it, but <hi>Prometheus</hi> checked him. So highly admired were things unknown, and so familiarly employed being once knowne.

                  <p>Touching the <hi>First,</hi> to wit, <hi>Publike</hi> affaires of State; as all are not fit for such a charge or burden; so there is a <hi>necessitie</hi> injoyned such, who are able to undertake so great and weightie a Taske, to submit themselves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to the command of their <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> whensoever his pleasure shall bee to make triall of their sufficiencie in affaires of State. In the carriage whereof, divers necessarie cautions have beene formerly observed by Statesmen. As first, to avoid all occasions of distrust, never to shew too much inwardnesse with forraine States: for this may beget a suspect in your <hi>Prince,</hi> that your aymes are neither faire nor loyall. It was this which broke <hi>Byrons</hi> necke,<note place="margin">Objections framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Byron,</hi> set his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine States.</note> being accused to have had conference with one <hi>Picote,</hi> borne at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and fled into <hi>Flanders</hi> to have intelligence with the Arch-duke, to which <hi>Picote</hi> hee had given an hundred and fifty crowns for two voyages to that effect. Likewise, it was objected against him, that he had treated with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> three dayes after his comming to <hi>Paris.</hi> Likewise, the intelligence he had from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the taking of <hi>Bourges,</hi> giving him advice to attempt against the Kings Armie. Likewise, that he should bring the King before S. <hi>Katharines</hi> to be slaine there: and to that end had written to the Governour, giving him some tokens to know his Majestie. Likewise, that he had sent <hi>La Fin</hi> to treat with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Fuentes.</hi> To which, although hee replied, and in some sort purged himselfe, yet those treaties or parlies which were proved against him, shewed him guiltie of divers indirect procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against him.

It is no lesse dangerous to one imployed in affaires of State, to bee too credulous; and that in two respects: either by being too credulous in <hi>giving trust</hi> to the relations of others, or by being too credulous in <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting his thoughts</hi> to the secrecie of others. For the <hi>former,</hi> it detracts much from the worth and estimate of man, yea (and if I may so say) argues great indiscretion to have an eare open to all reports, seconding whatsoever is related, with an opinion of credulitie. For such as these, whom either greatnesse of <hi>Place</hi> by <hi>Descent,</hi> or some more noble and native characters of <hi>personall</hi> worth have advanced, need not want for <hi>Relaters</hi> in this kinde, especially if they finde them apt to beleeve whatsoever they shall be readie to report.

Whence it is said, that <hi>Travellers, Poets</hi> and <hi>Lyars,</hi> are three words al of one signification.
Now there is no meanes better to avoid the company of these fabulous <hi>Relaters,</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:45431:43"/>
than by interrupting them, or by requiting their <hi>Tales</hi> (to argue their incredibility) telling stories farre more strange, and indeed beyond the compasse of common sense: whereof I have heard a merry conceited <hi>Tale</hi> to this effect: <q>A certaine <hi>Traveller,</hi> or at least one who desired though hee never deserved that <hi>title,</hi> reporting wonderfull and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible things which hee had seene in his travell, amongst the rest related this: Vpon a time it befell (said he) that I travelled along a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart in <hi>Arabia felix,</hi> where I with others who then accompanied mee, were assayled by a violent showre, so as labouring to fly for shelter to some covert, wee might perceive a little Coppice, wherein grew great store of Cabbages of such huge proportion, as the very leaves thereof (so largely extended were the spurges) might by their greatnesse give sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to five hundred men. This <hi>Tale</hi> being told, one amongst the rest, to answer his <hi>Tale,</hi> makes this reply by way of discourse upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents as had hapned him in his Travell, proceeding thus; It fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that I with some other Gentlemen of eminent ranke and quality, travelled neere the <hi>Riphean</hi> Mountaines, in the clifts of which Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines abundance of all metals, but especially of copper, is daily found: Now as wee coasted along, wee might perceive some three leagues Westward from those <hi>Mountaines,</hi> a great number of people beating and knocking with incessant labour, but for what end we knew not: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with one consent wee resolved to approach neerer them, and see about what they so eagerly laboured. Where wee found five hundred Braziers making of one Caldron, which was of so huge proportion, as not any one of all those Braziers, though they were all employed in one worke, could heare one another strike. Good God (quoth the former <hi>Traveller</hi>) for what use was so huge a Caldron made? Surely (replyed the second) I cannot imagine for what use it should be, unlesse it were to boyle your Cabbage in. This present and pregnant answer so daunted that fabulous <hi>Traveller,</hi> as hee was ever after more sparing in discourse of his Travels.</q>
A <hi>States-man</hi> ought likewise to beware of giving credit to all forrain relations: for divers there be who presuming of the distance of place, will invent and vent their inventions to curry favour: having so couched and digested their new-minted <hi>New<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The second respect, wherein a <hi>States-man</hi> ought not to be too credulous, is this; hee must not be too open-brested in <hi>imparting his thoughts</hi> to the secrecy of others.

Of this resolution or constancie of mind we have a notable example in <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> commended for his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; in so much as being threatned by <hi>Albert</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that if hee would not condescend to some reasonable ransome for his liberty, hee would deliver him over into the hands of his enemy, answered, <hi>Aske that thing of me being prisoner, that thou wouldst aske of me at Liberty.</hi> The like wee reade of <hi>Pantaleon,</hi> who restrayned in most strait bondage, was never a whit dismayed, nor so much as sighed, when hee beheld his son <hi>Paraxaspis</hi> thrust to the heart. This resolution or stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind, might be illustrated by divers examples of the like kind, but my purpose hath ever beene (because these doe rather illustrate than prove or confirme) to take them, as it were by the way, but in no case to dwell on them: wee will therefore descend to <hi>forraine imployments</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> as affaires of embassage or treaty with any Prince or State.</p>
                  <p>Now it is expedient that such as be imployed in affaires of this Nature, be choyce and select men both in gifts of Nature, and State-experience. For in <hi>Nature</hi> is the foundation layd, which by <hi>experience</hi> and continuall employment in state-busines, useth to be stored, furnished, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. So as I doe not altogether assent to his opinion, who thought that in choice of instruments to treat or negociate by way of Embassie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Prince and Prince; it is better to chuse men of a plainer sort, who are like to doe that that is committed to them, and to report backe againe faithfully the successe, than those that are cunning to contrive out of other mens busines, somewhat to grace themselves, and will helpe the matter in report for satisfaction sake. For his conclusion agrees not with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>If you would worke any man, you must either know his nature, and fashions, and so lead him; or his ends, and so perswade him; or his weaknesse and disadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have interest in him, and so governe him.</hi> Now how should a man, whom a simple plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse only possesseth, one whom no diving or penetrating reach enableth, one whom the outward semblance only instructeth, how should he (I say) by <hi>working any man,</hi> either know his nature or fashion, and so <hi>lead</hi> him; since his eye can reach no farther than the outward seeming, which as oft deceives, as it receives diversity of habits which it weares? or how should he (I say) <hi>know his ends</hi> with whom he treats, and so <hi>perswade</hi> him, since politicke men doe usually pretend that which they least intend: shewing a faire glosse, and putting on a false face to delude, and deluding
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45431:44"/>
to colour their designes more cunningly? or how should he discover the <hi>weaknesse</hi> or <hi>disadvantages</hi> of the person with whom he deales, when his owne weaknesse so disables him, as hee oft-times lets opportunity slip, when the best advantage is for him? or how discerne those which have <hi>interest</hi> in him, when his aymes are onely to conclude with him, with whom hee deales, without relation to any intercedent meanes to effect his busines? Neither is it to be doubted, but <hi>such</hi> whose understanding hath attained a higher pitch, will be as ready to doe that which is committed to them, as those on whom a more plainnesse hath naturally seized: for <hi>these</hi> will duly consider the great danger they are like to incurre, if they should exceed their Commission either in doing too much, or detract from their Commission in doing too little. For in affaires of this nature, especially <hi>parum agendum est de proprio,</hi> yea, though in the opinion of the party em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, it seeme that hee could goe more effectually to worke,<note place="margin">Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts most successive.</note> than just as his Commission directs him. <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> commanded his sonne to be put to death, for fighting (albeit prosperously) against his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Pub.

                     </note> wherefore <hi>Mutianus</hi> sent for the Enginer, and caused him to bee so cruelly whipped with rods, that he dyed therewith. If disobedience in such affaires as these, being of lesser consequence, seemed among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> cause sufficient to pronounce sentence of death upon the offender; what may they deserve, who in conceit of their owne wisedome, dare take upon them directions of their owne; without tying themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to their Commission? And of these there bee two sorts: The <hi>one,</hi> even in greatest and most important matters, will presume to take upon them without direction of Authority: wherein as they commonly erre, so they give advantage to him with whom they have to deale, of making his owne bargaine upon such <hi>Termes</hi> as shall best please him: for how should one mans judgement equall a whole judicious Councell? So as in dealing with cunning persons, we must ever consider their <hi>ends,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret their <hi>Speeches</hi>; and it is good to say little to them, and that which they least looke for. The <hi>other</hi> sort tye themselves something more strictly or precisely to their Commission; for these will be loath to digresse from it in matters of weight and substance, but rather in some impertinent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony or circumstance: as wee reade in the generall History of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that there came two Embassadours out of <hi>France</hi> unto King <hi>Alfonse</hi> the ninth, to demand one of his daughters in mariage for their Soveraigne King <hi>Philip</hi> one of which Ladies was very faire, and named <hi>Vrraca</hi>; the other nothing so gracious, and called <hi>Blanch.</hi> They both comming into the presence of the Embassadours, all men held it a matter resolved, that their choyce would light upon <hi>Vrraca,</hi> as the elder and fairer, and better adorned: but the Embassadours enquiring each of their names, tooke offence at the name of <hi>Vrraca,</hi> and made choyce of the Lady <hi>Blanch</hi>; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that her name would be better received in <hi>France</hi> than the other. For matters of such indifferencie as these, it is not to be doubted but they are left to the discretion of the instruments: but for affaires of <hi>State,</hi> as they require due deliberation in discussing; so require they the joynt assent and approbation of the <hi>State</hi> ere they come to concluding.</p>

                  <p>And first for the antiquity of <hi>Dice-play,</hi> we have plenty of authorities every where occurring: being much used by all the Roman Emperours at Banquets and solemne meetings, where they bestowed themselves and the time, at no grame so much as Dice. So as, <hi>Augustus</hi> was said to be a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gamester at Dice: affecting them much, when at any time he retired from Court, or Campe. Whence it is, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> bringeth in <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesar</hi> speaking thus; <hi>Si quas manus remisi cuique exegissem; aut retinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issem quod cuique donavi, vicissem, &amp;c. If I had exacted those</hi> chances <hi>which I remitted every one; and kept that which I bestowed, I had gotten by play; whereas now I am a loser by my bounty.</hi> Though no game more ancient, or which indeed requireth a conceit more pregnant than the <hi>Chesse</hi>; which we read to have beene in great request amongst the ancient Romans, whereof we have a History in the time of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> tending to this purpose. This Emperour being naturally addicted to all cruelty, chanced one day amongst others, to send for one <hi>Canius Iulus,</hi> a Philosopher of eminent esteeme at that time: with whom, after some conference, the Emperour fell into such a rage, as he bade him depart thence, but expect within short time to receive due censure for his boldnesse: <hi>For</hi> (quoth he) <hi>flatter not thy selfe with a foolish hope of longer life, for I have doomed thee to be drawne by the officer unto death</hi>: But see with what resolution this noble <hi>Canius</hi> bore himselfe! <hi>I thanke you</hi> (quoth he) <hi>most gracious Emperour,</hi> and so departed. Within some few dayes after, the Officer (according to the Emperours commandement) repaired to the houses of such as were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, not by any legall processe, but only by the Emperours pleasure, to suffer death; amongst which, he made repaire to <hi>Canius</hi> house, whom he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45431:52"/>
found playing at <hi>Chesse</hi> with one of his companions. The Officer without delay gave him summons to prepare himselfe, for it was the Emperours pleasure he should dye: whereat, as one nothing amated or discouraged, he called the Officer unto him, and <note n="*" place="margin">

This kinde of game, now of latter yeares is growne so familiar with most of our neighbouring Countries, as no one play more affected, or more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally used. So as we have heard of an <hi>Ape</hi> who plaid at <hi>Chesse</hi> in <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall:</hi> which implyed, the daily use and practice of that game, brought the <hi>Ape</hi> to that imitation, And certainly, there is no one game which may seeme to represent the state of mans life to the full, so well as the <hi>Chesse.</hi> For there you shall find Princes and Beggars, and persons of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ranked in their proper and peculiar places; yet when the game is done, they are all truss'd up in a bagge together: and where then appeares any difference betwixt the poorest Beggar, and the potentest Peere? The like may be observed in this stage of humane frailtie: while we are here set to shew during the <hi>Chesse-game</hi> of this life, wee are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our severall rankes esteemed; and fit it should be so, for else should all degrees be promiscuously confounded: but no sooner is the game done, the thred of our short life spunne, than we are throwne into a bagge, a poore shrowding sheet, for that is all that we must carry with us: where there shall be no difference betwixt the greatest and least, highest and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: for then it shall not be asked us how much we had, but how we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of that we had.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre have we discoursed of the first part, to wit, of the <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>recreations:</hi> thinking it sufficient to have touched onely such as are most usuall and knowne unto us. For some others, which we have purposely omitted, lest our <hi>Mindian</hi> gate should grow greater than our City, we shall have occasion to speake of some of them, when wee are to discourse of such <hi>Recreations,</hi> as are to be made choise of by <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of best ranke and qualitie.

Neither is it my meaning, that <hi>Gentlemen</hi> should be so from the pleasure of <hi>Recreation</hi> weaned, as if from society wholly estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: for this were like him, who became <hi>Hermit</hi> because hee might not have her he loued. Or like to him who immur'd himselfe to a Rocke, as if he cared not a button for the world, having bestowed upon butters all the State he had in the world. But rather so to attemper, or allay the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such pleasures or delights as they betake themselves to, that they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45431:52"/>
bee never too much besotted with them. This course that <hi>Gentleman</hi> took, who, perceiving himselfe too much affected on <hi>Hawking,</hi> resolved one day to weane his mind a little from it, by trying his patience with some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences incident to it. Wherefore hee set a lazie <hi>Haggard</hi> on his fist, and goes to his sport: where hee finds store of game, but few flights; for wheresoever the <hi>Partridge</hi> flew, his <hi>Hawke</hi> never made farther flight than from tree to tree, which drove the <hi>Gentleman</hi> faulconer to such impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as hee lesse affected the pleasure for long time after. The like I have heard of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who used much <hi>bowling,</hi> which <hi>Recreation</hi> hee so continually practised, for the love hee bore it, as his occasions were much neglected by it; which to prevent, as hee rode farre for his pleasure, so hee stayed late ere hee returned home, of purpose, so to become wearied, that his mind by that meanes might from his pleasure bee the sooner weaned. But these experiments as they are oft failing, where the mind is not come to settling: so, in my opinion, there is no meanes better or surer to weane man, endued with reason, from being too much captived or inchayned with these pleasures, than to consider what benefits redound from <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Recreation,</hi> and againe what inconveniences arise from <hi>immoderate</hi> delight therein. First then, let us consider the end for which <hi>Recreations</hi> were ordained, and wee shall find that they were rather intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile time, than to bestow our selves on them all our time. Though many, too many there be, who will not stick to say with him who sported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the warme Sunne, <hi>Vtinam hoc esset vivere,</hi> would to God this were to live; would to God this <hi>Recreation</hi> were a <hi>Vocation,</hi> this pleasure my trade for ever. No, as <hi>Recreation</hi> was at first intended for refreshing the mind, and enabling the body to performe such offices as are requisite to be performed: so is it not to be made a Trade or Profession, as if we should there set up our rest, and intend nothing else. Consider therefore the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> which redound by a <hi>moderate</hi> or temperate use of <hi>Recreation.</hi>

It is said of <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> that after the tenth houre he would be retained in no busines, neither after that houre would he reade so much as any Letter.

                  <p>There is another <hi>Recreation</hi> used by <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> but especially in this Citie; which, used with <hi>Moderation,</hi> is not altogether to be disallowed: and it is repairing to <hi>Stage-playes</hi>; where, as they shall see much lightnesse, so they may heare something worthy more serious attention.

                  <p>Playes were set out on a time by the Citizens for the more solemnity of a league concluded betwixt the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Berna</hi> and <hi>Tiguris</hi>; touching which Playes, sundry differences arose amongst the Ministers of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which could not easily be determined, about a young Boy, who represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a woman in apparell, habit, and person: in the end it was agreed of all parts, that they should submit the determination of this difference, with generall suffrage and consent,<note place="margin">

Which doubt, being so soundly and sincerely cleared by so conspicuous a light of the Church, wee will no longer insist upon, but descend to the next Objection.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The third Objection may probably ground it selfe upon the testimony of Saint <hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 6.24. <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e unto those that laugh now,</hi> &amp;c. Whence it may be gathered, That, if the Scripture condemne <hi>Laughter,</hi> then consequently <hi>Stage-playes</hi> also, whose speciall aime and intendment is to make men <hi>laugh.</hi> But it is to be understood, that Christ directeth his speech to those perverse and malicious men, whose mourning is but a dissembled sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, outwardly grieving, and inwardly <hi>laughing</hi>; who speake one thing with their mouth, but professe another thing in their life: for this is not to be understood of the common society or conversation of men, as if Christ should forbid any one to <hi>laugh</hi> at all; but rather of immoderate <hi>laughter:</hi> whence is that of the Poet;
<q>
                        <l>Woe unto thee whose Spleene affecteth laughter,</l>
                        <l>For thy short joy shall turne to sorrow after.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, as feare begetteth humility, so too much mirth procureth levity. <hi>Much laughter corrupteth manners,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vt metus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sic nimia laetitia gestit levita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Cic.</hi> Eccles. 3.22.</note> 
                     <hi>and looseth the sinewes of their former strength, but a grave countenance is the preserver of knowledge:</hi> yet addeth <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> unto this; <hi>There is nothing better than for man to rejoyce in his workes</hi>; which <hi>David</hi> confirmeth, Psalme <hi>penult.</hi> So as there is nothing by this Objection proved, but what with all reason may be approved; for <hi>immoderate</hi> mirth is that which is here condemned, being that which we have in this observation especially touched and taxed: whence wee may inferre, That <hi>moderate</hi> delight, tasting more of sobriety than levity, is not onely allowed, but commended.</p>

For such as Enterludes (<hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>) as participate with neither of these, but in a temperate and equall course mixe profit with honest delight; you shall account the time you bestow in hearing them, not altogether fruitlesly spent.

And these I now speake of, be our <hi>Ordinary Gentlemen,</hi> whose day-taske is this in a word: They leave their beds to put on their clothes formally, repaire to an <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and see a <hi>Play</hi> daily. These can find time enough for <hi>Recreation,</hi> but not a minutes space for <hi>Devotion.</hi> So as I much feare me, when they shall be strucke with sicknesse, and lie on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, it will fare with them as it fared with a young <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> within these few yeares; who being accustomed in her health every day to see one <hi>Play</hi> or other, was at last strucke with a grievous sicknesse even unto death: during which time of her sicknesse, being exhorted by such <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> as were there present, to call upon God, that he would in mercy look upon her, as one deafe to their exhortation, continued ever crying, <hi>Oh Hieronimo, Hieronimo, me thinkes I see thee, brave Hieronimo!</hi> Neither could she be drawne from this with all their perswasions; but fixing her eyes intentively, as if she had seene <hi>Hieronimo</hi> acted, sending out a deep sigh, shee suddenly dyed. And let this suffice to have beene spoken of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> use of this <hi>Recreation:</hi> upon which I have the longer insisted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am not ignorant how divers and different opinions have been hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den touching the law fulnesse of <hi>Stage-Playes,</hi> which I resolved to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile in as briefe and plaine a manner as I could, before I descended to the rest.</p>

Truth is, I would have none to play much, but those which have little to play. For these, as they have little to lose, so they cannot bee much poorer, if they lose all. Whereas such, whose Ancestors have left them faire revenues, by investing them as Heires to their providence; need little to raise or advance their fortunes by these indirect meanes. For tell me, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> doe ye game for gaine, or passing time? If for gaine, it is needlesse, ye have sufficient. If for passing time, your stake should be lesse, and your care for winning, more indifferent. Besides, doe ye not observe what <hi>foists</hi> yee have daily resorting and frequenting these houses; whose purses are lined with cheats, and whose profession is only to sharke? Shun their companies then, left they prey upon you: whereby you shall make your selves subjects both of want and weaknesse. Of <hi>Want,</hi> by filling their purses with your coine: of <hi>weaknesse,</hi> by suffering your selves to bee made a prey of by their cheats. If you will game, make choice of such as you know to be <hi>square Gamesters,</hi> scorning to bring their names in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with the least report of advantage. As for tricks frequently used in these dayes, learne rather to prevent them, then professe them: For I never knew <hi>Gamester</hi> play upon advantage, but bring him to the square, and his fortune was ever seconded with disadvantage. But above all, use <hi>moderation</hi> in <hi>Play,</hi> make not your <hi>Recreation</hi> a distemper: and set up this as your rest, never to mount your stake so high, as the losse of it may move you to chol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The reason may be this; hee cannot endure restraint: for the heat of <hi>Youth</hi> must needs take aire, or it choakes it selfe with too much holding. It must be carried aloft on the wings of the wind, taking an <hi>Icarian</hi> flight, but never fearing his fall. Such <hi>dogges</hi> as were presented by the King of <hi>Albanie</hi> unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who would not stirre at <hi>small Beasts,</hi> but at <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Elephants,</hi> are the fittest for his kennell; for <hi>Youth</hi> is no sooner moving then mounting.

To speake much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Recreation</hi> I will not addresse my discourse: onely this is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that as it is <hi>generous,</hi> so generally is it most <hi>harmelesse,</hi> so it be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately</hi> used; for otherwise it may weaken or enfeeble the body, impaire the health, and be occasion of many inconveniences: for in my discourse upon the particular branch of this <hi>Observation,</hi> I am onely to approve of such <hi>Recreations</hi> as are used with <hi>Moderation</hi>: As <hi>Hawking,</hi> which (as I before observed) is a pleasure for high and mounting spirits: such as will not stoope to inferiour Lures; having their minds so farre above, as they scorne to partake with them. It is rare to consider, how a wild <hi>Bird</hi> should be so brought to hand, and so well managed as to make us such pleasure in the ayre: but most of all to forgoe her native liberty and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and returne to her former servitude and diet. But in this, as in the rest, wee are taught to admire the great goodnesse and bounty of God, who hath not onely given us the Birds of the Ayre, with their flesh to feed us, with their voice to cheere us, but with their flight to delight us. The <hi>Eagle,</hi> which is indeed the Prince of Birds, and the <hi>prime Hawke,</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served much among the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in all their Auguries: so as an <hi>Eagle</hi> hovering in the Aire,<note place="margin">

Albeit, some there was among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who made small account of them: so as <hi>Claudius Pulcher,</hi> when in taking his <hi>Auspicia,</hi> or the predictions of his successe before <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Pullets</hi> would not feed, <hi>He commanded they should be plunged in the sea, that they might drinke, seeing they would not eat.</hi>

                     </note> It is the saying of an ancient Father. <hi>That the piercing eye of the Eagle exceeds the sight of all other birds:</hi> being of such sharpe sight, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting the beames of the Sunne fixed upon her, she can looke upon the Sunne without shutting her eyes, which are not to be dazled, shine the Sunne never so brightly. So as it is said, shee makes a tryall of her brood when they are but young, by mounting up, and fixing their eyes against the Sunne: of which, if any be so tender-eyed, as they cannot looke upon it, shee disclaimes them; but such whose sharpe sight can look sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly upon it, shee tenders them as her selfe. Whence many secret and sacred uses might be gathered (for this is but the type of a divine Morall) if I should insist upon the exposition of that blessed Father; but I must briefly descend to speake of the <hi>Moderate</hi> use of this <hi>Recreation.</hi>

                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:45431:60"/>This pleasure, as it is a princely delight, so it moveth many to be so dearely enamoured of it, as they will undergoe any charge, rather then forgoe it: which makes me recall to mind a merry tale which I have read, to this effect.
Divers men having entred into discourse, touching the superfluous care (I will not say folly) of such as kept <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Hawkes</hi> for <hi>Hawking</hi>; one <hi>Paulus</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> stood up and spake: <q>Not without cause (quoth hee) did that foole of <hi>Millan</hi> laugh at these; and being entreated to tell the tale, hee thus proceeded; Vpon a time (quoth hee) there was a Citizen of <hi>Millan,</hi> a Physician for such as were distracted of Lunaticke; who tooke upon him within a certaine time to cure such as were brought unto him. And hee cured them after this sort: He had a plat of ground neere his house, and in it a pit of corrupt and stinking water, wherein hee bound naked such as were mad to a stake, some of them knee-deepe, others to the groin, and some others deeper, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of their madnesse; where he so long pined them with water and hunger, till they seemed sound. Now amongst others, there was one brought, whom hee had put thigh-deepe in water: who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fifteene dayes began to recover, beseeching the Physician that hee might be taken out of the water. The Physician taking compassion of him, tooke him out, but with this condition, that hee should not goe out of the roome. Having obeyed him certaine dayes, he gave him liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to walke up and downe the house, but not to passe the out-gate; while the rest of his companions, which were many, remaining in the water, diligently observed their Physicians command. Now it chanced, as on a time he stood at the gate, (for out hee durst not goe, for feare he should returne to the pit) hee beckned to a young <hi>Gentleman</hi> to come unto him, who had a <hi>Hawke</hi> and two Spaniels, being moved with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty thereof; for, to his remembrance, before hee fell mad, hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seene the like. The young <hi>Gentleman</hi> being come unto him; Sir (quoth he) I pray you heare me a word or two, and answer me at your pleasure. What is this you ride on (quoth hee) and how doe you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him? This is a Horse (replyed he) and I keepe him for <hi>Hawking.</hi> But what call you that, you carry on your fist, and how doe you use it? This is a <hi>Hawke</hi> (said hee) and I use to fly with it at Pluver and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge. But what (quoth he) are these which follow you, what doe they, or wherein doe they profit you? These are dogges (said he) and necessary for <hi>Hawking,</hi> to find and retrive my game. And what were these Birds worth, for which you provide so many things, if you should reckon all you take for a whole yeere? Who answering, hee knew not well, but they were worth a very little, not above six crownes. The man replyed; what then may be the charge you are at with your Horse, Dogges and <hi>Hawke</hi>? Some fifty crownes, said hee. Whereat, as one wondring at the folly of the young <hi>Gentleman:</hi> Away, away Sir, I pray you quickly, and fly hence before our Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian returne home: for if he find you here, as one that is maddest man alive, hee will throw you into his Pit, there to be cured with others, that have lost their wits; and more then all others, for hee will set you chin-deepe in the water. Inferring hence, that the use or exercise of <hi>Hawking,</hi> is the greatest folly, unlesse sometimes used by such as are of good estate, and for <hi>Recreation</hi> sake.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is this pleasure or <hi>Recreation</hi> herein taxed, but the excessive and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45431:61"/>
immoderate expence which many are at in maintaining this pleasure: Who as they should be wary in the expence of their <hi>coine,</hi> so much more circumspect in their expence of <hi>time.</hi>

                     </note> So as in a word, I could wish young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> never to be so taken with this pleasure, as to lay aside the dispatch of more serious occasions, for a flight of feathers in the Ayre. The Physician saith, that it is the best exercise which is, <hi>ad ruborem, non ad sudorem</hi>; refreshing the spirits, and stirring up the blood a little, but not putting a man into any great sweat: for hee that makes his <hi>Recreation</hi> a toyle, makes himselfe likewise Pleasures thrall. Refresh your spirits, stirre up your blood, and enable your bodies by <hi>moderate</hi> exercise: but avoid mixing of distemper with your pleasure, for that were not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, but depresse the spirits; not to stirre up, but stop the course of blood; not to enable, but enfeeble the body. And so I descend to the next branch, treating of <hi>Recreations</hi> best sorting with the quality of a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>

Of all those which I have formerly touched and treated, there is none but may be approved and entertained with an equall indifferencie, being (as I have said) tempered and moderated with discretion. But some there are I have not touched, which may be so much the more admired, forasmuch as they are by our young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> usually affected; yea, and as especiall Ornaments to grace and accomplish them, generally esteemed: as <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> and <hi>Dancing</hi>; the one to accommodate him for the <hi>Court,</hi> the other for the <hi>Campe.</hi> Of which two <hi>Recreations,</hi> to give my opinion freely, there is required a knowledge; but respectively to such (I meane) as onely intend to <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Gallant</hi> it: for these shall have occasion to make use of their knowledge, in the <hi>one</hi> to grace and beautifie them; in the <hi>other</hi> to shield and defend them. Yet in neither of these would I have them to imitate their masters: for so may they turne <hi>Cowards,</hi> and so shew themselves <hi>true Fencers.</hi> Or in their <hi>Dancing</hi> use those mimicke tricks which our apish professants use; but with a reserved grace to come off bravely and sprightly, rather then with an affected curiosity. You shall see some of these come forth so punctually, as if they were made up in a fute of Wainscot, treading the ground as if they were foundred. Others you shall see, so supple and pliable in their joynts, as you would take them to be some Tumblers; but what are these but <hi>Iacke-an-Apes</hi> in gay clothes? But others there are, and these onely praise-worthy, who with a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full presence gaine them respect. For in exercises of this kind (sure I am) those onely deserve most commendation, which are performed with least affectation.</p>
                  <p>Now I have heard of some who could doe all this; shew an excellent grace in their carriage; expresse themselves rare proficients in all School-tricks; being so much admired as who but they: yet observe the cloze, and they spoile all with an English trick, they cannot leave it when it is well. It is said of <hi>Apelles,</hi> that hee found fault with <hi>Protogenes,</hi> in that hee could not hold his hands from his Table: and right so fares it with these young <hi>Cavalieroes,</hi> when they have shewne all that may be shewne
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45431:61"/>
to give content, striving to shew one tricke above <hi>Ela,</hi> they halt in the conclusion.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Fence-play,</hi> I have knowne some puffed up with a presumption of skill, to have beene too apt in giving offence; so as of professors of worth, they became practisers of wrong. But see their unhappinesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this they doe either for vaine glory, being ambitious after fame; or else out of a quarrelling disposition, being no lesse apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or apprehend the smallest occasion of offence, then to prosecute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon occasion offered.

                     <hi>Store-house</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> you shall find better meanes, then all the <hi>Helpes</hi> of <hi>Discourse</hi> which our weake Pamphleters can publish, to enable you for discourse in all companies. For to restraine or tye your selves to a set forme of discourse, as if you were to doe nothing without rules, were too pedanticall: besides, you should be sometimes so scantled, for want of subjects, that unlesse the subject whereof you are to discourse fall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily within your owne Element, your Ship for want of Sea-roome would runne a-ground. Whereas <hi>History</hi> (the sweetest <hi>Recreation</hi> of the mind) will afford variety, (being not curtaild by <hi>Epitome's,</hi> which are the <hi>Moths</hi> of <hi>History</hi>) both for table-talke to delight, and discourse of more serious consequence. Which in my opinion would better seeme a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> then to entertaine time in nothing but the cry of <hi>Dogs,</hi> or flight of <hi>Hawks</hi>; which, as they are Gentlemanly pleasures, and worthily approved (as I formerly noted) so are they to be used but onely as pleasures and <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> of which to speake sparingly were much better, then onely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of them, as if our whole reading were in them. Neither doe I speake this without just cause; for I have noted this fault in many of our younger brood of <hi>Gentry</hi>; who, either for want of Education in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or their owne neglect of Learning, have no sooner attained to the strength of making their fist a Pearch for a <hi>Hawke,</hi> but by the helpe of some bookes of Faulconry, whereby they are instructed in the words of Art, the will runne division upon discourse of this pleasure: whereas, if at any time they be interrupted by occasion of some other conference, these <hi>High-flyers</hi> are presently to be <hi>mewed</hi> up, for they are taken from their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> let me advise you in a word, so to entertaine time in <hi>Recreation,</hi> as the pleasure you take therein, draw not your minds from more serious and usefull employments. I have proposed to you, and made choice for you, of some <hi>Recreations</hi> which may no lesse delight and benefit your minds, then these other active delights doe your bodies; use them, and you shall find such pleasure in them, as you may perceive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and pleasure so equally mixed, as if at first intended to make your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light perfect.

I doe not like of this eagernesse after pleasure; for it argues too much sensuality: The minde should be so tempred, as it may shew an indifferencie to the use of pleasure. Which I have surely found, as a maine errour in most part of young <hi>Gentlemen</hi>; whose ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appetite so unmeasurably pursuing the quest of pleasure, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine it selfe from expressing outwardly, the love it conceives to such a pleasure inwardly. So as I have observed some intraunced (as it were) with joy in the chace of <hi>Hare,</hi> or the flight of <hi>Hawke</hi>; which in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion argued much lightnesse: for no sooner was their pleasure at a stay or default, then all their former delight was turned to a contrary passion. I commend therefore his resolution who said; <hi>Hee was never so over-joyed with pleasure, but he thought it good to allay that surpassing joy, with the remembrance of the end of that pleasure.</hi> It is an excellent thing to moderate our joyes, by considering the shortnesse of them: and to allay the height of them, by observing what breaches or intermissions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45431:66"/>
are incident to them. Wherefore above all it becommeth a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to be circumspect in this kinde, for even by his outward carriage may his weakenesse be discovered.

                     </note> should be so overtaken with joy, as to die with excesse thereof. The like wee reade of <hi>Argia</hi> the prophetesse, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried in a chariot of gold to the Temple by her two sons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at shee conceived no lesse joy than if her two sonnes had beene invested with the title of <hi>Emperours,</hi> through excessive joy immediately died. But these passions rather become women then men, who should bee themselves still, but especially when they feele any such conceit under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them. It is written of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> that meditating one day with himselfe, how hee had never any thing which crossed him all his life, but enjoyed all successe both at home and abroad, so as he became feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his foes, and powerfull to his friends, resolved to try how he might crosse his good fortune, by a voluntary incurring of losing that he did exceedingly love. Wherefore one day hee went unto the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, where taking off a Ring which he did especially tender, he threw it into the Sea, intending thereby to crosse himselfe, whom fortune would not: but see how <hi>Policrates</hi> was crossed in his crosses: for not long after a fisherman came and presented him the Ring hee had lost, having found it in the belly of a fish; which did not a little trouble the <hi>Prince,</hi> saying; <hi>I perceive the gods owe me a displeasure, which they will doe when I least expect it, and make me so much the more unfortunate, in that I never knew what misfortune meant.</hi> Which he afterwards found true, being deprived both of Crowne and Dignitie. Certainly, there is no meanes better to attemper and allay ones joy conceived in the pursuit of any pleasure, then to crosse himselfe in the quest thereof: for this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of true manhood, when one can master his affections, and stay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in that he loves. Neither is this hard to doe being once assayed; for wee shall finde more true content in the <hi>moderation</hi> of our pleasure, then in the pleasure it selfe. I have heard of some young <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who purposely crossing themselves in some one pleasure or <hi>Recreation</hi> which they loved, and betaking themselves to their chamber, apprehended such a deepe impression of the fruition of their pleasure, as they visibly (as it were) enjoyed that pleasure in their chamber which others enjoyed in the field. That conceit is strong I will not deny; but that it should worke so strange and strong an effect, I am doubtfull; yet whosoe're they be (if any such there bee) sure I am, they may well crosse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in pleasures abroad; having such pleasant conceits within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I would have young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to use <hi>moderation</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise it selfe; so would I have them observe like <hi>moderation</hi> in their expence or charge requisite for that exercise or pleasure.

Albeit I have heard of one, who (much subject to this imperfection) chanced to be reproved by his friend, who in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and familiar sort wished him either to learne more patience in gaming, or else to surcease from game.
<q>What (quoth hee to his friend) dost thou thinke I am a stocke or stone, that I should have no sense of my losse? Surely I thinke there is no man that knowes how he comes by his money, but will bee moved for the losse of it.</q>
But I approve not of his <hi>Maxime</hi>: You shall see an old <hi>Gamester</hi> beare all crosse chances with an equall and undejected spirit, whereas our young <hi>Gamesters</hi> (for passion is most incident to Novices) upon a crosse throw, pull their haire, teare the Cards, stampe and fret like gumm'd grogram: so far they are from patience for want of experience. Their younger and unmellowed yeeres never felt the crosses of a <hi>Gamester,</hi> and therefore can hardly digest them when they come.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Assuetis nulla sit passio.</hi>
                     </note> This the Philosopher seemes to confirme, saying; <hi>Nothing can be violent, being once habituate,</hi> For use or custome as it makes perfectnesse, so it begets a composednesse of mind, to endure with patience whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the extremity of fortune may inflict.</p>
                  <p>But now in my discourse of <hi>Passion,</hi> which makes men so much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themselves as they will, rather then want a fit subject to revenge their ill fortunes on, minister occasion of offence to their dearest friends; there is one thing which I would have our young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to take heed of, and that is, in their heate and height of passion to forsweare ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at all, or with such an one, because they had never fortune to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers at his hands; yet as men carelesse of what they sweare, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to what they formerly protested, presently fall to game againe with the selfe-same company which they had so lately abjured. A dolefull and wofull example we had of this, within these few yeares, of <hi>one,</hi> whose more eminent parts interested him greatly in his Countries hope; yet having dipt his hand in blood, was, according to iustice and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45431:67"/>
equity adjudged to die, which was afterwards accordingly executed. This <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose education had beene ever with the best, and in the most frequented places, used much gaming, at which hee had generally ill fortune; so as feeling the smart of it, he resolved, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his resolution with a solemne protestation, that if ever he gamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he might be hanged: which imprecation was so usuall with him, as nothing more frequent. But see this <hi>Gentlemans</hi> miserable end! With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few yeares after, hee suffered in himselfe what he had so often wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for himselfe. Take example hence, you, I say, who are so prodigall in oathes, vowing, protesting and swearing, in your heat of <hi>passion,</hi> what you are no lesse apt to forget having cooled your <hi>passion</hi>: For though you little feare the effecting of that which you wish to your selves, yet time may come when you would wish you had not used those impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations upon your selves.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing likewise which I could wish young <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to bee mindefull of, and it is to make distinction of times for their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations</hi>: for as all times are not for all pleasures, no more are pleasures for all times. Wee are therefore to reserve so much time for our more serious affaires, as not to give way to pleasure or delight, and so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what wee should principally intend.<note place="margin">

So as, even in matters of pleasure or <hi>Recreation,</hi> I could wish you to betake you to those games which may best benefit your understanding; as in games at Cards, the <hi>Maw</hi> requires a quicke conceit or present pregnancy; the <hi>Gleeke</hi> (because of variety) requires a retentive memory; the <hi>Cribbage</hi> a recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected fancy; the <hi>Pinache</hi> quick and vn-enforced dexterity. These are good exercises of the minde, and such, as being made <hi>Recreations</hi> onely, and no tricks to circumvent, may afford some helpe or benefit to the <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> understanding.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, doe not (<hi>Theotimus</hi>-like) preferre lust before your eyes; preferre not any profit you are to reape by gaming, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward benefit which you may reape by conceiving.

For, as there may bee a <hi>Wolfe</hi> in <hi>Sheeps cloathing,</hi> so there may bee a <hi>worldly mind</hi> in a <hi>Hermits dwelling.</hi> Mans security is the Divels opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which may bee found in the <hi>Wildernesse</hi> as well as in the <hi>World,</hi> neither is the one place lesse subject to temptation then the other. The <hi>Wildernesse</hi> is secret, yet Christ was tempted in it. The <hi>Night</hi> is silent, yet doth that princely Prophet warne us, <hi>To lift up our hands in the night watches of temptation.</hi> For the life of man, as it is a <hi>continuall temptation,</hi> so is there neither time, place, sexe nor condition exempted from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Monks Cell</hi> and the Monarchs <hi>Court</hi> are equally subject to it. This, devout <hi>Bernard</hi> seemes to confirme in his description of such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed a Monastick life, saying; <hi>They were large promisers, but slow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers; faire tongued flatterers, but snarling back-biters; simple-seeming dissemblers, but malicious betrayers.</hi> Againe, <hi>Wee</hi> (saith hee) <hi>receive all in our Monasteries, in hope to better them, whereas in the Court it is more usuall to receive such as are good, then to make them good: for wee have found by experience, that more good men have decreased then profited in it.</hi> Hence wee may conclude this point, that no place is priviledged from temptation, neither <hi>Cell</hi> nor <hi>Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but those places are, and have beene ever most subject to danger, where men were left to themselves to enter lists with temptation: Which proceedeth either from the naturall frailty of man, in that hee falleth from best to worst; or his want of judgement to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne best from worst: whence the Poet most divinely concludeth,
<q>
                        <l>When want of judgement reignes in humane brest,</l>
                        <l>The best is ta'ne for worst, the worst for best.</l>

                  <p>GOD in his sacred wisdome having created man, thought it not good that hee should be alone; and therefore made him an helpe meet for him. It was an excellent saying of that sage <hi>Cynicke,</hi> who seeing a young man all alone by himselfe, and demanding of him what hee was doing, <hi>I am talking</hi> (quoth the young man) <hi>with my selfe; Take heed</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou talke not with thine Enemy.</hi> For howsoever <hi>Cato</hi> might say, in respect of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45431:69"/>
the inward delight he tooke in Contemplation, <hi>I am never lesse alone, then when alone</hi>; wee shall find this true, that man is never more ready to give way to temptation, then when hee is alone.

So as it may seeme, it is not given to man to <hi>love</hi> and to be <hi>wise</hi>; because the Lover is ever blinded with affection towards his beloved; so as, hee dis-esteemes honour, profit, yea life it selfe, so hee may gratifie his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

Is hee wise, who dependeth so much on his owne advice, as if all wit and wisedome were treasured in his braine? Is hee wise, who being sicke would not be visited; poore, and would not bee succoured; afflicted, and would not be comforted; throwne downe, and would not be raised? Surely in the same case is hee, who fleights the purchase of a <hi>friend,</hi> preferring his owne profit before so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable a prize. There is none, whether hee be valiant, or a profest coward, but may stand in need of a <hi>friend</hi> in a corner. For be he valiant, hee stands in need of a <hi>friend</hi> to second him; if a coward, hee needs one to support him: Therefore, whosoever wanteth fortitude, whether it be in mind or body, let him embrace <hi>friendship</hi>; for if his weaknesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the mind, hee shall find a choice receit in the brest of his <hi>friend,</hi> to strengthen and corroborate him, so as griefe may assaile or assault him, but it cannot dismay or amate him. Againe, if his weaknesse proceed from the body, that weaknesse is supplied by the strength of his <hi>friend,</hi> who will be an eye to direct him, and a foot to sustaine him. <hi>Telephus,</hi> when hee could find none amongst his <hi>friends</hi> to cure his wound, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his enemy to doe it: and hee who purposed to kill <hi>Prometheus</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> opened his impostume with his sword.

They will lay heavy burdens on others shoulders, which they will be loath to touch with the tip of their finger. The Taskes which they impose on others are insupportable, the pressures they lay on themselves very easie and tolerable. Of this ranke was <hi>Aglataidas,</hi> of whom that noble and faithfull Historian <hi>Comines</hi> writeth, saying: While he served in the Campe hee was of a most harsh austere condition, doing many things perversly, and desiring rather to be feared then loved.

So as, these <hi>Timonists,</hi> are to be cashiered for two reasons; first, for their owne harsh and rough condition; secondly, for the unjust grounds of their opinion, which dissents so farre from society, as it disallowes of <hi>Marriage,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes appointed to preserve society.

Wherefore ground your <hi>Choice</hi> on Love, so shall you not chuse but like; making this your conclusion;
<q>
                        <l>To her in <hi>Hymens</hi> bands I'le nere be tide,</l>
                        <l>Whom Love hath not espous'd and made my Bride.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>For what miseries have ensued on <hi>enforced Marriages,</hi> there is no Age but may record: where rites enforced, made the hands no sooner joyned then their minds divorced, bidding adieu to Content, even at that instant when those unhappy rites were solemnized.</p>
                  <p>The next Observance in making your <hi>Choice,</hi> is matter of <hi>Portion</hi>; a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines not altogether to be neglected; for if she be a good wife, a good <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> makes her no worse: and if an ill one, she had need of a <hi>Portion</hi> to make her better. For he hath a hard bargaine that hath neither <hi>Portion</hi> in a <hi>Wife,</hi> nor out of a <hi>Wife.</hi> We would account him a weake and simple man, that would enter bond without either consideration, or security to keepe him harmeles. You are sure to be <hi>bound,</hi> be not so far from consideration, as have nothing to shew for your self for your own security. I can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his wit who having made <hi>choice</hi> of a <hi>Proportion,</hi> moving enough to gain affection, was not content so, but he must know further touching her <hi>Portion</hi>; that as

                  <p>Having now made <hi>choice</hi> of your <hi>wife,</hi> being so well disposed (as it is to be intended,) shee should not bee much restrained; for shee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready resolved to bee no gadder, but, in resemblance of the <hi>Snaile,</hi> a good house-keeper.</p>

patience converse with others? For <hi>Marriage</hi> is no such merchandize, as to promise returne with advantage to all factors. There is a ceremoniall custome used by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> upon the <hi>Ascention</hi> day, to goe in a vessell called the <hi>Bucentor,</hi> made Galley-wise, with other Nobles a mile or two into the Sea: casting a Ring into it, (by which ceremony they wed the Sea) that it may never leave the Citie upon dry land.

It were wisdome therefore to beare what wee may not avoid: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that as the <hi>Marriage</hi> state is subject to many occurrences, so it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with sundry excellent priviledges,<note place="margin">

                  <p>First, they are good to <hi>Pray</hi> with; for such as these only were they who assembled together in one place, imploying their time religiously in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, supplications, and giving of thankes, and honouring him, whom all Powers and Principalities doe honour with divine Melodie: which was expressed not so much with the <hi>noise</hi> of the <hi>mouth,</hi> as with the joyfull <hi>note</hi> of the <hi>heart:</hi> nor with the <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>lips,</hi> as with the soule-solacing <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi>; nor with the <hi>consonance</hi> of the <hi>voice,</hi> as with the <hi>concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of the <hi>will:</hi> For, as the precious stone <hi>Diacletes,</hi> though it have many rare and excellent soveraignties in it, yet it loseth them all, if it be put in a dead-mans mouth: so <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is the onely pearle and jewell of a Christian, though it have many rare and exquisite vertues in it, yet it loseth them every one, if it be put into a dead-mans mouth, or into a mans heart either, that is dead in sinne, and doth not knocke with a pure hand. So many rare presidents have former times afforded, all most ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable in this kind, as to make repetition of them, would crave an ample volume; wee will therefore onely touch some speciall ones, whose devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath deserved a reverence in us towards them, and an imitation in us after them.
<hi>Nazianzin</hi> in his Epitaph for his sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> writeth, <q>that she was so given to <hi>Prayer,</hi> that her knees seemed to cleave to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45431:80"/>
earth, and to grow to the very ground, by reason of incessancie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in <hi>Prayer</hi>; so wholly was this Saint of God dedicated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Dialogues writeth, that his Aunt <hi>Trasilla</hi> being dead was found to have her elbowes as hard as horne; which hardnesse she got by leaning to a deske, at which shee used to pray; so continued was the devotion of a zealous professor. <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his History wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of our Lord, had knees as hard as Camels knees, benummed and bereaved of all sense and feeling, by reason of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall kneeling in <hi>Prayer</hi>; so sweet was this Taske, undertaken for Gods honour, where practice made that an exercise or solace, which the sensuall man maketh a toyle or anguish.</q>

                        <hi>Hierome</hi> in the life of <hi>Paul</hi> the Eremite writeth, that hee was found dead, kneeling upon his knees, holding up his hands, lifting up his eyes: <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> so that the very dead corps seemed yet to live, and by a kind of zealous and religious gesture to pray still unto God.</q>
So transported or rather intraunced was the spirit of this lovely Dove, as even in death hee expressed the practice of his life: These followed <hi>Augustines</hi> rule in their forme of <hi>Prayer: seeke</hi> (saith he) <hi>what you seeke, but seeke not where you seeke.</hi> Seeke Christ, that's a good what. Seeke what you seeke; but seeke him not in <hi>bed,</hi> that is an ill where. But seeke not where you seeke: <hi>Moses</hi> found Christ not in a <hi>soft bed,</hi> but in a <hi>bramble bush.</hi> For as wee cannot goe to heaven on beds of down, no more can these devotions pierce heaven which are made on beds of down. Albeit, every place is good, for as no place is freed from occcasion of sinne, so no place should be free from <hi>Prayer,</hi> which breaketh downe the <hi>Partition wall</hi> of our sinne. But certainely those <hi>downie Prayers</hi> taste too much of the flesh,<note place="margin">

But these men, whom we now have in hand, and whom wee have made <hi>choice</hi> of, as fit companions to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi> and <hi>commerce</hi> with, are men of such singular discretion, as they will preferre silence before discovery of their ignorance.<note place="margin">These ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that maxim; He that knoweth how to speak well, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also when he must hold his peace.</note> These know for what end or purpose the <hi>bars</hi> and <hi>gates</hi> of the <hi>lips</hi> and <hi>teeth</hi> (like a double ward) were ordained to limit or restraine the <hi>Tongue.</hi> These observe, how man hath two <hi>eyes</hi> to see with, two <hi>nostrils</hi> to breath with, two <hi>hands</hi> to labour with, two <hi>feet</hi> to walke with, but one <hi>Tongue</hi> to talke with; implying that one <hi>Tongue</hi> requires as much government as any two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all the body.

                     <q>Where two meeke men meet together, their conference (<hi>saith</hi> Bernard) is sweet and profitable; where one man is meeke, it is profitable; where neither, it proves pernicious.</q>
Neither in mildnesse and affability onely, but in the highest pitch of wisdome, is their discourse seated. Whence it was (as I have heretofore noted) that <hi>Aristotle</hi> debating of the convenience and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of discourse before <hi>Alexander</hi>; maintained,
<q>That none where to bee

Which wisdome of discourse hath beene formerly so much affected, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth that <hi>Plato</hi> came forth of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> for no other cause but onely to see his deare friend <hi>Phocion</hi> the Philosopher, and to converse with him. This caused <hi>Nicaula,</hi> the Queene of <hi>Saba,</hi> to travell from her owne Countrey to <hi>Iudea,</hi> to heare the wisdome of <hi>Salomon:</hi> yea, peruse those <hi>Athenian Nights</hi> in <hi>Gellius,</hi> how, and in what excellent manner, with what variety of discourse, propriety of conference, strength of arguments those <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-nights</hi> were bestowed, and you shall find there fit companions for Scholers, Souldiers, and all <hi>Generous</hi> professours.</p>
                  <p>Neither are they consorts onely fit to <hi>converse</hi> with, but to <hi>commerce</hi> with also; for these are no <hi>bankrupt</hi> Merchants, or desperate Factors, who use to dispence with conscience and credit, rather then in a conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sort discharge their credit.

Yea, not onely our common <hi>friends,</hi> but even those who sleepe in our own bosome; as <hi>Dalilah</hi> plaid with <hi>Samson,</hi> either simply or subtilly, will discover our secret'st counsels to our enemy: so as, wee may take up the complaint of <hi>Samson,</hi>

Whence we may gather, how dangerous it is to discover the secrets of our heart, even to those to whom we have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our heart: for wee ought not to give our <hi>friend</hi> power over us. This is seconded by a divine precept:<note place="margin">Ecclus 33.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Give not thy sonne and wife, thy brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest; and give not away thy substance to another, lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same againe.</hi> Whence wee are advised to a two-fold <hi>reservancy</hi>; first, in <hi>concealing</hi> our secrets; secondly, in <hi>reteining</hi> our <hi>substance.</hi> For the <hi>first,</hi> hee explaines himselfe more fully in the ensuing verse; <hi>As long as thou livest, and hast breath, give not thy selfe over to any person.</hi> For the <hi>second,</hi> hee gives a reason in the end of the former verse; <hi>Give not away thy substance to another, lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same againe.</hi> Of which two parts, and the <hi>Reservancy</hi> which we are to observe in either, my purpose is briefly and plainely to intreat; and first of the first, to wit, <hi>Reservancy</hi> of <hi>secrets,</hi> wherein I will be as briefe as the quality of the Subject will suffer me.</p>
                  <p>It is said of <hi>Geese,</hi> that when at the change of seasons, they passe from <hi>Cilicia</hi> over the mountaine <hi>Taurus,</hi> which abounds with Eagles, they carry stones in their bills, for feare their cry should discover them to their enemies. <hi>Reason</hi> should teach us that which <hi>Nature</hi> hath instructed them, lest by diverting from the rule of reason, we become inferiour to

                  <p>Yea, but it may be objected, It may sometimes fall out that a <hi>friend</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe the office of a <hi>friend,</hi> but by discovering the secret purpose or practice of another.

                  <p>To which objection it may be thus answered; That, as amongst evill men there can be no true friendship continued, so neither are the <hi>Secrets</hi> of such men, tending ever to mischiefe and effusion of innocent bloud, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45431:82"/>

                  <p>Yea, but it may be againe objected, That admit this were so, may wee not impart our griefes to a <hi>friend,</hi> or communicate our counsels to one, whom we have made triall of to be trusty and faithfull?</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, That we may, but with this provision, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unrip our bosome so farre, as to give our <hi>friend</hi> power over us, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which may either concerne life, state, or name.

                  <p>Yea, but <hi>friendship,</hi> being one soule ruling two hearts, or one heart dwelling in two bodies, loseth her prerogative, if excluded from parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in her <hi>friends</hi> griefes or comforts: for would you thinke it well, that your <hi>friends</hi> should finde you sad, and so leave you; sicke without ministring any comfort to you; or poore, without releeving you?

Now, how should he comfort you, who is wholly ignorant of the cause of your discomfort? or how minister any receits to you, when he knowes not what distempers you? or how releeve you, when hee knowes not of any poverty that hath befallen you?</p>
                  <p>Whereto I answer, that these are not to be numbred among those <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets</hi> which we hold unfitting to be imparted or discovered, by one <hi>friend</hi> to another; for the discovery of these may profit, but cannot prejudice us: Whereas, the disclosing of such secrets as concerne our name, may afterwards brand us with infamie; or such as concerne our state, may bring us to poverty; or such as concerne our life, may weave our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py webbe in a fearefull tragedy.

If wee have discovered any <hi>Secret</hi> to them, which may prejudice us being revealed, wee shall be sure to have that <hi>Secret</hi> vented, if our hollow coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour be not rewarded. Are wee poore? though our state need not feare undoing, our <hi>secrets</hi> must be discovered, if the meanest may be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the discovery.</p>
                  <p>Thus no Ranke may be exempted, no degree freed from prejudice, where counsels are disclosed. Indeed sometimes it hapneth, that a <hi>friend</hi> discovers the <hi>secrets</hi> of a <hi>friend</hi>; because, out of the justnesse of himselfe, and the integrity of his owne conscience, which no respect will suffer him to violate, hee cannot endure the sinister or indirect practice of his <hi>friend,</hi> and therefore discovers it to give meanes of prevention to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Which may be instanced in the <hi>vicount</hi> of <hi>Melin</hi> his confession, who lying upon his death-bed here in <hi>England,</hi> disclosed the purpose of King <hi>Lewis</hi> his Master, to the chiefe Peeres and Barons of the Realme; who considering the inevitable danger into which they were falling, by giving free entrie to the <hi>French</hi> King,<note place="margin">

                     </note> wisely in time (and but in time) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed him, receiving their unhappy deposed King, to avoid an ensuing mischiefe. Now the occasion of this discovery, though it bee divers wayes conjectured, yet the probablest in my opinion is, to referre it to the compassion which <hi>Count Melin</hi> had of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, whose state had beene, to the judgement of all men, grievously shaken, had <hi>Lewis,</hi> as hee was already arrived, beene peaceably possessed of the same. Now to conclude this point, I hold that <hi>English</hi> Proverbe worthy our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, in affaires of <hi>Secrecie: One may keepe counsell, but two cannot:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that it is the safest and surest course to be a mans owne <hi>Secretary,</hi> so shall hee not give his <hi>friend</hi> power over him, but sleepe quietly without feare of discovery, having none but his owne brest to betray him to his enemy.</p>

                  <p>Oh <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> how many through too easie a hold have exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as a prey, to the avaritious desires of their followers: where many times it falleth out, that the <hi>servant</hi> is able to purchase his <hi>Master,</hi> having enriched himselfe by feeding his humour! Yet see the unthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of many of these; having made them a garment of their masters shreads, and raised themselves to a great estate by his prodigality, they can learne to put on a scornefull countenance towards their landlesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, entertaine him with contempt, forget his bounty, and ascribe all to their owne thriving providence, which proceed meerly from his profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. So well can these thriving <hi>Timists,</hi> who raise their fortunes from their masters ruines, shape themselves to all times, that they may profit by all meanes.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Acquaintance</hi> likewise, whose aimes as they extend onely to themselves, so they will use any indirect course, how irregular soever, to bring their purpose about. And of these, wee had a late example, even in our owne Countrey, and within the wals of this flourishing Citie: which example, that it might remaine to the memory of succeeding times, for the benefit whereof, as well as of these present, our labours should be addressed, I thought good here to set downe.
<q>There was a young <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whose profuser course having consumed much of his meanes, was enforced upon some present extremities urging him, to make a morgage of a peece of land, which peece was the very last which hee had left him: the money being lent and spent, and now the un-foreseene day of payment approaching, the young <hi>Gentleman</hi> driven to an exigent, made recourse by chance, to an ancient <hi>Acquaintance</hi> of his, by trade a <hi>Chandler,</hi> who was a monied man, and could find a <hi>friend</hi> in a corner, who upon a commodious bargaine would at any time bestead him of a good Summe. Hee, the <hi>Chandler</hi> I meane, noting what benefit the <hi>Morgage</hi> of the young <hi>Gentlemans</hi> land might be unto him, if he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his estate, which now lay a bleeding, and tooke the <hi>Morgage</hi> into
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45431:84"/>
his owne hand, concluded with the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and releeved his present wants, proposing a certaine day for redemption of the said <hi>Morgage:</hi> which was kindly accepted of by the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> little thinking how he fell from the fire into the flame, and by avoyding <hi>Charybdis,</hi> had fallen into <hi>Scylla.</hi> The time now drewneer, which was limited the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to redeeme the premisses: whence a double care or feare ensued; a feare and provident care in the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of procuring money to redeeme it; a feare in the <hi>Chandler,</hi> lest it should be redeemed, and so the hopes hee had of so beneficiall a bargaine frustrated. Which to prevent (marke the impiety of the age even in this one example) the <hi>Chandler</hi> against the day limited and prefixed, repaires to a consort of opportunate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents for his purpose; <hi>Assassinates</hi> fleshed in all mischiefe, and ready to embrace any motion, or engage themselves in any action, which might minister fuell to their riot. And these hee acquaints (as it seemes their <hi>Acquaintance</hi> was ancient) how hee knew of a rich <hi>Bootie</hi> for them, if they had hearts to attempt, and resolutions to effect, what their present wants enforced them to attempt. They desirous to heare of that booty, promising him reward if their purpose came to effect, pressed him (as little pressing needed to such a base <hi>instrument</hi>) that he would discover, where this booty might be purchased. Hee imparted his mind freely, and told them that such a <hi>Gentleman</hi> (being the same who had made a <hi>Morgage</hi> of his land unto him) was to come provided of a great Summe of money, upon such a day, and by such a place, as gave opportunity for the attempt, which they might easily obtaine, having none but himselfe and his man to resist them. They, at the first seemed jealous of him, imagining it was some fetch meerly to intrap and circumvent them; but being more confident upon his protestations, that his purpose was to benefit them, not to betray them; they generally consented to this plot, provided that they might have his company, not onely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, but share and partake with them: whereto the <hi>Chandler</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended, choosing rather to be an assistant in the practice, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of his purpose. To be short, vizards and disguises were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all things fitted, that such an attempt might be furthered: where, by direction of their <hi>Leader,</hi> they tooke their stand, where the unfortunate <hi>Gentlemen</hi> was to passe; who, within some few houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, came according to their expectance, provided of a Summe purposely to redeeme his estate (the last remainder of his fortunes) out of the hands of the <hi>Chandler</hi> But hee is intercepted and bid stand, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions admit no stay: and in briefe, stripped of all his money, and bound, hee and his man, and throwne into a gravell-pit, where we leave them; and returne to this perfidious <hi>Chandler,</hi> who expecting to be a sharer as well in the stake, as in the forfeiture of his estate, is by his witty <hi>Copesmates</hi> used after another sort then hee looked for; being bound hand and foot, and throwne into a ditch adjoyning; where hee remayned, till a Shepherds boy having occasion to come that way, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one pitiously mourning, drew neere to the place where hee heard the voice; but seeing one lye there bound in an ugly vizard, and disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed after an uncouth manner, as one afraid, hee run from him, albeit the <hi>Chandler</hi> humbly intreated him, to lend his helping hand to loose him. The noise which the <hi>Chandler</hi> made, desiring aid from the Shepherd, and the Shepherd denying aid to the <hi>Chandler,</hi> was now come to the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45431:84"/>
eare of the afflicted <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and his man: wherefore they sent out their complaint, as men pittifully distressed; which the Shepherd hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring came forthwith to the place where they lay bound, and seeing the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and his man, lent them his helping hand, and delivered them from their bands: directing them withall, to the Pit where the <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> his treacherous <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> lay; whom he knew by his disguise to be one of those, who had taken his money from him: but having pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off his vizard, and perceived him to be none but the <hi>Chandler,</hi> his professed <hi>friend,</hi> you may imagine what diversity of perplexed thoughts encountred him; but suspecting the worst, which after proved the truest, hee caused him to be brought before a <hi>Iustice,</hi> where he was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined touching the premisses, which, to his shame, he confessed, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himselfe to be both <hi>Actor</hi> and <hi>Authour</hi> of that persidious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot. For which, being committed, and legally tryed, hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged according to his desert, to receive the condigne punishment of death. Whose goods being confiscate, our late Prince of renowned me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, out of his royall compassion to the <hi>Gentlemans</hi> estate, allotted him so much in his princely bounty, as redeemed his engaged lands, reposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him therof to his great joy, &amp; an example to succeeding ages, not to repose too much confidence in the profession of <hi>Acquaintance.</hi>

                  <p>What admirable <hi>moderation</hi> divers ancient Princes have shewen, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their contempt to the glory and pompe of this life, Histories can afford sufficient examples; but to omit forraigne instances, my purpose is to insert here one of our owne; which, by how much more neere us, by so much deeper impression should it enforce in us. <hi>Canutus</hi> that was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute King almost of five kingdomes, somewhat before the Conquest, upon a time in his <hi>Progresse</hi> riding neere the <hi>Thames,</hi> light and sate downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the shore: then, as it were to try a conclusion, hee commanded the water being now ready to arise againe and to flow, not to come any neerer him: But the water keeping his naturall course, came up still higher and higher, till it began to wet him. Whereupon to his Nobles, which were about him, <hi>Yee call mee</hi> (sayes he) <hi>your King and Master, and so indeed I am; and yet loe yee, I cannot command so much as this little streame; but doe what I can that will doe still as it list.</hi> Whereupon presently hee posted to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and resigned his Crowne to the <hi>Crucifix</hi> there; neither could hee ever after this be perswaded to weare it any more. The like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to all princely, honours, shewed those memorable <hi>Saxons, Kingulfus, Iva, Ceodulphus, Eadbertus, Ethelredus, Keredus, Offa. Sebbi, Sigebertus.

into the hands of the Princes Electors, and with-drew himselfe in the yeere 1557. into a Monastery.

For these are they who have absolute soveraignty over their passions, and in prosperity scorne as much to be proud, as in adversity to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves base. Yea, they will rather entertaine the extreamest encounters that misery can lay upon them, then lose the least of that liberty of mind, with which their noble temper hath endued them. In briefe, those onely who dis-value sublunary things, esteeming them as they are, onely to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to our <hi>necessity,</hi> and not to reare them, as blind worldlings use, in the tabernacle of their heart to commit <hi>idolatry,</hi> keepe consort with this <hi>Definition</hi>; for the <hi>golden meane,</hi> as it is onely approved by them, so in a princely <hi>moderation</hi> of their affections, they are ever readiest to enter lists with their owne passions, that if any either exceed or come short of this meane, they may so square and hammer it till it bee reduced to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>meane.</hi> And let this suffice, for the <hi>Definition:</hi> we will now descend to the second branch, wherein wee intend to shew, <hi>that no vertue can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without Moderation,</hi> being indeed the temper which allayeth and aptly disposeth all our actions, making them equally seasoned, which otherwise would become violent and immoderate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:45431:92"/>AS <hi>Moderation</hi> is a <hi>subduer</hi> of every inordinate or indisposed <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> so is it a seasoner or temperer of all our actions, making them seeme worthy the title of vertuous,<note place="margin">

                     </note> which without this temper would appeare vicious. For without this <hi>Moderation,</hi> he that is liberall should incurre the name of prodigall, the frugall the name of miserable, the resolute be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med dissolute, the morall civill man a coward, the wise Stoicall, the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meerely formall, the just rigorous, the mercifull remisse. So defective is the structure of all vertues, wanting the sweet temper of <hi>Moderation</hi> to season them. Neither proceedeth this from the malevolent or uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable censures of men, as former times, have beene too apt to traduce or mis-interpret their best deservings, by aspersing some unworthy ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish upon their demerits: As in <hi>Rome,</hi> if the <hi>Pisoes</hi> bee frugall, they are censured-parcimonious; if the <hi>Metelli</hi> religious, they are taxed super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious; if the <hi>Appii</hi> popular, they are termed ambitious; if the <hi>Manlii</hi> austere, they are stiled tyrannous; if the <hi>Lelii</hi> wise, they are curious; the <hi>Publicolae</hi> aspiring if courteous; But meerely upon the want or deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of such <hi>actions,</hi> which are not tempered with <hi>Moderation.</hi> For to give instance in each kinde; how nobly and invincibly did <hi>Alexander</hi> the great beare himselfe in all exploits? how much feared abroad, and how much loved at home? how affable to his friends, and how terrible to his foes?

                     </note> But what meanes may be used to procure this longing and hungring desire in us? Not <hi>Luscious</hi> or curious <hi>fare</hi>; for that will move us rather to all inordinate motions, then the exercise of Devotion: no, it is <hi>fasting</hi> that makes the soule to be <hi>feasting</hi>; it is mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the flesh, that fattens the spirit. For it is sumptuous fare, that is the soules <hi>snare: Sagina corporis, Sagena cordis:</hi> It is the net which intangles the heart of man, drawing her from the love of her best beloved <hi>Spouse,</hi> to dote on the adulterate embraces of sensuall beauty. Neither is it <hi>fare,</hi> but delight in <hi>fare</hi>; not simply the meat, but the desire or liquorish appetite, which produceth those odious effects: as for example, when the loose affected man maketh choice or election of such meats, purposely to beget in him an ability, as well as desire, to his sensuall pleasures. Whence a learned Father most divinely concludeth: <hi>I feare not</hi> (saith he) <hi>the uncleanenesse of meats in respect of their difference, but uncleannesse of desire in respect of concupiscence. Neither doth the kind or difference of the meat</hi> (saith another) <hi>pollute so much, as the act of disobedience, eating that which is inhibited.</hi> Now to propose a rule of direction; not any one surer or safer can be set downe, then what an ancient Father hath already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. <hi>Wee nourish our bodies</hi> (saith hee) <hi>lest by being too much weakned, they faile us; and wee weaken them by abstinence, lest by too much feeding them, they presse us.</hi> So then, temper your desires, that neither too much restraint may enfeeble them, nor excesse surcharge them. For as the body being weakned, the soule becomes strengthned; so where the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes too much enfeebled, the performance of spirituall exercises is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled: but in all things, take heed of pampering a <hi>disobedient servant</hi>; hee sleeps in your bosome, that imagines mischiefe against you. Who, the more hee is fostered, the more is your danger furthered: the more hee is cockered, the more is your heat of devotion cooled: chastise then this domesticke enemy in time, for hee participates of the nature of a Serpent, who spreads most his poyson, where hee receives harbouring. Now as the Philosophers observe of the <hi>Hart,</hi> that being pursued by dogs in hunting, by reason of heat, and losse of breath, being tired with the chase, hee hasteneth to the <hi>Rivers</hi>; or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in fight with a <hi>Serpent,</hi> or stung, or wounded by him, while the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> resteth on the the ground, hee seeketh to some cold <hi>Fountaine,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the affection of the venome received, may be abated, and his former vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour restored. Even so, such as are wounded, and strucken of the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> must have recourse to Christ, that <hi>Fountaine</hi> of living waters, that all sensuall desires arising from excessive delight in delicious <hi>fare,</hi> may be the better allayed. Neither onely is restraint to be used in the choice, and change of <hi>meats,</hi> but in the excessive use of <hi>drinkes.</hi> The reasons are two; the one is, it is an enemy to the knowledge of God; the other is this, it is held to be an enfeebler or impairer of the <hi>memorative</hi> parts; for you shall ever note that deepe drinkers have but shallow memories. Their common saying is, <hi>Let us drowne care in healths:</hi> which drowning of care makes them so forgetfull of themselves, as carried away with a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45431:97"/>
brutish appetite, they onely intend their present delight, without reflexion to what is past, or due preparation to what may succeed.

I doe not approve of these, who fly from their Countrey, as if they were ashamed of her, or had committed something unworthy of her. How blame-worthy then are these <hi>Court-comets,</hi> whose onely delight is to admire themselves?

They will not take it as their <hi>fathers</hi> tooke it: their Countrey houses must bee barred up, left the poore passenger should expect what is impossible to finde, releefe to his want, or a supply to his necessity. No, the cage is opened, and all the birds are fled; not one crum of comfort remaining to succour a distressed poore one. Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, which was once a <hi>relique</hi> of <hi>Gentry,</hi> and a knowne <hi>cognizance</hi> to all ancient houses hath lost her title, meerely through discontinuance: and <hi>great houses,</hi> which were at first founded to releive the poore, and such needfull passengers as travelled by them, are now of no use but only as <hi>Way-markes</hi> to direct them.

Yet see the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of many of those rioters! Though they consume their meanes, yet is the port they live at meane: for they have abridged their <hi>familie,</hi> reduced their attendants to a small number, and (unnecessary expences set aside) drawne themselves to within as narrow a compasse as possibly they may. For to take a view of those which are in ordinary roule; you shall finde none but a Page, a Coachman, a Lackey, and perchance a Cooke.

But this needs little pressing: for experience shewes, that very small instruction will suffice any one to be provident enough in their bounty or exhibition to the poore.

For first, there is no <hi>pleasure</hi> which hath not respect to <hi>vertue:</hi> how then may that properly be termed a <hi>pleasure,</hi> which hath no relation to <hi>frugality,</hi> under which name all <hi>vertues</hi> may seeme to be comprized? Likewise, there is no <hi>profit</hi> which is not joyned with honesty, how then may that properly be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <hi>profit,</hi> which hath no respect to honest providence, upon which all <hi>profits</hi> are truly grounded? The best course then that you can follow, either in your choice of <hi>pleasures,</hi> or pursuit of <hi>profit,</hi> is ever to examine whether that <hi>pleasure</hi> which you affect, have respect to <hi>vertue,</hi> or that <hi>profit</hi> which you have in pursuit, be firmely grounded on honest <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> so shall neither <hi>pleasure</hi> so much inthrall you, as to engage your fortunes to her, nor <hi>profit</hi> so entangle you, as to neglect conscience for the love you beare her.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45431:99"/>
can desire, nor resist their owne wils in ought that they affect, bee they endued with never so much wisdome, it becomes foolishnesse, being blinded with their owne delights. They then onely, whose native <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> hath prepared them, or continuall wrastling with the infirmities of nature hath inured them, have attained this degree of perfection; not onely (I say) to use <hi>Moderation</hi> in their expence, but in their restraint of every <hi>pleasure</hi>; labouring to become commanders of themselves in the <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> of this life: which of all others make men the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutest conquerours. For man, whose naturall pravity, drawne from the corruption of his first parents, is ever working in him new motions of disobedience; layeth continuall siege and battery to the fortresse of the soule, suggesting to her motives of <hi>pleasure</hi> and delight, which the carnall man will easily condescend to, because he savoureth not the things of the spirit. Yea, how many doe we see, who begin in the <hi>spirit,</hi> but end in the <hi>flesh,</hi> making their end farre worse then their beginning? How necessary then is this <hi>Moderation,</hi> to curbe or checke such inordinate motions as arise in us, by reason of our naturall infirmity and weaknesse?</p>
                  <p>Neither doe I so much insist upon the <hi>Moderation</hi> of your expences, as if <hi>Coine</hi> were of that esteeme, as it onely deserved respect. For if <hi>Riches</hi> increase, wee are not to set our hearts upon them; but rather to shew our indifferencie towards them in our free and liberall use of them.

No, this exhortation rather tendeth to move you to relye on Gods <hi>providence,</hi> yet withall not to abuse those <hi>creatures</hi> which hee hath bestowed on you, but to use them with <hi>Temperance, Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Moderation:</hi> for what is it to abound in all riches, surfet in pleasures, enjoy the treasures of the whole earth, yea to want nothing that either the eye can desire, or the heart affect?

He is so farre from <hi>moderating</hi> his humour, as hee is humorously conceited of his worth, and thinkes whatsoever the <hi>Parasite</hi> saies in his commendations, to be no lesse then what hee in his owne proper person deserves. For his <hi>Contemplations,</hi> they are ever mounting, yet seldome so high mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as heaven, for his thoughts are directed to another Sphere.

Hee is unmeasurably opinionate, and admires his owne knowledge, wherein hee discovers his owne folly: for as hee that seekes to bee more wise then he can be, shall be found to be lesse wise then hee should be; so hee who conceits himselfe more wise then hee is, displayes himselfe to the world what hee is. So as it seemes, hee differs in opinion from the Poet; who holds this as a maxime:

Nor how the circular <hi>World</hi> cannot fill the triangular <hi>Heart,</hi> no more then a <hi>Circle</hi> can fill a <hi>Triangle</hi>; where still there will bee some empty corners.

May your teares be so shed on earth, that they may bee bottled in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; so shall you bring your <hi>sheaves</hi> with you; and, like fine flower, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boulted from the bran of corruption, receive your portion in the land of the living. And may this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>teares</hi> which you offer up unto <hi>him,</hi> whose eyes are upon all the wayes of the children of men, minister like comfort to your soules, as they have done to many faithfull members of Christs Church. And let this suffice to have beene spoken of such Subjects, wherein <hi>Moderation</hi> is to bee used: for to speake of <hi>Moderation</hi> of <hi>sorrow</hi> for sinne, I hold it little necessary, seeing most men (so insensible are they of their inward wounds) come rather short of that <hi>sorrow</hi> which is required, then exceed in any sort the measure that is prescribed.</p>

How hard a thing is it then to observe with indifferency an equall or direct course herein, when either by leaping short or over, we are subject to error? So saith blessed <hi>Cranmer; Some lose their game by short shooting, some by over-shooting: some walk too much on the left hand, some too much on the right hand.</hi> Now to propose what forme of direction is best to be observed herein: wee will take a view of those Subjects, whereof wee formerly treated, and set downe in each of them what <hi>Moderation</hi> is to be used. All waters are derived from three waies or currents: springing either by <hi>fountaines</hi> and <hi>spring-heads,</hi> from the bowells of the earth inwardly drained; by <hi>rivers</hi> and conduits, from those <hi>fountaines</hi> derived: or <hi>haile</hi> and <hi>snow</hi> from the earth extracted; where some ascend, some descend: so <hi>passions</hi> are three wayes moved in our bodies; by <hi>humours</hi> arising out of our bodies; by externall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the secret <hi>passage</hi> of sensuall objects; or by the <hi>descent</hi> or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of reason. Now to insist on the motion or effect of each passion, we shall not greatly need, having sufficiently touched them in our former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: we will therfore upon a review of those severall subjects, Lust, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Gorgeous apparel, Luscious fare, Company-keeping, &amp;c. reduce them and the occasion of them to those three troubled <hi>Springs,</hi> from whence miserable man, by meanes of the immoderate appetite of sense, sucks the

In like sort, if any intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or immoderate desire to <hi>luscious fare</hi> or <hi>delicious drinke</hi> should sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us, whose subtill fumes unrivet each joynt of the memory, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the cement which held it fast; (for you shall ever note, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that deepe drinkers have but shallow memories:) wee are so to prevent the abuse, that we contemn not the <hi>moderate</hi> and healthfull use of them. For as to use them in excesse is to abuse them, so not to use them at all is to contemne or neglect Gods providence in them. Wee must not say with the Epicure, <hi>Let us eate and drinke, for to morrow wee shall die</hi>; but rather let us eat and drinke, as if to morrow wee should die; remembring that strict account which every one must give of the use or abuse of Gods creatures: for it is not the use, but abuse which produceth sinne.

Likewise in the quest or pursuit of honour, as it is <hi>ambition</hi> to hunt after it, undeserved; so it is the most apparent testimonie of true and approved vertue to obtaine it undesired. For this reluctancy to receiving of honour, can never bee without some mixture of <hi>pride</hi>: for they would have the world to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, how well they deserve it; and againe, their humility (which is seldome in these without some tincture of vaine-glory) in that they so little desire it. So as, these popular and firie spirits, whose only aymes are to dignifie themselves, deserve no sharper curbe for over-valuing them selves, than these, who pride themselves in their humilitie, deserve for counterfeiting a kind of debasing or dis-valuing of themselves to the eye of the world. Whence I might take occasion to speake of those precise Schismaticks, who cannot endure any precedency or priority of place to be in the Church, but an equalitie of Presbyterie; nay, what is now growne amongst them to a more desperate frenzy, their maine worke is to advance a <hi>Lay-presbytery,</hi> which till by <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> from the <hi>Chymera's</hi> of a vaporous or viperous brain hatched, was never dreamed: but I wil leave them to a sharper censure, til they be throughly cured of their distemper.</p>

Thus far have I proceeded in discourse touching both manner and matter, how and wherein <hi>Moderation</hi> is to be limited. Where, in the pursuit of <hi>honour,</hi> as I would have you no <hi>Canius,</hi> too Stoically to contemne it; so no <hi>Cassius,</hi> too tenderly to affect it: Likewise in the pursuit of <hi>Wealth,</hi> as I would have you no <hi>Mimus,</hi> too scornfully to hate it; so no <hi>Midas,</hi> too slavishly to hug it: Likewise in the pursuit of <hi>Fancie,</hi> as I would have you no <hi>Arminius,</hi> too severely to loath it; so no <hi>Arsenius,</hi> too dearely to love it: Likewise in <hi>Fare,</hi> as I would have you no <hi>Phythagoras,</hi> too rigorously to abstain from it; so no <hi>Diagoras,</hi> too riotously to epicure it: Likewise in <hi>Apparell,</hi> as I would have you no <hi>Diogenes,</hi> too carelesly to use it; so no <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> too curiously to chuse it: Lastly, in <hi>Pleasure,</hi> as I would have you no <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> too strictly to despise it; so no <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> too highly to prize it. For <hi>Origen</hi> himselfe eunuching, <hi>Democritus</hi> his eyes blinding, <hi>Crates</hi> his money drowning, and <hi>Thracius</hi> his vines destroying, no lesse offended (as wee have before observed) in exceeding the limit by Nature proposed, then the Libertines of their time, came short of that rule which <hi>Moderation</hi> had prescribed.

Let us not entertaine those dangerous motives to sinne, which, like a <hi>Snake</hi> in the bosome will wound us to death. And what bee those motives? Wanton thoughts and wanton words, which corrupt mens manners with wicked workes. It is a sure note and worthy observance; Whensoever any thought is suggested to you which tasteth of evill, make the doore of your heart fast, lest you give actuall possession to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. <hi>Wanton words</hi> likewise are dangerous motives to incontinence; the habit whereof being once attained, will hardly be relinquished. So as <hi>Speech,</hi> which <hi>Democritus</hi> cals the <hi>image of life,</hi> being exercised in scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, seemes to deface that <hi>Image,</hi> by laying on it the darke and sable colour of death.

Now hee who useth his tongue to filthy communication, incurres a threefold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: First, in dishonouring God; Secondly, in sinning against his own soule; Thirdly, in ministring matter of scandall or offence to his brother. How necessary is it then, to keepe a watch upon our mouth, and a gate of circumstance unto our lips, that we offend not with our tongue; which like the poisonous <hi>Adder,</hi> stings even unto death, wounding the soule with an incurable dart? Neither doe I, speaking of <hi>wantonnesse,</hi> onely restraine my discourse to incontinence, but to whatsoever else may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly tend to the complacency or indulgence of the flesh, as to tender o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to her in the desire of luscious and lascivious meats, or the like; including all such as turne the grace of God to <hi>wantonnesse,</hi> making a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, but denying the <hi>power</hi> thereof in their life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>

For of all others, there is no sorrow baser nor unworthier, than that which is grounded on the losse of Oxe, or Cow, or such inferiour subjects.

<q>For by consideration had to these temporall goods (to use the words of a devout Father) hee gathereth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heavenly Councell: Comprehending by the little ones, those great ones; by these visible, those invisible ones: For if the Lord shew, or rather showre so great and innumerable benefits from heaven, and from the ayre, from the land and sea, light and darkenesse, heat and shadow, dew and raine, winds and showres, birds and fishes, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of herbs and plants of the earth, and the ministry of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures successively in their seasons ministring to us, to allay our loathing, and beget in us towards our Maker, an incessant longing, and all this for an ignoble and corruptible body; what, how great, and innumerable shall those good things be, which hee hath prepared for them that love him, in that heavenly Countrey, where we shall see him face to face? If hee doe such things for us in this prison, what will hee doe for us in that Palace? Great and innumerable are thy workes O Lord, King of heaven! For seeing, all these are very good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, which hee hath equally bestowed upon both good and evill: how great shall those bee which hee hath laid up onely for the good? If so divers and innumerable be the gifts, which hee bestoweth both upon friends and foes; how sweet and delectable shall those be, which hee will onely bestow upon his friends? If such comforts in this day of teares and anguish, what will hee conferre on us in that day of Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall solace? If a prison containe such delights, what, I pray you, shall our Countrey containe? No eye, (O Lord) without thee, hath seene those things which thou hast prepared for them that love thee: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the great multitude of thy magnificence, there is also a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy sweetnesse, which thou hast hid for them that feare thee: for great thou art, O Lord our God, and unmeasurable, neither is there end of thy greatnesse, nor number of thy wisedome, nor measure of thy mercy, neither is there end, nor number, nor measure of thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but as thou art great, so be thy gifts great: because thou thy selfe art the reward and gift of thy faithfull warriours.</q>

What profit shall you reape, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely superficially read some Treatise tending to the comfort of such as either in body afflicted, or in mind perplexed, or in both distressed; if you apply not these directions of comfort to them thus miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected? What reward, I say, shall you receive, upon the account by you given, of the <hi>Sicke</hi> which you have visited; when having knowne how to comfort men in their affliction, you have not ministred the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them in their visitation? Or when you shall be demanded, where are the <hi>hungry</hi> which you have refreshed, the <hi>thirsty</hi> whose thirst you have quenched, the <hi>naked</hi> whom you have cloathed, the miserable <hi>oppressed</hi> soule, whose case you have not onely pitied but redressed? And you shall answer, how you did indeed visit them, but minister small comfort unto them; you knew them to bee oppressed, and the way to redresse them, but other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions detained you, as you could not releeve them; Nay rather, have you not added worm-wood to their affliction? Have you not surfetted in their suffering, fatned your selves in their famishing, and raised your states by their ruine? Were not your tables stored, when they were starved; did not you feast, when they fasted; did it not affect you to see them afflicted? If at any time you felt this in your selves, let the dolefull remembrance thereof produce torrents of teares from your distreaming eyes; supply your mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold misdeeds with many almes-deeds; your transgressions with compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; your oppression with foure-fold restitution; that your sinne may no more be had in remembrance: yea, let mee use that exhortation to you, which a learned Father used upon like occasion, <hi>Let charity smite your bowels</hi>;<note place="margin">

For the first, it is and hath beene ever the condition of sober and secret men to avert their eare from their owne praises; at least with a modest passing over such vertues as were commendable in them: which modesty appeared in <hi>Alphonsus</hi> Prince of Aragons answer to an Orator, who having repeated a long Panegyricall oration in his praise, replied, <hi>If that thou hast said consent with truth, I thanke God for it; if not, I pray God grant me grace that I may doe it.</hi> Others likewise we reade of, who could not with patience endure their persons or actions to bee praised above truth: this princely passion appeared in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who hearing <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> a famous Greek Historian, read his writings purposely penned upon the memorable acts he had atchieved, wherein he commended him farre above truth; being mightily incensed therewith, threw the booke into the river, as he was sailing over <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> saying with all, <hi>hee was almost moved to send</hi> Aristobulus <hi>after.</hi> Neither indeed will any wise man endure to heare himselfe praised above truth, seeing no lesse aspersion may be laid on his person by being too highly praised, than if he were discommended: for should wee praise one for his bountie, who is publikely knowne to the world to be parcimonius; or for his humility, who is naturally ambitious; or for his continencie, who is licentious; our praises would not tend so much to his honour; as to the display of his nature: yea, even he himselfe, guilty in himselfe, would tax us, knowing that he the least of all others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served these praises from us. It is flattery (saith one) to praise in absence; that is,<note place="margin">

                     </note> when either the vertue is absent, or the occasion is absent. But in the report of our owne praise, admit wee should deserve it, the safest course is to withdraw our eare from hearing it, lest vaine-glory transport us upon hearing of those praises which are spoken of us: for if our aymes be only to purchase popular esteeme, preferring the praise of men, before the praise of God, or the <hi>testimony</hi> of a good <hi>conscience</hi>; as our aymes were perverted, so shall wee bee rewarded. Now there is no better means to abate or extenuate this desire of praise in us, than duly to consider whose gifts they bee, that deserve this praise in us: for were they our owne, wee might more properly be praised for them; but they are Gods, and not ours, therefore is the praise to be ascribed unto God, &amp; not unto us.

Or what availes it guilty men to find a place to lye hid in, when they have no confidence in the place where they lye hid in?</hi> Excellent therefore was the counsell of zealous <hi>Bernard,</hi> and sententious <hi>Seneca,</hi> that wee should alwayes, as in a mirrour, represent unto our eyes the example of some <hi>good man</hi>; and so to live as if he did alwayes see us, alwayes behold us: for wee, who know that the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are upon all the wayes of men, and that no place so remote, no place so desart or desolate, as may divide us from his all-seeing presence, ought to be in all our workes so provident and circumspect, as if God were present before our eyes, as in truth hee his. And therefore <hi>Prudentius</hi> in one of his <hi>Hymnes</hi> gives this <hi>memorandum</hi>;
<q>
                        <l>Thinke with thy selfe, if thou from sinne would free thee,</l>
                        <l>Be't day or night, that God doth ever see thee.</l>

So repent us to have dishonoured him here on <hi>earth,</hi> that wee may be honoured by him in <hi>heaven</hi>! Let us become humble Petitioners unto him, and prostrate our selves before his foot-stoole: of whom if wee begge life, his <hi>hand</hi> is not so shortned, as it will not save; his <hi>eare</hi> so closely stopped, as it will not heare. It is reported that when a poore man came to <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and preferred his Petition unto him standing, the imperious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would not give eare unto him; whereupon this poore Petitioner, to move him to more compassion, fell downe prostrate at his feet, and with much importunity obtained his suit: after all this, being demanded by one why hee did so;<note place="margin">

                  <head>A Gentleman</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S a Man of himselfe, without the addition of either Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Millener, Seamster or Haberdasher. Actions of goodnesse he holds his supreme happinesse: The fate of a yonger brother cannot depresse his thoughts below his elder. Hee scornes basenesse more than want; and holds Noblenesse his sole worth. A Crest displayes his house, but his owne actions expresse himselfe. Hee scornes pride, as a derogation to Gentry; and walks with so pure a soule, as hee makes uprightnesse the honour of his Family. Hee wonders at a profuse foole, that hee should spend when honest frugality bids him spare; and no lesse at a miserable Crone, who spares when reputation bids him spend. Though heire of no great fortunes, yet his extensive hand will not shew it. Hee shapes his coat to his cloth; and scornes as much to bee holden, as to bee a Gally-slave. Hee hath been <hi>youthfull,</hi> but his maturer experience hath so ripened him, as hee hates to become either <hi>Gull</hi> or <hi>Cheat.</hi> His <hi>disposition</hi> is so <hi>generous,</hi> as others happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cannot make him <hi>repine,</hi> nor any occurrent, save sinne, make him repent. Hee admires nothing more than a constant spirit, derides nothing more than a recreant condition, embraceth nothing with more intimacie, than a prepared resolution. Amongst men hee hates no lesse to bee uncivill, than in his feare to Godward to bee servile. <hi>Education</hi> hee holds a <hi>second Nature</hi>; which (such innate seeds of goodnesse are sowne in him) ever improves him, seldome or never depraves him. <hi>Learning</hi> hee holds not onely an addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ornament to <hi>Gentry.</hi> No complement gives more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment. Hee intends more the tillage of his minde, than his ground; yet suffers not that to grow wilde neither. Hee walkes not in the clouds to his friend, but to a stranger. Hee eyes the <hi>Court</hi> with a vertuous and noble contemplation; and dis-values him most, whose <hi>sense</hi> consists in <hi>sent.</hi> Hee viewes the <hi>City,</hi> with a princely command of his affections. No object can with-draw him from himselfe; or so distract his desires as to covet ought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily; or so intraunce his thoughts, as to admire ought servilely. Hee lives in the <hi>Countrey</hi> without thought of oppression; makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening his dayes <hi>Ephemeris.</hi> If his neighbours field flourish, hee doth not envy it; if it lie fit for him, hee scornes to covet it. There is not that place hee sees, nor that pleasure hee enjoyes, whereof he makes not some singular use to his owne good, and Gods glory. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> hee admits of, walking in it with so generous and religious a care, as hee makes <hi>Piety</hi> his <hi>Practice,</hi> acts of <hi>Charity</hi> his <hi>Exercise,</hi> and the benefit of others his sole solace. Hee understands that neither <hi>health</hi> commeth from the <hi>clouds</hi> without seeking, nor <hi>wealth</hi> from the <hi>clods</hi> without digging. Hee recommends himselfe therefore in the morning to Gods protection and favour, that all the day long hee
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:45431:133"/>
may more prosperously succeed in his labour. Hee holds idlenesse to bee the very moth of mans time: Day by day therefore hath hee his taske imposed, that the poison of idlenesse may bee better avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Hee holds, as Gods opportunity is mans extremity; so mans security is the Divels opportunity. Hoping therefore hee feares, fearing hee takes heed, and taking heed hee becomes safe. Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality hee holds a relique of Gentry: Hee harbours no <hi>passion</hi> but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</hi> Hee grieves no lesse at anothers losse than his owne; nor joyes lesse in anothers successe than his owne peculiar. <hi>Recreation</hi> hee useth to refresh him, but not surprize him. Delights cannot divert him from a more serious occasion; neither can any houre-beguiling pastime divide him from an higher contemplation. For honest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, hee is neither so <hi>Stoicall</hi> as wholly to contemne them, nor so <hi>Epicureall</hi> as too sensually to affect them. There is no delight on mountaine, vale, coppice, or river, whereof hee makes not an usefull and contemplative pleasure. <hi>Recreation</hi> hee admits, not to satisfie his <hi>sense,</hi> but solace <hi>himselfe.</hi> Hee fixeth his minde on some other subject, when any pleasure begins too strongly to worke upon him: Hee would take it, but not bee taken by it. Hee attempers his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractivest pastimes with a little <hi>Alloes</hi>; to <hi>weane</hi> him all the sooner from their sweetnesse. Hee scornes that a moment of content should deprive him of an eternity of comfort. Hee corrects therefore his humour, in the desire of pleasure, that hee may come off with more honour. <hi>Acquaintance</hi> hee entertaines with <hi>feare,</hi> but retaines with <hi>fervor.</hi> Hee consorts with none, but where hee presumes hee may either better them, or bee bettered by them. Vertue is the sole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his choice: Hee conceives how no true amity, nor constant society can ever bee amongst evill men. Hee holds it a blemish to the repute of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and an aspersion to his discretion to make choice of those for his associates, who make no more account of time, than how to <hi>passe</hi> it over. Conference hee affects; and those hee admits onely into the list of his discourse, whom hee findes more reall than verball, more solid than complementall. Hee will try him before hee rely on him: but having found him <hi>touch,</hi> they touch his honour that impeach him. <hi>Moderation</hi> in his desires, cares, feares, or in what this Theatre of Earth may afford, hee expresseth so nobly, as neither love of whatsoever hee enjoyes can so enthrall him, nor the losse of what hee loves can any way appall him. A true and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Moderation of his affections, hath begot in him an absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and conquest of himselfe. Hee smiles, yet compassionately grieves at the immoderation of poore worldlings in their cares and griefes; at the indiscretion of ambitious and voluptuous Flies in their desires and feares. <hi>Perfection</hi> he aspires to; for no lower mound can confine him, no inferiour bound impale him. <hi>Vertue</hi> is the <hi>staire</hi> that raiseth to height of this <hi>Story.</hi> His ascent is by degrees; making <hi>Humility</hi> his directresse, lest hee should faile or fall in his progresse. His <hi>wings</hi> are holy desires; his <hi>feet</hi> heavenly motions. There is no <hi>sense</hi> which he offers not up as a sweet <hi>incense,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite his <hi>course</hi> and refresh his <hi>conscience.</hi> He holds it the sweetest life to be every day better, till <hi>length of dayes</hi> reunite him to his Redeemer. Hee hath plaid his part on this Stage of Earth with honour; and now in his <hi>Exit</hi> makes heaven his harbour.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome moneths are past, since I made bold to recommend to my Right Honourable LORD your Husband, an <hi>ENGLISH GENTLEMAN</hi>; whom hee was pleased, forth of his noble disposition to receive into his Protection. Into whose most Honourable service he was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner entertained, &amp; upon due observance of his integrity approved; then upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his more piercive judgement, hee became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received. Out of these respects, my most Honourable Lady, I became so encouraged, as I have presumed to preferre unto your service an <hi>ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN,</hi> one of the same Countrey and Family, a deserving sister of so <hi>generous</hi> a brother: Or (if you will) a pleasing Spouse to so <hi>gracious</hi> a Lover. Whom, if your Honour shall be but pleased to entertaine (and your noble Candor is such, as shee can expect nothing lesse) especially, seeing her exquisite feature takes life from his hand, whose family claimes affinity with your fathers house; you shall find excellently graced with sundry singular qualities, beautified with many choice endowments, and so richly adorned with divers exquisite ornaments, as her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb facs="tcp:45431:139"/>
shall be no derogation to your Honour, nor no touch <hi>to your</hi> unblemish'd <hi>Selfe,</hi> to reteine her in your favour. The living memory of your thrice noble and heroick <hi>Father,</hi> may justly exact this addressement of mine to his <hi>Daughter:</hi> of whom my <hi>Father</hi> sometimes held such neare dependance, being ever cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his countenance, and highly obliged to his goodnesse. This <hi>Memoriall</hi> made mee confident of a <hi>Patronesse</hi>; and so much the rather, being to preferre a <hi>Maid</hi> so complete and richly qualified, as shee could not chuse but deserve highly from the hand of so noble a <hi>Mistresse.</hi> Sure I am, the sweetnesse of her temper, sorts and sutes well with the quality or disposition of your Honour: For shee loves without any painted pretences to be really vertuous, without any popular applause to be affably gracious, without any glorious glosse to bee sincerely zealous. Her Education hath so enabled her, as shee can converse with you of all places, deliver her judgement conceivingly of most persons, and discourse most delightfully of all fashions. Shee hath beene so well Schooled in the Discipline of this <hi>Age,</hi> as shee onely desires to reteine in memory that <hi>forme</hi> which is least affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but most comely; to consort with such as may improve her <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> of goodnesse by their company; to entertaine those for reall and individuate friends, who make actions of piety expressivest characters of their amity. Diligent you shall ever find her in her imployments, serious in her advice, temperate in her Discourse, discreet in her answers. Shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes farre more time in eying the glasse of her life, to rectifie her errors, if there be any, then the glasse of her face in wiping off such outward staines as might blemish her beauty. Neither in preserving that, is shee altogether so remisse, as not to reteine that seemely grace in her feature, as may put her in remembrance of the unexpressive beauty and bounty of her Maker. Neate she goes usually in her <hi>Attire,</hi> which shee puts on with more <hi>care</hi> then <hi>cost.</hi> And to these she addes such a well-seeming grace, as shee bestowes more beauty on them, then she receives from them. Phantasticke habits or forraine fashions are so farre from taking her, as with a sleight but sweet contempt they are dis-valued by her. She wonders how a wise state should imploy so much time in inventing variety of disguises to disfigure their <hi>Shape.</hi> This makes her desire rather to be out of request with time, then with a civill and well-composed mind; whose honour it is to be prized more by her owne internall worth, then any outward weare. Constant shee is in her <hi>Behaviour</hi>; wherein shee <hi>affects</hi> little, but <hi>observes</hi> much; With a bashfull admiration shee smiles at these civilized simpring Dames, whose onely glory
<pb facs="tcp:45431:139"/>
it is to affect a kind of reserved state; which, as they hold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists principally in a mine'd speech, set looke, or ginger pace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shee loves alwayes to bee her selfe, nor to entertaine ought which may estrange her from her selfe. So as, there is nothing in the whole posture of her <hi>Behaviour,</hi> but with a native gracefull propriety doth infinitely become her. Take upon her to instruct others, she will not, such is her Humility; albeit, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving posture which comes from her, may be a line of direction unto others to follow her. <hi>Complement</hi> she affects not, as the world takes it. The word in his owne native and unborrowed signification is good, and in that sense she admits it; but to bee restrained to an inforced formality, shee cannot relish it. Whence it is, that shee prefers the incomparable Liberty of her mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mutable formality of a deluded age. Shee desires to bee <hi>Compleat</hi> in the exercise of goodnesse; to improve her Honour not by titles but a lovely and lively proficience, graced with a continuate practise in all vertues. Shee cannot indure this later introduc'd kind of Complement, which consists in Cringies, Congies, or supple Salutes. A cheerefull modesty is her best <hi>Complement,</hi> which shee ever weares about her as her chiefest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. <hi>Decency</hi> shee affects in her <hi>Cloathes,</hi> affability in her Discourse; shee hath made a covenant with her eyes never to wander, nor intentively to bestow themselves on any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than the glory of her Maker. A proper personage is no such attractive motive to her eye, to make her loose her selfe. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shee undertakes beseemes her, because shee affects nought but what naturally becomes her. Her beauty is her owne; and whatsoever else may better accomplish her. Her pathes are evenly vertuous; her desires truly religious; Piety is her pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise; which shee expresseth so fully in every action; as the whole course of her well-disposed life is not so much as justly conscious of the least aspersion. So highly shee values her <hi>Estimation,</hi> as shee will not engage it to suspition. Promises cannot tempt her, nor hope of advancement taint her. She won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders one should preferre a conceit of being <hi>great,</hi> before a desire of appearing <hi>good.</hi> Protesting Lovers shee holds for no better then deceiving Lures. Bee their vowes of <hi>service</hi> never so incessant, their assaults never so violent; her resolves have vow'd her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. Hope of <hi>Profit</hi> cannot surprize her, nor thought of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> vainely delude her. <hi>Estimation</hi> shee holds her highest grace, with which untainted shee purposeth to goe to her Grave. Shee knowes how to <hi>fancie</hi>; and in her she reteines what she <hi>fancies</hi> most; A <hi>chaste soule:</hi> this is that shee <hi>loves,</hi> and with which shee cheerfully <hi>lives.</hi> Shee was never yet acquainted with a passionate
<pb facs="tcp:45431:140"/>
                     <hi>Ah me</hi>; nor a carelesse folding of her armes, as if the thought of a prevailing Lover had wrought in her thoughts some violent Distemper. So seriously doth shee taske her selfe to imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as shee never reserves so much time as to treat of so light a subject. Yet she unfainedly vowes, that if it be ever her fortune to make her <hi>Choice,</hi> her constant affection must never admit any <hi>Change.</hi> To be <hi>Generous</hi> in every action, hath beene ever the height of her ambition. Howsoever she might boast of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> her desire is to raise it by <hi>Desert.</hi> Shee holds, no family can be truly <hi>Generous,</hi> unlesse it be nobly vertuous. Her <hi>life</hi> must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the <hi>line</hi> from whence she came. She scornes to entertaine one thought below her selfe: Or to detract from the glory of that house from whence she came. As the blood that streames through her veines was nobly derived, so must it not by any <hi>action</hi> or <hi>affection</hi> drawne from the rule of her direction, become corrupted. For <hi>Honour,</hi> she admits it, but seldome or never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires it; the <hi>Staires</hi> by which shee meanes to clime to it, must be faire and firme, or shee will never mount them. She rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires the Ages folly; while shee observes how many hazard their high-priz'd liberty, for a vading glimpse of popular glory. Her desires are higher seated, where they are only to be sated. A secure State consists not in <hi>styles</hi> but <hi>vertues,</hi> which are <hi>Honours</hi> surest stayes. Therefore her highest <hi>Honour</hi> reflects on her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, wherein she is so farre from fearing,<note place="margin">Such, to your <hi>Honour,</hi> is her zealous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as she makes it the sole Apology of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption: which she weaves up in this Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>To serve some</hi> GREAT ONES <hi>I've been oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times woo'd, But</hi> HERS <hi>I'm vow'd that is both</hi> GREAT <hi>and</hi> GOOD.</note> wherein she is so farre from fearing, as she is ever wishing more <hi>Corrivals.</hi> THIS is the <hi>GENTLEWOMAN</hi> whom I have presumed here to present unto your <hi>Ladiships</hi> service, whose sweet converse will at retired houres afford you choicest solace. Neither should you ranke her amongst the lowest of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, will it displease her, such is her Humility: for she hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as well to <hi>obey</hi> as <hi>command.</hi> Nor will she spare for any paines, so her diligence may please. Only (<hi>Madam</hi>) be pleased to shine upon her with the gracious raies of your favour, to shrowd her bashfull endeavours under the wings of your Honour; and entertaine her blushing approach with your benigne Censure. So shall you find a constant desire of requitall in her; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>Him,</hi> whose intimate Zeale to your <hi>Honour</hi> recommended her,</p>

Peruse her, and I make little doubt, but you will so approve of her Behaviour, as you shall acknowledge her right worthy the title of a <hi>Sister.</hi> More shall you find in her, by freely conversing with her, than in those <hi>YOVNG</hi> but loose <hi>ENGLISH GENTLEWOMEN,</hi> whose long merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prostitution upon the <hi>Stall,</hi> hath brought them out of request, and made them grow too <hi>Stale,</hi> by being exposed to publike <hi>Sale.</hi> Many Countries hath shee coasted, sundry Dangers accoasted, Courts and Cities hath shee frequented, to returne home better freighted, and re-convey the benefit of that fraught to this <hi>Iland,</hi> where shee was first bred and now arrived. Doe yee itch after <hi>Fashion?</hi> Shee is for you; yet not that, which the vanity of this Age admits; but what Modesty onely affects.

What is good and amiable in the eye of vertue, shee embraceth with an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate tender; making it her highest honour, to promote the glory of her Maker. But lest by being too serious, shee might become te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; shee will not sticke to walke abroad with you into more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing groves or pastures of Delight: where shee will converse with you of Love, and intermixe her Discourse with such time-beguiling Tales, as variety shall no lesse sharpen your attention, then the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of her Method beget admiration. Every subject shee treats of, you shall find so equally tempered with <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>delight;</hi> as the one shall no lesse benefit your mind, than the other solace your eare. Shee can reprove without <hi>gall,</hi> blush without <hi>guilt,</hi> love without <hi>guile,</hi> live without <hi>gaine.</hi> Her <hi>gaine</hi> is to purchase <hi>vertue</hi> more followers; her <hi>guile,</hi> to deprive the <hi>world</hi> of her favourers; her <hi>guilt,</hi> to defeat all vitious pioners; her <hi>gall,</hi> to dis-relish all Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous practisers. Shee can discourse of Love without lightnesse; converse with Love without loosenesse; and consort with those shee loves without lewdnesse. She knowes how to reteine a seemely state without pride; to expresse her selfe praise-worthy without selfe-praise; and in all her actions to make <hi>Vertue</hi> her highest prize. <hi>Humility,</hi> which is the princesse of Vertues, the conqueresse of Vices, the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Virgins, and Crowne of Christians, shee so much honours, as shee values it above all humane glory: whence it is, that shee hath ever reapt more spirituall profit by <hi>dis-esteeme</hi> then <hi>selfe-esteeme.</hi> Day by day shee recreates her selfe in her <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>good-will;</hi> and in her recreation, shee makes this her soule-solacing Meditation: <hi>Who bee they that neighbour neare mee, and whose weake estates stand in need of mee?</hi> Concluding with this charitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: <hi>There is none so poore, but to my power I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, so long as I live, for the honour of his Image whom I love.</hi> Shee divides her day into houres, her houres into holy taskes. Employment takes away all occasions of distraction. Should shee suffer a light or indisposed thought to worke upon her imagination: or give way to any such intruder to disturbe the peace of her <hi>inward house,</hi> shee would endure her selfe worse for many yeares, and inflict upon her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant affections such a censure, as might deterre them thenceforth to wander. Shee distates none more than these <hi>busie house-wives,</hi> who are ever running into discourse of others families, but forget
<pb facs="tcp:45431:141"/>
their owne. Neither holds shee it sufficient to bee onely an <hi>House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper;</hi> or, <hi>Snayle</hi>-like, to bee still under roofe: shee partakes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the <hi>Pismire</hi> in providing, of the <hi>Sareptan</hi> widow in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: holding ever an absent providence better then an improvident presence. Shee is no common Frequenter of publike feasts, but if neighbour-hood require it, shee will admit of it: wherein shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes her selfe so civilly, as there is no discreet person but joyes in her society. There is nothing must beget in her a distemper, having ever a tender eye o're her honour. In the report of others praises shee is attentive, but deafe to her owne. Bee shee in places of publike resort or privately retyr'd, shee ever enjoyes her selfe; neither can excesse of birth transport her, or any crosse occurrent much perplexe her. There is nought that aliens her mind more from those with whom shee consorts, then an immodest discourse, which shee interrupts with a discreet anger. Wheresoever shee sets her rest, she makes <hi>Vertue</hi> her guest; whom shee entertaines with so sweet an embrace, as nothing can divide them: so firme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable is the league that is betwixt them. Shee conceives no small delight in Educating the young and unexperienced Damsels of your sexe: wherein shee reteines an excellent faculty and facility. It shall not bee amisse therefore for you who have Daughters, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to her direction, whose government is such, as neither her too much indulgence shall spoyle them; nor restraint dull them. Whatsoever shee in many yeares hath learned (so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous is shee to benefit where her <hi>Observations</hi> may afford profit) shee is willing to impart; to the end shee may procure <hi>Her</hi> more servants, whom shee religiously hath ever vow'd to serve. Long hath shee beene a Learner, neither is shee asham'd to bee so still. Onely for <hi>Vertues</hi> honour, is shee become a Teacher; that the <hi>Younger</hi> may bee instructed by those that are <hi>Elder;</hi> the undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplin'd by such as are riper. Neither shall you find her show in performing what shee hath so perfectly learned: For her very Life is a continued line of Direction, being solely dedicated to a vertuous profession. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> did sharpely reprove a rich woman, for comming into the Lords Temple without her Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But this reproofe shee would bee loath justly to incurre: therefore shee goes better prepar'd, that her portion of Glory may bee sooner shar'd: having an Oblation in her hand, Devotion in her heart, and a Crowne of Consolation in hope. You then, who love modesty, entertaine her; for shee will sort well with your humour, and through her acquaintance improve your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For such, who sacrifice the Morne to their Glasse, the Afternoone to the Stage, and Evening to revelling; shee holds no correspondence with them. These shee holds for no imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:45431:142"/>
nor the Professors of them worthy her knowledge. They must not abuse time, that are commended to her trust. Shee is not so weary of time, neither doth shee so disvalue it, as with such impertinences to consume it. Those likewise, who preferre <hi>Fashion</hi> before <hi>Decency,</hi> formall <hi>Punto'es</hi> before reall <hi>Formality,</hi> and will suffer themselves to bee deluded by Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; they must not bee admitted into her family. Shee hath learned <hi>better things</hi> than to foole her selfe in a painted dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise; or to labour of that Vniversall disease, which the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a full and florishing State usually produceth. Shee hath learned with that <hi>better Sister,</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi> the <hi>better part.</hi> Constant bee her purposes, contentment her desires, consonant her delights. Bee it then your <hi>honour</hi> to bee informed by her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing her instructions are equally mixt with <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> Now if you object, that shee hath beene too slow in comming, seeing her <hi>GENTLEMAN</hi> so long since arrived; heare mine answer; and suspend your Censure, by imputing this fault to our English Error: Where <hi>Venus</hi> is longer in trimming, than <hi>Mars</hi> in training: though hee too, in these distracted times, hath beene too slow in marching. Many provisions were required by her, before the World were to bee possessed of her. Much likewise expected from her, before the World had knowledge of her; this made her the longer to retire, that shee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the more in her returne. May you, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> bee the instance of it; so shall both the <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>Labour</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it.

Well enough was he before that time attyred, albeit naked: and so happily stated, as wee are to imagine, that ignorance kept him not from the knowledge of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, but that his originall purity freed him from these necessities. But no sooner was the forbidden fruit tasted, then poore <hi>Adam</hi> became tainted, his nakednesse discovered; so as now for honour of modesty, hee must of <hi>necessity</hi> betake himselfe to that <hi>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> whereto (being <hi>free</hi> till that time) hee was never <hi>bound Apprentice.</hi> His inhibited taste made him sensible (and therein more miserable) of what before hee felt not.

in her joynts: Such a strange distemper hath the tast of an Apple wrought in her. She must fit her selfe then to endure that with patience, which shee procur'd to her selfe and second selfe, through disobedience; and put on what before she needed not, a Vaile to cover her nakednesse, and subject her selfe to these Necessities. It is true, that <hi>Cloathing</hi> keeps the body warme two wayes: By keeping in the naturall heat of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and by keeping out the accidentall cold of the Ayre. All Creatures enter the world sheelded and shrouded, save onely poore man, who enters lists naked. Tender and delicate h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now to fence himselfe against all occurrents, and the better to endure all intemperate violence, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence hath accommodated it selfe to his <hi>Necessity,</hi> from the very first entrance of his <hi>infancy:</hi> yet were it fit, when hee reflects upon himselfe thus decked and attired, to recall to mind the prime occasion of these <hi>Necessities.</hi> So equally tempered was the Ayre where hee first brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed; so farre from the distemper of heat or cold freed; with such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all delights stored; as then in all happinesse hee seem'd to bee sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but presently after his fall, began these to faile. That soyle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was naturally fruitfull, became wild without manuring: Those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which before were purely relishing and delighting, became muddy, brackish, and distasting: Yea, that Ayre, which before was ever sweetly and temperately breathing, became unseasonably scorching or freezing. <hi>Necessity</hi> then hath provided for <hi>Adam</hi> and his collapsed posterity a Coat, to shroud them from the inclemency of all seasons. And whence came this <hi>necessity,</hi> but from sinne? To glory then in these <hi>necessities,</hi> is to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in sinne: Which were, as if some grave Capitall offender, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted high Treason against his Soveraigne, should, notwithstanding, out of a Princely Clemency be pardoned; yet with this condition, that hee should weare a Cord or Halter about his necke during his life, to put him in remembrance of his disloyalty and treason: In which Badge, this front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Traytor should pride himselfe more, then if it were some ancient Crest of honour. Reflect then upon the originall source of your sorrow, <hi>Eve,</hi> yee daughters of <hi>Eve.</hi> Ambition prompted her to sin, sin brought her to shame, shame to her shroud. Meere <hi>necessity</hi> compelled her to weare what before shee knew not, and to provide her selfe of that which before shee needed not. How is it then, that these rags of sinne, these robes of shame, should make you idolize your selves? How is it, that yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that which was ordained for <hi>necessity,</hi> to feed the light-flaming fuell of licentious liberty? Was <hi>Apparell</hi> first intended for keeping in naturall heat, and keeping out accidentall cold? How comes it then that you weare these thinne Cobweb attires, which can neither preserve heat, nor repell cold? Of what an incurable cold would these Butterfly-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits possesse the Wearer, were pride sensible of her selfe? Sure, these attires were not made to keepe cold out, but to bring cold in. No <hi>necessity,</hi> but meere vanity, introduced these Pye-coloured fopperies amongst us. Vnvaile many of our light Curtezans, whose brothell practice hath reft them of the ornament of a woman, and you will find a strange Metamorphosis; <hi>Venus armata</hi> turn'd to <hi>Venus calva:</hi> Wee say there is no good congruity in a proud heart and a beggers purse: Why should wee then pride our selves in that which displayes our beggery? Before wee had cloathes, wee wanted nothing; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:45431:143"/>
cloathes, wee stand in need of all things. Primitive purity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted us from these <hi>necessities</hi>; Originall impurity subjected us to these <hi>necessities.</hi> Cold wee grew in Charity, cold in every Christian duty; garments then stood wee in need of, to shroud us against the tempest of a benummed Conscience. These habits then, it appeares, were ordained, at first, for <hi>necessity</hi> to shield us: Vanity had not then set invention on worke, nor the age sent her Phantasticks abroad to trafficke with forraine fashions. Winter made choyce of his garment to fit the season; so did Summer, without an affected singularity, fit him to a seasonable fashion. They stood not much either upon colour or curious border; temperate heat they desired to reteine, intemperate to repell; cold to keepe out, naturall warmth to keepe in. This was that ancient times intended; this was all that they affected. <hi>Necessity</hi> enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to doe what they did; otherwise, I am perswaded, they had not beene, to this day, made. Those then that esteeme more of <hi>Apparell,</hi> how gorgeous soever, then of a worke of <hi>Necessity,</hi> detract from their owne glory, to sute themselves in stuffes of vanity.</p>

                     </note> but it may bee corrupted; what was at first intended for some good <hi>Vse,</hi> if perverted, declines into some apparant <hi>Abuse.</hi> Now, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> (for to you I direct this discourse) would you observe the right <hi>use,</hi> and divert in no particular from the Ordinance of <hi>Apparell</hi>; Modesty must be your guide, vertuous thoughts your guard, so shall heaven be your goale. When the Roman Princes, in their Conquests, or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant honours, were with acclamations and vollies of salutes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by the generall applause of the people extolled, and in their triumphall <hi>Eber</hi> or Chayre of State seated; there stood alwayes one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them in their Throne, to pull them by the sleeve with this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall; <hi>Remember thou art mortall.</hi> A more usefull Memoriall you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, then these Robes you weare, of your owne frailty nor a more effectuall motive to humility. Had not sinne worne you out of Gods favour, and rest you of your native splendour, you had never worne these habits, signals of your dishonour. I commend her for the good use which shee made of her <hi>Apparell,</hi> who never eyed her garment, but shee watred it with a teare, remembring what <hi>necesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> her ambitious thoughts had brought her to: for by aspiring to know more then shee did, shee became deprived of that excellent beauty which shee had. Patternes likewise of modesty you may bee, and herein singularly usefull by your examples, unto others of your sexe. Nor can you possibly expresse it better, then in observing that divine precept, by learning how to <hi>array your selves in comely appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, with shame-fastnesse and modesty, not with broided haire, or gold, or pearles, or costly apparell; But, as becommeth women that professe the feare of God. For even after this manner in time past did the holy women, which trusted in God, tire themselves.</hi> Here is a prescript forme by way of direction, for your habit. Choicer ornaments you cannot have to adorne you; nor any fashion that will better seeme you.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:45431:144"/>
Where you walke, you may enjoy your selves freed from light eyes, gazing and admiring vanity: your very <hi>habit</hi> is your <hi>Testate</hi> to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for you: loose thoughts nestle not in your bosome, nor doe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring distractions surprise your breast: you have learned to your highest solace, even in every motion, action, posture, gesture, to observe modesty, as an ornament to honour. For, seeing that the very habit of the mind may bee best discerned and discovered by the state or carriage of the body, the disposition of the body by the habit; to avoid scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and retaine that Christian opinion which every one ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, wee are to make choyce of that attire, which confers most seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gravity on us. This the very Heathen, whose best direction was mortality, were carefull of: for in the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Apparell,</hi> they reteined such constant course, as they held it the greatest blemish they could asperse upon their Nation, to introduce any new or exoticke fashion, either to effeminate the dispositions of their people, or to derogate from the honour of their memorable predecessours; whose model was their direction in habit, and all other observable customes. What a simple, honest Rusticity our Ancestors reteined in their weare, might bee easily discerned, if wee should make recourse to one of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Wardroves; where antiquity may prescribe for many ages, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly second what antiquity had introduced. Yea, so observant were former times of those fashions which preceding ages had recommended to them, as they held it ominous to innovate, or bring in any new forme, even in matters of indifferency. When <hi>Darius</hi> had altered the fashion of his Sword, which used to bee Persian, into the forme of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian (in the yeare immediately before hee fought with <hi>Alexander</hi>) the Chaldees or Sooth-sayers prophecied, that into what fashion as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> had altered his Sword, time would reduce his State; and that the Persian glory was drawing towards her last period, by subjecting herselfe to the Soveraignty of Macedon. Which prediction was soone confirmed by the next yeeres Conquest. But tell mee, yee curious Dames, who hold it a derogation to your honour, to entertaine ought that is vulgar; whereto were Cloathes first ordained, but to cover that nakednesse which sinne brought, and to skreene that shame which the effect of sinne first wrought? The <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Apparell</hi> is not to dignifie the wearer, or adde more beauty to the Creature. Sure I am, that a judicious eye, who measures dignity by desert, scornes to preferre the <hi>Case</hi> before the <hi>Instrument,</hi> the <hi>Rinde</hi> before the <hi>Pith.</hi> Those who are worthy to bee your Iudges, will determine your worth by what there is in you, not by what you weare on you. Let May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>games and Morrices beautifie themselves with Anticke dressings, to captivate the vulgar eye; your breeding hath beene better, your judgements clearer, your observations wiser, than to stoope to such base Lures. Our life consists in the perfection or temperate infusion of naturall or radicall humour, or in the conservation of naturall heate: to preserve this, to increase that, Nature hath provided meanes inward and outwards. To invert the <hi>use,</hi> is to pervert the <hi>Ordinance</hi> it selfe: So <hi>use</hi> the outward, that you dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not the inward; so dispose of the inward, that it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the outward. Reflect on antiquity, yet no farther then may suit with the decency of the age, wherein you live. I am not
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:45431:144"/>
ignorant, how many fashions formerly used, would in this age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve rather derision than approvement. And that the infancy of the world had many shapes, as then but onely in their <hi>Embrio</hi> or rather Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which succeeding times, accommodated by more exquisite artists, brought afterwards to perfection. <hi>Vse</hi> your habit as an ornament of decency; let it not have the least Edging of vanity. Many Eyes are fixed on you, sundry motives of imitation are derived from you. Send not out one fruitlesse sigh for any phantasticke fashion which you see: they cannot bee sighes of compassion, that are sent meerely out for fashion. Sigh rather that your Country should labour of so vaine a birth, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre forraine inventions before the ornament of a <hi>Maiden Ile,</hi> constant modesty. Spend not a fruitlesse houre in an unprofitable garnish of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: <hi>Vse</hi> these outward dressings as if you did not <hi>use</hi> them: Let them bee rather your <hi>scorne</hi> than your <hi>pride</hi>; your <hi>contempt</hi> than <hi>content.</hi> Bee those curious Cases of mortality decked or dawbed with never so much adulterate beauty, they cannot conferre upon themselves one beameling of lasting glory. Looke upon those poore <hi>bases</hi> of frailty, your <hi>feet,</hi> what a <hi>tinkling</hi> they make, to partake of a lascivious meeting in privacy: Eye those <hi>rising mounts</hi> your <hi>displayed breasts,</hi> with what shamelesse art they wooe the shamefast passenger: View those <hi>wandring Lamps,</hi> how they rove abroad, as if they would flye out of their Lodges, and spheare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in some amorous Orbe. Call them home, lest, <hi>Dinah</hi>-like, they lose themselves by straying, impeach their honour by wandring, bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves woe by their lascivious wooing. Affect no fashion that may beget in your generous bosomes a light thought; Contemne that fashion which detracts from the native beauty of the feature, or which brings it to that admiration of the Creature, as it makes it forgetfull of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. O how contemptible a thing is man (the word may reflect equally upon either sexe) if hee erect not his thoughts above man! What a poore <hi>use</hi> makes that miserable creature of his being here, who bestowes so much time in the <hi>Tyring-house,</hi> as hee forgets what part hee is to play on the Stage?

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:45431:145"/>
was, whose adulterate <hi>shape</hi> takes now acquaintance from the <hi>Shop.</hi> Then were such women matter of scandall to Christian eyes, which used painting their skinne, powdring their hayre, darting their eye. Our Commerce with forraine Nations was not for fashions, feathers and follies. There was distinction in our attires; differences of ranks and qualities; a civill observance of decent habits; which conferred no lesse glory on our Ile at home, than victorious mannagements by the prowesse of our Inhabitants did abroad. If wee reflect on them, wee must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity blush at our selves; seeing, what wee have received for <hi>use,</hi> wee have converted to <hi>abuse.</hi> That distinction which decency found out for habits virile and feminine, what commixture hath it found in latter times? What neare resemblance and relation hath womans to mans: suting their light feminine skirts with manlike doublets? <hi>Semiramis,</hi> that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Princesse, commanded all to weare <hi>Tyres</hi> upon their heds, and to put upon them womans apparell without distinction, that shee might reigne securely without exception: Thus the comely habit of modesty became a pretended vaile to an usurped Soveraignty. A feminine Regiment oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd this Ornament: Invention then became a project of Policy, and found no head to looke out from a light <hi>Balcone</hi> or <hi>Prospect</hi> of vanity; But these succeding times have tyred our women with tyres; transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to a plume of Feathers. Fashion is now ever under faile: the Invention ever teeming, Phantasticke Wits ever breeding. More time spent how to <hi>abuse</hi> time, and corrupt licentious youth, than how to addresse employment for the one, or to rectifie the distempers of the other. Take a survey of all degrees, and tell me what uniformity you finde in this particular. And to make instance in three severall places (for to these all others may have proper relation) take a more precise and punctuall perusall of <hi>City, Court,</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi>; and returne me a briefe of your Survey. In the <hi>first,</hi> you shall finde many grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, modest Maids, devont Widdowes: but are these all? No; with these you shall finde a strangely mixt generation: Some affecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than what is most novell and phantasticke: Others envying what they disdainfully see in others; which fashion rather than they will misse, they will not sticke to set their honour at sale: All, or most, true <hi>Biantines,</hi> carrying all their wealth about them. For the <hi>second,</hi> you shall find, amongst many other plants of promising growth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent proficience, sundry sweet-sented sprigs of <hi>Cynnamon,</hi> whose rinde is worth all the body. No discourse can rellish their formall palate, but fashion; if <hi>Eves</hi> Kirtle should bee now showne them, how they would geere their Grandam? For the <hi>last,</hi> though it bee long ere they creepe into forme, having once attain'd it, they can take upon them as unbeseeming a State in a Countrey Pew, as if they were Ladies for that yeare, and had beene bred in the Art of Mincing since their childhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what are these, but such, whose expence of time is scarcely valued? Sacrificing more houres to their Looking-glasse, than they reserve mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to lament their defects. Such, whose vertuous thoughts never har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the least conceit that may betray their honour, or deprave those more noble parts wherewith they are indowed; scorne to drowne their <hi>better part</hi> in these dregs of sensuality. Vertue is their attendant, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their object, all inferiour delights their lowest subjects. Day by day have these their taske imposed, that the poyson of sloath may bee better
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:45431:145"/>
avoyded: No day passeth without a line, no action without a limit: observing the course of that vertuous Mirror, of whom it is said,
<q>
                        <l>In distinct houres she did divide the day,</l>
                        <l>To walke, to worke, to meditate, and pray.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much different from this pious resolution, was that Libertines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious conclusion, who held that none could bee frequently devout in prayer, and fashionably decent in attire. Shee bestowed too much time on her <hi>Glasse,</hi> to reserve any for her Lampe. Pride had exiled her zeale; delicacy of habit, sanctity of heart. Her day might bee easily divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Shee bestowed the forenoone on her skinne, the afternoone on a Play, clozing her Evening Lecture with a reere supper: and this was her Christian Taske. Miserable is the condition of that Creature, who, so her skin bee sleake, cares not if her soule bee rough: so her outward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit bee pure and without blemish, values little her inward garnish. Such an one hath made a firme Contract with vanity, clozing her contemptuous age with a fearefull Catastrophe. Thus farre have wee discoursed of the effect or <hi>abuse</hi> it selfe, wee are now to treat of those two sources, from whence these <hi>abuses</hi> properly arise; to wit, <hi>Delicacy</hi> in being more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in our Choyce of <hi>Apparell</hi> than <hi>necessity</hi> or <hi>decency</hi> doth require; secondly, <hi>Superfluity,</hi> in storing more variety and change of rayments than either nature needs, or reason would admit, were shee not transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a sensuall affection, by giving way to what unbounded appetite requires.</p>
                  <p>IN the search of any Minerall,<note place="margin">How the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell</hi> may be inverted to <hi>abuse.</hi>
                     </note> wee are first to digge for the veine: and in the curing of any malevolent effect, wee are duely and seriously to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the producing cause, that by stopping the Spring or source, wee may stay the violence of the streame. Wee are then to insist of those two precedent means, by which the <hi>use</hi> may bee inverted to <hi>abuse</hi>; and that which of it selfe is approveable, if observed with decency, becomes justly reprehensible by corrupting so necessary and consequent an <hi>use,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>delicacy,</hi> which weakens and effeminates the <hi>spirit,</hi> or by <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity,</hi> which ever darkens the beameling of <hi>reason</hi> with the Cloud of <hi>sense.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reproofe touching <hi>Apparell</hi> may bee occasioned from foure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects:</p>
                  <p>First, when anyone weareth <hi>Apparell</hi> above their degree, exceeding their estate precious attire. Whence it is that <hi>Gregory</hi> saith; There bee some who are of opinion, that the weare of precious or sumptuous <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell</hi> is no sinne: Which if it were no fault, the divine Word would never have so punctually expressed, nor historically related, how the <hi>Rich man,</hi> who was tormented in hell, was cloathed with Purple and Silke. Whence wee may note, that touching the matter or subject of attire, humane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity availeth highly. The first stuffe or substance of our garments, was very meane; to wit, Skinne with Wooll, Whence it is wee read, that God made <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife <hi>Coats of Skinnes,</hi> that is, of the Skinnes
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45431:146"/>
of dead beasts. Afterwards (see the gradation of this vanity derived from humane singularity) they came to <hi>Pure Wooll,</hi> because it was lighter than Skinnes. After that to <hi>rindes of trees,</hi> to wit, <hi>Flax.</hi> After that to the <hi>dung and ordure of Wormes,</hi> to wit, <hi>Silke.</hi> Lastly, to <hi>Gold and Silver, and precious Stones.</hi> Which preciousness of attire highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God. For instance whereof (which the very Pagans themselves observed) we read that the very first among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ever wore <hi>Purple,</hi> was strucke with a Thunder-bolt, and so dyed suddenly, for a terror and mirror to all succeeding times, that none should attempt to lift himselfe proudly against God in precious attire.</p>
                  <p>The second point reprehensible is, <hi>Softnesse</hi> or <hi>Delicacy</hi> of <hi>Apparell</hi>: Soft Cloathes introduce soft mindes. Delicacy in the <hi>habit,</hi> begets an <hi>effeminacy</hi> in the <hi>heart. Iohn Baptist,</hi> who was sanctified in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, wore sharpe and rough garments. Whence wee are taught, that the true servant of God is not to weare garments for beauty or delight, but to cover his nakednesse; not for State or Curiosity, but necessity and convenience. Christ saith in his Gospel, <hi>They that are clad in soft rayments, are in Kings houses.</hi> Whence appeareth a maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the servants of Christ, and of this world. The servants of this world seeke delight, honour, and pleasure in their attire: whereas the servants of Christ so highly value the garment of innocence, as they loath to staine it with outward vanities. It is their honour to <hi>put on</hi> Christ Iesus; other robes you may rob them of and give them occasion to joy in your purchase.</p>
                  <p>The third thing reproveable is, <hi>forraine Fashions</hi>: When wee desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to bring in some Outlandish habit different from our owne;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zephan.</hi> 1.</note> in which respect (so Apishly-anticke is man) it becomes more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than our owne. Against such the Lord threatneth, <hi>I will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the Princes and the Kings children, and all such as are cloathed with strange Apparell.</hi> Which <hi>strange Apparell</hi> is after divers fashions and inventions, wholly unknowne to our Ancestors. Which may appeare sufficiently to such, who within this 30, or 40, or 60. yeares never saw such cutting, carving, nor indenting as they now see.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing reproveable is, <hi>Superfluity of Apparell,</hi> expressed in these three particulars: first, in those who have divers changes and suits of Cloaths; who had rather have their garments eaten by moaths, than they should cover the poore members of Christ. The naked cry, the needy cry, the shreekingly complaine unto us, how they miserably labour and languish of hunger and cold. What availes it them that wee have such changes of rayments nearly plaited and folded; rather than wee will supply them, they must bee starved? How doe such rich Moath-wormes observe the Doctrine of Christ when hee saith in his Gospel; <hi>He that hath two Coats let him give one to him that hath none?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee are to consider the <hi>Superfluity</hi> of such who will have long garments purposely to seeme greater: yet, which of these can adde one cubit to his stature? This puts me in remembrance of a conceited story which I have sometimes heard, of a diminutive Gentleman, who demanding of his Tayler, what yards of Sattin would make him a Suite, being answered farre short in number of what hee expected: with great indignation replied,
<q>Such an one of the <hi>Guard</hi> to my knowledge had thrice as much for a Suite and I will second him.</q>
Which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:45431:146"/>
his Tayler with small importunacy condescended to, making a <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua's Suite</hi> for this <hi>Ounce of mans flesh,</hi> reserving to himselfe a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of shreads, purposely to forme a fitter proportion for his <hi>Ganimede</hi> shape.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>Superfluity</hi> ariseth from their vanity, who take delight in wearing great sleeves, mishapen Elephantine bodies, traines sweeping the earth, with huge poakes to shroud their phantasticke heads, as if they had committed some egregious fact which deserved that censure: for in the Easterne Countries it hath beene usually observed, that such light Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as had distained their honour, or laid a publike imputation on their name, by consenting to any libidinous act, were to have their heads sow'd up in a poake, to proclaime their shame, and publish to the world the quality of their sinne.</p>
                  <p>NOw to insist more punctually on that effeminatour both of youth and age,<note place="margin">Delicacy of <hi>Apparell.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Delicacy of Apparell</hi>; I would have our Daughters of <hi>Albion,</hi> reflect upon themselves, those poore shells of corruption: what a trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and tricking they bestow on their brittle houses. <hi>Petrarch's</hi> advice was, that wee should not be afraid though our out-houses, these structures of our bodies, were shaken, so our soules, the guests of our bodies, fared well. Whereas contrariwise, these, whose onely care is to delude the outward appearance with a seeming faire, so they may preserve the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, disvalue the foundation. O may this folly be a stranger to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! To allay which fury, attemper which frenzie, I hold no receipt more soveraigne, then to enter into a serious meditation of your frailty: As first to consider, what you were before your birth; secondly, what from your birth to your death; lastly, what after death. If you reflect upon the first, you shall find that you have beene, what before you were not, afterwards were what now you are not; first made of vile matter (see the Embleme of humane nature) wrapped in a poore skin, nourished in an obscure place, your Coate the second skinne, till you came to a sight of the Sunne, which you entertained with a shreek, implying your origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne. Thus attired, thus adorned came you to us; what makes you then so unmindfull of that poore case wherein you came among us? Hath beauty, popular applause, youthfull heate, or wealth taken from you the knowledge of your selves? Derive your pedigree, and blush at your match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse folly, that pride should so highly magnifie it selfe in dust, or glory most in that which brings with it the most shame. Why doe you walke with such haughty necks? why doe you extoll your selves so highly in these Tabernacles of earth? Attend and consider; you were but vilde corrupted seed at the first; and now fuller of pollution then at the first. Entring the world with a shreeke to expresse your ensuing shame, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards exposed to the miseries of this life and to sinne; in the end wormes and wormes meat shall you be in the grave. Why then are you proud, yee dusty shrines, yee earthen vessels, seeing your conception was impurity, birth misery, life penalty, death extremity? Why doe yee embellish and adorne your flesh with such port and grace; which within some few dayes wormes will devoure in the grave? Meane time you neglect the incomparable beauty of your soules. For with what orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe ye adorne them? With what sweet odours or spirituall graces
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:45431:147"/>
doe yee perfume them? With what choyce Flowers of piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe yee trim them? What Habits doe yee prepare for them, when they must bee presented before him who gave them? How is it that yee so dis-esteeme the soule, preferring the flesh before her? For the Mistresse to play the Handmaid, the Handmaid the Mistresse, is a great abuse. There can be no successe in that family, where the houshold is managed so disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. O restraine your affections, limit your desires, beare an equall hand to the better part! The Building cannot stand unlesse you remove the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish from the foundation. The Soule in the body is like a Queene in her Palace. If you would then have this little Common-wealth within you to flourish, you must with timely providence suppresse all factious and turbulent molesters of her peace: your passions, especially those of vaine glory, must bee restrained; motives to humility cherished; chaste thoughts embraced; all devious and wandring cogitations excluded; that the soule may peaceably enjoy her selfe, and in her Palace live secured. Whereto if you object, that this is an hard lesson; you cannot despise the world nor hate the flesh; tell mee where are all those lovers of the world, cherishers of the flesh, which not long since were among us? Nothing now remaineth of them but dust and wormes Consider diligently (for this consideration will be a Counterpoize to all vaine-glory) what they now are, and what they have beene. Women they were as you are: they have eat, drunke, laughed, spent their dayes in jollity, and now in a moment gone downe to hell. Here their flesh is apportioned to wormes, there their soules appointed to hell fire: till such time as being gathered together to that unhappy society, they shall be rowled in eternall burnings, as they were before partakers with them in their vices. For one punishment afflicteth, whom one love of sinne affecteth. Tell mee, what profiteth them their vaine-glory, short joy, worldly power, pleasure of the flesh, evill got wealth, a great family, and concupiscence arising carnally? Where now is their laughter? Where their jests? Where their boasting? Where their arrogance? From so great joy, how great heavinesse? After such small pleasure, how great unhappinesse? From so great joy they are now fallen into great wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, grievous calamity, unsufferable torments. What hath befallen them, may befall you; being Earth of Earth, slime of slime: Of Earth you are, of Earth you live, and to Earth you shall returne. Take this with you for an infallible position in these your Cottages of Corruption: If you follow the flesh, you shall be punished in the flesh: if you bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the flesh, you shall be tormented in the flesh: for by how much more your flesh is cockered in this world with all <hi>delicacy</hi>; by so much more shall your soules bee tormented in hell eternally. If you seeke cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and delicate rayments, for the beauty and bravery of your rayments shall the moath bee laid under you, and your Covering shall be Wormes. And this shall suffice to have beene spoken touching <hi>Delicacy of Apparell:</hi> wee are now to descend briefly to the second branch, <hi>Superfluity</hi>; whereof wee intend to discourse with that brevity, as the necessity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whereof wee treat, shall require, and the generality of this spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malady may enforce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:45431:147"/>DIvine is that saying,<note place="margin">Superfluity of <hi>Apparell.</hi>
                     </note> and well worthy your retention: The covetous person before hee gaine loseth himselfe, and before hee take ought is taken himselfe. He is no lesse wanting to himselfe in that which he hath, than in that which he hath not. He findes that he lost not, possesseth that he owes not, detaines that he ought not, &amp; hates to restore what he injuriously enjoyes. So unbounded is the affection, or rather so depraved is the avariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans inclination, as he cannot containe his desires within bounds, not enter parley with reason, having once slaved his <hi>better part</hi> to the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of a servile affection. This may appeare even in this one particular. Food and rayment are a Christians riches: wherein hee useth that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as hee makes that Apostolicall rule his Christian direction; <hi>Having food and rayment, I have learned in all things to bee contented.</hi> But how miserably is this golden rule inverted, by our sensuall worldling? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency must neither bee their Cater in the one, nor Conveniency their Tayler in the other. Their Table must labour of variety of dishes, and their Wardrobe of exchange of raiments. No reason more probable than this of their naked insides, which stand in need of these <hi>superfluous</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments. What myriads of indisposed houres consume these in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying rotten tombes! How curious they are in suiting their bodies, how remisse in preferring their soules suit to their Maker! How much they are disquieted in their choyce, how much perplexed in their change, how irresolute what they shall weare, how forgetfull of what they were! This edging suits not, that purle sorts not, this dressing likes not: off it must after all bee fitted, and with a new Exchange, lesse seemely, but more gaudy suited. The fashion that was in prime request but yesterday, how it begins to dif-rellish the wearer, as if it had lost the beauty by unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able weather; thus is fashion fallen into a quotidian Fever: See our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletest <hi>Fashion-mongers,</hi> how much they tyre themselves with their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, how they trouble themselves with their trimming! Had wee more new <hi>Exchanges</hi> erected, we should have them plenteously peopled, and with such variety of feminine fancies stored, that invention should sooner lose her spirit, then our phantastick Dames their appetite. And to take a fuller view of vanity, that pride may blush at her owne formality; observe what Babies, most of our fashion affecters bee! Rare trinkets they have got, to improve their <hi>Projectors</hi> gaine; yet having wonne them, they know not how to weare them. A forraine Tyre-woman must have a constant pension, to put this love-bespotted Idol into a more complete fashion. It seemes wonderfull to me, that they are not wholly crushed, with that onerous burthen with which they are pressed. What a shop of guga nifles hang upon one backe? Here the remainder of a greater worke, the reliques of ancient manor converted to a pearle Chaine. There the moity of an ill-husbanded demaine reduced to a Carknet. Long traines must sweepe away long acres: the Epidemicall vanity of this age doth exact it; and shee is held least worthy affecting, that doth least affect it. What? sayes my delicate Madam;
<q>Is it for one of my ranke or descent to affect what is vulgar? how then should I become popular? I confesse, wee are all composed of one <hi>Earth,</hi> yet is there to bee presupposed a difference in our <hi>birth.</hi> Were it fitting that I should fall off, either from that <hi>delicacy</hi> which is generally approved, or that <hi>variety</hi> which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:45431:148"/>
is by our more generous formalists applauded? What availes a mighty fortune to a miserable disposer? Or brave meanes, where a base mind is the dispenser? <hi>Apparell</hi> must be with <hi>delicacy</hi> sorted, <hi>variety</hi> suited, or the dignity of the person, be it never so conspicuous, will be obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Admit variety be meere <hi>superfluity,</hi> at worst it is but the ages <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>; which is such an universall malady, as it pleads exemption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther apology.</q>
Whereto I answer; it is true, the Age labours of this disease, where the eye becomes a determiner of our worth, by the outward habit which wee weare: It reflects not on what is in us, but what is on us. Shee is not to be accounted a Court visitant, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines her selfe either in her choyce of <hi>delicacy,</hi> or <hi>variety</hi> of habit. What then? Shall a vitious or effeminate age deprave your judgement? Or a corrupt time deprive you of judgement? No; you have more absolute perfections within you, than to be blemished with these imperfections which you too frequently carry about you. The more you display your pye-coloured flagge of vanity, the more Lures you throw out of loosest liberty; the more foments you use of soule-soyling <hi>delicacy,</hi> the deeper Lodging you bespeake your selves in the Lake of eternall misery. To such I onely speake, who, so they may furnish themselves of a dainty artist, to teach them how to <hi>dye</hi> well, make it the least of their care how to <hi>live</hi> well. These who love to dye their <hi>haire,</hi> but never change the dye of their corrupted <hi>heart</hi>: these will not stick with frontlesse impudence to boulster their depraved liberty; they may be, without controule, dispensers and disposers of their owne. This <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>delicacy</hi> wherein they expresse themselves by an especiall marke of distinction from others, they derive it from the affluence of their owne fortunes, and not from others: which being so justly enjoyed, and without injury, admits no exception in all probability. Whereto I reply, with the words of a Divine Father,
<q>Art not thou, whosoere thou bee, a Robber, who hast received goods as a Steward or dispenser, and entitlest thy selfe the impropriator or owner? for what faire glozes or pretences soever thou makest for thy selfe, to gild thy shame, or mince thy sinne, it is the bread of the needy, which thou with-holdest; the Coat of the naked, which in thy Chest thou storest; the shooes of the bare-foot, which with thee lye rotting; the coyne of the begger, which with thee lyes moulding.</q>
Away then with these <hi>Superfluous</hi> dressings; you see daily objects of your Charity, bring out your Wardrobe, and cloath the naked. That which you so prodigally spent upon your selves, convert it to the more glorious <hi>attiring</hi> of your naked soules. See that your <hi>Kings daughter</hi> bee all glorious within, that the <hi>King of Kings</hi> may take pleasure in her. Let not so precious an Image bee defaced, so specious a Virgin defiled, so glorious a Creature dishonoured. Instead of <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> decke your selves modestly; instead of <hi>Superfluity,</hi> out of your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety communicate freely to others necessity. Wee are now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend briefly to the <hi>last branch</hi> of this <hi>first Observation,</hi> declaring, how, That <hi>Apparell</hi> is most comely, which confers on the <hi>Wearer</hi> most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>beauty,</hi> and most honour on her <hi>Countrey.</hi>

Nothing is held more contemptible with them, then apishly to imitate forraigne fashions: Prescription is their Tayler, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity their Tutor. Amongst the ancient Heathen, even their very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit distinguish'd Widdowes from Matrons, Matrons from Virgins. So as not onely sexes, states, conditions, yeares, but even linages, races, and families were remarkeably discovered.

Shee will neither relye on her owne invention, nor compose her selfe to the fashion of any one particular Nation, but make her selfe an Epitomized confection of all. Thus becomes shee not onely a stranger to others, but to her selfe. It were to bee wished, that as our Countrey is jealous of her owne invention in contriving, so shee were no lesse cautelous in her choice of wearing. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great thought that <hi>Angles</hi> did neerly symphonize with <hi>Angels,</hi> not so much in letter, as in favour and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Were it not pitty that these should darken their beauty with vailes of deformity? Were it not pitty that there should not be an Analogy in their <hi>name</hi> and <hi>nature</hi>; that the <hi>Angles</hi> might partake of <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>nature</hi> as well as <hi>feature?</hi> But the <hi>gold</hi> has chang'd his <hi>colour</hi>; our purer <hi>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> her native <hi>splendor.</hi> Truth is, there is nothing which confers more native beauty on the <hi>wearer,</hi> then to bee least affective in whatsoever shee shall weare. Shee asperseth a great blemish on her better part, who tyes her selfe to that formality, as shee dare not put off the least trifle that shee weares, nor put on ought more then shee weares, lest she should lose the opinion of Compleat. There is a native modesty even in attire as well as gesture, which better becomes, and would more fully accomplish her, if <hi>fashion</hi> were not such a <hi>pearle</hi> in her eye, as it keepes her from the sight of her owne vanity. I confesse, light heads will be easily taken with such toyes: yea, I have sometimes observed a phantasticke dressing strike an amorous inconsiderate Gooseling sooner into a passionate <hi>Ah mee,</hi> with a carelesse love-sicke wreathing of his enfolded armes, then some other more attractive object could ever doe. But what is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of one of these <hi>Greene-wits</hi> worth? What benefit can a young <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> reap in enjoying him, who scarcely ever enjoy'd himselfe? Meanes he may have, but so meanely are they seconded by inward abilities, as his state seems fitter to mannage him, then he to marshall it. A long Lock he has got, and the art to frizle it; a Ring in a string, and the tricke to handle it: A whole <hi>Forrest</hi> of <hi>Synonimies,</hi> has he by retaile purchased; which, like so many dis-jointed <hi>Similees,</hi> impeach his novellisme of palpable <hi>Non-sense.</hi> For his discourse, to give him his true Character, his silence approves him

Now, <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> tell me, doe you trim your selfe up for this <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinjay</hi>? Would you have the <hi>foole</hi> to weare you, after so many <hi>follies</hi> have out-worne you? Let modesty suit you, that a discreeter mate may chuse you. Be it your prime honour to make civility your director. This will incomparably more grace you, then any phantasticke attire; which though it beget admiration, it clozeth alwayes with derision. You cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly detract more from the renowne of your Countrey, where you received birth and education, than by too hot a quest or pursuit after Outlandish fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions. Play not the <hi>Dotterell</hi> in this too apish and servile <hi>Imitation</hi>; let other Countries admire your Constancy and Civility: while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect both on what you weare, and what you are. Bee it your glory to improve your Countries fame. Many eyes are fixed on you, and many hearts will bee taken with you, if they behold those two Ornaments, <hi>Modesty,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> ever attending you: Discretion will bee more taken and enamoured with these, then toyes and feathers. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so rough but may bee polished; nor ought so outwardly faire but may be disfigured. Whereas the beauty of these two cannot by adulterate Art be more graced, by the aged furrowes of time become defaced, or by any outward Occurrent impaired. There are many beauteous and sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Cases,</hi> whose <hi>Instruments</hi> are out of tune.

Now in this one Subject, it is strange to observe what diversity of <hi>active</hi> dispositions wee shall finde. Some are employed to the purpose, but they are so remisse in their employment, as they lose the benefit of it. Others are imployed to no purpose, making a passing of time a meere pastime, comming as farre short of one usefull <hi>action</hi> at their death, as they were incapable of it at their birth. Others sleepe out their time in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse security; saluting the morning with a sacrifice to their Glasse, the Noone with a luscious repast, the Afternoone with a Play or a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let repose, the Evening with a wanton consort, accoutred with a reere-banket, to belull the abused soule with the sleepe of an incessant surfeit. Others have crept into such an Apish formality; as they cannot for a world discourse of ought without some mimmicke gesture or other; which, seeme it never so complete to them, appeares ridiculous to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. This was <hi>Semphronia's</hi> error, for which she was generally taxed, before ever her honour was publikely tainted. What a tinkling you shall observe some to make with their feet, as if they were forthwith to dance a Morrice? They are ever in motion like <hi>Puppets,</hi> but in <hi>actions</hi> of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse meere <hi>Punies.</hi> Their <hi>pace</hi> is a <hi>Pavin</hi> in the street; their <hi>looke</hi> a <hi>Lure</hi> to a lascivious attempt; They expresse nothing by their gesture worthy the <hi>image</hi> they beare. Besides, who is hee, whose judgement will not taxe these of lightnesse, by these light an uncivill appearances? A womans honour is of higher esteeme, than to bee thus dis-valued. Light occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are many times grounds of deepe aspersions.

In the Maze or Labyrinth of this life, many bee our cares, mighty bee our feares, strong our assailants, weake our assistants, unlesse wee have that <hi>brazen wall</hi> within us to fortifie us against all occurrents. O then, let not the least <hi>action</hi> betray you to your enemy, for you have many; within you, for they are dangerous, because domesticall; without you, for they are strangers, and therefore doubtfull! Let your <hi>actions</hi> bee your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plausivest <hi>Actors</hi>; The Scene of your life is short, so live that your noble <hi>actions</hi> may preserve your memory long.

Neither have our moderne times lesse flourished with feminine worthies, as might be illustrated with sundry eminent instances, if I would reflect upon this Subject: but this hath beene the Theame of sundry Panegyrick Poems, which makes me more sparing in it: Onely in your behalfe, and to your honour, let me retort their Criticke Censure, who draw from the very <hi>Etymon</hi> of your name an occasion of error:
<q>
                        <l>

The memory of <hi>Dorcas</hi> liveth still; <hi>Shee was full of good workes and almes which shee did.</hi> Yea, even the very <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Garments</hi> which shee made, while she was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, were showne the Apostle as arguments of her industry, memorials of her piety. Hence it was that Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> that excellent patterne of holy Discipline, serious professor of Divine Doctrine, counselleth the holy Virgin <hi>Demetrias</hi> to eschew idlenesse:
<q>
                        <p>Exhorting her withall, that having done her prayers, shee should take in hand wooll and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, after the commendable example of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> that by such change or variety of workes, the day might seeme lesse tedious, and the assaults of Satan lesse grievous: concluding his devout Exhortation, with this definite position,</p>
                        <p>I speake generally, no rayment, ornament, or habit whatsoever, shall seeme precious in Christs sight, but that which thou makest thy selfe, either for thine owne peculiar use, or example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virgins, or to give unto thy Grand-mother, or thy Mother, no, though thou distribute all thy goods unto the poore.</p>
                     </q>
See how strictly this holy Father proceeds with his religious Daughter! Yet was this <hi>Demetrias,</hi> to whom hee addressed this his exhortation, a Noble Lady; not one, whom poverty did enforce to <hi>actions</hi> of such necessity: but one honourably descended, richly endowed, powerfully friended. Let this Lady bee your Patterne, her <hi>action</hi> your direction, her obedience your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, that you may share with her in a peacefull dissolution. Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine no time without some devout taske: reflect upon the Noblenesse of your descent, ennoble it with excellence of desert.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>For you must know true honour is not wonne,</l>

                  <p>Waste not prodigally the precious Lampe of your life without some vertuous <hi>action</hi> that may purchase love. Your time is lesse than a minute in respect of eternity, employ that minute so, as it may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize your memory. Let this bee your highest taske; to promote
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:45431:151"/>
the honour of your Maker, esteeming all things else a slavish and servile labour.</p>

                        <hi>Affection.</hi>
                     </note>THere is nothing which requires more discretion, than how to <hi>behave</hi> or carry our selves while wee are enthralled to <hi>affection.</hi> The Lover is ever blinded (saith wise <hi>Plato</hi>) with <hi>affection</hi> towards his beloved. <hi>Reason</hi> is laid a sleepe, while <hi>Sense</hi> becomes the master Wooer. Whence came that usuall saying, <hi>One cannot love and be wise.</hi> But I wholly oppose my selfe to their assertion, who seeme thus farre transported with the sensuall opinion of <hi>affection.</hi> My Tenet is, <hi>One cannot truely love, and not be wise.</hi> It is a Beldam frenzy and no fancy, which gives way to fury, and admits not reason to have soveraignty. Yet in this Subjects, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,</hi> is your temper best tryed, your discretion most required, and your Patience, oft-times, most exercised. Looke therefore how you plant it, lest you bootlesly repent it, when it is mis-placed.</p>
                  <p>It is most certaine, there is nothing more impatient of delay than love, nor no wound more incurable while wee live. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, all have a taste of this Potion, though it have severall degrees of operation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Looke all about you; who so young that loves not?</l>
                     <l>Or who so old, a comely feature moves not?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Yet what different passions arise from one and the selfe-same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Here, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> you shall see some of your Sexe so surprized with <hi>affection,</hi> as it bursts out into violent extremes; their discourse is semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brev'd with sighes, their talke with teares; they walke desperately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne, making Launds and desolate Groves their disconsolate Consorts. Their eyes are estrang'd from sleepe, their weakened appetite from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, their wearied limbs from repose. Melancholy is their sole melody; They have made a Contract with griefe, till griefe bring them to their grave. And these poore wenches are much to bee pittied, because their owne tender hearts brought them to this exigent: having either set their <hi>affections,</hi> where they thought verily they might bee requited and were not, or else where they received like seeming tender of <hi>affection,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards rejected, what they wished to effect they could not. So as, in time, if continuance of absence reduce them not to a better temper, they fall into a poore <hi>Maudlins</hi> distemper, by giving reines to passion, till it estrange them from the soveraignty of reason. Whereas others you shall see, though not such kind soules, nor halfe so passionate, yet more discreet in their choyce, and in the passages of love more temperate. These will not deigne to cast a loose looke upon their beloved: but stand so punctually upon their termes, as if they stood indifferent for their choyce, albeit constantly resolved never to admit of any change. These scorne to paint out their passions in plaints, or utter their thoughts in sighes, or shed one dispassionate teare for an incompassionate Lover. Their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught them better Notions: they will seemingly fly to make them follow, and so take them by whom they are most taken. They can play with the flame, and never cinge their wings; looke love in the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:45431:151"/>
face, and preserve their eyes; converse where they take delight, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour their <hi>affection</hi> with a seeming disdaine. These are they who can walke in the Clouds to their intimatest friends: make their eyes strangers to their hearts, and conclude; nothing more foolish then Love, if discovered; nothing more wise, if artfully shadowed. But I neither approve the <hi>violence</hi> of the former, nor <hi>indifference</hi> of the latter. The one interlayeth <hi>affection</hi> with too much passion, the other with too much dissimulation. These were well to bee so allayed or attempered, as neither too much eagernesse taxe the discretion, nor too much remisnesse argue coolenesse of <hi>affection.</hi> For the former, I must tell them, they give great advantage to an insulting Lover, to entertaine Love with such vehement ardour: it fares with these, as with hot <hi>duellists,</hi> who fight themselves out of breath, and so subject their relenting <hi>force</hi> to the command of a better tempered enemy. For the latter, they hold constantly that position in arguments of <hi>Love,</hi> as well as in other actions of their <hi>life</hi>; She knowes not how to <hi>live,</hi> nor how to <hi>love,</hi> that knowes not how to dissemble. I must tell these, <hi>Dissimulation</hi> sorts not well with <hi>affection:</hi> Lovers seldome reade Loves Politicks. Let them appeare what they are, with that discreet temper, as they may deserve the embraces of a Noble Lover. In briefe, let such as are too hot in the quest of their desires, attemperate that heat with intermissions: such violence is best rebated by absence. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, such as are too coole, let them quicken that easinesse with their more frequent conference, and assiduate presence.</p>

But this <hi>Passion</hi> never workes more tragicke or fearefull effects, then when it streames from Iealousie or Competition in the Subject where they love. Whereof we have variety of instances even in our owne Iland, to omit <hi>Italy,</hi> which is a very Theatre of Tragicke Conclusions in this kind.

<q>It sometimes pleased a young <hi>Gentlewoman,</hi> whose fortunes had swell'd her high, to settle her affection on a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of deserving parts, which hee entertained with a generous requitall: nothing was omitted that might any way increase this respect, or second the height of their joyes. Continuall resort and frequent made them inseparably one: No day so pleasing, as when they were together; No houre so tedious as when they were asunder. But how short is that moment of vading happinesse, which hath in it a rellish of lightnesse, and is not grounded on essentiall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse! Long had they not thus lived, and sociably loved, but the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> conceived some private suspition, that her selfe was not sole so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignesse of his heart, but that another was become sharer in his love.

her owne attendant, whose Caskets shee secretly opened, where shee found a Ring of especiall note, which shee had formerly bestowed on him. This confirmed her Conceit, changed her reall love into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hate; which shee seconded with this tragicke act: Inviting him one day to a Summer Arbour, where in former times they were usually wont to repose, amidst of an amorous discourse, shee casually fixt her eye upon three <hi>Lennets,</hi> one whereof picking some <hi>Privet</hi> leaves purposely to build her nest, flew away, while the two which remained, lovingly billed one with another: which shee intentively observing, used these words; <hi>How tenderly and intimately doe these poore fooles mate it? Were it not pitty they should ever bee divided?</hi> Which words shee had no sooner uttered, then the <hi>Shee-Lennet</hi> flew away, and left the Male alone, till another returned: with whom the <hi>Hee-Lennet</hi> billed, and amorously wooed as hee had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Which shee more seriously eying, <hi>O,</hi> quoth shee, <hi>How light these males are in their affection; This may seeme to you an easie error, but were I judge of Birds, it should receive due censure. Why Lady,</hi> (replyed hee) <hi>these poore Birds doe but according to their kind. Yea, but what doe yee kind men then, who ingage your loves, interest your selves, empawne your soules to bee constant where you professe love, and performe nothing lesse then what you professe most.</hi> Nor would her long intended revenge admit more liberty to her tongue; for with a passionate enterbreath shee clozed this speech with a fatall stabbe: leaving so much time to her unfortunate and disasterous Lover, as to discover to one of that sorrowfull family the ground of her hate, the occasion of his fall, which hastned on the dolefull Scene of her Tragedy. Now to allay or abate these passionate furies, there is no better meanes then to enter parley with reason; to chastise all such innovating motions as disquiet the inward repose of the mind; to use the helpe of such wholsome instructions, as may attemper the heat of those indisposed and inordinate passions.</q>
Anger, being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of blood about the heart, is such a fury, as to give way to it, is to disclaime reason: much wisedome is then required, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture advice to bee used, all assistants of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed before this <hi>Adder</hi> can bee charmed. For wee shall hardly see any one more forget themselves, then when they are surprized with this <hi>Passion.</hi> Some you shall observe so amazed or entranced, as they become wholly silenced: They cannot utter an articulate word to gaine a kingdome. Gladly would they expresse their distaste, and menace revenge, if their tongues would give them leave, but wrath hath tyed them to <hi>good behaviour.</hi> Others are so voluble of tongue, as nothing can passe them untouch'd, to asperse disgrace on such by whom they hold themselves wrong'd. If any infamy (which to that time lay buried) offer it selfe to their memory, how they joy in the occasion of venting their malice on their persons, bee their Calumny seconded with words of fowlest aspersion: Which sort of people the ever living <hi>Pindarus</hi> termes persons of unbounded and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled tongues. To remedy which enormities, take along with you these instructions: they will benefit you much in the height and heat of your anger, and allay your <hi>passion</hi> when it rageth and riseth into hugest distemper. Forthwith, so soone as you shall perceive your selves mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:45431:152"/>
restraine your passion; but if you cannot appeale nor compose your inward Commotion, at least restraine your tongue, and injoyne it si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that if it speake no good, it may speake no evill, lest being loose and set at liberty, it utter what <hi>wrath,</hi> and not <hi>reason</hi> dictates: More sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and peacefull it will be for you to retire from society, make recourse to your Oratory, by recommending to your best Physician the cure of this infirmity. Vse likewise this Cordiall salve to your corroding sore; the receit is Divine, if seasonably applyed, and will minister you comfort when you are most distempered. So soone as your disquieted minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to expostulate with the quality of your wrongs, which your Enemy is apt to aggravate and exasperate, purposely to hasten your precipitate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; propose and set before you all the disgraces which possibly you can suffer, and conferre them with those that were aspersed on your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: this will prepare you to suffer, teach you to conquer: for Arrowes foreseene menace lesse danger.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, when you consider the injuries which are done you by others, you may reflect upon the wrongs which are done by you unto others: for the consideration of your owne infirmity, will exact of you towards others an impunity. Weigh with your selves how much others suffer of you, how much God himselfe suffers of you, who, if hee should have inflicted revenge for every particular offence, you should have perished long since. In a word, you your selves are frequently grievous, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to your selves: Seeing then you are so distastefull unto your selves, as you must of necessity suffer many injuries and affronts from your selves, repine not at the sufferings which are inflicted by others on your selves.</p>
                  <p>You are likewise to consider these discommodities which arise from this <hi>Passion</hi>; which will arme you with patience, if of your selves you have any compassion. What availes it to be revenged, after our injury bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Is your wound by anothers wound to be cured? Or disgrace tendred, by rendring disgrace restored? Besides all this, see what he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, who <hi>anger</hi> obeyeth: 1. Hee is deprived of the Crowne of glory, and reward of eternity. 2. Hee becomes a Minister and Instrument of the Divell: 3. Hee destroyeth his owne soule, that hee might hurt anothers body: For a dispassionate or angry person is like unto him, who, that hee may kill his Asse, destroyeth himselfe; or rather like him, who for huge debts which hee is not able to discharge, is throwne into prison, and disdainefully refuseth any ones offer to pay his debt for him. For by him, who doth you wrong, is the debt which you owe to God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, if with patience you suffer the injury which is done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the angry person, who will bee his owne revenger, telleth God how and in what sort hee is to deale with him: that as hee suffered not small disgraces from another, so neither should small things bee suffered in him by God: As it is written, <hi>With what measure you mete, the same shall bee measured to you againe.</hi> Six other detriments or discommodities there bee which arise from the exorbitancy of this passion. For by Anger is lost, first, <hi>Wisedome,</hi> while reason becomes blinded. Secondly, <hi>Righteousnesse</hi>; for <hi>the wrath of man worketh not the righteousnesse of God.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Society</hi>; for the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of one angry man, is pleasing unto none. <hi>Bee not,</hi> saith the Wiseman, <hi>a companion with the angry man.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Concord,</hi> while peace is disturbed. Fifthly, the <hi>Light of Truth</hi>; because anger casteth
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:45431:153"/>
the darkenesse of confusion upon the mind or understanding, from whom God hideth the cheerefull beame of his Divine knowledge. Sixthly, the <hi>Splendor of the holy spirit: upon whom,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>shall my spirit rest, but upon the humble and quiet</hi>? that is, upon the meeke, mild, and compassionate.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what benefits may bee procured by attempering, what discommodities incurred by fostring this <hi>Passion.</hi> Whereon I have the rather insisted, because I am not ignorant, how the strongest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantest tempers have beene, and may bee distempered and disparaged by it; much more you, whose mainest strength consists in the expression of that <hi>Passion.</hi> At all times therefore use a moderate restraint; in the prime of your yeares, when youth sends forth her first promising blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes, <hi>behave</hi> your selves mildly without bitternesse, humbly without haughtinesse, modestly without lightnesse, soberly without childishnesse. The Caske will reteine her first taste; the Wooll her first dye; the purest Tablet her prime impression; the loyall'st Spirit her first affection. If you shew too much waywardnesse in your youth, small good is to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in your age. As you tender your preferment, seeme milde while you are maids, lest you prove scare-crowes to a young mans bed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your selves likewise to a nuptiall State, and preserve your honour without staine. Contest not with your <hi>head</hi> for preeminence: you came from him, not hee from you, honour him then as hee cherisheth the love hee conceives in you. A domestick fury makes ill harmony in any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The discord which was hatched and increased towards <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> was ever allayed and attempered by the moderation of <hi>Octavia.</hi> Bee you all <hi>Octavia's</hi>; the rougher your crosse, the richer your Crowne. The more that injuries presse you, the more shall your patience praise you. The Conflict is but short and momentanie, the Triumph glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and impall'd with eternity. And thus much touching those three particulars, whereon your <hi>Behaviour</hi> principally reflects; wee are now to descend to the next branch, which shall shew how a <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> of ranke and quality, (for to such onely is my discourse directed) is to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have her selfe in Company.</hi>

                     </note>
                     <hi>SOciety</hi> is the solace of the living; for to live without it, were a kinde of dying. Companions and friendly Associats are the <hi>Theeves</hi> of time. No houre can be so tedious, which two loving Consorts cannot passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with delight, and spend without distaste. Bee the night never so darke, the place never so meane, the cheerefull beames of conceiving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts will enlighten the one, and their affections mutually planted, enliven the other. What a Desart then were the world without friends? and how uselesse those friends without conceiving mindes? and how weake those mindes, unlesse united in equall bonds? So then, love is the Cement of our life: a load without love. Now, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> you are to put on your vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and goe into <hi>Company.</hi> Which (I am perswaded) you cannot enter without a maiden-blush, a modest tincture. Herein you are to be most cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous, seeing no place can bee more mortally dangerous. Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with whom you consort, as you tender your repute: for report will brute what you are, by the Company which you beare. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> being at a combat, discerned the inclinations of his two daughters,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:45431:153"/>
                     <hi>Iulia</hi> and <hi>Livia,</hi> by the Company which frequented them: for grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators talked with <hi>Livia,</hi> but riotous persons with <hi>Iulia.</hi> Would you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve those precious odors of your good names? Consort with such whose names were never branded, converse with such whose tongues for immodesty were never taxed. As by good words evill manners are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, so by evill words are good ones corrupted. Make no reside there, where the least occasion of lightnesse is ministred; avert your Eare when you heare it, but your heart especially, lest you harbour it. To enter into much discourse or familiarity with strangers, argues lightnesse or indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: what is spoken of Maids, may bee properly applyed by an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full consequence to all women: <hi>They should be seene, and not heard:</hi> A Traveller sets himselfe best out by discourse, whereas their best setting out is silence. You shall have many trifling questions asked, as much to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as if they said nothing: but a frivolous question deserves to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd by silence. For your <hi>Carriage,</hi> it should neither be too precise, nor too loose. These sempring made faces partake more of <hi>Chambermaid</hi> then <hi>Gentlewoman.</hi> Modesty and mildnesse hold sweetest correspondence. You may possibly be wooed to interchange favours: Rings or Ribonds are but trifles; yet, trust mee, they are no trifles that are aym'd at in those exchanges. Let nothing passe from you, that may any way impeach you, or give others advantage over you. Your innocent credulity (I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) is as free from conceit of ill, as theirs, perhaps, from intendment of good: but these intercourses of Courtesies are not to be admitted, lest by this familiarity, an Entry to affection be opened, which before was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. It is dangerous to enter parley with a beleagring enemy: it implies want or weaknesse in the besieged. Chastity is an <hi>inclosed Garden,</hi> it should not be so much as assaulted, lest the report of her spotlesse beauty become soyled. Such Forts hold out best, which hold themselves least secure, when they are securest. It was the saying of a worthy Generall, Presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on a mans owne strength is the greatest weaknesse; and the readie way to betray himselfe to dangers is to contemne them. <hi>Nasica,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth was supposed to be in most secure estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause freed of their enemies, and strongly fenced by their friends, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that though the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both brought under the yoke of bondage, yet they were most in danger, because none were left, whom they might either feare for danger, or who should keepe them in awe.</p>
                  <p>How subject poore <hi>Women</hi> be to lapses, and recidivations, being left their owne Guardians, daily experience can sufficiently discover. Of which number, those alwayes proved weakest, who were confidentest of their owne strength. Presumption is a daring sinne, and ever brings out some untimely birth, which viper-like deprives her unhappy parent of life. I have knowne divers so resolute in their undertakings, so presuming of their womanish strength, so constantly devoted to a single life, as in publike consorts they held it their choycest merriment to give love the affront, to discourse of affection with an imperious contempt, geere their amorous suiters out of Count'nance, and make a very <hi>Whirligig</hi> of love. But marke the conclusion of these insulting spirits: they sport so long with love, till they fall to love in earnest. A moment makes them of Soveraignes Captives, by slaving them to that deservedly, which at first they entertained so disdainfully. The way then to prevent this malady, is to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:45431:154"/>
weane you from consorting with folly. What an excellent impregnable fortresse were <hi>Woman,</hi> did not her <hi>Windowes</hi> betray her to her enemy? But principally, when shee leaves her Chamber to walke on the publike Theatre; when shee throwes off her vaile, and gives attention to a merry tale; when shee consorts with youthfull bloud, and either enters parley, or admits of an enter-view with love. It is most true what the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious morall sometimes observed: Wee may bee in <hi>security,</hi> so long as wee are sequestred from <hi>society.</hi> Then, and never till then, begins the <hi>infection</hi> to bee dispersed, when the sound and sicke begin to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously mixed. Tempt not Chastity; hazard not your Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. You shall encounter with many forward youths, who will most punctually tender their uselesse service to your shadowes at the very first sight: doe not admit them, lest you prostitute your selves to their prostrate service. <hi>Apelles</hi> found fault with <hi>Protogenes,</hi> in that hee could not hold his hands from his Table. Whereas our <hi>Damsels</hi> may more justly finde fault with their youthfull <hi>Amorists,</hi> for that they cannot hold their hands from under the Table. It is impossible to come off faire with these light-fingred fooles. Your onely way is rampire your chaste intentions with Divine and Morall instructions, to stop the source, divert the occasion, subject <hi>affection</hi> to <hi>reason,</hi> so may you become Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peresses of that which hath sometimes tyrannized over Emperours: By this meanes shall every place where you <hi>publikely</hi> resort minister to you some object of inward comfort: By this meanes shall <hi>Company</hi> furnish you with precepts of chastity, inable you in the serious practice of piety, and sweetly conduct you to the port of glory.</p>

Never lesse alone then when most alone: for then, and never so freely as then, enjoyed fancy full scope of action, as when her retired privacy gave her thoughts leave to converse with affection. Then and onely then became jealous Love a Projector, contriving wayes for enjoying her Lover. No <hi>Italian</hi> device, closed it never so inordinately with sense, could be unattempted, to catch him by whom shee was catched; to seaze on him by whom shee was surprized.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:45431:154"/>
lose herselfe, then by meanes of her deluded privacy, lose opportunity. To you, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> I direct my discourse, whose privacy may enable you, if well employed, for better things than the toyes, tyres, &amp; trifles of this age. How many (the more our misery) bestow their <hi>private houres</hi> (which might be dedicated to Contemplation, or workes of piety &amp; devotion) upon light-feather'd inventions, amorous expostulations, or minting of some unbesee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fashions? How few enter into account with their owne hearts; or so consecrate their houres to Gods honour, as they make <hi>Privacy</hi> their soules harbour? The day they spend in <hi>visitations</hi>; how rare and tedious is one houre reserved for meditation? What a serious intercourse or sociable dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue is betweene an amorous Mistresse and her Looking-glasse! The poynt or pendent of her feather wags out of a due posture; her Cheeke wants her true tincture; her captious Glasse presents to her quicke eye one error or other, which drives her into a monstruous distemper. Pride leaves no time for prayer. This is her CLOSET for LADIES, where shee fits and accommodates her selfe to <hi>Fashion,</hi> which is the period of her content, while purer objects are had in contempt. This is not the way to make <hi>Privacy</hi> your mindes melody. These employments should sooner afflict than affect you, because they will sooner distract than direct you. Your spirits will bee revived most, when these are valued least. Let me therefore recommend to your choyce, Patternes of more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site worth: such whose devotion may bee your direction, whose direction your instruction.</p>
                  <p>Devout mention is made of zealous <hi>Anna,</hi> who made recourse to the Temple, offring her incessant prayers, a viall of sweet odours, that shee might conceive a sonne: of whom, to her succeeding memory, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture recordeth, that after her teares so devoutly shed, her prayers so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely offred, her religious vowes so faithfully performed, her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more altred; Piety begot in her divine love, faith in Gods promise made her beleeve, and zeale to Gods house caused her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe: thus sighing she sought, seeking shee obtained, and obtaining shee reteined a gratefull memory of what shee received. No lesse fervour shewed <hi>Ester</hi> in preferring the suite of her distressed <hi>Israelites</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive Oratory, what powerfull Rhetoricke, what inducing reasons shee used, to have their unjust censure reversed, their insupportable wrongs redressed, their aggrievances relieved, the incensed King appeased, and them to favour restored! Shee wooed with teares in her eyes, faith in her heart, almes in her hand: Gods cause was the progresse of her course; shee desired nothing more then how to effect it; which was seconded with a successive conclusion, because begun, continued, and ended with devotion. The like zeale expressed <hi>Iudith</hi> for her besiedged <hi>Bethulites</hi>; the love of God had so inflamed her, as no feare of the enemy could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate her; faith armed her with resolution, constancy strengthned her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all opposition. Her armour was prayer, <hi>Bethulia's</hi> cure her care, holy desires her sole attendants; shee enters her enemies pavilion with a zealous confidence; implores the Divine assistance in her entrance; and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits a <hi>daring</hi> foe with cautelous silence. Her sighes and teares were as the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second raine</hi>; they brought successe to her thirsty soule, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conquest to her native soyle. No lesse are wee to admire the wonderfull devotion of that teare-swollen <hi>Magdalen,</hi> who with devout love sought her deare Spouse intombed, whose body with obsequious
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:45431:155"/>
Odours shee had embalmed before ever hee was interred. Shee, when his Disciples were departed, left not the Sepulchre of her sweet Master; still shee sate sorrowing and sighing, weeping long and much, rising from her seat of sorrow, her grave of griefe: Where hee was, hee is not; and where hee is, shee knowes not: with pious teares, watchfull eyes, weary wayes, shee re-visits againe and againe the desart caves of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish'd Sepulchre, hoping at last to have the happinesse to behold, whom with so fervent a desire shee sought. Now once and againe had shee entred his desolate Tombe; but little was all this to her that lov'd so much: The power or efficacy of every good worke consists in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance. But observe the comfortable effect of her effectuall love! For as much as shee loved more than the rest, and loving wept more than the rest, and weeping sought more than the rest, and seeking persever'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her selfe no rest: therefore deserved she to finde, behold, and speake unto him before the rest. And not onely so, but to become the very first messenger of his glorious resurrection to his Disciples, according as her choyce Spouse had commanded her, and by especiall Commission re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to her: <hi>Goe, tell my Brethren that they goe into Galile, there they shall see me.</hi> Hence note the fruit of a devout heart; the incomparable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative granted to Divine love! <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his Epitaph for his sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> writeth, that shee was so given to prayer, that her knees seemed to cleave to the earth, and to grow to the very ground by reason of inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancy or continuance in prayer. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Dialogues writeth, that his Aunt <hi>Trasilla</hi> being dead, was found to have her elbowes as hard as horne: which hardnesse shee got by leaning to a Deske, at which shee used to pray. Such as these deserve your imitation; for their <hi>Vertues,</hi> like sweet <hi>Odours,</hi> have sent out a pleasant perfume. They <hi>prayed,</hi> and <hi>obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> what they pray'd for; They <hi>liv'd</hi> and <hi>practis'd</hi> what they sought for; They <hi>dy'd</hi> and <hi>enjoy'd</hi> what they so long time sigh'd for. You are taught to <hi>Enter your Chambers and bee still. Still,</hi> and yet <hi>stirring</hi> still: <hi>Still</hi> from the clamours and turbulent insults of the <hi>World; still</hi> from the mutinous motions and innovations of the <hi>flesh.</hi> But never <hi>still</hi> from warring, wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, bickring and embattailing with the <hi>Leader</hi> of those treacherous asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats, tyrannous assassinats. O should you consider what troopes of furious and implacable Enemies are ever lying in ambuscado for you; how many soule-tempting <hi>Syrens</hi> are warbling notes of ruine to delude you; what <hi>feares</hi> within you, what <hi>foes</hi> without you, what <hi>furies</hi> all about you; you would not suffer one graine of sand to drop through the Cruet, without a dropping eye; not one minute passe undedicated to some good employment, to prevent the fury of such desperate assailants. Make then your Chamber your private Theatre, wherein you may act some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Scene to Gods honour. Bee <hi>still</hi> from the world, but <hi>stirring</hi> towards God. Meditation, let it bee your companion: It is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of the memory; the soules rouzer from sinnes lethargy, the sweetest solace in straits of adversity. Let it bee your <hi>key</hi> to open the <hi>Morning,</hi> your <hi>locke</hi> to close the <hi>Evening.</hi> What an argument of indiscretion were it for one, amidst variety of choyce and delicious viands, to discourse of vanity, and suffer himselfe to famish in the presence of such plenty? This is your case, if amids so many soule-solacing dainties of spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, you divert your eye, by fixing it on these Objects of earth: and repose not your selves in those fragrant borders of Divine Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:45431:155"/>
which, by how much they are more frequent, by so much they become more sweet and redolent. Surely, there is nothing that relisheth more sweetly, tasteth more daintily, with-draweth your mindes from the world more speedily, strengtheneth you against the temptations of your enemy, excites or exerciseth you in every spirituall duty, as the soule-ravishing <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Supreme Deity. All other Objects are vanity. They may play upon your fantasie, and so delude you; but being weakely grounded on piety, they can never suffice you. Taske your selves then privately, lest <hi>privacy</hi> become your enemy. As mans extremity is Gods opportunity, so the Divels opportunity is mans security. Let not a minute bee mis-spended, lest security become your attendant. Bee it in the exercise of your Needle, or any other manuall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, attemper that labour with some sweet meditation tending to Gods honour. Chuse rather with <hi>Penelope</hi> to weave and unweave, than to give Idlenesse the least leave. Wanton Wooers are time-wasters: They make you idolize your selves; and consequently hazzardize the state of your soules. Let not their <hi>Lip-salve</hi> so annoynt you, as it make you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of him that made you. Bee you in your Chambers or private Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets; bee you retired from the eyes of men; thinke how the eyes of God are on you. Doe not say, the walls encompasse mee, darkenesse o're-shadowes mee, the Curtaine of night secures me; these be the words of an <hi>Adulteresse</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore doe nothing <hi>privately,</hi> which you would not doe <hi>publikely.</hi> There is no retire from the eyes of God. I have heard of some, who for want of more amorous or attractive Objects abroad, have furnished their private Chambers with wanton pictures, <hi>Aretine</hi> tables, <hi>Sibariticke</hi> stories. These were no objects for Christian eyes: they convey too inordinate an heat from the eye to the heart. The history of Christ is a peece of portraiture that will suite your Chambers best. Eye no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which may estrange you from thought of your Maker. Make every day your <hi>Ephemerides.</hi> Let your morning initiate your purposes for the day, the day second what your morning purposed, the Evening examine your mornings purpose, your dayes purchase. And so I descend to the next branch, how you are to <hi>behave</hi> your selves in <hi>publike,</hi> which should be by so much more punctuall, for as much as the world is more Stoicall.</p>
                  <p>WOmen in sundry Countryes,<note place="margin">This branch might seeme included in our former discourse of <hi>Company</hi>; but that reflected on <hi>persons,</hi> this on <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</hi>
                     </note> when they goe into any <hi>publike</hi> concourse or presse of people, use to weare vayles, to imply that secret inscreened beauty which best becomes a <hi>Woman, Bash-full modesty.</hi> Which habit our owne Nation now in latter yeares hath observed: which, howsoever the intention of the wearer appeare, deserves approvement; because it expresseth in it selfe <hi>Modest shamefastnesse,</hi> a Womans chiefest Ornament. I second his opinion, who held it; for divers maine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, a custome very irregular an undecent, that <hi>Women</hi> should fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent places of <hi>publike</hi> resort, as Stage-playes, Wakes, solemne Feasts, and the like. It is <hi>Occasion</hi> that depraves us; <hi>Company</hi> that corrupts us. Hence it was that some flourishing States, having eyed the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which arise from the usuall resort of <hi>Women</hi> to Enterludes and other <hi>publike</hi> Solemnities, published an expresse inhibition against such free and frequent meetings. Had <hi>Hippodamia</hi> never wandred, shee had prov'd an <hi>Hypemnestra,</hi> and had never wantoned. Had <hi>Dinah</hi> never roaved, shee
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:45431:156"/>
had prov'd a <hi>Diana,</hi> and had never beene ravished. Yet farre bee it from me, to bee so regularly strict, or <hi>Laconically</hi> severe, as to exclude <hi>Women</hi> from all <hi>publike</hi> societies. Meetings they may have, and improve them, by a Civill and Morall use of them, to their benefit. They may chat and converse with a modest freedome, so they doe not gossip it. For these <hi>Shee-Elpenors,</hi> and <hi>Feminine Epicures,</hi> who surfet our their time in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womanly excesse, wee exclude them the pale of our Common-weale. Bee they of what <hi>state</hi> soever, they are staines to their <hi>Sexe</hi> for ever. Especially such, who carouse it in deepe healths, rejoyce at the colour of the wine, till it sparkle in their veines, inflame their bloods, and lay open a breach to the frailty of their Sexe. For prevention whereof, wee reade that kinsmen kissed their kinswomen to know whether they drunke wine or no; and if they had, to bee punished by death, or banished into some Iland. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, that if the Matrons had any necessity to drinke wine, either because they were sicke or weake; the Senate was to give them licence, and not then in <hi>Rome</hi> neither, but out of the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Macrobius</hi> saith, that there were two Senators in <hi>Rome</hi> chiding, and the one called the others wife an Adulteresse, and the other his wife a Drunkard; and it was judged, that to bee a drunkard was more infamy. Truth is, they might joyne hands as mates of one society, for I have sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome seene any one subject to Ebriety, preserve long untainted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their chastity.</p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>publike</hi> Employments, I know all are not borne to bee <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borahs,</hi> to beare virile spirits in feminine bodies. Yet, in <hi>chusing the better part,</hi> you may fit and accommodate your persons to <hi>publike affaires,</hi> well sorting and suting with your ranke and quality. <hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> were nobly descended, yet they <hi>publikely</hi> resorted where they might bee religiously instructed; and no lesse <hi>publikely</hi> instructed others in those principles wherein they were informed. It is said of the <hi>Vestall Virgins,</hi> that they first learned what to doe; secondly, they did what they had learned; thirdly, they instructed others to doe that which they had both done and learned. For this, the rich <hi>Saban Queene</hi> left her owne Region to heare the Wisdome of King <hi>Salomon.</hi> Surely, howsoever some, no lesse properly than pregnantly, have emblematiz'd <hi>Woman</hi> by a <hi>Snaile</hi>; because shee still carries her house about her, as is the property of a good House-keeper: yet in my judgement (wherein I ingenuously submit to others censure) a modest and well <hi>Behaved Woman</hi> may by her frequent or resort to <hi>publike</hi> places, conferre no lesse benefit to such as observe her <hi>behaviour,</hi> than occasion of profit to her private family, where shee is <hi>Over-seer.</hi> I have seene some in these places of <hi>publike repaire,</hi> expresse such a well-seeming State without Apish formality, as every action de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served imitation of such as were in their Company. Their Conceits were sweetly tempered without lightnesse; their jests savory, yet without saltnesse; their discourse free without nicenesse; their answers milde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tartnesse; their smile pleasing, mixt with bashfulnesse; their pace grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full without too much activenesse; their whole posture delightfull with a seemely carelesnesse. These are such mirrors of modesty, patternes of piety, as they would not for a world transgresse the bounds of Civility. These are Matrons in their houses, Models in <hi>publike</hi> places. <hi>Words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in season, are like apples of gold with pictures of silver</hi>: So opportunately
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:45431:156"/>
are their words delivered, so seasonably uttered, with such unaffected elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence expressed, wheresoever this sweet and well-tempered discretion is seated. Whereas others there be, whose indiscretion makes discovery of an Ocean of words, but a drop of reason. They speake much, but expresse little; their conceits are ever ballased with harshnesse; their jests foisted in with too much dulnesse; their discourse trimmed up with too much neatnesse; their answers leavened with too much sowrenesse; their lookes promising too much lightnesse, or unsociable perversenesse; their pace either too quicke or too slow in dispatch of busines; their whole posturean indisposed frame of irregular absurdities. But to draw in our fayles, touching the prosecution of this branch; our reproofe shall reflect upon two sorts especially, whose devious course drawne by an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line, may seeme to deserve reprehension worthily. The <hi>first</hi> are such who give too easie raines to liberty, making <hi>Pleasure</hi> their <hi>Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; as if they were created for no other end, then to dedicate the first fruits of the day to their <hi>Glasse</hi>; the residue to the <hi>Stage</hi> or <hi>Exchange.</hi> These, no sooner have they laid their <hi>Artificiall Complexion</hi> on their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate faces, then they grow sicke for their Coach. They must visit such a Lady, or what, perchance, is worse, such a Lord. A minute now in their Chambers seemes a moneth. Shall wee display one of these in her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? The <hi>Play-bils</hi> must be brought her by her <hi>Pentioner:</hi> her eye views and reviewes, and out of her feminine judgement culs out one from among them which shee will see, purposely to be seene. Much shee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not in it, onely shee desires to be observed at it. Her <hi>Behaviour</hi> in a <hi>Box,</hi> would make any one thinke shee were a Bee in a box; shee makes such a buzzing and rusling. This is her daily taske, till death enter the Stage and play his part; whom shee entertaines with such unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as her <hi>extreme act</hi> presents objects of infinite unhappinesse:
<q>As it sometimes fared with a Gentlewoman of our owne Nation, who so daily bestowed the expence of her best houres upon the Stage, as being surprized by sicknesse, even unto death, shee became so deafe to such as admonished her of her end, as when her Physician was to minister a Receipt unto her, which hee had prepared to allay the extremity of that agonizing fit wherewith shee was then assailed, putting aside the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt with her hand, as if shee rejected it, in the very height and heate of her distemper, with an active resolution used these words unto her Doctor: Thankes good <hi>Horatio,</hi> take it for thy paines.</q>
So inapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive was shee of death at her end, because shee never meditated of death before her end. Now for the <hi>second sort,</hi> they are meere <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the former; These are onely for <hi>profit,</hi> as the other were for <hi>pleasure.</hi> These become so wedded to the world, as they afflict their spirits, macerate their bodies, estrange themselves from offices of Neighbourhood, to improve their revenewes, by discovering their too much providence to the world. And these are commonly such, as are matcht to Schollers, whose contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation hath taken them from the world, and recommended the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their estate to their wife. Now to both these sorts let mee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse my instruction: As I could not possibly approve of the <hi>former,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they made <hi>pleasure</hi> their <hi>businesse:</hi> so I cannot commend these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they make not their <hi>businesse</hi> a <hi>pleasure.</hi> Let these take heed, that they incurre not that miserable insensibility, which I have heard some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times befell to a Worldling of their sexe:
<q>Who approaching neere her
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:45431:157"/>
haven, &amp; entring now her last conflict with Nature, was, by such as stood about her, earnestly moved <hi>to recommend her selfe to God, tender the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of her soule, and to make her salvation sure</hi>; thus briefly, but fearfully answered, and forthwith departed: <hi>I have made it as sure as Law will make it.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        </note> Or as wee read in a booke enituled <hi>The Gift of feare,</hi> how a Religious Divine comming to a certaine Vsuresse, to advise her of the state of her soule, and instruct her in the way to salvation, at such time as she lay languishing in her bed of affliction; told her, how there were three things by her to be necessarily performed, if ever she hoped to be saved: First, shee was to be <hi>contrite</hi> in heart; secondly, shee was to <hi>confesse</hi> her sinnes; thirdly, shee was to make <hi>restitution</hi> according to her meanes. Whereto shee thus replyed; <hi>Two of those first I will doe willingly: but to doe the last, I shall hold it a difficulty; for should I make restitution, what would remaine to raise my children their portion?</hi> To which the Divine answered; <hi>Without these three you cannot be saved. Yea but,</hi> quoth shee, <hi>Doe our Learned men and Scriptures say so! Yes surely,</hi> said the Divine. <hi>And I will try</hi> (quoth shee) <hi>whether they say true or no, for I will restore nothing.</hi>
                     </q>
And so resolving, fearefully dyed, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poverty temporall, more then eternall, which shee was of necessity to suffer, (without Gods infinite interceding mercy) for preferring the care of her posterity, before the honour of her Maker.</p>
                  <p>To be short, the <hi>former sort</hi> deserves reproofe, for making <hi>pleasure</hi> their <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ocation</hi>; the <hi>latter</hi> for barring <hi>businesse</hi> all <hi>recreation.</hi> A discreet temper will moderate both these; the <hi>first,</hi> by holding <hi>pleasure</hi> a pastime, and no <hi>businesse</hi>; the <hi>last,</hi> by applying a cure to an incessant care, and immixing some <hi>pleasure</hi> with <hi>businesse,</hi> to attemper it, lest it incline to heavinesse. Both which, equally concurring, are ever conferring to the labouring mind, inward quietnesse.</p>
                  <p>COmplexion inclosed in a box, gives no tincture to the Cheeke, nor morall precepts unapplyed, beauty to the mind. Thus farre have wee proceeded in directions of <hi>Behaviour</hi>;<note place="margin">That <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> most approved which is clearest from <hi>affectation</hi> freed.</note> insisting on such remarkeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances, as might better enable you in each particular. Wee are now to say before you, upon serious discussion of the premisses, how that <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> is to be most <hi>approved,</hi> which is clearest from <hi>affectation</hi> freed.</p>
                  <p>Apes are catcht in Desarts by imitation. Would not you be caught by indiscretion? Imitate nothing servilely, it detracts from your <hi>gentility.</hi> I have noted some of our Chambermaids take upon them such an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming state, when they came to visit their poore friends in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as they punctually retein'd both gate and garbe of their mincing Mistresses in the City. To their Parish-Church they repaire to be seene and showne; where if any of these civilized <hi>Iugs</hi> chance to be saluted by the way, having quite forgot both broome and mop, with a scornefull eye they will not stick to returne this majestick answer: <hi>Wee thanke you, my good people.</hi> It is discretion that appropriates to every peculiar degree their proper distinction. Many things will beseeme the Mistresse, which agree not with the quality of the Maid. But in no degree will that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi> seeme comely, which <hi>affectation</hi> hath introduced, be it in <hi>Court, City,</hi> or <hi>Countrey.</hi> You shall see many, purposely to cover some naturall blemish or deformity, practise that which makes them appeare farre more
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:45431:157"/>
unseemly. Here one indents with her lips to semper, that shee may hide the want or greatnesse of her teeth. Another contracts with her Tayler, lest <hi>Nemesis</hi> should be seene sitting on her shoulder. A third weares her Gowne with a carelesse loosenesse, to cover or colour her bodies crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. This, with <hi>Fabulla,</hi> buyes an artfull Periwig to supply her art-fallen haire: That enazures her seered veines, embolsters her decayed brests, to purchase a sweet-heart. What an <hi>affected</hi> state this generally-infected state assumes, purposely to gaine a popular esteeme? Survey our streets, gaze on our windowes; you shall see gazers to entertaine your eyes with variety of phantasticke <hi>Behaviours.</hi> But these are none of <hi>Vertues</hi> followers. Would you be prayse-worthy? Vertue to her selfe is her chiefest prayse, her choycest prize. There is nothing comparably precious to a continent soule. <hi>Affectation</hi> shee will not admit, for her habit; both her <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Behaviour</hi> are proper not enforced; native and not apishly introduced. Shee cannot wooe a wanton Lover with a dissembled blush, nor promise more with an outward presence, then shee resolves to admit with a spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Conscience. Outward semblances, if light, shee holds apparant ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes to her life. Her <hi>life,</hi> as it is a <hi>line</hi> to her selfe, so she would have it a <hi>light</hi> to others. <hi>Lacides</hi> Prince of <hi>Argos,</hi> was accounted lascivious onely for his sleeke lookes, and mincing gate. So <hi>Pompey,</hi> because hee used to scratch his head with one finger, albeit very continent and modest. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, though your <hi>Person</hi> be the <hi>Booke,</hi> your <hi>Behaviour</hi> is the <hi>Index.</hi> Which will require a large <hi>Comment,</hi> if it expresse it selfe in ought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably incontinent. Now, for as much as nothing better seemes you, more commendably adornes you, or more absolutely accommodates you, then what is native and unaffected, so it be by <hi>Education</hi> seasoned: bee your owne Women; dis-value all apish formality; resort not to the Temple to take a patterne of some new fashion: modest discretion blusheth at such servile imitation. What you see in another, may become them, which would not become another. The Asse in the fable seeing the dogge fawne and leap upon his Master, though it would beseeme him, but sorting not with his nature, it got him a beating for his labour.</p>
                  <p>Now to distinguish betwixt an enforced and unaffected <hi>Behaviour,</hi> it is most easie; the very first blush will discover the one by the other. You shall observe these who are tyed to <hi>affectation</hi> in this kind, set their looke, gate, and whatsoever else may conferre a phantasticke grace on their usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Behaviour,</hi> so punctually, as if they had entred a solemne Contract with eye, face, hand, foot and all, to hold constantly their dimension, to beget in the beholder a more setled admiration. Whereas contrariwise, these whose free, genuine, and generous demeanours expresse themselves lesse strictly, but farre more comely, scorne to tye their affections to these servile restraints. They hold it farre more sutable with an <hi>Italian Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mime,</hi> who professeth hope of profit upon the Stage, to confine them to these regularities, then discreet Women, whose honour is their honest <hi>Behaviour</hi>; and whose praise it is, to be exemplary to others in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not others Apes in imitating their phantastick fashions. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then this <hi>Observation</hi>; as you are <hi>generous</hi> by birth, dote not on that which is most ridiculous on this Stage of earth. Approve your selves chaste Virgins, continent Wives, discreet Matrons, honourable Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, in your vertuous and modest demeanour. Preserve that eternally, which gives accomplishment to Gentility. Your Educations (as may be
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:45431:158"/>
presupposed) have so beautified you, as the garbe you reteine is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto you. The <hi>Hyaena</hi> is a dangerous beast: yet her subtilty and cruelty take life from <hi>affectation</hi> and <hi>imitation.</hi> Desire you to bee so <hi>Behav'd,</hi> as others may admire you? In your choyce of <hi>Behaviour,</hi> inure your selves to what is <hi>neatest,</hi> not what is <hi>newest.</hi> Invention in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this kinde, doth more harme than good. So <hi>behave</hi> your selves, that too much curiosity may not taxe you of pride, nor too much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of State: Modesty mixt with humility will temper both these, and make that <hi>Behaviour</hi> which appeares in you, so well become you, as if it were borne with you, and not <hi>affectively</hi> derived from others to you.</p>

Nothing was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in those times publikely, but what was by the graver Censors first discussed privately. Iealous were the Pagans of forraine fashions: for, with such constancy they reteined their owne, as they seldome or never itched after others. The <hi>Tyrian</hi> and <hi>Sidonian</hi> were so suspected of pride, through their effeminacy in attire, and other light fashions which they used, as they were held dangerous to commerce with. So purely did those poore beamelings of Nature reflect on her people; that <hi>formality</hi> was held palpable <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> faire semblances and coole performances meer golden shadowes to delude others, but gull themselves most. Princes Courts were Princely Seminaries. Delicacy was there no Tutresse, nor
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:45431:159"/>
effeminacy Governesse. If <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> albeit in <hi>Athens</hi> the beautifull'st, for native endowments the pregnant'st, and for descent one of the noblest, introduce ought irregularly; or expresse any <hi>Complement</hi> which relisheth not of Civility; the author must suffer the censure of the City. It was very usuall in former times, when any Embassie was addressed from one state unto another, for the Senate or Councell, from whence any such Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate was sent, to schoole them in sundry particulars before they tooke their journey or received their Commission: but in no caution were they more strict, then in expresse command that they should use no other garbe, <hi>Complement,</hi> nor salute upon their approach in forraine Courts, then what they had seene used and observed at home. Thus their owne native fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, became a note of distinction to every Nation.</p>
                  <p>Neither am I ignorant, how, even in one and the selfe-same Province, there may be generally introduced a different or distinct garbe: which proceedeth either from the Commerce and Confluence of people there resorting, and consequently improving their <hi>Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Elocution</hi> by their mutuall conference; or from the Princes Court, where all State and Majesty hath residence; or from the temperature of the Ayre, to which some have attributed an especiall preeminence. Whereas, in desart and remote places, on which the beames of Civill society seldome reflect, wee shall find nothing but barbarisme and unsociable wildnesse. Education is the improver of the one, and producer of the other. Wee shall ever see <hi>Complement</hi> shine most in places eminent. There are <hi>Objects</hi> fit for such <hi>Subjects:</hi> Such as expect it, and bestow their whole dayes practice in exercise of it: These aspire to the nature or <hi>definition</hi> of no art more eagerly, then <hi>Complement,</hi> which they hold the absolute ornament of <hi>Gentility.</hi> Howsoever, mainely repugnant be their <hi>Tenets</hi> touching the subsistence of <hi>Complement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have held, it consisted in congies, cringes, and salutes; of which errour, I would this age wherein wee live, did not too much labour: others, meerely in a painted and superficiall discourse; wherein they so miserably tyed themselves to words, as they tyred the impatient hearers with foolish repetitions, frivolous extravagancies; being, in a word, so affianced to the <hi>shadow,</hi> as they forgot the <hi>substance.</hi> The last, which were onely <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>complete</hi> Courtiers, held a seemely gracefull presence, beautifide with a native comelinesse, the deservingst <hi>Complement</hi> that could attend us. Certainely, if wee should exactly weigh the derivation of the word, wee could not imagine so meanly of it, as to consist meerly of words, or anticke workes. It was first intended to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt persons of civill and savage carriage: yea, to appropriate a title of preeminence to such, who exceeded others in grounds or precepts of Morality; whose lives appeared as Lampes to enlighten others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently perpetuate the memory of themselves. Many noble and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Ladies are recorded, both in divine and humane writ, to have excelled in this <hi>Complement</hi> of honour.

Former times were not so <hi>jaded</hi> to <hi>fashions,</hi> as to esteeme nothing <hi>formall,</hi> but what was <hi>phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> It was not then held the life of <hi>Complement,</hi> to have the art to set a face, court a glasse, make a cringe or a ducke. Legges were held for use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full supporters, but no <hi>Complementall</hi> postures. New-minted words made not their tongues more <hi>complete:</hi> nor an Outlandish Salute their Persons more admired. Virgin-modesty made resolution her <hi>Steletto</hi> to guard her honour: Plumes and Feathers were held light dressings for staid minds; suspicious trimmings for stale Maids. Actors might weare them in their presentments upon the Stage, but modest Matrons were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allowed to weare them in the State. Women were admitted to have Painters, but not to be their owne painters: <hi>Campaspe</hi> was pictured out in her colours by <hi>Apelles: Crotons</hi> five daughters lively depictured by <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> yet these, without any helpe of art, still retained their owne native features. It was the <hi>Complement</hi> of that age to deliver their mind freely without mincing, converse friendly without glozing; walke the street demurely without gazing. Wherein (with submission ever to graver judgements) this latter age, in mine opinion, deserves just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe. Education is a second Nature, and this hath given that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to women, as they may admit any oportunity to entertaine time with their amorous servants; redart wanton tales with light blushes; passe a whole afternoone in a Bay-window, in Congies, Courtesies, and other uselesse <hi>Complements.</hi> Flashes of wit are made beguilers of time; and these mixt now and then with such lascivious passages, as modesty might justly hold it selfe abused to be so encountred: Alas!

Doe you observe how their tongues are tipt with your praises; how they honour your shadowes; admire the earth you tread on; adore the Ayre you breath on; and with their ayrie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses so gild you, as in the end they palpably gull you; leaving you no lesse miserably deluded, than themselves seased of what their sensuall quest pursued? Beware of that <hi>Complement</hi> which gives way to rob you of your choycest <hi>Ornament. Egnatius,</hi> in <hi>Catullus,</hi> is brought out, shewing the whitenesse of his teeth: a poore subject to raise an Encomiasticke poem.

Many you have of your sexe, who are too attentive auditors in the report of their owne praises. Nothing can bee attributed to them, which they hold not properly due unto them.

Let no conceit transport you above your selves; hold it for no <hi>Complement</hi> worthy your breeding, to trifle time in love-toyes.

is no sooner made than melted? Make choyce of such for your <hi>Consorts,</hi> whose choyce may admit no change. Let no <hi>Company</hi> bee affected by you, which may hazard infecting of you. The <hi>World</hi> is growne a very <hi>Pest-house</hi>: timely prevention must bee used, before the infection have entred. You have no such soveraigne receits to repell, as you have to prevent. The infection of vice leaves a deeper spot or speckle on the mind, than any desease doth on the body. The <hi>Blackmoore</hi> may sooner change his skin, the <hi>Leopard</hi> his spots, than a soule deepe dyed in the graine of infection, can put off her habituate corruption. Bee it then your principall care to make choyce of such bashfull Maids, modest Matrons, or reverend Widdowes, as hold it their best <hi>Complement</hi> to retaine the opinion of being <hi>Continent.</hi> Infamy hath wings as swift as fame. Shunne the occasion, lest you undergoe the brand. <hi>Posthuma,</hi> because given to laughter, and something forward to talke with men, was suspected of her honesty; where being openly accused, shee was acquitted by <hi>Spurius Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> with this caveat, to use words sutable to her life. Civility, trust me, is the best and most <hi>refined Complement</hi> that may bee. Courting in publike places, and upon first sight, it affects not; for it partakes more of <hi>impudent</hi> than <hi>Complete.</hi> Bee it of the <hi>City</hi> that argument of discourse bee ministred, it can talke freely of it without mincing; or of the <hi>Court,</hi> it can addresse it selfe to that garbe in apt words without minting; or of the <hi>Countrey,</hi> in an home-spun phrase it can expresse whatsoever in the Countrey deserves most prayse. And all this in such a proper and familiar manner, as such who are tied to <hi>Complement,</hi> may aspire to it, but never attaine it. Hee that hath once tasted of the fountaine <hi>Clitorius,</hi> will never afterward drinke any wine. Surely, howsoever this civill and familiar forme of dialect may seeme but as pure running water in comparison of <hi>Complement,</hi> which, like <hi>Nectar,</hi> streames out in Conduits of delight to the humorous hearer: yet our discreet <hi>Complementer</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the pure fountaine before the troubled river. It is true, that many fashions, which even these later times have introduc'd, deserve free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance; yea, there is some thing yet in our <hi>Oare,</hi> that may be <hi>refined.</hi> Yet in the acceptance of these, you are not to entertaine whatsoever these finer times have brought forth. Where variety is affected, and the age to inconstancy subjected, so as nothing but what is rare and new becomes esteemed: Either must our inventions bee present and pregnant, our surveyes of forraine places serious and sollicitant, or wee shall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to decay of fashion, or make old ones new, and so by antiquity gull our Nation. Truth is, though our tongues, hands, bodies, and legges bee the same, our Elocution, action, gesture, and posture are not the same. Should the soule of <hi>Troilus,</hi> according to that erroneous transmigration of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> passe into the body of one of our English Courtiers; or <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> (who was an Orator active enough) into one of our English Lawyers; or <hi>Antigone</hi> (who was <hi>Complementall</hi> enough) into one of our English Curtezans; they would finde strange Cottages to dwell in. What is now held <hi>Complete</hi>; a few yeares will bury in disgrace. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then so <hi>refined,</hi> if on earth seated, which time will not raze, or more curious conceits dis-esteeme, or that universall reduction to nothing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve. That <hi>Complement</hi> may seeme pleasing; such a fashion generally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting; such a dressing most <hi>Complete</hi>: yet are all these within short space covered with contempt. What you observe then to be most civill in others,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45431:161"/>
affect it; such an <hi>habit</hi> needs not to bee <hi>refined,</hi> which cannot be bettered. Fashion is a kinde of frenzy; it admires that now, which it will laugh at hereafter, when brought to better temper. Civility is never out of fashion; it ever reteines such a seemely garbe, as it conferres a grace on the wearer, and enforceth admiration in the beholder. Age cannot deface it; contempt disgrace it; nor gravity of judgement (which is ever held a serious Censor) disapprove it.</p>
                  <p>Bee thus minded, and this <hi>Complement</hi> in you will bee purely <hi>refined.</hi> You have singular patternes to imitate, represent them in your lives, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in your loves. The <hi>Corruption</hi> of the age, let it seize on ignoble spirits; whose education, as it never equall'd yours, so let them strike short of those nobler indowments of yours: labour daily to become impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, honour <hi>her</hi> that will make you honoured: let <hi>vertue</hi> be your crowne, who holds vanity a crime: So may you shew holinesse in your life, enjoy happinesse at your death, and leave examples of goodnesse unto others both in life and death.</p>

To which Objection I easily condescend; for, should a rusticke or boorish <hi>Behaviour</hi> accompany one who betakes himselfe to the Court, hee might bee sure to finde a <hi>Controuler</hi> in every corner to reprove him; or some <hi>complete Gallant</hi> or other, pittifully to geere and deride him. But to dote so on fashion, as to admire nothing more then a phantasticke dressing, or some anticke <hi>Complement,</hi> which the corruption of an effeminate State hath brought in, derogates more from discretion, then the strict observance of any fashion addes to her repute. This place should bee the <hi>Beacon</hi> of the <hi>State</hi>; whose mounting <hi>Prospect</hi> surveyes these inferiour coasts which pay homage and fealty unto her. The least obliquity there, is exemplary else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Piercing'st judgements, as well as pregnant'st wits should bee there resident. Not a wandring or indisposed haire, but gives occasion of observance to such as are neere.

Your <hi>beauty</hi> may proclaime you faire; your <hi>discourse</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a pregnancy of conceit; your <hi>behaviour</hi> confirme you outwardly <hi>complete.</hi> Yet there is something more then all this required, to make you absolutely <hi>accomplished.</hi> All these outward becommings, be they never so gracefull, are but reflections in a glasse; quite vanished, so soone as the glasse is removed. <hi>Critolaus</hi> balance was of precious temper, and well deserving estimation with Heires of Honour; who poised the goods of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>fortune</hi> in one skale, and goods of the <hi>mind</hi> in the other: where the goods of the <hi>mind</hi> so farre weighed downe the other, as the Heaven doth the Earth and Seas. To lead a dance gracefully; to marry your voice to your instrument musically; to expresse your selves in prose and verse morally; are commendable qualities, and enforcing motives of affection. Yet I must tell you, for the first, though it appeare by your feet to be but a meere <hi>dimension,</hi> in the opinion of the Learned, it is the <hi>Divels procession:</hi> Where the <hi>Dance</hi> is the <hi>Circle,</hi> whose <hi>centre</hi> is the <hi>Divell.</hi> Which may be restrained by a more easie or moderate glosse to such wanton and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Revels,</hi> as have anciently beene used in the Celebration of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane feasts by Pagans, and are to this day by Pagan-christians; who, to gaine applause from the Spectator, care not what shamelesse parts they play in the presence of their Maker. But what are these worth, being compared with these inward Ornaments or beauties of your <hi>mind</hi>; which onely distinguish you from other creatures, and make you soveraignesses over the rest of Gods creatures? You have that within you, which will best <hi>accomplish</hi> you. Let not that bee corrupted, by which your

Hold it no such necessary point of <hi>Complement,</hi> to shew a kind of majesty in a <hi>Dance</hi>; and to preferre it before the <hi>Complement</hi> of a Religious taske. Those sensuall <hi>Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans,</hi> who are so delighted in songs, pipes, and earthly melody, shall in hell rore terribly and howle miserably; crying, as it is in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips; <hi>Woe,</hi>

Woe unto you my <hi>hands,</hi> why have you deprived mee by your sinfull touch, and sensuall embrace, of the Crowne of glory? by your meanes am I brought to hell fire, where I shall bee tormented eternally. Woe unto thee, thou cursed <hi>tongue,</hi> what mischiefe hast thou brought upon mee, by uttering words so scurrilous and filthy, and singing uncivill songs so frequently?

Woe unto thee my <hi>heart,</hi> what hast thou put upon mee, who by thy lustfull thoughts and unlawfull joyes, hast deprived me of eternall joyes? The third <hi>Woe,</hi> that shee shall cry out, is this, saying: Woe unto the <hi>bitternesse</hi> of my <hi>torments,</hi> for they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse: woe unto the <hi>multitude</hi> of them, for they are numberlesse: woe unto the <hi>eternity</hi> of them, for they are endlesse. Would our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Curtezans, who sport it in their beds of Ivory, surfeit it in their delicacy, wanton it in the bosome of security, and dedicate their whole time to sensuality, reflect upon such a soveraigne salve or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall balme as this; they would draw backe their <hi>feet</hi> from the wayes of wantonnesse, and exercise them wholly in the paths of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.

What a circular gesture wee shall observe some use in their pace, as if they were troubled with the <hi>vertigo</hi>!

Thus doe our <hi>Wantons</hi> (as if they had transparent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) display their folly, and subject themselves to the censure of levity. This cannot <hi>Decency</hi> endure. When shee sees <hi>Women,</hi> whose <hi>modesty</hi> should bee the Ornament of their <hi>beauty,</hi> demeane themselves more like <hi>Actors</hi> than civill Professants, shee compassionately suffers with them, and with choyce precepts of morall instruction (wherein shee hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shewne her selfe a singular proficient) shee labours to reclaime them: With amorous, but vertuous Rhetoricke, shee wooes them, hoping by that meanes to winne them. Shee bids them looke backe to preceding times, yea those, on which that glorious light which shines in those Christian dayes, never reflected; and there they shall finde <hi>Women</hi> highly censured, for that their outward carriage onely made them suspected. A vaile covered their <hi>face,</hi> modesty measured out their <hi>pace</hi>; their <hi>Spectators</hi> were as so many <hi>Censors</hi>: Circumspect therefore were they of their carriage, lest they should become a scandall or blemish to their sexe. Their repaire to their Temples was <hi>decent,</hi> without any loose or light gesture; Entring their Temples, constant and setled was their behaviour. Quicke was their <hi>pace</hi> in dispatch of houshold affaires; but slow in their Epicureall visits or sensuall gossipings. They had not the art of imitating such huffing &amp; mounting <hi>gates,</hi> as our light-spirited Dames now use. They were not as then learn'd to <hi>pace</hi>: so far estrang'd were they from the very least conceit of vanity in this kinde. How much more should these purer times, where verity is taught and embraced, vanity so much tax'd and reproved, affect that most, which adornes and beautifies most? Is it not palpable folly, to walke so hautily in these streets of our captivity? Eye your <hi>feet,</hi> those <hi>bases</hi> of frailty, how they, who so proudly strut on earth, are but earth, and approach daily nearer their earth. The <hi>Swan,</hi> when she prides her selfe in her <hi>whitenesse,</hi> reflects on her <hi>blacke feet,</hi> which brings downe her plumes, and allayes her selfe-conceit with more humblenesse. What anticke Pageants shall wee behold in this survey of Earth? With what <hi>Apish</hi> gestures they walke, which taxeth them of lightnesse? How like <hi>Colosso's</hi> others walke, which discovers their haughtinesse? How <hi>punctually</hi> these, as if they were Puppets drawn by an enforced motion? How <hi>phantastically</hi> those, as if their walke were a theatrall action? These unstaid <hi>dimensions</hi> argue unsetled <hi>dispositions.</hi> All is not well with them. For if one of the <hi>Spartan Ephori</hi> was to lose his place, because hee observ'd no <hi>Decency</hi> in his <hi>pace,</hi> how may wee bee opinion'd of such <hi>Women,</hi> whose <hi>yeeres</hi> exact of them stayednesse, whose places reteine in them more peculiar reverence, and whose <hi>descents</hi> injoyne them to a state-reservance; when they, to gaine observance, admit of any <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>undecent</hi> posture? Deserve these appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vement?

they cannot walke <hi>honestly.</hi> Those who value reputation, will not bee seene there; for <hi>Honour</hi> is too deare a purchase to bee set at sale. Such as frequent these places, have exposed themselves to shame; and made an irrevocable Contract with sinne. They make choyce of the Twy-light, lest their paths should be discovered; and shrowd their distained actions with the sable Curtaine of night, lest they should bee displayed.

Live devoutly, walke demurely, professe constantly; that devotion may instruct you, your wayes direct you, your profession con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you to your heavenly Countrey. It is a probable argument, that such an one hates her Countrey, where onely shee is to become Citizen, who thinkes it to bee well with her here, where shee is a Pilgrim.

                  <p>I know well, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> that your resort to places of eminent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, cannot but minister to you variety of Objects. Yea, even where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but chaste thoughts, staid lookes, and zealous desires should har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are now and then loose thoughts, light lookes, and licentious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires in especiall honour.

Now to preserve purity of heart, you must observe a vigilant discipline over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sense. Where, if the <hi>eye,</hi> which is the light of the body, bee not well disposed, the rest of the senses cannot choose but bee much darkned. Wee say, that the want of one peculiar sense supplies that defect with an higher degree of perfection in the rest. Sure I am, there is no one sense that more distempers the harmony of the mind, nor prospect of the Soule, then this <hi>window</hi> of the body. It opens ever to the <hi>Raven,</hi> but seldome to the <hi>Dove.</hi> Raving affections it easily conveyes to the heart; but Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like innocence it rarely reteines in the brest. As it is a member of the flesh, so becomes it a servant of the flesh; apprehending with greedinesse, whatsoever may minister fuell to carnall concupiscence. This you shall easily correct, by fixing her on that pure and absolute <hi>object,</hi> for which shee was made.

Otherwise, howsoever wee <hi>speake</hi> much, wee <hi>discourse</hi> little. That sage Stagyrian debating of the convenience and propriety of discourse before <hi>Alexander,</hi> maintained, that none were to bee admitted to <hi>speake</hi> (by way of positive direction) but either those that mannaged his wars, or his Philosophers which governed his house. This Opinion tasted of too much strictnesse (will our <hi>women</hi> say) who assume to themselves a priviledge in arguments of discourse, be the argument never so course whereon they treat. Truth is, their tongues are held their defensive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but in no particular detract they more from their honour, then by giving too free scopeto that glibbery member. For to such as professe their ability at this weapon, may that saying of <hi>Pandolphus</hi> bee properly applied: <hi>They speake much ill, but they speake little well; they speake much, but doe little.</hi> Againe, <hi>They doe little well, but they doe much ill; they say well, but doe ill.</hi> They promise much, but doe little. What restraint is required in respect of the tongue, may appeare by that ivory guard or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison with which it is impaled. See, how it is double warded, that it may with more reservancy and better security be restrained! To give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the tongue to utter what it list, is the argument of an indiscreet person. In much <hi>Speech</hi> there can never want sinne, it either leaves some tincture of vaine-glory, which discovers the proud heart, from whence it proceeded; or some taste of scurrility, which displayes the wanton heart, from whence it streamed; or some violent and dispassionate heat, which proclaimes a rancorous heart, from whence it issued. Whereas, a well-disposed mind will not speake before it conceive; nor deliver ought by way of expression, till it be prepared by a well-seasoned deliberation. That Philosophers speech deserves retention; who seeing a silent guest at a publike feast, used these words: <hi>If thou beest wise, thou art a foole; if a foole, thou art wise in holding thy peace.</hi> For as propriety of speech ministers no lesse delight then profit to the Hearer: so it argues discretion in the Speaker, begetting him such attention, as not one syllable fals from him, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits not retention. In your dialect then, you are not to <hi>hide</hi> your <hi>talent,</hi> if it probably appeare that you may improve any one by it. Wherein let me advise you never to tye your selves so strictly to elegancie or ornament, as by the outward trimming to forget the benefit of speech, and so fall into expressions impertinent. This were to preferre the <hi>rinde</hi> before the <hi>pith:</hi> and to ingage <hi>Sense</hi> to a profuse <hi>Speech.</hi> As discourse usually edifying confers a benefit to the Hearer; so discourses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Volubility of tongue in these, argues either rudenesse of breeding, or boldnesse of expression.

To discourse of State-matters, will not become your auditory: nor to dispute of high points of Divinity, will it sort well with <hi>women</hi> of your quality. These <hi>Shee-Clarkes</hi> many times broach strange opinions; which, as they understand them not themselves, so they labour to intangle others of equall understanding to themselves. That Divine sentence, being made an individuate consort to their memory, would reclaime them from this errour, and free them from this opinionate censure: <hi>God forbid, that wee should not be readier to learne then to teach. Women,</hi> as they are to be no <hi>Speakers</hi> in the Church, so neither are they to be disputers of controversies of the Church. Holy <hi>Bernard</hi> pleasantly glanced at these, when on a time entring a Church, wherein the image of our Lady was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, hee was saluted by the Image in this manner, <hi>Good morrow</hi> Bernard; which device having quickly discovered, perceiving some person to bee purposely inclosed in it, hee forthwith replyed: <hi>Your Ladiship hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got your selfe; Women should be no Speakers in the Church.</hi> In one word, as modesty gives the best grace to your behaviour, so moderation of <hi>Speech</hi> to your discourse.

The <hi>Habit</hi> of the mind is discerned by the state or posture of the body; the condition or quality of the body by the <hi>Habit,</hi> which either addes or detracts from her beauty.

It skils not much, for the quality of your <hi>habits,</hi> whether they be silken or wollen, so they bee civill and not wanton. For albeit, some have affirmed that all <hi>gorgeous attire</hi> is the <hi>attire</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> the quality of the <hi>person</hi> may seeme to extenuate the quality of that sinne.

Right worthy was hee to conquer another, who could with such temper subdue himselfe: such good successe hath ever attended on these <hi>Morall vertues,</hi>

The other <hi>Heroe</hi> was rightly <hi>AVGVSTVS</hi> both in name and nature; and wheresoe're, you looke, a victorious <hi>CAESAR. Cleopatra</hi> kneeled at his feet, laid baits for his eyes; but in vaine; her beauties were beneath that Princes chastity.</p>
                  <p>Absolute Commanders were these Heroicke Princes of their affections, yet a farre more singular argument of his composed disposition, and of Morall, if not Divine Mortification, shewed that young man <hi>SPV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIMIA</hi> in <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> whose beauty did so incomparably become him, as it occasioned many women to lust after him: which this noble youth no sooner perceived, then hee purposely wounded his face, that by the scarre hee sustained, his beauty might become more ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished, and consequently all occasion of lusting after it, clearely removed. This might bee instanced in one of your owne Sexe; a religious votaresse, whose chaste bosome was a sacred Recluse dedicated to goodnesse: and who upon the encounter of a lascivious Lover, returned this answer:
<q>Sir, I honour you so much, as I have chosen rather to suffer, then by my tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beauty to make you a Prisoner: Wherewith discovering her face, in complexion much altered, by some impostured colours, which shee had caused to bee laid upon it: hee vowed to relinquish his suit, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that shee had poysoned her face, to waine him from his impure affection. This hee had no sooner said, then shee ranne to a Spring neere adjoyning to wash it off: See, said shee, I am the same I was; but you are much better: for now you are brought to see your errour, in being so much taken with a skin-deepe beauty, which onely consists in dye and colour.</q>

                  <p>Now (<hi>Gentlewomen</hi>) if you make <hi>Estimation</hi> your <hi>highest prize</hi>; if you preferre honour before pleasure, or what else is deare or tender; your fame will find wings to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:45431:172"/>
the misery of it; whereas, a chaste mind hath ever had something to succour and support it. Thus you see what this <hi>inward beauty</hi> is, which if you enjoy, you sit farre above the reach of Calumny; age cannot taint it, nor youth tempt it. It is the <hi>Estimation</hi> within you, that so confines you, as you hate that place which gives opportunity, that person which makes importunity his agent to lay siege to your Chastity.</p>
                  <p>Now wee are to descend to the second branch, wherein we are to shew you how this <hi>Estimation,</hi> which is your <hi>highest prize,</hi> may be discerned to bee <hi>reall</hi>; which is not gathered by the first appearance, but a serious and constant triall.</p>
                  <p>IN <hi>Philosophy,</hi> a man begins with experience, and then with beleefe; but in <hi>Divinity,</hi> wee must first beginne in faith, and then proceed to knowledge. True it is, that the Sunne, Moone, and Starres become subject to vanity; yet charity bids mee beleeve, that there are many beauteous and resplendent Stars in this our Firmament, many fresh fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Roses in this our <hi>inclosed Garden</hi> of <hi>Albion,</hi> who have preserved their beauty without touch, their honour without taint. Where, if vanity did touch them, yet did it not so seize on them, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure or transforme them. You (<hi>noble Gentlewomen</hi>) are those <hi>Stars,</hi> whose glory can never bee eclipsed, so long as your <hi>Estimation</hi> lives unstained; you are those <hi>fragrant Roses,</hi> whose beauty cannot be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so long as your stalke of honour growes untouched. Now, to the end that your lustre many not bee like to that of the <hi>Gloworme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How <hi>Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may be discerned to be <hi>reall.</hi>
                     </note> nor <hi>rotten wood,</hi> which is meerely <hi>imaginary,</hi> compared with that is <hi>reall</hi>; you are not to make faire and glorious pretences, purposely to gull the world, and cast a mist before the eyes of bleered judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You may find maskes to shroud your face; but no shroud to enskreane you from the eye of Heaven. No, you are to be <hi>really,</hi> what you appeare <hi>outwardly.</hi> These that walke in the Clouds, though they deceive others much, yet they deceive themselves most. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve then this rule of direction; it will accomplish you more then any outward ornament that Art can bestow on you; <hi>Bee indeed what you desire to bee thought.</hi> Are you Virgins? dedicate those inward Temples of yours to chastity; abstaine from all corrupt society; inure your hands to workes of piety, your tongues to words of modesty. Let not a straid looke taxe you of lightnesse, nor a desire of gadding impeach you of wantonnesse. The way to winne an husband is not to wooe him, but to bee woo'd by him. Let him come to you, not you to him. Proferred ware is not worth the buying. Your states are too pure, to bee set at sale; too happy, to bee weary of them. So long as you live as you are, so your minds bee pure, you cannot possibly bee poore. You have that within you, will enrich you, so you conforme your minds to your meanes. In the discourse of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and true estimate of them, none was ever held more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then that which is found in chaste youth. You are Conquerours in that, wherein the greatest Conquerours have fail'd. Your chaste paths are not trac'd with wandring desires; your private Chambers arras'd with amorous passions; you spinne not out the tedious night in <hi>Ah mee's.</hi>

Others you may command; by none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Others will vow their service unto you; while you are from all servitude freed. Live then worthy the freedome of so noble a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for your Virgin state wants nothing that may enlarge her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Againe, are you Wives? you have attained an <hi>honourable state</hi>; and by it made partakers of that individuate union, where one soule ruleth two hearts, and one heart dwelleth in two bodies. You cannot suffer in that, wherein you have not one share. Griefe by your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort</hi> is allayed; joy by partaking with him is augmented. You have now taken upon you to become <hi>Secretaries</hi> to others as well as your selves; but being one and the same with your selves, doe not betray their trust, to whose trust you have recommended your selves. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine now (to recall to memory an ancient Custome) that you have broken the axletree of your Coach at your doore; you must bee no more straglers. These walking Burses and moveable Exchanges, sort not with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of your Condition. You must now intend the growth and proficience of those <hi>Olive branches</hi> about your table. Like a curious and continuate builder, you must ever addresse your selves to one worke or other. From their infancy to their youth. from their youth to their maturer growth. For the first, I know well that distich to bee most true:
<q>

                  </p>
                  <p>But farre was it from those ancient heroicke Ladies, to thinke this to bee either a disgrace to their place, or a blemish to their beauty. Their names are by aged Annals memorized, and shall by these of ours bee revived. Such were <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the mother of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and <hi>Vetruria</hi> of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>; who became examples of goodnesse and chastity; Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their children which they had brought up from their own brests, with the milke of morality.</p>
                  <p>The like did <hi>Portia</hi> the wife of <hi>Brutus; Cleobula</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> one of the seven Sages of <hi>Greece; Sulpitia</hi> the wife of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus,</hi> who not onely instructed her children which shee had tenderly nursed, with excellent precepts while shee lived, but left sundry memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable instructions, as <hi>Legacies</hi> or <hi>Mothers blessings</hi> to them, when shee dyed. <hi>Hortensia,</hi> the excellent daughter of a most eloquent Orator, deserved no lesse fame, for her motherly care in nursing and breeding, her ability in copious and serious discoursing, her gravity in composing and digesting such golden sentences, as shee afterwards recommended to the perusall of her surviving Children. <hi>Edesia</hi> borne at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> farre excelled others in profundity of learning, and piety of living; shee was admired by such as lived in her time: performing the office of a Nurse in her childrens infancy, of a Guardian in their minority, of a Sage Counsellour in their maturity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paulina</hi> the wife of <hi>Seneca,</hi> as shee was excellently seasoned with the precepts of her husband, so shee surceas'd not from commending them to the practice of those children shee had by her husband. Whence it was, that <hi>Seneca</hi> bemoaned the ignorance of his mother, for that shee
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:45431:173"/>
had not so exactly observed the precepts of his Father: by reflecting upon his <hi>Paulina,</hi> who was so serious an observer and improver of the Directions of her husband. What shall I speak of <hi>Theano,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Metapontus? Phemone,</hi> who was first that ever composed heroicke verse? <hi>Corinnathia,</hi> who exceeded the Poet <hi>Pindarus</hi> in her curious and artfull measures; and contending flue severall times with him for the Garland? <hi>Argentaria Pollia,</hi> the wife of <hi>Lucan</hi>; whom shee is reported to have assisted in those his high and heroicke composures? <hi>Zenobia</hi> the Queene of <hi>Palmira,</hi> who learned both the Greeke and Latine tongue, and compiled an Excellent History; approving her selfe no lesse a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant wife to her husband, then a nursing Mother to her children? <hi>Theodosia</hi> the yonger daughter of the vertuous and victorious <hi>Theodosius</hi>; no lesse renowned for her learning and other exquisite endowments of minde, than by being inaugurated with an imperiall title, to which shee was afterwards advanced. The Centons of <hi>Homer</hi> shee composed, and into one volume reduced, which to her surviving glory were after pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. <hi>Diodorus Logicus</hi> his five daughters, all which excelled in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and chastity, and left memorials of their motherly care to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
                  <p>These were tender Nurses, carefull Mothers, reverend Matrons. Or to give them that title which antiquity hath bestowed on them; they were in so darke and cloudy a time, patternes of piety, presidents of purity, champions of chastity, mirrours of modesty, jewels of integrity: Women (to use <hi>Plutarchs</hi> words) so devoted to contemplating, as they conceived no delight in dancing; yet could not contemplation estrange them from performing such proper offices as did concerne them. They knew what it was to obey; that it was not fit for an <hi>inferiour member</hi> to command the <hi>head,</hi> nor for them to soveraignize over their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. What had sometimes beene taught them by their Mothers, they now carefully recommend to the serious review of their Daughters:

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus learned they the duty of a wife, before they aspired to that title: conforme your selves to their examples: the cloud which kept them from a full view of their condition, is in respect of you, dispersed; your eyes are cleared, not with any Pagan errour filmed. Bee then in this your Christian conjugall Pilgrimage so conformed, that as with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of dayes, so with approvement of deserts you may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                  <p>Againe, are you widowes? you deserve much <hi>honour,</hi> if you bee so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> This name both from the Greeke and Latine hath received one consonant Etymology; <hi>deprived</hi> or <hi>destitute.</hi> Great difference then is there betwixt those widowes who live alone, and retire themselves from publike concourse, and those which frequent the company of men. For a widow to love society, albeit her intentions relish nothing but sobriety, gives speedy wings to spreading infamy. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> writing to <hi>Eustachia,</hi> gives her this counsell;
<q>If thou shalt finde any question in Scripture, harder then thou canst well resolved; demand satisfaction
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:45431:173"/>
from such an one, who is of a most approved life, ripe age; that by the integrity of his person, thou maist bee secured from the least asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for in popular concourse and Court-resorts there is no place for widowes: for in such meetings shee exposeth her honour to danger, which above all others shee ought incomparably to tender.</q>
Yea, but, will you object, admit our inheritance, family, fortunes, and all lye a bleeding, may wee not make recourse to publike Courts, for redresse of our publike wrongs? What of all this? Doe not complaine that you are desolate or alone. Modesty affecteth silence and secrecy; a chaste woman solitarinesse and privacy. If you have businesse with the Iudge of any Court, and you much feare the power of your adversary, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all your care to this end, that your faith may bee grounded in those promises of Christ:
<q>Your Lord maketh intercession for you, rendring right judgement to the Orphane, and righteousnesse unto the widow.</q>
Besides, ye have <hi>Courts</hi> for righting <hi>Widows</hi> and redressing <hi>Orphans;</hi> where those very <hi>Impreze's</hi> wrought in their <hi>Cushions,</hi> cannot chuse but be like so many representative Hieroglyphicks or usefull Memorialls of <hi>Iustice,</hi> to render to your just complaints and injurious pressures conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient solace.</p>
                  <p>This inestimable inheritance of Chastity is incomparably more to bee esteemed, and with greater care preserved by <hi>Widowes</hi> then <hi>Wives:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, by these neither to bee neglected, but highly valued. Out of that ancient experience which time hath taught them, their owne observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inform'd them, and the reverence of their condition put upon them; they are to instruct others in the practice of piety; reclaime others from the pathes of folly, and with a vertuous convoy guide them to glory. It would lesse become them to tricke and trimme themselves gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or gorgeously, then young girles, whose beauty and outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament is the hope and anchor-hold of their preferment: for by these doe they their husbands seeke, and hope in time to get what they seeke. Whereas, it were much more commendable for widowes neither to seeke them, nor, being offred, to accept them: lest enforced by necessity, or wonne by importunacy, or giving way to their frailty, they make exchange of their happy estate for a continuate scene of misery. A widow ought to pray fervently, to exercise workes of devotion frequently, that the benefit of her prayer may redound to her effectually and fruitfully; and not returne backe from the throne of God drily or emptily. For I would (according to <hi>Menanders</hi> opinion) have a widow not onely to demeane her selfe chastely and honestly, but likewise to give exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of her blamelesse life to such as heare her instructions attentively. For she ought to be as a Glasse to young Maids, wherein they may discerne their crimes.</p>
                  <p>Now I hold her a chaste Widow, who though shee have opportunity to doe it, and bee suited by importunity unto it, yet will not suffer her brest to harbour an unchaste thought, or consent unto it. In that Countrey where I was borne (saith <hi>Lud. Vives</hi>) wee usually terme such widowes the greatest associates and assistants of vices, whose too much delicacy in bringing up their children, makes them oft-times depraved, and to all inordinate liberty addicted. Wherefore, I approve well of their course, who recommend the care of their children to some discreet and well-disposed person. For such is the too tender affection of mothers
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:45431:174"/>
towards their children, and so much are they blinded with the love of them, as they thinke they treat them too roughly, albeit they embrace them never so tenderly.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writing unto <hi>Salvina,</hi> saith; The chastity of a woman is fraile and fading, like a flower quickly perishing and vading, with the least gust or blast of adverse Fortune failing, if not falling: especially, where her age is apt for vice, and the authority of her husband wants to afford her advice; from whose assistance, her honour derives her best succour and supportance. Who, if shee have a great family, many things are required of her, and to bee found in her, to minister supply to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of time, and use of affaires, wherein shee stands interessed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite therefore it were, that shee made choyce of some one discreetly ripe both in yeares and inward gifts, by whose honest integrity her family might bee better mannaged, with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence attended, and to the woman lesse occasion of disgrace ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                  <p>For I have knowne very many women, who, albeit they spent their dayes continually within their owne doores, yet have fallen into reproach, either by some persons observing them, or of their owne fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies disposed by them; for suffering their servants goe abroad too neatly, arguing thereby a neglect of their family: so as the handmaids pride brought her Mistresse into suspition of contemning her honour. Which proceeded, as may bee probably gathered, from the subtilty of some quick Conceipts, imagining that the Maids knowledge of her Mistresse light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (to purchase her secrecie and connivence) advanc'd her to such neatnesse.</p>
                  <p>Sure it is, that an honest woman, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e fame is her highest prize, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing else, desires nothing else, than to satisfie her husbands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, though dead: honouring him with a due Commemoration and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his vertues: for the lives of those that dye, consist in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of those that live. So did <hi>Anthonia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Marc. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie,</hi> and wife to <hi>Drusus</hi>: leading all the remainder of her life with her stepmother, and reteining alwayes the remembrance of her dead husband. The like did <hi>Livia,</hi> who left both her house and land, that shee might dwell under one roofe with <hi>Noemia</hi>: fearing, perhaps, lest the Maids of her family growing too lasciviously wanton and inordinate, might by their lightnesse prejudice her honour, which shee incomparably valued above any treasure.</p>
                  <p>See you not here by our discourse (<hi>Gentlewomen</hi>) what excellent Lights darted out from those darke times! <hi>Estimation</hi> was their best por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nothing of equall prize unto it choycest Vertues were their. Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they preserv'd with such constancy, as feare of death could not deprive them of them, though after death they had scarce the least glimpse of immortality.</p>
                  <p>Thus have wee traced over these three Conditions, which wee have stored with precepts, strengthened with examples, sweetned with choycest sentences; that this <hi>reall Estimation,</hi> whereof wee treat, might bee discerned; and that <hi>Superficiall Esteeme,</hi> whereon wee are now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, discovered.</p>

                     </note> what they are least in <hi>heart.</hi> They have learned artfully to gull the world with apparances; and deceive the time, wherein they are Maskers, with vizards and sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances. These can enforce a smile, to perswade you of their affability; counterfeit a blush, to paint out their modesty; walke alone, to expresse their love to privacy; keepe their houses, to publish them provident pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors for their family; receive strangers, to demonstrate their love to hospitality. Their speech is minced, their pace measured, their whole posture so cunningly composed, as one would imagine them terrestriall Saints at least, whereas they are nothing lesse than what they most appeare. Some you shall observe so demure, as in their Salutes they forbeare to expresse that freedome of Curtsie, which civill custome exacts of them. Those true <hi>Trojan</hi> Dames, to pacifie their incensed husbands, could finde a lippe to procure them love, and supple their contracted looke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, these civilized Dames, either out of a reservancy of state, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee observ'd, scorne to bee so familiarly demeaned; as if they renounced antiquity, and sought by all meanes, that such Customes as plead prescription, might bee reversed. Their <hi>Lippe</hi> must bee their <hi>Cheeke</hi>; which as it reteines a better tincture, so many times a sweeter savour.</p>
                  <p>At these, the Poet no lesse pleasingly than deservedly glanced in this Sonnet:

                  <p>All which hee elegantly clozeth in opposition to himselfe, with these continuate Stanza's:
<q>
                        <l>Cheeke shall I checke, because I may not taste it?</l>
                        <l>No; Nature rather; who to th' eye so plac'd it,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>To puchase improvement of esteeme by these meanes, were to swim against the streame. Discretion cannot approve of that for good, which selfe opinion or singularity onely makes good. These are but <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:45431:175"/>
showes, which procure more contempt than repute, more derision than ground of esteeme. It is not a civill habit, a demure looke, a staid gate that deserves this report, unlesse all these bee seconded with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved soule, and a religious heart. Those who dedicate themselves to the service of vertue, preferre the pith before the rinde, substance before appearance. What can bee safe, will these say with <hi>Lucretius,</hi> to any woman, if shee prostitute her honour, or make it common? Good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as they labour to avoyd all occasion of scandall, so much more any act that may give breath to scandall. Civill they are in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>habit</hi>; Constant in the profession of vertue.</p>
                  <p>For others, they imitate the <hi>Whoorish Woman,</hi> who wipes her mouth, and saith, <hi>Who seeth mee</hi>? So they carry themselves <hi>charily,</hi> they care not how little <hi>chastely.</hi> There is none lookes through the Chinke to see them, none in presence to heare them; freely therefore may they commit, what shall afterwards shame them. Let mee then direct my Speech to these <hi>whited walls,</hi> who make pretences their best attendants, immaske their Impudence with the Vayle of darkenesse.</p>
                  <p>Tell mee, yee deluded daughters, is there any darkenesse so thicke and palpable, that the piercing eye of heaven cannot spye you thorow it? O, if yee hope by sinning secretly to sinne securely, you shall bee forced to say unto your God, as <hi>Ahab</hi> saith unto <hi>Elijah: Hast hou found mee, O mine Enemy?</hi> Nay, O God terrible and dreadfull, thou hast found mee. And then let mee aske you in the same termes that the young Gallant in <hi>Erasmus</hi> asked his wanton Mistresse: <hi>Are you not ashamed to do that in the sight of God and before his holy Angels, which you are ashamed to doe in the sight of men?</hi> Sinnes may bee without danger for a time, but never without feare. Stand then as in the presence of God: redeeme the time you have lost; love that which you have hitherto loath'd; loath that which you have hitherto lov'd. Know that these <hi>Superficiall</hi> Complementors, are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Courtiers; these formall <hi>Damazens,</hi> profest Curtezans. You must not hold <hi>Religion</hi> to bee meere <hi>Complement.</hi> I will not say, but the bleered eye of humane reason may bee taken with these; and conceive them <hi>reall,</hi> which are onely <hi>Superficiall:</hi> But the <hi>All-seeing eye</hi> cannot bee deceived; hee sees not as man seeth. Neither distance of place, nor resemblance of that Object, whereon his eye is fixt, can cause him to mistake. The <hi>bowells</hi> of the Earth are unto him as the <hi>Surface;</hi> bee it your resolve to compose your selves, ever as in his <hi>presence:</hi> considering, how in chastising you hee does but justice, and in sparing you hee shews his patience.</p>
                  <p>Would you then bee Courtiers, grac'd in the highest Court? Throw away whatsoever is <hi>Superficiall</hi>; and entertaine what will make you Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely <hi>reall.</hi> It is not <hi>seeming goodnesse</hi> that will bring you to the <hi>fountaine of all goodnesse.</hi> The <hi>Figge-tree</hi> brought forth leaves, yet because it yeelded no fruit, it was cursed.

<q>Your highest taske should bee how to promote Gods honour, and to esteeme all things else a slavish and servile labour.</q>
Thus by seeming what you are, and <hi>really</hi> expressing what you seeme, you shall purchase that <hi>esteeme</hi> with God
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45431:175"/>
and good men, which is <hi>reall,</hi> by shunning ostentation, which would set such a vading glosse on all your actions, as they will seeme meerely <hi>Superficiall.</hi>

It is a constant maxime; There is no lesse difficulty in keeping than getting. Some are more able to get a victory, than skilfull to use it; Others have more art to use it, than courage to atchieve it; few or none so accomplish'd, as propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to winne it, and prudently to weare it.</p>
                  <p>Wee are now to suppose, that you (vertuous Ladies) to whom wee addresse this <hi>Labour,</hi> are victoriously seated in the Fort of honour, where beauty cannot bee planted, but it must bee attempted. But so constantly gracious are your resolves, that though it bee assaulted, it can never bee soiled; attempted but never attainted. This you desire, and to this you hope to aspire. In the Port or entrance of every Castle, City, or Cittadell, there useth some <hi>Percullas</hi> to bee in readinesse, to frustrate the Enemies assault, and keepe him from entry. The like must you prepare, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to have your honour secured, your daring enemie repelled, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conquest purchased. And what must this Spirituall Engine bee, but a <hi>religious Constancy,</hi> to resist temptation; and all the better to subdue it, to shunne the occasion? I doe not admit of any Parlies over your wals; they give new breath to the beleaguer, and oft-times makes a prey of the beleagured. If the assault bee hot, devotion best fortifies the hold. One Christian aspiration breathes comfort to the besieged, and promiseth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe when shee is most straightned. Of all arrowes these which are darted by the spirit of zeale, wound the enemy most, and procure the Archer best rest. And that in all assaults whatsoever, plotted or practised by so malicious a Tempter.</p>

One of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s enemies reproaching him with a stinking breath; went home and questioned his wife, why shee told him not thereof: who answered, <hi>Shee thought all men had the same savour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without question, there is nothing that addes more true glory to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or better <hi>preserves</hi> her <hi>esteeme,</hi> then to reteine a constancy in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or disposition of her estate. Bee shee young or old, let her fame live ever fresh; and like greene <hi>Bayes,</hi> most flourishing, when the winter of adversity is most nipping. Vertue cannot exercise her owne strength, nor expresse her owne worth without an Opposite. Spices send forth the sweetest smell, when they are most bruised; and Palmes spread the broadest, when they are soarest pressed. Resolution without an assailant, would, in time, become effeminate. Yet, I must tell you, it is dangerous
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:45431:176"/>
to tempt either youth or age with motives of fancy, or to give least way to a promising opportunity. You shall find secret assacinates enough to undermine you, you need little to become your owne betrayers.</p>
                  <p>I have heard of a noble Lady in my time, whose descent and desert equally proclaime her worth, so tender of the esteeme of her honour, as shee held it scarce safe to receive any Letter from a great Personage, whose reputation was touched by rumour. This was the way to preserve her honour <hi>impregnably,</hi> and to reare it above the reach of Calumny. Neither are you to bee cantelous onely of your <hi>Estimation</hi> in subjects of love and affection: but even in your domesticke affaires, which trench upon your providence or expence. Your discretions in these are brought to the Stage. Let not profusenesse draw you to spend, where honest providence bids you spare; nor niggardlinesse cause you to spare, where reputation bids you spend. Shee deserves not to bee governesse of an house, who wants discretion to moderate her expence. Let her reflect upon her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, intend her charge, and provide for her family. A <hi>good wife</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>wise Merchant,</hi> who brings his trafficke from a farre. Now, a wise Merchant will not have his Oare in every mans Boate, but will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously addresse his care to his owne. Busie women would make ill <hi>Snayles,</hi> and worse house-wives; straglers will never become good house-keepers.</p>
                  <p>To cloze this <hi>branch:</hi> so compose your affections at home and abroad, as providence may expresse you care and charge in the one; a grave and reserved reverence preserve your <hi>esteeme</hi> in the other. As your lives are lines of direction to your selves, so should they bee arguments of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto others. Bee you planted in what state soever, let your <hi>good report</hi> be your <hi>greatest stake</hi> for ever: so may you reape what your vertues have deserved, and keepe your <hi>Estimation impregnably preserved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOne can preserve what hee loves,<note place="margin">How <hi>Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may be irreparably lost.</note> by mixing it with the society of that hee loathes. The Ivye while it winds and wreathes it selfe about the Plant, with an envious consumption decayes the sap. If you be companions to <hi>Ostridges,</hi> you shall favour of the wildernesse. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> called Envie an impostume of the soule: so may every corrupt affection bee properly termed. Vices love neighbourhood, which, like infectious maladies, doe ever most hurt, when they draw nearest the heart.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing <hi>(Gentlewomen)</hi> that brings your Honour to a more desperate hazard, then giving reines to your owne desires. These must you subdue to the soveraignty of reason, if you expect rest in your inward mansion. What better fruits then ignominy may carnall liberty produce? When you make the Theatre your chiefest place of repose; phantasticke gallants, who never yet converst with vertue, your choisest consorts; delicious viands, servants to your liquorish appetites; what conclusion may wee expect from such dangerous premisses? When modesty puts off her vaile, and vanity begins to ruffle it in sinne; when chaste desires are chased out a breath, and lightnesse pleads prescription; when vermillion has laid so deepe a colour on an impudent skinne, as it cannot blush with sense of her owne shame; when <hi>Estimation</hi> becomes a word of <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or carelesly worne like some over-cast raiment, valued as painted

Pageants doe guilded Puppets, onely for shew? What prodigy fuller of wonder, then to see a woman thus transform'd from nature? Her <hi>face</hi> is not her owne, note her <hi>complexion</hi>; her <hi>eye</hi> is not her own, note her <hi>straid motion</hi>; her <hi>habit</hi> is not her owne, eye her <hi>strange fashion.</hi> Whilest <hi>loose weares</hi> imply <hi>light workes</hi>; and thin cobweb covers promise free admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all sensuall lovers. Yea, which is more, shee holds it no shame to glory in sinne, nor to court vice in her owne livery; all which she main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to be complements of gentility. Thus vice is ever in fashion, and keepes her gradation till shee aspire to the height of her building.

                  <p>One of this ranke have I oft-times observed tracing the streets of this flourishing City; who, as one weary of her sexe, forbore not to unwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her selfe, by assuming not onely a <hi>virile</hi> habit, but a <hi>virago's</hi> heart. Quarrels shee would not sticke to bind upon any fresh-water Souldier, whose late induction to the siege of Gallants, had not sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him in that posture. Nothing desir'd shee more then to give affronts in publike places, which shee did with that contempt, as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace shee aspers'd on others, was her sole content. Places of frequent were her Rendevou; where her imperious tongue run descant on every subject ministred; her selfe she usually ingaged for a <hi>Second,</hi> upon least occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Now could these courses any way choose but cause that to be <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably lost,</hi> which by any modest woman should be incomparably lov'd? Tell mee, were not his spirit armour of proofe, who durst encounter with so couragious an <hi>Amazon?</hi> or enter nuptiall lists with such a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine <hi>Myrmidon?</hi> Surely, these, as they labour to purchase them opinion of <hi>esteeme,</hi> by their unwomanly expressions of valour, so they eclypse their owne fame, and by these irregular affronts, detract highly from their essentialst honour. Such may gaine them <hi>observance,</hi> but never <hi>esteeme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take heed then, lest publike rumour brand you. Scandall is more apt to disperse what is ill; then Opinion is to reteine what is good. When the world is once possest of your shame; many deserving actions of piety can hardly wipe off that staine. <hi>Esaus</hi> birth-right was temporall, yet once lost, many teares could not regaine it; your soules honour is a birth-right spirituall, which once lost, many tedious taskes shall not redeeme it. Let your <hi>estimation</hi> bee by you so tenderly lov'd, as you will rather choose to loath life, then <hi>irreparably</hi> lose that, which is the sweetest Consort of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life.</p>

                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">An English Amazon.</note> to draw neerer home, and instance this Maiden-constancy in one of our owne;
<q>I have heard of a notable spirited Girle, within the wals of this City; who, albeit shee frequented places of publike Concourse boldly, discoursed freely, expressed her selfe in all assayes forwardly; yet so tender was shee of preserving her honour, that being on a time suited by a young Cavaliero, who was so taken with the height of her spirit, wherewith shee was endowed, as hee preferred it before the beauty of an amorous face, wherewith shee was but meanely enriched. Shee presently apprehending the loosenesse of his desires, seemingly condescended: so shee might be furnished and appointed, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines with that secrecy carried, as no occasion of suspition might bee probably grounded. This answer-cheer'd our young Gallant; winged with hope to enjoy, what his wild desires did so much affect. A Coach is provided; all things prepared; the very place appointed where they shall meet, to hasten their light journey: which, for more privacy, must bee the Countrey. Time and place they observ'd; but before shee would mount her Coach, calling him aside, shee tels him, how she had vow'd never to consent to any man in that kind, till shee had first tri'd his metall in the field. Draw hee must, or shee will disgrace him; in which combat, instead of a more amorous Conflict, she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd him, and with a kicke, wisht him ever after to be more wary how hee attempted a Maidens honour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>second,</hi> excellent was the answer of those <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> wives; who, being immodestly suited, made this reply:
<q>Surely, wee should give way to your request, but this you sue for is not in our power to grant: for when wee were maids, wee were to bee disposed of by our parents; and now being wives, by our husbands.</q>
At such time as the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> came to <hi>Lacedemon</hi>; suspecting them to bee Spies, they threw them into prison; whose wives, having got leave to visit and comfort them in their captivity, changed garments with them, and according to their Countries guise, vailed their faces, by which meanes the men escaped, leaving their wives restrained:<note place="margin">

                  <p>These were good wives, which <hi>Zenophon</hi> cals the highest grounds of humane felicity. Nothing being more amiable then an honest woman, saith <hi>Theognis</hi>; nothing conferring more joy to man, saith sententious <hi>Xistus.</hi>

                  <p>Now, what may you suppose did those Pagan Ladies hold to be the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute end,</hi> whereto this tender care of their <hi>Estimation</hi> chiefly <hi>aspired,</hi> and wherein it cheerfully <hi>rested?</hi> It was not riches, nor any such temporall respect: for these they contemned, so their honour might be preserved.

                  <p>Your ambition <hi>(Ladies)</hi> must mount higher, because your Conversation is heavenlier.

                  <p>There is no time that exacts more modesty of any woman, than in her time of sniting; a shamefast red then best commends her, and the movingst Orator that speakes for her. Like <hi>Venus</hi> silver Dove, shee is ever brouzing on the <hi>palme</hi> of <hi>peace</hi>; while her <hi>cheeke</hi> betrayes her love, more then her <hi>tongue.</hi> So as <hi>Virgil,</hi> the very Prince of our Latine Poets, when hee should bring in King <hi>Latinus</hi> privately conferring with his wife <hi>Amata,</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> to whom in nuptiall bands hee was to espouse his daughter: hee brings in the young maid weeping, blushing, and silent. Whence is implyed, that it becomes not a Maid to speake of marriage in her parents presence, for that were small argument of modesty or shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse. There is a pretty pleasing kinde of wooing, drawne from a conceived but concealed <hi>Fancy</hi>; which, in my opinion, suits well with these amorous younglins: they could wish with all their hearts to bee ever in the presence of those they love, so they might not bee seene by those they love. Might they chuse, they would converse with them freely, consort with them friendly, and impart their truest thoughts fully; yet would they not have their bashfull loves finde discovery. They would bee seene, yet seeme obscured; love, but not, disclose it; see whom they love, but not bee eyed. This the Poet in the person of a Shepherdesse neatly displayeth:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Phillis</hi> to willowes, like a cunning flyer,</l>
                        <l>Flyes, yet she feares her Shepheard should not spy her.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in this Subject of <hi>Fancy,</hi> as there is nothing more dangerous than entertaining it without due and deliberate advice: so there is nothing growes more generally fatall to the indiscreet Lover than by groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding affection on outward respects, without relation to that <hi>inward faire,</hi> which onely makes the Object of <hi>Fancy</hi> full of beauty, and presents every day as a Marriage-day to the party: by performing the office of a princely combiner of <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>majesty</hi> together. Neither affluence of estate, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of friends, nor highnesse of descent can attemper the griefe of a loathed bed. These may play upon the <hi>Fantasy,</hi> but never give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the <hi>Fancy.</hi> Wherefore <hi>(Gentlewomen)</hi> to the end you may shew your selves discreetest in that, which requires your discretion most, discusse with your selves the purity of love, the quality of your lover; ever reflecting on those best deserving endowments of his, which either make him worthy or unworthy your love. Affection, though it enter in by the narrow cranny of the <hi>Eye,</hi> it shoots at the <hi>heart</hi>; which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it bee seasoned by judgement, it can not deserve so faire a title. A discreet <hi>eye</hi> will not bee taken with a smooth skinne; it is not the <hi>rinde</hi> but the <hi>minde</hi> that is her <hi>Adamant.</hi>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:45431:179"/>
being married to one more rich than wise, exclaimed against her fate, that folly should hale her to so loathed a bed. And good reason had shee to repine, when his groundlesse jealousie made her a tragick spectacle of misery before her time. For seeing her white necke, that object begot in him presently an argument of suspect, which hee seconded with revenge, to vent the fury of his nature, and publish to the world the weakness of his temper. Let <hi>deliberation</hi> then bee the Scale, wherein you may weigh Love in an equall poize. There bee many high and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Circumstances, which a discreet woman will not onely discourse but discusse, before shee entertain so mysterious and honorable estate. Disparity in descent, fortunes, friends, with other like respects, many times beget distraction of mindes. Whence it was, that <hi>Pittacus</hi> of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> being intreated by a young man, to afford him his best advice, in the Choyce of two wives tendred him, whether hee should marry; the one whereof was equall to himselfe both in birth and wealth; the other surpassing him in both; Wish'd him to goe along the streets of the City, where children use to play, and there observe what they did advise him. Truth is, inequality in these, procures distaste; but where there is a difference in the seazure of disposure of the heart, (which should bee the firmest and strongest Cement to unite affection) there ariseth the greatest hazard. Thence is it, Suspition workes upon every light and frivolous subject; while the other party hunts after opportunity, to surfet on forbidden fruit, and give her suspitious Mate just ground of jealousie. Feed hee may his indigested humour in a jealous pasture, and vow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge when hee shall finde an apt subject, meane time hee becomes invisibly gull'd, while hee deludes himselfe with painted sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</p>

                     </note> are the effects of love, as are the dispositions of those that love. <hi>Livia</hi> made quicke dispatch of her husband, because shee lov'd him too little: <hi>Lucilia</hi> of hers, because shee loved him too much. <hi>Phoedra</hi> fancied <hi>Theseus</hi> lesse than shee should, but young <hi>Hippolytus</hi> more than hee would. Which effects are usually produced, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disparity of yeares breed dislike; or obscurity of descent begets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; or inequality of fortunes, discontent. Deliberate then before you marry, and thus expostulate with your selves touching his Condition, whom you are to marry "Is he young? I will beare with his youth, till better experience bring him to the knowledge of man. My usage shall bee more easie, than to weane him from what hee affects, by extremity. Youth will have his swinge; his owne discretion will bring him home; at least, time will reclaime him; hee shall not finde mee put on a cloudy brow, or entertaine his freer course with a scowle.

as so many friendly admonitions to reclaime mee; his bed I will honour, no unchaste thought shall defile it; his Counsell I will keepe, no forraine brest shall partake it.

Much good may it doe him; this shall not make me proud; my desire shall bee, hee may imploy it for his best advantage; I will move him to communicate unto the needy, that his riches may make him truly happy. It is a miserable state that starves the owner. I will perswade him to enjoy his owne, and so avoyd basenesse; to reserve a provident care for his owne, and shunne profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>"Againe, Is hee poore? His poverty shall make me rich; there is no want, where there wants no content. This I shall enjoy in him, and with him; which the world could not afford mee, liv'd I without him. It hath beene an old Maxime; that as poverty goes in at one doore, love goes out at the other; and love without harbour, falls into a cold and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish distemper: but this rule shall never direct my thoughts; should po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty enthrall me, it shall never appall me; my affection shall counterpoize all affliction: No adversity can divide mee from him, to whom my vowed faith hath individually ti'd me.

Those two Motto's I would have you incessantly to remember; for the useful application of them may highly conduce to your honour. The one is that of <hi>Caia Tranquilla,</hi> which shee ever used to her royall Spouse <hi>Caius Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Priscus; Where thou art Caius, I am Caia.</hi> The other, that of <hi>Ruth</hi> unto <hi>Naomi; Whither thou goest, I will goe: and where thou dwellest, I will dwell.</hi>

                  <p>There is no greater argument of lightnesse, then to affect the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of strangers, and to entertaine variety of Suites. These, as they distract the <hi>eye,</hi> so they infect the <hi>heart.</hi> Constant you cannot bee where you professe, so long as you affect change. Vowes deliberately advised, and religiously grounded, are not to be dispenc'd with. But say, you never
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:45431:180"/>
vowed: have you made outward professions of love, and entertained a good opinion of that object in your heart? Againe, are you resolved, that his affection is reall towards you? That his protests, though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by his mouth, are engraven in his heart? Let not so much good love bee lost; insult not over him whom unfained affection hath vow'd your servant:
<q>
                        <l>Let Wolves and Beasts bee cruell in their kindes,</l>
                        <l>But Women meeke, and have relenting mindes.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were to much incredulity in you to distrust, where you never found just cause of distaste. Yea, but you will againe object; Wee are already by your owne <hi>Observations</hi> sufficiently instructed, that <hi>Fancy is to bee with deliberation grounded,</hi> that love lightly laid on, lasts not long. Should wee then affect before we finde ground of respect? Should wee entertaine a Rhetoricall Lover, whose protests are formall Complements, and whose promises are gilded pills, which cover much bitternesse? No, I would not have you so credulous, lest your Nuptiall day become ominous. Make true triall and experiment of his Constancy, who tenders his service to you. Sift him, if you can finde any branne in him. Taske him, before you take him. Yet let these be sweetly tempred with lenity; Let them not bee Taskes of insuperable difficulty. This were tyrannize, where you should love. This was <hi>Omphales</hi> fault to make her faithfull servant, a servile slave. Alas! shall hee fare the worse because hee loves you? This would induce others, who take notice of your cruelty, to loath you. And make your discarded Lover, surprized with an amorous distemper, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as <hi>Absalom</hi> to <hi>

                        </gap>hy friend</hi>? My counsell is, that, as it will bee usefull for you to <hi>deliberate,</hi> before you take so much as the least Notions of an affectionate Servant; yea, and to second that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation</hi> with some probable proofe or triall, that hee is truly constant: so it will bee a gratefull office in you, to reteine him in your favour with a gracious respect; to countenance the improvement of his constancy with a cheerefull and amiable aspect: to banish all clouds of seeming dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and to give him some modest expressions of the increase of your good Conceit towards him. Let this bee done, till <hi>Hymen</hi> make you individually one Then, and never till then, may Love enjoy her full freedome. Shee stands priviledg'd by a sacred rite to taste that fruit, which before was forbidden. Mutuall respects, like so many diametrall lines, pointing all to one Centre, are then directed to one exquisite object, the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>love</hi>; which produceth this admirable effect: it makes one soule rule two hearts, and one heart dwell in two bodies. Now, I would have you, when your desires are drawne to this period, to become so taken with the love of your choyce, as to interpret whatsoever hee shall doe, ever to the best sense. It were little enough that you reteined a good opinion of him, who stands in so many severall ingagements ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged for you. Should your riot bring him into debt, his restraint must make you free. <hi>Durance</hi> must bee his suit, while better stuffe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes you a Coate. Hee must content himselfe with restraint, to give you content: let nothing discontent you more then to entertaine him with contempt. Yea, what Conscience is there in it, but hee should receive and affable and amiable respect from you;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45431:181"/>
seeing, if your <hi>Conscience</hi> be no <hi>Conformalist,</hi> hee must pay for you?</p>
                  <p>These respects should perpetually tye you, to honour him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes so <hi>legally</hi> ty'd for you. Requite these then with constancy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine this ensuing Example ever in your memory. <hi>Theogena,</hi> wife to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles,</hi> shew'd admirable constancy in her husbands greatest misery, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her selfe most his owne, when hee was relinquisht and forsaken of his owne; clozing her resolution with this noble Conclusion:
<q>She had not onely betaken her selfe to bee his Companion in prosperity, but in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that should befall him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conforme your selves to this <hi>Mirror,</hi> and it will reforme in you many a dangerous errour. Thus if you live, thus if you love; honour cannot chuse but accompany you living, much comfort attend you loving, and a vertuous memory embalme you dying.</p>

Many like Creatures there bee of a malignant nature, but none comparable to a distempered Lover.</p>
                  <p>Now, that wee may use the method of Art; to cure the <hi>effect,</hi> is to take away the <hi>cause:</hi> my purpose shall be first to discover those incendiaries of foments of this inordinate passion, or intoxicating poyson; secondly, the effects arising from them; lastly, the cure or remedy of them.</p>
                  <p>For the first, wee may very properly reduce the prime grounds of this <hi>wanton fancy,</hi> or <hi>wandring phrenzie</hi> to a Catalogue included in these two verses:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>1</hi> Sloth, <hi>2</hi> Words, <hi>3</hi> Bookes, <hi>4</hi> Eyes, <hi>5</hi> Consorts, and <hi>6</hi> luscious fare,</l>
                        <l>The lures of lust, and staines of honour are.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One every of which particulars to insist, would enlarge this <hi>branch</hi> too much; wee will onely poynt at them and so leave them. For the first, sententious <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, hee had rather endure the utmost of fortunes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, then subject himselfe to <hi>Sloth</hi> or <hi>Sensuality.</hi> For it is this onely which maketh of men, women; of women, beasts; of beasts, monsters. This then is to be shunned, if the reward of vertue be to bee shared. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Words</hi> corrupt the disposition; they set an edge or glosse on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Liberty: making that member offend most, when it should beee
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:45431:181"/>
imployed in profiting most. The tongue is more effectuall then any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; let it be then so employed, as it may improve the hearer. Thirdly, <hi>Bookes</hi> treating of light subjects, are Nurseries of wantonnesse: they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the loose Reader to become naught; whereas before, touching naughtinesse hee knew nought. A story of the rape of <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> or of light <hi>Lais</hi> in <hi>Eurypides,</hi> are their daily Lectures. <hi>Plato</hi>'s Divine Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or <hi>Dicearchus</hi> pious Precepts of Morality, must vaile to <hi>Alcaeus,</hi> or <hi>Anacrons</hi> wanton Poesie. <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis</hi> are unfitting Consorts for a Ladies bosome. Remove them timely from you, if they ever had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment by you, lest, like the <hi>Snake</hi> in the fable, they annoy you. Fourthly, <hi>Eyes</hi> are those <hi>Windowes</hi> by which death enters; your inward house cannot shine, unlesse these bee shut; Objects they have of more beauty to take them, then these sights of vanity, which miserably taint them. <hi>Eve</hi> looked on the fruit before shee coveted, coveting she tasted, tasting shee perished. Thus aspiring to the knowledge of good and evill, became to her and her posterity evill. The <hi>Eye</hi> is a <hi>Living glasse,</hi> but if wee make it a <hi>false glasse,</hi> it will neither represent us truly, nor discover our blemishes freely; but make that seeme faire which is odious and ugly. By this meanes, may good objects become <hi>Eye-sores</hi> unto us, which, if clearely viewed, would like a soveraigne <hi>Eye-bright,</hi> restore sight unto us. Fifthly, <hi>Consorts</hi> are theeves of time, they will rob you of opportunity, the best treasure time can afford you, if you suffer them to incroach on you and abuse you. Chuse such then for your <hi>Consorts,</hi> of whom you may have assured hope, that they will either better you, or bee bettered by you. Chuse such, whom you may admire both when you see them and heare them: when you see their living Doctrine, and hear their wholesome instruction. Lastly, <hi>Luscious fare</hi> is the fuell of every inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate concupiscence. Nothing so much feeds it, nor insensates the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by delighting in it. By restraint of this, you shall learne to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate your desires. Whence you may rejoyce, yet in him, who is your joy, if you can live sparingly, and embrace the meanes that may chastise in you all sensuality: for by your spare life is lust extinguished, vertue nourished, the mind strengthned, the understanding to heavenly things raysed. Yea, abstinence availeth much for preserving health of body and length of life.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now to descend to the second <hi>branch</hi> of our division in this <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; wee might here enumerate those many odious and inhumane effects, which have and doe daily arise from the violence of this <hi>Wanton fancy</hi> or <hi>Wandring phrenzy</hi>; and what tragicke events it hath in all times produc'd: but they would seeme relations too full of horror to your modest and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Natures. Onely let mee tell you, if you desire to be satisfied in subjects of that kind, our <hi>Italian</hi> Stories will afford you variety: Where indiscreet Love clozeth her dolefull Scene with so miserable an <hi>Exit,</hi> as no Pencill can expresse any picture to more life, then an historicall line hath drawne out the web of their miseries.

needlesse, being free from all such violent distempers;) the best and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign'st receit is to fortifie the weaknesse of your sexe with strength of resolution; that, with incessant devotion. Bee not too liberall in the bestowing of your favours; nor too familiar in publike converse. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not too much on the strength of a weake Fort. Make a Contract with your eyes not to wander abroad, lest they be catch'd in comming home.

                  <p>Fly to an higher Sphere: you are yet untouch'd; this <hi>wandring phrenzy</hi> hath never yet surpriz'd you; prevent the meanes, and it shall never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade you. Be not such foes to your selves, as to purchase your owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. Examples you have of all sorts, both to allure and deterre you. Pure love admits no staine. Such a <hi>fancy</hi> is never incident to a <hi>phrenzy.</hi> If ever then you entertaine any Love, let it be such as brings with it a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous solace; for all others, howsoever they may seeme to promise some perfunctory delight, they ever cast up their last account with repentance.</p>

Expostulate with <hi>Fancy,</hi> thus you may, safely and freely:
<q>How is it with me? Me thinkes, it fares other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then it hath done formerly. A strange distemper I find in my mind; and it might seeme to resemble Love, if I knew the nature of it. Love! Can virgin-modesty returne that <hi>accent,</hi> and not blush? Yes; why not? If the Object I affect be worthy loving. And if not, what then? Is not the Lover ever blinded with affection towards his beloved? He, who may seeme a <hi>Thersites</hi> to another, may be a <hi>Paris</hi> in mine eye. Were hee poore as <hi>Irus, Fancy</hi> makes him dearer to mee, then the wealth of <hi>Croesus.</hi> Yea, but a little advice would doe well. Art thou perswaded that this <hi>Non-parallell,</hi> thou thus affectest, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his service onely to thee? Yes; his protests have confirm'd him mine. Besides, his continuall presence seconds what hee protests: That houre is tedious, wherein hee sees me not; those pleasures odious, which my presence accompanies not. His eye is ever fixed on me; his sole discourse is to me. What I affect he embraceth with delight: what I dis-relish, hee entertaines with distaste.</q>

Or like that namelesse Lover, who solliciting a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans affection with abundance of amorous Rhetoricke, concluded with this Emphaticall protest; <hi>that shee was the onely Mistresse of his thoughts:</hi> which conclusion being over-heard by one to whom not long before upon like protests hee had ingag'd his faith; shee replied, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Trialls in affaires of this nature have ever a truer touch than protests. It is easie for beauty to extort a vow, or a temporary protest; which many times is as soone forgot as made. Let not these then worke on your Credulity.</p>
                  <p>There bee, I know (and so all bee that are truly <hi>generous</hi>) who rather than they would infringe their faith, would ingage their life. But all are not of that noble temper. Others there bee, who can tip their glozing tongues with Rhetoricall protests, purposely to gull a credulous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the purchase of an unlawfull pleasure; which obtain'd, they leave them to bemoane their lost honour. With more safety therefore may you suspect, than too rashly affect. It will not bee amisse for you to <hi>reade</hi> him, before you <hi>chuse</hi> him. As thus;
<q>Hath his faire carriage got him estimation where hee lives? Hath hee never inur'd his tongue to play Hypocrite with his heart; nor made Ceremoniall protests to purchase a light Mistresse? Hath hee kept a faire quarter, and beene ever tender of his untainted honour? Hath hee never boasted of young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans favours, nor runne descant on their kindnesse? Hath hee kept himselfe on even boord with all the world, and preserv'd his patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from ingagement? Hath hee ever since hee vow'd himselfe your servant, solely devoted himselfe yours, and not immix'd his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with forraine beauties?

                  <p>It is not so hard to give comfortable counsell to the sorrowfull, as to finde a fit season when to give it. I would have you, whose more noble parts promise much comfort to your families, give such attention to seasonable counsell, as you may prevent all ensuing occasions of sorrow. It is the condition of an inconsiderate person, who never foresees his fall, to cloze the issue of his misfortunes with this improvident conclusion;

In one word; have you plaid a little too long with the flame? Have you given too free accesse to your desertlesse lover? Have you suffered your heart not onely to thinke of him, but with more intimate respect to harbour him? Lodge him no longer in that roome; it deserves a farre better guest. I will not heare you, if you reply, and say; This is a Taske of impossibility. Continuance of time, with discontinuance of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, will easily effect it. Meane time, fixe your eye upon some more deserving object. Revenge your selfe of that Conceit, that shall a-fresh present him to you. So shall the <hi>wildnesse</hi> of your <hi>Fancy</hi> be <hi>checked</hi>; your halfe-lost liberty regained; and your affection afterwards planted, where it may bee better acquited; there seated, where it may bee more sweetly seasoned.</p>

Their hearts are smeer'd over with <hi>Salamanders oyle,</hi> and wil admit no heat. They may entertaine Suiters, but it is with that coldnesse of affection, as the longer they resort, the lesser is their hope. They may boast more of the multiplicity of their Suitors, than their Suitors can of any probability to bee speeders. As it chanced sometime in a Contest betwixt two Maids, who comparing one with the other their descents, friends, and Suitors:
<q>

These unso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Natures, who many times deferre making their choyce, till age bring them to contempt, and excludes them from all choyce; Or, <hi>Danaë</hi>-like, live immured in their Chamber, till their Fort bee undermined by some <hi>golden</hi>

Pioner; detract much from the relenting disposition of their Sexe. It is their honour to be woo'd and won. To be discreet in their <hi>choyce,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine their <hi>choyce</hi> without <hi>Change.</hi> Of such I speake, who have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated their dayes to Virginity, which is such a Condition, as it aspires to an Angelicall perfection. Good, (saith venerable <hi>Bede</hi>) is conjugall chastity, better is viduall continency, but best is the perfection of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity. Yea, Virginity exceeds the condition of humane nature, being that, by which man resembles an Angelicall Creature. Wee reade likewise, that the <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> when hee can be taken by no force nor subtill Engine, will rest and repose in the Lap of a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>To those onely I direct my discourse, who have a mind to take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the world, and to entertaine their <hi>Lover:</hi> but it is with such coolenesse, as it drives their dispassionate <hi>Sweet-heart</hi> into strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames. And this proceeds commonly from an over-weening Conceit, which these dainty Damsels have of their owne worth: with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension whereof they become so infinitely taken, as they can find none worthy their choyce. Of this disdainefull opinion was the unhappy Gentlewoman, who after many faire fortunes tendred, Suitors of deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quality rejected, made her incestuous brother her licentious Lover.</p>
                  <p>A crime detestable even to Barbarians and bruit beasts. Insomuch as it is reported of the <hi>Cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You, whose discreet affections have cast anchor, by making choyce of some deserving Lover; afflict him not with needlesse delayes; if hee merit your choyce, one day is too long to deferre him; if undeserving, taxe your owne indiscretion so rashly to entertaine him.</p>
                  <p>Is it bashfull modesty that with-holds you? I commend it; it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you. Chastity cannot expresse it selfe in a fairer Character, then in blushing lines of loving shamefastnesse. Is it consent of friends that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines you? I approve that too; These rites are best accomplished, when they are with consent and consort of friends solemnized. But if the ground of your delay trench either upon some future expectance of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortunes; or indifferency of affection in respect of your Choyce: the issue cannot possibly prove well, being built upon such weake grounds. For, to insist cursorily upon either of these two; Shall a deceiving hope of preferment dispossesse him of your heart, whom personall deserts make worthy of your love? Looke to it; Such fortunes cannot purchase you content, which are got with an aged husbands contempt. It shewes a servile nature to cashiere a faithfull Lover, because hee is poorer; and to preferre another lesse desertfull, because hee is richer. This inconstancy cannot succeed well, because the foundation is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ill.</p>
                  <p>Againe, are you indifferent or Luke-warme in affection; in respect of your choyce? for shames sake what doe you make of love? Do you use it like a toy or tyre to put off or on as you like? Must it resemble the fashion? This day in request, and next day out of date? This, indeed, is such a cool &amp; easie-tempered Love, as it will never mad you; yet, trust me, it may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude you. <hi>Fancy</hi> will not so be plaid with. You will object, I imagine, your sto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>macks
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:45431:184"/>
are too queasie to digest Love. Why then did you ever seeme so greedily to feed on that, which your stomacks now cannot well digest? Have you surfeited on the <hi>substance</hi>? Lay that aside for a while, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow your eye on the <hi>Picture.</hi> Such impressions have sharpened the dull affections of many Lovers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> being much in love with <hi>Apelles,</hi> as one highly rapt with the exquisitenesse of his art, proposed him that Mcdell for a taske, which hee, of all others, affected most; commanding him on a time to paint <hi>Campaspe,</hi> a beautifull woman, naked; which <hi>Apelles</hi> having done, such impression wrought the <hi>Picture</hi> in his affection, as <hi>Apelles</hi> fell in love with her; which <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving, gave him her. It is incredible, what rare effects were sometimes drawne from a <hi>Morian-Picture,</hi> being onely hung up in a Ladies Chamber. If such impressive motives of affection draw life from a <hi>Picture,</hi> what may bee conceived by the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? Oris Apollo</hi> writeth that the Egyptians, when they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the Heart, and fit her with a proper Embleme, paint the bird <hi>Ibis</hi>: because they thinke that no Creature, for proportion of the body, hath so great an heart as the <hi>Ibis</hi> hath.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Bird of love</hi> must bee the Embleme of your heart. It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther picture nor posture can content her. Much lesse these <hi>inferiour pictures,</hi> which wee call <hi>moneyes</hi>: which are so farre from satisfying the affection, as they are onely for the Mold or Worldling: whose grosser thoughts never yet aspired to the knowledge of loves definition. As then, the precious stone <hi>Diacletes,</hi> though it have many rare and excellent soveraignties in it, yet it loseth them all, if it bee put in a dead mans mouth: so <hi>Love,</hi> though it bee a subject so pure, as none of a more refined nature; so firme, as none of a more holding temper; so hot, as none of a more lasting fervour: yet becomes her splendour darkened, her vigor weakened, her fervor cooled, when shee is in a cold brest entertained. Resemble, rather, the <hi>Iuniper-tree,</hi> whose coale is the hottest, and whose shadow is the coolest: bee hot in your <hi>affection,</hi> but coole in your <hi>passion.</hi> If you finde any thing which cooleth love in you, remove it; if any thing which urgeth passion, quench it: contrariwise, feed in you loves heat; but represse in you all passionate hate. Take into your more serious thoughts, a view of his deserts whom you affect: increase the conceit of them by supposing more than hee expresseth. The imagination of <hi>Love</hi> is strong, and works admirable effects in a willing subject. Yet in all this, let no one straid thought wrong your Maiden-modesty so much, as to suggest to you a straine of light-nesse. Other Closet-treaties you may entertaine safely and freely, without touch of modesty. As to thinke of the <hi>honour</hi> of that <hi>State,</hi> to which you are approaching; the mutuall Comfort from that mysterious union arising; how griefes will bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered by one anothers suffering; how joyes will bee augmented by one anothers sharing. These thoughts cannot but well become you; nor otherwise chuse than with a pure affection inflame you; nor receive lesse than free acceptance from you.</p>
                  <p>Thus may that Love, which seem'd before to have beene as <hi>chilled,</hi> by these modest motives bee <hi>cheered.</hi> That day no blacke Cloud should by right sit on your faire brow; no cold dampe seaze on your heart.

First, the <hi>wildenesse</hi> of the one; secondly, the <hi>coolenesse</hi> of the other: by seasoning them both with an indifferent <hi>temper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Vine,</hi> wilde and luxurious branches are to bee pruned, that such as are free and kindly may bee better cherished. In the spirituall field of your heart, is never to bee expected any fruitfull increase of vertues, till there be weeded out of it all the thornes of vices. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>wild</hi> Love, is this: the one ever deliberates before it love; the other loves before it deliberate. The first question that shee askes, who <hi>wisely</hi> loves;
<q>Is hee, who is here recommended to my choyce, of good repute?</q>
Is hee rich in the endowments of his minde? Next question shee askes, are of a lower siege:
<q>May his personage give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?</q>
Are his fortunes such, as may not beget in love a contempt? Thus beginnes shee that loves <hi>wisely,</hi> with goods inward, and ends with outward; whereas, shee that loves <hi>wildly,</hi> beginnes with outward, and ends, or else never remembers the inward:
<q>Is hee, you tender to mee, of promising personage? Is hee neat in his cloathes? Complete in his his dresse? Can he Court mee in good words? and perfume them with sweet protests? Can hee usher me gracefully in the street? and in very pace expresse a reserved state?</q>
Next question shee askes, must bee neare the same verge:
<q>Is hee rich in Manors? Hath not fortune made him a younger brother? Can hee, to buy himselfe honour, pawne the Long-acre? May his swelling means furnish me of Coach, Caroach, and daily fit mee for some <hi>Exchange</hi> trifles? I have a moneths mind to see the man!</q>
Hee cannot but deserve my love. Wherein shee sayes well, for in very deed hee could deserve little else. Now as the <hi>former,</hi> seldome bestowes her selfe, but where shee findes content; so the <hi>latter,</hi> seldome or never, but either shee with her Choyce, or her Choyce with her falls into contempt. The reason is, this <hi>wilde</hi> Girle never cares for more than to bee married. If shee may but see that day, it accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth her content: though shee have but one Comicall day all her life. Yea, it is as well as can bee expected from her hands, if shee attaine that <hi>style</hi> without some apparant <hi>soile.</hi> Such as these I could wish, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the worst, they were married betime, lest they marre themselves before time. Albeit, moderate restraint, seasonable advice (presupposing some seeds of grace to worke on) have wrought singular effects in many of these <hi>wilde-ones,</hi> who afterwards became grave and modest Matrons.</p>
                  <p>To you then, <hi>kind-hearts,</hi> am I to recommend some necessary cautions, which carefully observed, may make you wiser than you thought of; and cause you have a tender care of that, which before you had never mind of. Your brests are unlock'd, your tongues unty'd; you cannot love, but you must shew it; nor conceive a kinde thought, but you must tell it. The <hi>Index</hi> of your <hi>hearts</hi> you carry both in your <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>eyes</hi>; for shame, learne <hi>silence</hi> in the one, and <hi>secrecy</hi> in the other. Will you give
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:45431:185"/>
power to an insulting Lover, to triumph over your weakenesse; or, which is worse, to worke on the opportunity of your lightnesse? Doe not; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ramme up those <hi>portells</hi> which betray you to your enemy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his entry by your vigilancy. Keepe home and stray not, lest by gadding abroad, you incurre <hi>Dinahs</hi> fate. You have Consorts of your owne sexe to passe time withall; their society will teach you to forget, what is better forgot than kept. Let not a straid thought betray your innocency. <hi>Checke</hi> your madding <hi>Fancy,</hi> and if it use resistance, curbe it with restraint. It will doe excellently well, if you forbeare to resort to places of publike meeting; till you have drawne up and seal'd a Covenant with your eyes, to see naught that they may not lawfully covet. These, when they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they breed in the heart a dangerous distemper. Lastly, addresse your imployment ever to something that is good; so shall your <hi>fantasie</hi> finde nought to worke upon that is ill. This shall afford you more liberty, than the whole worlds freedome can afford you.</p>
                  <p>Now to you, <hi>Coy ones,</hi> whom either <hi>coldnesse</hi> of nature hath benummed, or <hi>coynesse</hi> hath made subtill to dissemble it. You can looke and like, and turne another way, where you like most. No object of love can take you, till it overtake you. Bee not wise too much. True affection cannot endure such dissimulation. Divide not him, whom you love, into such extremes: you may be modest, and spare a great deale of this <hi>Coynesse</hi>; It is the rule of Charity to doe as you would bee done to. Now, would it content you to bee entertained with disdaine, where your deserts merit acceptance? Rectifie this then in your selves, which you would not have done by another to your selves. It is an ill requitall, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence fancy with contempt, or constant love with disdaine. This were to incurre ingratitude, a vice so odious, as no age could finde ever ought more uncivilly impious. I do not move you to bee too open-hearted; or if so, not too liberally to expresse it: this were no discovery of <hi>fancy,</hi> but <hi>folly.</hi> So conceale and smoothly palliate your love, as your lover may not despaire of all hope to obtaine your love. Indifferent Curtsies you may shew without lightnesse, and receive them too in lieu of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I leave it to your discretion to distinguish times and places; for these may either improve or impaire the opportunity of such like Curtsies.</p>
                  <p>Doe not immure your beauties, as if a jealousie of your owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had necessitated this restraint. There can bee no <hi>Conquest,</hi> where there is no <hi>Contest.</hi> Converse with love; conceit with your selves whom you could like. This your <hi>cooler</hi> temper may admit, and still reteine that liberty which is fit.</p>
                  <p>Falconers use many meanes to make their Hawks sharpe; they begin with short flights, till weathring bring them to endure longer. <hi>Pigmalions</hi> image received not life in all parts at once; first, it took warmth, after that, vitall motion. Is love <hi>coole</hi> in you? let a kindly warmth heat that coldnesse. Is Love <hi>dull</hi> in you? let a lively agility quicken that dulnesse. Is love <hi>coy</hi> in you? let a lovely affability supple that coynesse: So, in short time, you may have a full rellish of loves sweetnesse.</p>
                  <p>Now wee come to the <hi>attemperament</hi> of these; wherein wee are to extract out of grosser metals some pure Oare, which wee must refine, before it can give any true beauty to this specious palace of love. Draw neare then, and attend to what of necessity you must observe; if ever
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:45431:185"/>
you meane to deserve HER love, whom you are in Civility bound to serve.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Sicilia</hi> there is a fountaine called <hi>Fons Solis,</hi>

When the heat of passion is at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I meane his full height, with those to whom faith hath engag'd you, and love, before the hostage of that faith, confirm'd you; then are you to resemble the quality of that fountaine,<note place="margin">An Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Embleme.</note> by flowing with <hi>cold water</hi> of discretion and sweet temper, to allay that heat; lest it weaken those you love, by giving way to passion, which patience cannot chuse but loath. Againe, when heat is farthest off, and providence begins to labour of a lethargy; when servants remit their care, neglect their charge, and the whole family grow out of order, through the coldnesse of a remisse Master; resemble then that fountaine, by flowing with <hi>hot water</hi>; win and weane these whom love and loyalty have made yours, with warme conjugall teares, to compassionate their neglected estate, and by timely prevention to avert the fate of improvident husbands.</p>
                  <p>Or thus,<note place="margin">Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Embleme.</note> if you please, may you make your selves gracious Emblemes of that fountaine: Doth the Sun shine at Mid-day, and in his fullest height on you? Do the beams of prosperity reflect brightly on you? Flow with <hi>cold water</hi>; allay this your heat and height of prosperity, with some cooling thoughts of adversity, lest prosperity make you forget both the Author of it, and in the end how to bestow it. Againe, doth the Sunne shine farthest off you? Doth not one small beameling of prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous successe cheere you? Flow with <hi>hot water</hi>; vanquish adversity with resolution of temper. Desist not from labour, because fortune seconds not your endevour. To conclude, as your <hi>wild fancy</hi> (if you were ever surpriz'd of any) is now rectifi'd; your <hi>coolenesse</hi> heatned; your <hi>coynesse</hi> banished; so conforme your selves to them, whom <hi>one heart</hi> hath made one with you, as no cloud of adversity may looke so blacke, no beame of prosperity shine so cleare, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may not with an equall embrace of both estates, beare your share.</p>

Your more ascending honour requires more than a Common lustre. In places of publike resort you challenge precedency, and it is granted you. Shall the highest place have the least inward grace? No; let not a word fall from you, that may unbeseeme you. Others are silent when you discourse; let it bee worth their attention; lest a presumption of your owne worth draw you into some frivolous excursion. There is not an accent which you utter, a sentence you deliver, any motion in your carriage or gesture, which others eye not, and eying assume not. Your retinue is great; your family gracious; your actions should bee the life of the one, and line of direction to the other. To see a light Lady descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from a noble Family, is a Spectacle of more spreading infamy, than any subject of inferiour quality. I cannot approve of this Apish kinde of formality, which many of our better sort use; it detracts from their <hi>descent,</hi> to make <hi>affectation</hi> their <hi>Tutresse.</hi> They were free-borne; nothing then that is servile can become them. It is nothing to reteine the favour or feature of your <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and to estrange you from that which truly dignifi'd your <hi>Ancestors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vertues have more living colours, and are seconded with more lasting honours than any outward beauties. You deceive your selves, if you thinke that honour received her first life from descent; no, It was <hi>demerit</hi> that made <hi>descent</hi> capable of honour. A Pedigree argues your <hi>Gentility</hi>; but had not some deserving action beene, you had never attained to any noble Pedigree. For <hi>Gentility</hi> is not to bee measured by antiquity of time, but precedency in worth. If brackish or troubled water seldome come from a pure Spring; wilde and unsavory fruit from a good tree; whence is it, that noble Predecessors, whose pure blood was never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with any odious staine, should bring forth such degenerating
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:45431:187"/>
scions? Surely, this generally proceeds from the too much liberty that is granted to our youth; whose inclinations, though otherwise good and equally disposed, are usually by <hi>Custome,</hi> which becomes a <hi>Second na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> miserably depraved. Society they affect, and this infects them; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to publike places they admit, and this corrupts them. Those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent examples which their Noble Progenitors left them, become buried with them. They comply with the time; <hi>Vertue</hi> (they say) can hardly subsist, where <hi>Vice</hi> is in highest request. What though <hi>Plato</hi> advise them to make choyce of the best way of living, which may bee easily effected by assiduate use and daily custome: they have learned to invert his rule, by affecting that custome most, which tends to the practice of vertue least. Besides, there is another reason which may bee probably alleaged, why <hi>generous descents</hi> become so much corrupted; and vertuous Parents by vitious Children so frequently seconded. Our Nobler women, though in other respects truly imitable, and for their vertuous Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation admirable, come short in one peculiar duty, which even Nature exacts of them, and which being duely perfom'd, would doubtlesly, no lesse enable and ennoble them who are descended from them, than any particular, were it never so powerfull, that could informe them. These which are mothers by generation, are seldome their Nursing-mothers by education. No marvell then, if they degenerate, when they partake of the natures of other women. Though their owne mothers blood streame through their veines, a strangers milke must feed them, which makes them participate of their <hi>nature,</hi> as they are fed with their <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> Wheresoever the Nurses milke is received, the Nurses manners are likewise reteined. Whence it was, that <hi>Chrysippus</hi> expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the very best and wisest Nurses should bee made choyce of; that what <hi>good blood</hi> had infused, might not by <hi>ill milke</hi> be infected. It was the joynt advice both of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Phavorine,</hi> that a mother should bee her childrens Nurse: because, commonly, with the milke of the Nurse, they sucke the quality or condition of her life. Yea, according to an ancient Decree, women were bound to nurse their owne children, and not to have any other women (unlesse necessity enforc'd them) to nurse them.</p>
                  <p>Let this then bee rectifi'd; yee, whose Noble descents have made you eminent in the eye of the world, and whom Gods blessing hath made fruitfull Mothers, to bring forth a faire and hopefull increase unto the world; nurse them with your owne milke: this will expresse in you a motherly care to them, and beget in them a greater measure of child-like love to you. Your care, the more it is parentall, will exact of them a love more faithfull and filiall. Nurse them, I say, with the milke of your owne brests to feed them; with the milke of your owne lives to informe them. So shall their actions prove them to bee your Successours; when they shall not onely <hi>derive</hi> their blood from you, but on this Theatre of humane frailty, shall publish themselves to bee true <hi>representers</hi> of you. For in vaine is your blood to them <hi>derived,</hi> if your memory by their vertues be not <hi>revived.</hi> Give them then that which may make them yours. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may bee blamed, but her succeeding memory can never bee blanched. Thus shall you not onely shew your selves worthy of that <hi>house,</hi> from whence you came, but after your period on earth, bee receiv'd into a more glorious house in time to come.</p>

                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:45431:188"/>IT is not the Nobility of <hi>descent,</hi> but of <hi>vertues,</hi> that makes any one a gracefull and acceptable Servitour in the Court of heaven.

Shee confines her desires upon earth within a strait Circumference; a very small portion of that metall will content her. Her desires are onely there seated, where they may bee satisfied. Shee sees none so great in the Court, as may deserve her envy; none so rich in the City, as may beget in her an earthly desire; none so repos'd in the Countrey, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her to change her state. Shee is infinitely happy, in that shee aymes at no other happinesse, than where it is to bee found. Ambition may display her Pie-colour'd flagge; but shee will never get <hi>vertue</hi> to bee her follower: Her desires are pitcht upon a farre more transcendent honour, than these <hi>State-corrivals</hi> on earth can ere afford her; or by their compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition take from her. Pleasure may cast out her Lure, but <hi>vertue</hi> is so high a flyer, as shee scornes to stoupe to ought unworthy of her; it pleaseth her to contemplate that on earth, which shee is to enjoy in heaven. These <hi>feathers</hi> in the <hi>ayre,</hi> are Objects undeserving her care. Profit may seeke to undermine her; but all her policy cannot worke on <hi>vertues</hi> constancy. Content is her Crowne; Contempt of the world, her care; what word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings seeke, shee shuns; whence it is, that her beauty, in the darkest Night of adversity, shines. In a word, shee is an absolute Commandresse of her selfe; and easie is it to have that Command, where no turbulent passions labour to contend.</p>
                  <p>Farre otherwise is it with those, who be they never so <hi>generously</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, popularly graced, nor powerfully guarded, yet being not adorned with this <hi>Crest,</hi> distinguished by this <hi>Coat,</hi> they can neither enjoy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome within, nor safety without.</p>

                     <hi>Lewis,</hi> the eleventh had a conceit, which, no doubt, proceeded from his melancholicke and indisposed humour, that every thing did stinke about him: all the odoriferous perfumes, or fragrant savours they could get, would not ease him, but still hee smelled a silthy stinke. So fares it with them, whose corrupt hearts, like musty vessells, not throughly seasoned with <hi>vertue,</hi> send forth no other smell than what is most distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to a pure and well-disposed minde. Now, there bee many, who make an outward semblance of conscience; and promise to the world apparant arguments of their uprightnesse; whose inward Cells, like corrupt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell-houses, afford nothing but filthinesse. Yea, these, to make the world more confident of their sanctity, will not sticke to condemne themselves, dis-value their owne worth, and rank them amongst the unworthiest that breath on earth. Yet, though they disprayse themselves before others, they cannot endure to bee dispraysed by others. Whereof wee read one excellent example to this purpose: There was a certaine woman, who had taken her selfe to a Cloyster-life, and seemed very devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t; so as shee usually said to her Confessor, who came often unto her, to heare her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and partake of her Devotion:
<q>
                        <hi>Good father, pray unto the Lord
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:45431:188"/>
for mee; for I am a woman so evill, yea, even so utterly naught, as I much feare lest the Lord punish others for my sinnes.</hi> Vpon this, the Priest out of a discreet zeale, desired to try whether there were in her the foundation of true humility or no. Next time therefore, that shee uttered the like words unto him, saying; <hi>That shee was the very worst of all women</hi>; the Priest forwith answered: <hi>I have often times at many bands heard thus much of thee before this.</hi> Whereat shee being presently incensed, replyed: <hi>You lye in your throat: And whosoever hath told you, or reporteth such things of mee, are all lyers.</hi> To attemper which immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate passion, the Priest humbly returned her this answer: <hi>Now I perceive thy pride and hypocrisie; for as much as thou speakest that of thy selfe, which thou disdainest any other should speake of thee. And this is no signe of true humility, but of inward pride and grosse hypocrisy.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>These dissembled, bee they never so assiduate, semblances, are no colours for <hi>Vertues crest,</hi> They must bee dyed in graine, or they will not hold. These, who expresse modesty in their outward carriage, are good examples to those that consort with them; yet if their private Parler bee a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their dishonor, they deface the figure of goodnesse in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Vertue</hi> consists not in seeming but performing, nor piety in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but practising. What is it to bee outwardly retyred from the world, and inwardly affianced to the world? How are those women in <hi>Turkie</hi> affected, that most part of the yeare come not abroad? Those <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Dames, that are mewed up like Hawks, and lockt up by their jealous husbands? This is such an enforced restraint, as it many times begets loose desires in the restrained. It is the prevention of occasion that crownes us. More prayse-worthy were those women of <hi>Sio,</hi> could they confine their actions within the bounds of modesty, than these restrained Libertines. For those Iland Women, as they are the beautifull'st Dames of all the Greekes, so have they more liberty granted by their avaricious husbands, than all the Dames in Greece. For their wives prostitution is their promotion. So as, when they see any stranger or promising factor arrive, they will presently demand if hee would have a Mistris: which, for want of better supply, they mercenarily tender him in the person of their owne wives: so willing are they to weare the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Badge of infamy, for base lucre or commodity.</p>
                  <p>It is not then an enforced moderation of our affections, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the stile of goodnesse. Wee are to enjoy freedome in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and over those a noble Conquest, if wee merit the name of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</hi>

                  <p>Come then, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> you see what <hi>Coat</hi> will honour your <hi>House</hi> most.

But no <hi>Augur, Seer</hi> or <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer</hi> can by any such groundless Divination, detract from the constant beauty or splendor of his <hi>Coat.</hi>

                        <l>And have no <hi>gen'rous vertues,</hi> is a scorne.</l>

                  <p>Let it bee your highest scorne, to stoupe to any base thought. It is not priority nor precedency of place, but propriety and proficiency in grace that makes an honourable Soule. That Cloath is of most worth that weares best; and that fashion of most esteeme that holds longest in request. <hi>Vertue</hi> is right. <hi>Sempiternam</hi> for weare; and of that complete fashion, as with Christian women it growes never out of date. Make choyce of this stuffe then to suite you, of this <hi>Coat</hi> to gentilize you. All others are but conterseits in comparison of her; whose property it is to honour those that serve her; harbour those that flye for refuge to her; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward those who constantly stand in defence of her honour. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can wound you, being thus armed; nothing ill-beseeme you, being thus adorned; nothing disparage you, being thus honoured: Heraldry findes a <hi>Coat</hi> for your house, but <hi>Vertue</hi> findes honour to grace your person. Reteine those divine impressions of goodnesse in you, that may truly ennoble you: display your <hi>gentility</hi> by such a <hi>Coat,</hi> as may best distinguish your family; so shall you live and dye with honour, and survive their fame, whose onely glory it was to enjoy fortunes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>PAinters are curious in the choyce of their colours, lest their Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come blemished through those decayed colours, wherewith their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are pourtrayed.

                     <hi>Protogenes</hi> tables, wherein <hi>Baccbus</hi> was painted, and all his furious <hi>Bacchanals</hi> to life displayed, moved King <hi>Demetrius</hi> to such admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during his siege of the City <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that where hee might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the City with fire, and buried the glory thereof in ashes, would not for the preciousnesse of that table: so as, protracting time by staying to bid them battell, wonne not the City at all. If a livelesse Picture could enforce such affection in a knowing Commander, what effects may wee thinke will a living substance produce? Truth is, there is such sweet and amiable correspondence betwixt <hi>vertuous</hi> beauty, and <hi>shamefaste</hi> modesty, as the one cannot subsist without the others society. Not a light passage can want the attendance of a blush, whilest modesty is in presence. Yea, though shee bee not conscious of any conceit, that might beget in her face a shamefaste blush; out of a modest Compassion shee will not sticke to blush, when shee observes ought in another deserving blame. Her eares glow at any light report; which, lest they should grow too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, shee fortifies with reason, to oppose the too easie entrance of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Shee partakes of no resemblance lesse than that of the <hi>Chamelon,</hi> whose naturall property it is to represent all Colours save white. Shee is a milde and moderate interpreter of others actions; but a serious Censor of her owne. Light discourses, which tend rather to the depraving of the Hearer, than ministring any usefull subject to an attentive Observer, shee excludes; uncivill Complement shee abhorres; what onely is modest shee approves; and seconds her approvement with a gracefull smile. Shee holds an infected minde to bee more dangerous than an infected house: such Company shee shunnes, on whom the rayes of <hi>vertue</hi> seldome or never shine. There is not that Condition, bee it never so meane, which shee cannot with cheerefulnesse entertaine: so as, shee holds out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poverty the best enricher of an inward family. Her desires are so equally poyzed, as shee neither seekes more than shee enjoyes, nor wants freedome to dispose of what shee enjoyes. Honour shee affects, yet with no such eagernesse, as to hazzard the losse of a dearer honour, for so uncertaine a purchase. Friends and favourites shee admits, and with that constancy, as it neither repents her of accepting, nor them of tendring such vertuous fruits of amity.</p>
                  <p>Here you have her, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> who will tell you, and in her selfe exemplifie what shee tells you; that <hi>modesty</hi> is the choycest ornament that can adorne you. Now if you purpose to trace her path, or conforme your selves to her line; you must worke on your affections, to embrace what shee loves, and reject whatsoever shee loathes. Are you conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant at any time with such <hi>protesting servants,</hi> as make deepe Oaths meere Complements; and whose tongues are witty Orators in running descant on a wanton Tale? These are such Consorts as <hi>Modesty</hi> would bee loath to converse with. Shee can never endure any of these discourses without an angry blush. Should you delight in these, you should quickly heare her out of a vertuous passion, cry out with the Poet:
<q>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:45431:190"/>
                        <l>O Age! most of our women know not now,</l>
                        <l>What' tis to blush, till <hi>painting</hi> tell them how.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, should you entertaine in your naked bosomes, what some wantons have too much affected, light amorous Poems; perusing them with no lesse Content, than if they had beene purposely penned to worke on your Conceit; this cannot stand with your <hi>modesty</hi>: These may corrupt you, but never rectifie what is wandring in you. Suffer not a wanton passage to play on your fantasie. Sinne would never enter in upon you, if shee found but a preparation of resistance in you. Tell me, what a sweet grace conferres it on you, to mixe your salutes with modest blushes, and entertaine your Suitors with a shamefaste bashfulnesse! Sure I am, where love is discreetly grounded, this cannot chuse but be an especiall motive to affection. There may bee, I grant, such <hi>wilde lovers,</hi> who preferre the loose love of an inconstant <hi>Phaedra,</hi> before the chaste embraces of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent <hi>Antiope:</hi> but their indiscreet choyce is ever seconded with a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cloze. Those, who esteeme more of a painted cheeke, than a native blush, shall finde all their imaginary happinesse resolved to a painted blisse. It is <hi>Modesty</hi> and not <hi>Beauty</hi> which makes the husband happy. Would you then deserve the title of Chaste Virgins, constant Wives, modest Matrons? While you are ranked amongst the <hi>first,</hi> converse not privately with a wanton thought; send not forth a wandring eye to fetch in a Sweet-heart. Dis-value not your owne worth so much, as to wooe others to become your Suiters: This would bee a meanes rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse love, than increase it; impayre love, than improve it. If you bee worthy winning, you cannot chuse but bee worthy wooing. Meane time, let not a straid looke betray your too forward love; nor a light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit tax you of deserved reproofe. Dye your cheeks with a Rosie blush, when you heare ought that may detract from the <hi>modesty</hi> of your Sexe. Bee as silent as the night; your best Rhetoricke consists in maiden blushes, and bashfull smiles; which will worke more powerfully on a Lovers heart, than a Rhetoricall tongue, bee it never so curiously tipt with Art.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>second</hi> ranke, you know how strict a duty is imposed on you; now are you not to converse with strange love, or suffer any other person have the least share in your affection. To Court love, or use any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, purposely to winne a private favorite, would detract as much from your honour, as for a Souldier to flye from his Captaine, and adhere to a stranger. Hee hath invested you in himselfe, and ingaged himselfe yours by a sacred vow, which death onely may reverse: the dispersed loves which you enterteined before, must now bee reduc'd to one, and that but one, by whose mutuall choyce two are individually made one. A heart divided cannot live; no more can the heat of divided love. You are now so farre from entertaining any stranger; as you have vow'd with your heart, not to enter so much as any treaty with an unjust intruder. It is dangerous to converse with a profest foe, whose drift it is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine you; and such an one is every loose lover, who labours with the licentious art of adulterous Oratory, to deprive you of that inestimable gemme, which of all others, most adornes you.</p>
                  <p>For you that are <hi>Matrons,</hi> ripenesse of yeares hath enjoyned you to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:45431:190"/>
bid a lasting adieu to the vanities of youth. Now are you set as examples of gravity, for others to imitate.</p>
                  <p>It were dotage in you now to begin to love, when your decay in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels you, it is not long you are to live. You have hitherto performed your parts with a <hi>genercus</hi> approvement of your actions, faile not in the conclusion. This small remainder of your declining pilgrimage, should bee wholly dedicated to the practice of goodnesse; that your pious end may second your vertuous beginning. The Sunne shines ever brighter at his setting than rising; so should your life appeare better at your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than entring.</p>
                  <p>It were incomparably beneficiall for you, now in this your <hi>Exit,</hi> to have your affections seated in heaven, before you depart from earth: leaving some memorable examples of your wel-spent life, which may eternize you after this life.</p>
                  <p>This will make your names flourish; and cause others in a vertuous emulation of your actions, to reteine your memory in their lives. To bee briefe, bee you of what Condition soever, either in respect of your age or state; there is nothing can better become you than a modest shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse: which consists either in averting your eare from your owne praise; or with-drawing your presence from dishonest or uncivill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; or rejecting an importunate Suitor, whose too inconsiderate entertainment might question your honour. I have noted in some women a kind of zealous and devout passion, when they chanc'd but to heare any light or wanton communication; they could not hold but reprove them for their impudence, and amidst their reproofe, to adorn the Rosie Circlets of their cheekes with a blushing shamefastnesse. Surely, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a singular <hi>modesty</hi> in them; which I would have you (<hi>Gentlewomen</hi>) in a serious imitation of them, to represent in your selves. It will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, many times, that you cannot chuse but encounter with some front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Buffouns,</hi> petulant <hi>Pasquills,</hi> whose highest straine of obscene wit, is to justifie some fabulous story, or repeat an uncivill Tale; which you are to entertaine with such disgust, as these odious Relaters may gather by your Countenance, how much you distaste such uncivill discourse. For it is a sweet kinde of evincing sinne, to discountenance it with a modest shame.</p>
                  <p>Thus shall you make your very frowne an ingenuous <hi>Index</hi> of your uncorrupt heart: and to adde one line more unto your Honour, display the Character of your guiltlesse shame in a Maiden blush, a Virgin-colour.</p>

This delicate Prince had that learned Sage no sooner found decked and adorned with the choisest Ornaments, and seated on an high Throne, than hee encountred that grave Philosopher with this vaine question: demanding of him, <hi>Whether hee had ever seene a more glorious sight</hi>?

Their inward ornaments are their chiefest care; their renewing and repairing of them, their highest cure. They have found such choice flowers, as they afford more spirituall delight to the soule, than any visible flowers or odours doe to the smell. And what are these, but divine and morall precepts, soveraigne instructions; which have taught them how to contemne earth, conquer death, and aspire unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?

O Eternity, eternity! let this ever empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically sound in your memory; Supply then that in you, which bleered judgements expect without you. You challenge precedency in place, expresse your selves worthy of that place. Vertue will make you farre more honoured, than any garish habit can make you admired.

Now these <hi>Native seeds,</hi> as they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, so are the fruits which come of them, variously disposed. Some have a rellish of true and <hi>generous bounty</hi>; wherein they shew that noble freedome to their owne, in their liberality towards others: as their very actions declare unto the world, their command and soveraignty over the things of this world. Others discover their noble disposition, by their notable <hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi>; These will estrange themselves from no mans misery. If they cannot succour him, they will suffer with him. Their bosomes are ever open with pittifull <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> to receive a distressed one.

Others shew apparant arguments of their singular <hi>moderation</hi>; abstemious are these in their dishes; temperate in their Companies; moderate in their
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:45431:192"/>
desires. These wonder at the rioters of this time; how they consume their daies in sensuality and uncleannesse Their account is farre more straight; their expence more strait; but their liberty of mind of an higher straine. Cloathes they weare, but with that decency, as curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity cannot taxe them; meats they partake, but with that temperance, as delicacy cannot tempt them. Others from their Cradle, become brave sparkes of <hi>valour</hi>; their very Childhood promiseth undoubted tokens of succeeding honour. These cannot endure braves nor affronts. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> resolution hath stampt such deepe impressions in their heroicke mindes, as fame is their ayme; which they hunt after, with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of spirit, as danger can neither amate them, nor difficulty avert them from their resolves. Others are endued with a naturall pregnancy of <hi>wit</hi>; to whom no occasion is sooner offered, than some dainty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression must second it. Others with more solidity of <hi>judgement,</hi> though of lesse present conceit. And these are such, as generally imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in State-affaires; wherein Experience, purchased by an usefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, of time, doth so ripen them, as the Publike State takes notice of them, and recompenceth their care with honours conferred on them.</p>
                  <p>These and many other excellent endowments shall wee observed to bee <hi>lineally</hi> derived from Ancestors to their Successors; which, as they reteine a neare resemblance of their persons, so they represent their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: so powerfull is <hi>nature</hi> in bestowing her distinct Offices on every creature, wherein they generally partake of their <hi>disposition</hi> as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>feature:</hi> whence the Poet;
<q>
                        <l>Stout men and good are sprung from stout and good,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet see the iniquity of time! It fareth oft-times with those who are endowed with these vertues, to bee most traduced, where their more noble and eminent parts are to bee highliest honoured. Which, as it was a maine error in former ages, so descends it to these present times. When <hi>Rome</hi> was in her glory, this eclipsed her light, by detracting from their demerits most, whose free-bred vertues deserved of their Countrey best. Sundry Families shee had, famous for their vertues, which by a depraved and mis-interpreting Censure, became branded with undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved aspersions. If the <hi>Piso's</hi> were frugall, they were held parcimonious; if the <hi>Metelli</hi> devout, they were superstitious; if the <hi>Appii</hi> strict, they were rigorous; if the <hi>Manlii</hi> affable, they were ambitious; the <hi>Laelii,</hi> if wise, they were dangerous; the <hi>Publicolae,</hi> popular, by being courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But with good and well-disposed persons, <hi>vertue</hi> is never out of favour, though it bee never so much impeached by a traducing censure.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have heard, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> what <hi>vertues</hi> have <hi>lineally</hi> and by <hi>blood</hi> descended from Parents to their Children; what especiall inward graces usually attend some especiall families, which no lesse memorize them, than those native honours which are conferred on them. Now, to select such as sort best with your sexe and condition; in my opinion there is none that ennobles you higher, or makes you more gracious in the eye of the beholder than <hi>Modesty,</hi> which was the greatest advancer
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:45431:193"/>
of many <hi>Roman</hi> families. This is that <hi>vertue,</hi> which expresseth you to be women; this is that, which makes you honoured amongst women. Chaines and Carkenets, Iewels and Habiliments may bee valued; but this Ornament is of that high estimate, as it is not to bee prized. Now, there is nothing that will cause this to appeare more pretious unto you, next to the testimony of a good Conscience within you, with an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of promoting his glory who made you, than a reflexion to your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> which bred you; whose honour to preserve, as it is your especiall duty, so no object of profit or pleasure, no attractive Lure of deceiving honour should remove this opinion from you:
<q>To bee high borne and basely minded, is to ingraffe bastard slippes in a noble stocke.</q>
Branches of a crooked and inflexible <hi>quality,</hi> highly degenerate from true <hi>Gentility.</hi> High and heroicke vertues become great houses. For, as they were first made <hi>great</hi> by being <hi>good,</hi> so should they by surceasing from being <hi>good,</hi> lose their title of being <hi>great.</hi> If by abusing the liberty of time, you detract from your Ancestors fame, you lye a blemish on his shrine; which, though it touch not him, yet it taints you who represent him.</p>
                  <p>This, no doubt, was that Noble Lady right mindfull of, when on a time being sollicited by a powerfull Suitor, who wooed her first in person, and after in a wanton Rhetoricall Letter; shee, as one tender of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and perceiving that the scope of his suit tended to her dishonour, answered his fruitlesse sollicitancy in this sort, with great modesty:
<q>Should I condescend to your Suit, I should not only derogate from the honour of my present state, dis-value that which I hold most deare, make my selfe a subject of contempt to every eare, but asperse that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy on my family, which would beare record of my inconstancy. O what would the next age report of me, that I should so farre dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from those that bred me? No; poverty may enter in at my gate, but dishonour shall never lodge in mine heart. Reserve these promises of honour for such, as prize them above their honour: That <hi>generous</hi> blood which distreames through my veines, shall sooner bee dried, than it shall bee for any hope of advancement ingloriously stained.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such singular resolves many of our <hi>Albion</hi> Ladies, questionlesse, even at this day reteine; who, rather than they would incurre the least disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or occasion suspition by their too free entertaine of light Suitors, would confine themselves to their Chambers, and debarre themselves of publike recourse. Seeing then, that there are <hi>native Seeds of goodnesse sowne in generous bloods by lineall succession</hi>; which even in their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy give faire promises of their inward beauty; expresse your selves Daughters worthy such vertuous Mothers. Emulation of goodnesse in great persons is honourable. Their Pictures you hang up, that their memories may live with you. Enjoy their vertues too, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories shall live fresher in you. All memorials, being materials, be they never so durable, are subject to frailty; only these precious monuments of your vertues survive time, and breath eternity. You spring from a noble Seminary; let those <hi>seeds</hi> of <hi>goodnesse</hi> which are sowne in your youth, come to that ripenesse in your age, that as in piety you imitated others, so you may become Presidents unto others; as you were here seasoned with grace, a good report may follow you to your grave.

                  <p>Than S. <hi>Hierom</hi> none more gravely copious, as may appeare by
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:45431:194"/>
those pithy and effectuall Epistles of his, directed to those noble Ladies, <hi>Marcella, Demetria, Laeta, Furia,</hi> &amp;c. wherin he useth singular exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, invincible arguments, perswasive reasons, sweet similitudes, and forcive examples. Modesty is the subject hee commends unto them; decency in apparell hee approves in them; to a moderate restraint of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty hee enjoynes them; to an exemplary holinesse hee exhorts them; and with sweet and comfortable promises of an incorruptible reward he leaves them.</p>
                  <p>Than S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> none more devoutly serverous; in his reproofes hee shewes mildnesse; in his treaties a passionate sweetnesse; hee winnes the sinner by inducing reasons; hee strengthens the soule mightily against temptations; hee proposeth an excellent way of moderating the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; hee applyes soveraigne receits to soveraignizing passions: and concludes with that sober and discreet temper, as with a Divine insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee wooes, winnes, and weanes the sinner, and in a spirituall tye unites him to his Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>Than S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> none more profoundly judicious, more judiciously zealous; pithy are his directions, powerfull his instructions: in his <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> hee is moving; in his <hi>Soliloquies</hi> inwardly piercing; in his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall</hi> comfortably clozing. Amongst all those Conflicts in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian warfare, hee holds none sharper than our Combat with Chastity. Hee applies meanes how wee may resist, resisting vanquish; and by our Christian victory, receive Crownes of eternall glory. That Conquest, hee holds, deserves small honour, which is atchiev'd without Encounter. In a Divine rapsodie drawne, as it were, from himselfe, hee shewes what should bee done by us. Earth is no object fit to entertaine our eye; nor her deluding melody our eare: Hee exhorts us therefore to leave Earth now while wee live, that leaving Earth for altogether, wee may enjoy our <hi>best Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Than S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> none more Divinely plenteous; sweetly serious are his instructions; enforcing are his reasons: hee speakes home to the sinner; whom hee no sooner findes wounded for sinne, than hee applies a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall salve to cure his sinne. Many grave sentences are in his <hi>Offices</hi> methodically couched; singular directions to guide every Christian in his Spirituall Path-way, are there delivered. Like an expert Physician, hee first gathers the nature or quality of your distemper, and then mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters soule-salving receipts to restore you to your right temper. Hee shewes you how in your very motion, gesture, and pace you are to observe modesty: concluding that nothing can afford true comfort to a sojourning soule, but practise of piety.</p>
                  <p>Than S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> none more fully sententious; hee discovers the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our corruption familiarly; adviseth us with many passionate and teare-swolne lines to provide for our inward family; hee proposeth us a reward, if wee contemne Earth; he threatens us with the Law, if wee contemne life. Sundry moving and effectuall Lessons hee recommends to the perusall of women of all rankes, ages, and conditions. Tenderly hee compassionates the case of a sinner; passionately treats hee of those torments which shall last for ever: with prayers and teares hee sollicits them that have gone astray, to returne; those that are already return'd, to goe no more astray. Hee concludes with an usefull Exhortation to sorrow for sinne, promising them, forth of that Store-house of Comforts,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:45431:194"/>
contained in the Gospell, for this their momentaine sorrow, an incessant joy in <hi>Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Than S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> none more highly mysterious, nor contemplatively glorious; Divinely morall are his <hi>Morals</hi>; full of heavenly comforts are his instructions; hee walkes in an higher way than others trace, yet with that humility, as there is not a cloze from him, but it discloseth in him a love of meekenesse, lowlinesse, and piety. With proper and elegant si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes are his works adorned; with choice sentences, as with so many select flowers, neatly garnished; in a word, hee is sweetly substantiall, and substantially sweet. Hee reprehends the times gravely; commends the practice of vertue gracefully. With an holy zeale hee reproves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misnesse of the Ministry. Directions hee gives unto women, to have an especiall care of modesty: concluding, that the love of this life should not so possesse us, as to deprive us of that inheritance which might eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally blesse us. In good mindes hee holds poverty the portresse of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: accounting those Evils or Adversities, which doe here presse us, to bee the Cords which draw us unto God who made us.</p>
                  <p>Touching those three Philosophers, this is my conceit of them; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in none can otherwise chuse than concurre with me, that shall seriously read, and sincerely scanne them: Than <hi>Plato,</hi> none more divinely Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall; Than <hi>Cicero,</hi> more philosophically Rhetoricall; Than <hi>Seneca,</hi> more sagely Morall.</p>
                  <p>But for as much as it is not given to most of you to bee Linguists, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many of their workes bee translated in your mother tongue, you may converse with sundry English Authors, whose excellent instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will sufficiently store you in all points; and, if usefully applied, conferre no small benefit to your understanding. I shall not need particularly to name them to you, because I doubt not, but you have made choice of such faithfull Reteiners and vertuous Bosome-friends, constantly to accompany you. Neither, indeed, are <hi>bookes</hi> onely necessary; conference will singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly improve your knowledge; but that is not altogether so convenient nor decent for your sexe in publike places. So as, I much condemne their opinion, who hold no meanes so fitting to bring their daughters to audacity, as a frequent consort with Company. This, in time, begets in them rather <hi>impudence</hi> than <hi>boldnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was held a touch to a Maid to bee seene talking with any one in a publike place. But in private Nurseries, which may bee properly termed your <hi>houshold Academies,</hi> it will suit well with your honours to treat and enter into <hi>Conference</hi> one with another; or in such places, where your owne sexe is onely conversant. For such indiscreet Mothers, who usually trim and deck their daughters, to send them forth to Showes, Meetings, or Enterludes, they annoint havin with oyle, that it may burne the better. But much more blame-worthy bee those, who take them along to Tavernes and gossippings; which Education a little time will bring into custome, and make modesty a stranger to her selfe. For above all things (saith the Philosopher) ought young Girles to bee kept from Ebriety:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t. Pol.</hi> 7.</note> which hee confirmes with this reason:
<q>It is good, saith hee, for young men and maids to bee kept from wine, lest such become af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards protest drunkards, profuse rioters, and prodigall exposers of their honour: the maine occasion whereof, are their parents, by meanes of their ill <hi>instruction,</hi> and worse example.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:45431:195"/>It is the very <hi>first instruction</hi> that takes the <hi>deepest impression</hi>; how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary then is it for you, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> whose sexe is the Embleme of weakenesse, and whose best resolves are oft-times weakned by youthfull promises, to furnish your blooming youth with wholesome instructions: and so to improve them, that they may increase in vigour, as you doe in stature? This your sexe exacts of you; this your present estate requires of you; and this shall easily bee effected by you, if having (as is to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed) discreet and religious Mothers, you submit your selves in all humble obedience to their direction. For as it is very hard for any one to know how to command, unlesse she know first how to obey; so will it bee unto you to performe the office of a Mother, if you never knew the duty of a daughter. Strict and severe may those Commands seeme to your youth, which riper age will easily digest. Againe, you that are Mothers, become patternes of modesty unto your daughters. Your living actions are the lines of their direction. While they are under your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the error is yours, not theirs, if they goe astray. Their <hi>honour</hi> should bee one of the principall'st things you are to tender; neither can it bee blemished, without some touch to your Credit. I have knowne some inconsiderate mothers, and those none of the lowest ranke or quality, who, either out of a confidence they had of their daughters good carriage, or drawn with the hopes of some rich Suitors to advance their marriage, have usually given too free way to opportunity, which brought upon their daughters names a spreading infamy.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>instructions</hi> will doe well with them, till society deprave them: divert then the occasion, so shall your daughters, bee they never so poore, have good, portions of reputation. Suffer not then those who partake of your image, to lose their best beauty. Sigh then if they bee soyled, for their shame must bee on you aspersed.</p>
                  <p>Grace is a pure balme, and consequently requires a pure and sound vessell. In vaine is it infused, if the vessell bee not whole and found to preserve it. It must bee <hi>pure,</hi> that what is infused into it, bee not pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it must bee <hi>sound,</hi> that what is poured into it, bee not effused, and it must bee <hi>deep,</hi> that it may bee more capacious in receiving of what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into it. Looke then to your own actions; these must informe them; Looke to your owne examples, these must confirme them. Without you they cannot perish; with you they may. What will you doe with the rest that is left, when you see a part of your selfe lost?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Harpie</hi> hath the face of a man, but a Bird so cruell by nature, as when shee is an hungry, shee will assault any man and kill him: After which bloudy repast, shee becomes thirsty, so as, going to the River to quench it, shee sees her owne face; and recalling to mind how it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him whom shee flew, she conceives such griefe, as shee dyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. If your Education or <hi>instruction</hi> deprave those who derive their beginning from you, the resemblance of this story may have proper relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto you. But if your pious examples enable them, their proficiency in vertue shall ennoble you; your comforts shall bee multiplyed in them; your hopes seconded by them; and, to your ever-living fames, the memory of your vertues preserved by them.</p>
                  <p>Let not that adage prove true, in respect of your Charge:
<q>The most precious things have ever the most pernicious Keepers.</q>
Nothing more precious than a Virgins honour; it were shame for the mother to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:45431:195"/>
prove a <hi>Tarpeian</hi> or treacherous keeper. That Conceit was elegantly expressed by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, in his instructions to the King his sonne;
<q>That Fortune had somewhat of the nature of a woman; that if shee bee too much woo'd, shee is the farther off.</q>
But I hope I shall not finde that aversenesse in you. I have wooed you in words; expresse your selves wonne by the testimony of your workes. I would not follow the indiscretion of Empericks, which minister the same medicines to all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; I know well, that such Physicke as agrees with age, would not agree with the hot constitution of youth: To either sort therefore have I applyed my severall receits: and to both, doe I addresse my conclusion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Let the whole progresse of your Conversation bee a continued Line of <hi>instruction</hi>; Let the mother discharge her office in <hi>commanding,</hi> and that without too much rigour or indulgence; Let the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performe her duty in <hi>obeying,</hi> with all faithfull and filiall observance: So shall <hi>honour</hi> grace you here, and <hi>glory</hi> crowne you there with an heavenly inheritance.</q>

Such as knew not what it was to admire the <hi>purple,</hi> nor fawne on a rising <hi>favorite</hi>; but interveined their actions with the precious Oare of Divinest vertues. Such as had attained to a singular Command or soveraignty of their affections: so as they had learned to say, as <hi>Chilo</hi> answered his brother, <hi>Wee know how to suffer injuries</hi>; so doe not these fiery and furious spirits. It is a poore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>greatnesse,</hi> to exercise it in revenge; or in triumphing over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours; or countenancing unjust actions. These detract from <hi>honour</hi>; neither can their memory live long, who makes authority a Sanctuary to wrong. Know then, (noble <hi>Gentlewomen</hi>) that your <hi>Honour,</hi> bee it never so eminent; your <hi>Descent,</hi> bee it never so ancient; lose both their beauty and antiquity, if <hi>vertue</hi> have not in you a peculiar soveraignty. Be your wanton fancy painted and trimmed in never so demure or hypocriticall disguise; Bee your ambition or Courtly aspiring never so shrouded with gilded shadowes of humility; Bee your unbounded desire of revenge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so smoothly coloured with the seeming remission of an impressive injury: In a word, should you never walke so covertly in a Cloud; nor never so cunningly with a dainty kind of dissembling gull the world; all this will not avayle you. When your bodies shall come to be shrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then shall all your actions bee uncased. Rumour then wil I take more liberty to discover unto the world, what you did in it.

Have you <hi>foes</hi>? if <hi>vicious,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve ever to bee held so; but if they affect <hi>goodnesse,</hi> prize them above the value of your highest fawning friends: who, as they are meere observers of the time, preferre your <hi>fortunes</hi> with which you are inriched, or <hi>honours</hi> to which you are advanced, or some other by-respect secretly aymed, before those <hi>essentiall parts</hi> which are in you, and truly ennoble you.</p>

                  <p>Againe, Have you such as maligne your <hi>honour</hi>? their aspersions cannot touch you; He that made you, hath made you strong enough to despise them, and with a patient smile, or carelesse neglect to flight them. Those that are <hi>good,</hi> can have none but those that are <hi>evill</hi> to bee their foes.

These may be properly, in my opinion, compared to our new counterfeit stuffes; which, as at first they are made best, so do they weare best at first. Your Cloth, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> must bee of another nap: it must not bee the best a farre off.

That person needs not feare any foe, that hath within him such an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable friend. There was never any yet so happy, as to bee wholly freed from adversity, and never feele any gusts of affliction. Trials of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience are sweet encounters; by a minde rightly-resolved, they are with more delight than distaste entertained: Which, as they come not unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, so are they no lesse cheerefully received.</p>
                  <p>It is the argument of a <hi>generous</hi> spirit, to expresse his highnesse most,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:45431:199"/>
when the world accounts of him least. <hi>Honour,</hi> if truly grounded, can looke in the face of terrour, and never bee amated. Her device deserv'd approvement, who in the portraiture shee made for her selfe, directed her eye to the picture of <hi>vertue,</hi> and pointing thereat with her singer, used this <hi>Imprezza: That picture is my posture.</hi> Truth is, shee that makes <hi>vertue</hi> her <hi>object,</hi> cannot but make every earthly thing her <hi>subject.</hi> Yea, there is nothing shee weares, which shee makes not a morall use of to better her selfe. Her very <hi>attire</hi> puts her in minde of what shee was before shee needed it; and how breach of obedience necessitated her to weare it. Shee will not therefore pride her selfe in her shame, nor glorifie her selfe in the cover of sinne. Shee cannot eye her selfe with any selfe-love, seeing shee lost her selfe by affecting that which shee ought not to love. Her <hi>head-tyre</hi> puts her in minde of the <hi>helmet of salvation</hi>; her <hi>stomacher,</hi> of the <hi>brest-plate of righteousnesse</hi>; her <hi>partle,</hi> of the <hi>shield of faith</hi>; her very <hi>shooes,</hi> of the <hi>sandals of peace.</hi> In this Tabernacle of earth, shee is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day nearer her port of rest; for her discourse is ever seasoned with discretion, winged with devotion, and graced by her owne conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
                  <p>Shee is none of these, who are Saints in their tongues, but Divels in their lives: Shee propounds nought fit to bee done, which shee confirmes not with her owne action. Againe, for her actions, shee is free from publike scandall, as her whole life is a golden rule of direction, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued precept of instruction. In a word, shee considers from whence shee came; her <hi>descent</hi> was noble, and this shee graceth with noble vertues. Her <hi>house</hi> must receive no dishonor from her, but an ample testimony of a deserving successour.</p>
                  <p>Let this Idaea, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> bee your Patterne. Pure is the <hi>Cloth</hi> you weare; let no staine of yours blemish it; no Moath of deserved detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction eat into it. Many of your Sexe, though highly borne, have so ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished the <hi>honour</hi> of that <hi>house</hi> from whence they came, and corrupted that <hi>noble blood</hi> from which they sprung, as their memory rots, yet their infamy lives. Againe, others there have beene, who though obscurely borne, yet by those eminent vertues which did adorne them, those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine parts which did truly ennoble them, they became enlightners of their obscurity, filling Annals with their glorious memory. Imitate these; relinquish those. <hi>Honour</hi> is not worth receiving, unlesse it bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by one that is deserving: yea, how many have incurred disgrace by dis-esteeming <hi>vertue,</hi> when they were advanced to highnesse of place? Nay, how many while they lived obscure, lived secure, and preserved their good names, who afterwards, by becomming <hi>great,</hi> lost that private esteeme which before they possest? So hard it is to encounter with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and every way returne a saver.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then no <hi>Cloth</hi> takes such <hi>deepe tincture</hi> as the <hi>Cloth of Honour,</hi> let no vicious aspersion spot it, no corrupt affection staine it; lest, by being once blemished, it bring that <hi>Honour</hi> into contempt, which before you reteined.</p>

Yea, shee loves those best, to whom these arguments of bounty are in highest measure exprest. Shee averts not her eare from the needy beggar, shee will shew him all favour for his image or feature. Shee holds it an unbeseeming state, to entertaine a sowre looke, where noble pitty should beget in her a compassionate love. Shee is so daily and duely inured to <hi>workes</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> as shee joyes in no object more than occasion of bounty. Shee considers (and this shee Divinely applies unto her selfe) how nought but vanity is to bee attributed to them, reteine they never so much earthly glory on them, who dwell in houses of clay, whose <hi>foundation</hi> is in the <hi>dust,</hi> which are <hi>crushed</hi> before the <hi>Moath.</hi>

Neither reserves shee the gleanings for him, that is Master of the Harvest.

therefore give her eye leave to wander, lest it should betray her <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to a treacherous intruder. How weak prove those assaults, which her home-bred enemies prepare against her? Her <hi>looke</hi> must bee set on a purer Object than vanity: Shee will not eye it, lest shee should bee taken by it. Her <hi>Discourse</hi> must bee of a better subject than vanity: Shee will not treat of it, lest shee should bee engaged to it. Her <hi>thoughts</hi> are not admitted to entertaine vanity: They must not conceit it, lest they should bee deceived by it. Occasions wisely shee foresees, timely prevents, and consequently enjoyes true freedome of minde. You shall not see her consume the precious oyle of her Lampe, the light of her life, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable reere-bankets, unprofitable visits, or wanton treaties. Those will shee not admit of for companions, who are prodigall of their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> These shee reproves with a milde spirit, labouring to reclaime them with an ingenuous tender of her vertuous compassion towards them. None shee more distastes than these Brokers or Breakers of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bargaines: Shee excludes them the List of all civill society. How cautelous shee is, lest suspition should tax her? Outwardly, therefore, shee expresseth, what shee inwardly professeth. That <hi>honourable bloud</hi> which shee from her Predecessors received, till death surprize her, will shee leave untainted.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there ought shee hates more than <hi>pride,</hi> nor scornes more than <hi>disdaine.</hi> Shee rightly considers how her daies are <hi>mensurable,</hi> being but a <hi>span long,</hi> which implies her brevity; and <hi>miserable,</hi> being <hi>altogether vanity.</hi> Shee disclaymes that state which consists in scornefull lookes; A sweet and affable Countenance shee ever beares: The <hi>honour</hi> shee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes makes her humbler; and the prayses which are given her, work in her thoughts no distemper. So farre is shee from affecting the pompe of this world, as it growes contemptible to her higher-mounting thoughts. A faire and well-seeming retinue shee ever keepes about her: but none of these must bee Sycophants, with their oylie tongues to delude her; neither must any, who cloaths his Countenance with scorne, attend her. Shee observes on what steepe and dangerous grounds ambition wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Her sleepes are sweter, her content higher, her thoughts heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier. It is one of her greatest wonders, that any one should bee so rest of understanding, as to forget what infirme ground hee stands on. The purest Creature, bee shee never so absolute in her feature, is of no richer temper than <hi>Earth,</hi> our Common-mother. Shee is wiser than to preferre a poore handfull of <hi>red Earth</hi> before her choycest treasure. Though her deserts merit <hi>honour,</hi> shee dis-esteemes her owne deservings: being highly valued by all but her selfe. Thus shee prepares her selfe daily for what shee must goe to. Her last day is her every dayes memoriall. Lower may her body bee, when interred; but lower cannot her mind bee, than at this instant.

                     </note> when that <hi>unwrought Table</hi> of <hi>youth</hi> becomes furnished with choice characters; and the <hi>Subject</hi> begins to affect what is engraven in them; by continuance of time they become so habituate, as no art can make them adulterate. <hi>Sempronia</hi> was too light in her <hi>youth,</hi> to bee staid in her <hi>age. Fulvia</hi> gave too much way to her passion in her <hi>youth,</hi> to attemper it in her age. <hi>Zantippe</hi> was too shrewd a maid, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a quiet wife. What <hi>Nature</hi> hath not effected in us, may by industry bee facilitated in us, so wee begin to worke while the waxe is soft. O <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> how many, whose excellent endowments deserve ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, either by selfe-opinion have become transported, or by giving loose reines to passion, have miserably wandred, or by inveying against others more deserving parts, have wittingly transgressed? By which meanes, they become spectacles of contempt, who otherwise by their conceiving discourse might have given occasion of content. It is too true, that the liberty of <hi>greatnesse</hi> is such, as it is more apt to finde fewell to feede the humour of <hi>vice,</hi> then to minister any usefull ingredience for the recovery of <hi>vertue.</hi> Great mindes are many times sicke of great maladies, which by soothing parasites become insensible, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently incurable. <hi>Vice</hi> in a poore habit never reteines that majesty, which it displayes in a richer robe. Is it so? Reflect then upon your selves; if <hi>vice</hi> seeme so specious, what will <hi>vertue</hi> do: (though all your <hi>vertues</hi> bee but indeed specious <hi>vices.</hi>) Beleeve it, if you cherish <hi>vertue</hi> in your minority, shee will performe the office of a faithfull guardian. The widowes teares shall bee very few, for shee will finde <hi>justice</hi> to redresse her: the Orphans cryes shall not bee so loud, shee will finde <hi>compassion</hi> to cheere her. The State shall not exclaime of surfeits, for <hi>temperance</hi> shall shield her: nor the Church of coldnesse, for <hi>zeale</hi> shall inflame her: What a sweet <hi>consort</hi> is an <hi>unison</hi> of <hi>vertues</hi> to the eare of a divine soule! All other Musicke is dis-rellishing, because it workes not on the affection.</p>
                  <p>Now would you know whence it comes, that <hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>vice,</hi> whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever takes hold first, <hi>reteines</hi> a <hi>deeper impression</hi> in <hi>Honour,</hi> than in any <hi>lower subject</hi>? The reason is evident: As in their state or condition they are more eminent, so is their representative example in others more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent. Doe these <hi>honourable personages</hi> then love <hi>vertue</hi>? they are <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous molds</hi> unto their followers: they shall finde in their <hi>shadowes</hi> what they expresse in <hi>themselves. Iulia</hi> could not bee <hi>loose,</hi> when <hi>Lucretia</hi> was so <hi>chaste</hi>: shee saw that in her Mistresse which deserv'd love, and to that shee conform'd the line of her life. To consort at unseasonable houres with loose lovers, or to entertaine light discourse to beguile time, was no authenticke doctrine in her Mistresse family: no day was without her taske, no night without her peculiar employment. There is no
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:45431:201"/>
question, but the prime yeeres of this noble Lady were seasoned with such exquisite instructions, as what her <hi>youth</hi> had received; were not in her riper <hi>yeares</hi> to bee abolished. First, motions have <hi>deepe impressions:</hi> especially, when they become seconded by examples of authority, whose very persons impose on their Pupils a resistlesse necessity. The estimate of <hi>Honour,</hi> with those who are truly <hi>honourable,</hi> is at too high a rate to ingage it selfe to the hazard of disgrace, for any temporary <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>delight.</hi> Their onely <hi>profit</hi> is to become <hi>proficients</hi> in the practice of <hi>Vertue</hi>; Their highest <hi>delight,</hi> to subdue their delights to the obedience of reason, for the love of <hi>vertue.</hi> Such as these, are to bee accounted onely <hi>Noble</hi>; for their <hi>desires</hi> are so, which they ever ennoble with deserving actions. For tell me, can any one whose judgement is not blinded, or inward light not wholly blemished, esteeme that <hi>Person</hi> for <hi>honourable,</hi> whose <hi>Outside</hi> onely magnifies it selfe in a <hi>poakt</hi> head, a <hi>poland</hi> sleeve, and a <hi>Protean</hi> body? No; these are but outward badges of their inward vanity. These have too much coare at their heart, to bee of sound health. If they have no other expressions to deblaze their <hi>Honour,</hi> they are rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Contempt</hi> than <hi>State,</hi> bee they never so glorious to the eye of our vulgar.</p>
                  <p>It hath beene (and I could wish it were not to this day continued) an usuall forme of breeding, with some more eminent Persons, to have their Children practise a kinde of state from their infancy; which, indeed, being truly defined, was a phantasticke supercilious garbe, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered more pride than deserved <hi>prayse.</hi> Neither could these so easily relinquish in their <hi>age,</hi> what was commended to them in their <hi>youth.</hi> For such as commonly attended their persons, extolled whatsoever they saw by them, or in them expressed; such is the misery of <hi>greatnesse</hi> that if it be not an exact Censor and reprover of her owne vanity; They shall finde approvers of it by those odious professors of sycophancy, whose glozing condition hath beene the ruine of many a noble family. For what may bee the usuall dialect of these <hi>Tame-Beasts</hi> to their bounteous Benefactors, those prodigall disbursers of their fathers providence, but this parasiticall parley?
<q>It would well become you, to bee rarely seene, reservedly affable; to reteine state in your pace, awe in your face, scorne in your eye, a storme in your brow, with a gracefull contempt in all your carriage.</q>
An excellent direction to purchase hate! These <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi> are not for your <hi>Honour.</hi> The way to divert their straine, is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what they distaste. You cannot want vitious Libertines to second you in a sensuall course, if your owne disposition stand so affected. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnia</hi> could not bee good, when <hi>Messalina</hi> was so naught. Your <hi>lives,</hi> as they are <hi>lines</hi> to your selves, so should they bee <hi>lights</hi> unto others. Are you modest? It will beget a love of modesty through all your family. Not one who owes their observance to you, but will admire this <hi>vertue</hi> in you, and practise it in themselves, because they see it so highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by you. Againe, Lightnesse, or any irregularity in you whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will not redound onely to your owne, but your whole families dishonour. Which opinion once possest, your <hi>honour</hi> receives such a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wound, as no continuation of time (so lasting is the record of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy) may perfectly cure it: which seemes confirmed by our moderne Poet:

                  <p>Briefly, Are you <hi>young</hi> or <hi>old</hi>? Esteeme no life sweeter, then when every day improves you and makes you better: Then when every Taske tastes of goodnesse, to advance your <hi>Honour.</hi> Delights, as they may moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheere you, so let them not play too much on your fancy, lest they take you: Bee not commanded by them, but command them. The onely meanes to weane you from them, or make you more indifferent for them, is to fixe your affections on <hi>those</hi> which doe infinitely surpasse them.

                  <p>The way to <hi>contemplate</hi> these, and <hi>consort</hi> with these, is to meditate of <hi>heaven,</hi> which enjoyeth all these.

Last day, you were at <hi>Court</hi>; where revels, reere-bankets, showes, and solemnities, were objects to your <hi>Eyes, Eares,</hi> and <hi>Tastes:</hi> but all these are vanished.

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:45431:204"/>
the night clozeth the day, which makes them shut up shop, and then all those vanities are shrouded.

Thus you runne in a maze, while you lay the <hi>Scene</hi> of your <hi>Mirth</hi> on <hi>Earth.</hi> Recollect then your divided thoughts; seat there the delight of your <hi>minde,</hi> where you may find a continued <hi>Mirth.</hi> Earth is too low a <hi>Stage</hi> for an <hi>Act</hi> of that Majesty; and too straight to give your <hi>best guest</hi> content within her Mud-wals of misery.

                  <p>Consider, how the eyes of heaven are upon you; how that <hi>generous</hi> stemme, from whence you were derived, expects much from you. The <hi>former</hi> injoynes you, upon hope of a future reward, to bee more caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; The <hi>latter,</hi> as you tender the <hi>honour</hi> of your <hi>house,</hi> to bee vertuous.

                  <p>That glorious Light of the Church, an industrious Searcher and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Censor of Antiquities, S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> saith, That anciently the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> worshipped <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> for gods. Whence it was, that they built two Temples, which were so seated, as none could enter the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi> unlesse hee had first passed through the Temple of <hi>Vertue</hi>: to signifie that none was to bee <hi>honoured,</hi> unlesse by some <hi>Vertue</hi> he had first deserved it. The <hi>Morall</hi> admits no other exposition than its owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. For <hi>Honour,</hi> none should bee so daring bold as to wooe her, till by passing thorow <hi>Vertues</hi> Temple, hee get admittance unto her.</p>
                  <p>If you desire to bee <hi>great,</hi> let it bee your height of ambition to <hi>aspire to honour</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi> Where the lowest cannot bee lesse than a <hi>Lady of Honour,</hi> because the lowest of her actions correspond with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Such a <hi>service</hi> were no <hi>servitude</hi> but a <hi>solace.</hi> Admit, that sometimes you affected forraine <hi>fashions,</hi> now let forraine <hi>Nations</hi> admire your <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> Perchance, the delicacy of your nature, or misery of a long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed custome will not so easily at the first bee wholly weaned, from what it hath for so many yeares affected. Vse than an easie restraint at the first; withdraw your affections from <hi>vanity</hi> by degrees; reserve some select houres for private Devotion; check your fancies when they dote on ought that may distract you. The first Encounter will bee hardest; Time will bring you to that absolute soveraignty over your passions, as you shall finde a singular calmenesse in your affections. For the <hi>Windes</hi> of your <hi>passions</hi> shall no sooner cease, then that vast boundlesse <hi>Sea</hi> of your distemper'd affections shall become calme. What a brave <hi>Salique</hi> State

Thus shall you revive the ashes of your families, and conferre on them surviving memories. But, it is the evening crownes the day; sufficient it is not to diffuse some few reflecting beamelings of your <hi>vertues,</hi> at your first <hi>rising,</hi> and darken them with a cloud of <hi>vices</hi> at your <hi>setting.</hi> As your daies are more in number, so must they bee every day better. What availes it the <hi>Mariner</hi> to have taken his Compasse wisely, to have shunned rockes and places of danger warily, and at last to runne on some shelfe, when hee should now arrive at the Bay where hee would bee? Rockes are ever nearest the <hi>shore,</hi> and most tentations nearest your <hi>end.</hi> If you resolve then to come off fairely, prepare your selves for some encounter daily; observe your exercise of devotion duely; resist assaults constantly; that you may gain a glorious victory. This is all the <hi>Combat</hi> that is of you desired; wherein many of your <hi>Sexe</hi> have nobly deserved. Stoutly have they <hi>combated,</hi> and sweetly have they <hi>conquered.</hi> Emulate their <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> imitate their <hi>lives,</hi> and enjoy their <hi>loves.</hi> So may you with that <hi>Patterne of patience dye in your owne Nests, and multiply your dayes as the Sand:</hi> So may your <hi>vertues,</hi> which shone so brightly in these Courts of Earth, appeare most glorious in those Courts of Heaven. So may these scattered flowers of your fading beauty, bee supplied with fresh flowers of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible beauty: yea, the <hi>King</hi> himselfe shall <hi>take pleasure in your beauty</hi>; who will come like a <hi>glorious Prince</hi> out of his <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>royall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> to grace you; like a <hi>Specious Spouse</hi> out of his <hi>Nuptiall Chamber,</hi> to embrace you.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S her owne <hi>Tyrewsman</hi>; one that weares her owne <hi>face</hi>; and whose <hi>complexion</hi> is her owne. Her Iournals lie not for th' <hi>Exchange,</hi> needlesse visits, nor Reere-bankets. Showes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments shee viewes with a civill admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein her harmlesse desire is, rather to see than bee seene. Shee hates nothing so much as entring parly with an immodest Suitor. Retire from occasions drawes her to her Arbour: where the sole object of her thoughts is her Maker. Her eyes shee holds her profest foes, if they send forth one loose looke; teares must sue out their pardon, or no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Her resort to the <hi>Court,</hi> is for <hi>occasion,</hi> not <hi>fashion</hi>: where her demeanour ever gives augmentation to her honour. Her winning modesty becomes so powerfull a Petitioner, as shee ever returnes a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Suiter. During her abode in the <hi>City,</hi> shee neither weares the Street, nor wearies her selfe with her Coach: Her Chamber is her Tyring-roome, where shee bethinks her how shee may play her part on the worlds Theatre; that shee may gaine applause of her heavenly Spectators. Her constant reside is in the <hi>Country</hi>; where hospitality proclaimes her in-bred affection to workes of piety. All which shee exerciseth with that privacy, as they will witnesse for her, shee feares nothing more than vaine-glory. In her house shee performes the office of a Mistris, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Governesse. Shee knowes when to put on a smooth brow, and to cherish industry with moderate bounty. Her discreet providence makes her family look with a cheerefull countenance: Her posterity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but prosper, being nurs'd by so naturall a mother. The open field she makes her Gallery; her Labourers, her living Pictures; which, though shee finds <hi>meere Pictures,</hi> hanging on, rather than labouring, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion transports her not above her selfe, nor forceth her to the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression unworthy of her selfe: shee passeth by them with a modest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, which workes in them a deeper impression, than any fiery or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious passion: Her Neighbors shee daily wooes and winnes: which shee effects with such innocent affability, as none can justly tax her of flattery. An <hi>Over-seer</hi> for the <hi>poore</hi> shee appoints her selfe, wherein shee exceeds all those that are chosen by the <hi>Parish.</hi> Shee takes a Survey daily and duly of them, and, without any charge to the <hi>Hamlet,</hi> relieves them.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:45431:206"/>
She desires not to have the esteeme of any <hi>She-clarke</hi>; shee had rather bee approv'd by her <hi>living,</hi> than <hi>learning</hi>: And hath ever preferr'd a sound professant before a profound disputant. A president of piety shee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth her selfe in her family, which shee so instructs by her owne life, as vertue becomes the object of their love. Her taske shee sets her selfe daily, which shee performes duely: Her owne remisnesse, (if any such be) shee reproves by so much more than others, as she knowes her owne life to bee more exemplary than others. Some Bookes shee reads, and those powerfull to stirre up devotion and fervour to prayer; others shee reads, and those usefull for direction of her houshold affaires. Herbals shee peruseth, which shee seconds with conference: and by degrees so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves her knowledge, as her cautesous care perfits many a dangerous cure. In all which, shee turnes her eare from her owne praise: humbling her selfe lowest in heart, though <hi>descent</hi> ranke her highest in place. She af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects nothing more than mildnesse; distastes nothing more than harshnesse. Prosperity could never worke so upon her thoughts, as to transport her; nor adversity so weaken her well-resolved temper, as to amate her. Though shee tender her family; extend her care to her posterity; her highest ayme is the practise of piety. Her discretion hath enabled her to distinguish of times: whereby shee informes her selfe when shee should bee provident and frugall, when bounteous and liberall. Her <hi>gate</hi> is not more open than is her <hi>heart</hi>; where shee holds the poorest her richest guests. Shee thinkes that day wholly lost, wherein shee doth not one good worke at least. She is no <hi>busie-body,</hi> nor was ever, unlesse it were about her family, needle, or Sampler. She holds that day the swetest, which in actions of goodnesse is the fruitfull'st. Like a good Merchant, shee brings her merchandize afarre, and yet shee travels not farre for it; Shee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Her <hi>Husband</hi> shee acknowledgeth her <hi>head</hi>; whom to oppose, were to mutine against her <hi>Leader,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently shew her selfe an <hi>unruly member.</hi> If hee bee <hi>intemperate,</hi> shee wooes and winnes him with <hi>love</hi>; and, in time, weanes and reclaimes him from his <hi>irregular life.</hi> So conformable is shee to his opinion, both in points of Religion, and arguments of providence; as the <hi>Exchequer</hi> must bee no <hi>Sponge</hi> to her husbands purse through her conscience. Yet makes shee <hi>Conscience</hi> her <hi>gaine</hi>; and in that blessed commerce, <hi>Humility</hi> her <hi>guide, Heaven</hi> her <hi>goale.</hi> Her <hi>houshold</hi> shee makes her <hi>Common-weale</hi>; wherein not any from the highest to the lowest of her <hi>feminine governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but knowes their peculiar office and employment: to which they addresse themselves (so highly they honour her they serve) with more <hi>love</hi> than <hi>feare.</hi> Shee becomes <hi>Promoter,</hi> I meane of no office to wrong her Countrey, but the tender care of a mother in behalfe of her well-edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated progeny; to which the world no sooner gives entertainment, than shee begins to enable them for their advancement. Markets shee seldome visits, nor any place of freer Concourse: for shee findes when her <hi>eyes</hi> are abroad, her thoughts are estrang'd from home. Would you take a fuller view of her? Draw nearer; <hi>Observe</hi> her even in <hi>these</hi> which some of her sexe esteeme least, with how <hi>generous</hi> a beauty shee adornes her selfe most.</p>
                  <p>APPARELL shee weares; and sighes when shee remembers her Sexe. She wonders how that <hi>fig-leafe,</hi> Habit, should bee so strangely altered. How this <hi>Ensigne</hi> of originall sinne should bee so quaintly slasht, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:45431:206"/>
What <hi>paines</hi> sinne takes to display her shame! Her garment is of another cut. Though shee cannot rectifie this broad-spreading malady, the corruption of this age must not draw her to that vanity. Shee knowes the use of APPARELL, which shee would bee loath to invert. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd it was, to keepe in naturall heat, and to keepe out cold: this shee observes with a gracefull presence, making this her Impreze: <hi>Comely, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>BEHAVIOUR shee sets out with a civill expression, without much art or affectation. There is nothing which doth not infinitely become her. In places of resort, shee is so highly admir'd, as those which observe her, could bee well content to serve her. She is <hi>generous</hi> in all; Not a Look but gives Life to Love; and that so vertuously dispos'd, as not a light thought can distract it. Her very motion is a moving direction; Shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learned to <hi>tinkle</hi> with her <hi>feet,</hi> to <hi>wander</hi> with her <hi>eyes,</hi> to <hi>staine</hi> her spotlesse honour with a <hi>painted blush.</hi> All shee doth is her owne; All her owne doth incomparably please; which shee clozeth with this impreze: <hi>Loving Modesty is a Living Beauty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>COMPLEMENT shee admits, but not that which this Age affects; shee preferres <hi>Substance</hi> before meere <hi>Formality.

Shee cares not for this Rhetoricall varnish, it makes a good cause suspitious; her desire is to expresse her selfe in <hi>action</hi> more than <hi>discourse.</hi> That COMPLEMENT which consists in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, cringies, and salutes, dis-rellisheth her palate most: it tastes too much of the Caske; for the rest shee is secure, so her actions bee really pure; her selfe <hi>completely</hi> honest. Thus shee summes up her dayes, makes <hi>vertue</hi> her praise, this her Impreze: <hi>Civill Complement, my best Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment.</hi>

                  <p>DECENCY is her native Livery; though shee make no shadow of it, her owne shadow is not more individuate. In her attire shee is not so sumptuous as seemely, not so costly as comely; in her discourse shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers her mind not so amply as fully, nor so quickly as freely; in her whole course shee expresseth her inward beauty. Her Glasse is not halfe so usefull to her selfe, as the glasse of her life is to others. Whatsoever is worne by her, receives a singular grace from her. Her fashion is never out of request; though more constant in it, than the Age would admit.

                  <p>ESTIMATION is that precious <hi>odour</hi> which gives sweetnesse to her <hi>honour.</hi> Dye had shee rather with it, than enjoy an Empire and live without it.

Poverty shee holds an incomparable blessing, so her name bee inriched by ESTIMATION: No <hi>lead Fly</hi> can corrupt that <hi>Ointment.</hi> Happy needs must be her <hi>State,</hi> that preserves this without <hi>Staine.</hi> This shee feeds not with the juyce of vain-glory; nor seeks to augment it with a fabulous story. Many have purchas'd praise in Oylie lines, that never merited applause all their lives. Her desire is to <hi>be,</hi> rather than <hi>seeme</hi>; lest <hi>seeming</hi> to <hi>bee</hi> what shee <hi>is not,</hi> shee gull the world; but her selfe most, by

                  </p>
                  <p>FANCY she entertaines with a cheerefull but chaste bosome. Though Love be blind, her love has eyes. No lesse faithfull is shee in reteining, than doubtfull in entertaining. Protests are dangerous Lures to credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lovers, but her FANCY is too staid to stoope unto them. Shee can love well, but lest shee should repent soone, and that too late, shee will <hi>try</hi> before shee <hi>trust,</hi> have some reason to <hi>like</hi> before shee <hi>love.</hi> Shee holds that FANCY a <hi>Frenzy,</hi> which is onely led by <hi>Sense.</hi> Shee makes <hi>Reason</hi> her <hi>Guide,</hi> that <hi>Content</hi> may bee her <hi>Goale.</hi> Long time shee debates with <hi>Love,</hi> before ever she give <hi>Love</hi> her <hi>heart</hi>; which done, shee confirmes the bargaine with her hand.

                  </p>
                  <p>GENTILITY is not her boast, but that which dignifies that title most. Titles from Ancestors derived, and by their Successors actions not revived, Shee holds degenerously usurped. Vertue is her soveraignesse; in whose service to live and die shee holds the absolutest happinesse. Gentry shee thinkes best graced by affability: To bee surly, derogates as much from her worth, as basenesse from Nobility of birth.

That antick portrature of State must needes decline, where <hi>piety</hi> beares not up the traine. The more HONOUR that is conferr'd on her, makes her the humbler; shee cloathes not her Looke with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull scorne, nor clouds her brow with an imperious frowne.

For the <hi>first,</hi> she is fashionably neat; for the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> formally discreet; for the <hi>third,</hi> civilly complete; for the <hi>fourth,</hi> amiably decent; for the <hi>fifth,</hi> precious in repute; for the <hi>sixth,</hi> affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly constant; for the <hi>seventh, generously</hi> accommodated; for the <hi>eighth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably</hi> accomplished. Whence it is, that shee impalls her diuinall race with this imperiall Impreze: <hi>Honour is Vertues Harbour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Goe on, then, shee may with <hi>Honour,</hi> seeing the <hi>King</hi> in her <hi>beauty</hi> takes such <hi>pleasure.</hi> A Divine presage of promising goodnesse was her infancy; A continuate practice of piety was her youth and maturity; The cloze of her Pilgrimage a calme passage from frailty to felicity. Longer would the earth keepe her, but so should shee bee kept from that which shee values farre better. Her Husband cannot stay long behind, seeing his <hi>better part</hi> is gone before.</p>

                  <head>APPENDIX VPON A FORMER supposed Impression of this TITLE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Uring my late and long abode in the Countrey, I was advertised by a friend from the Universitie, that my <hi>ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISH GENTLEMAN</hi> was <hi>matched</hi> in the Citie. Which report did not a little perplexe me; that one so tenderly nursed, carefully nurtured, and by the testimony of all such as did judiciously know him, absolutely accomplished, should without his Fathers consent, become tide, whom a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Liberty had made free. Besides all this, I was infinitely troubled with the feare of his <hi>Choice.</hi> For, thought I, should he now bee married to some <hi>Young-roisting-minx,</hi> who ne're knew what providence meant, but intended more the tricking and trimming of her selfe, than decking or dressing of her Soule; who makes it her sole taske, to sacrifice the <hi>Morning</hi> to her <hi>Glasse,</hi> the <hi>Mid-day</hi> to the <hi>Stage,</hi> the <hi>Evening</hi> to a <hi>Light Consort</hi> or <hi>recre-banket</hi>; and so spin out her time in a sensuall surfeit; how would this distemper him, and consequently dis-rellish them, who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured up their hopes in him! This begot in me diverse resolves, which were seconded with a fresh fally of doubts and feares. Sometimes I resolved, if the Match were not already concluded, nor the rites solemnized, to forbid the baines lest it should bee his <hi>bane,</hi> so rashly to contract, before hee had his parents consent.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:45431:208"/>
But I feared, lest this might have the selfe-same issue, which that cashiered Souldier had, who having bestowed seven yeares and more in service with the <hi>States</hi>; and now returning home; and comming on a Holiday to the Parish church where hee was borne, hee might heare the baines of matrimony published betwixt one who bare his owne wives name, and another, to whom shee was to bee espoused, as hee rightly conceived. So as, impatient of farther delay, hee forbad the baines; but to no purpose; for though shee bare her name, shee was not his wife whom hee heard published; for his owne wife was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Curate of the Parish solemnly contracted. All this while recollecting my senses, and adding spirit to my resolves, I began a fresh thus to expostulate with my selfe: Admit this <hi>Young Gentleman</hi> were married, and by his <hi>Choice</hi> disparaged; were it not in the compasse of our Lawes to redresse it? Yes; for, thought I, her carriage will not bee so faire, but one may take advantage of it; and consequently procure a <hi>divorce</hi> by it. Or, should her circumspect levity bee such, as none could discover it, nor taxe her demeanure for it, yet presumptions and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, exemplified with fat fees, would bring her to a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and in short time produce a <hi>Nullity.</hi> Records upon due search, (had they not of late either <hi>subtilely</hi> or <hi>tumultuously</hi> beene defaced) I needed little doubt, but they would furnish me with <hi>Eminent instances</hi> of this kind; which being <hi>feelingly</hi> pressed, would become very prevalent before a <hi>Conceiving</hi> Court. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I might justly insert this in the course of my pleading, as a sufficient ground or motive to <hi>Separation</hi>; pregnant proofe I have of a precontract betwixt this <hi>ENGLISH GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WOMAN</hi> and HIM; which marriage, though it were not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized with an externall rite, yet by mutuall consent was it confirmed, and reciprocally plighted with a ceremonious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergage of hand and heart. But I held it fittest, to addresse my course to the place, before I resolved of the materiall points of my pleas. And first to conferre with my <hi>Gentleman</hi> himselfe, that I might understand by him how hee stood affected; and whether his owne relation would confirme, what erring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had so constantly bruited. But to my comfort, as I left him, so I found him; of too discreet a temper, to bee taken with any such counterfeit Creature. Such reports, hee ingenuously confess'd, there were dispersed;
<q>But what am I (said hee) by these disparaged? My untainted honour is neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd nor impeach'd by rumour. Hee builds weakely, who reares his foundation on the opinion of the vulgar. Have you ever seene me so lightly enamoured, as to preferre either
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:45431:208"/>
                        <hi>face</hi> or <hi>habit,</hi> before a <hi>deserving Spirit.</hi> Did you ever injoyne mee that morall Embassie, which I have not faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Or imposed on mee that taske, being noble and generous, which I have not carefully discharged? Were your eyes ever witnesses of any loose or light affection, to which I too pliably inclined? Or have you at any time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served mee so lightly credulous, as constantly to affect what was transitively commended? Have you ever knowne me sacrifice my Lampe to the Idoll of an undeserving love? Or melted into passion, to display the least impression of that love? Or flattered that Love with any forced hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole, or passionate line? Or with folded armes past over a tedious houre, with an amorous redoubling of <hi>A Mees</hi>? How fares it then, you should so rashly conceit, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate report had so lightly dispersed? No, believe it; had it beene my unhappy fate, to have engag'd my faith to such a staine; or darkened my discretion with such a foile; or interchang'd my present happy estate, with such a blemish of her Sexe; I would have razed out my <hi>TITLE,</hi> and expos'd my selfe a contemptible Subject to all people. Besides all this, I verily thinke, I should have turn'd true Courtier, and made it my perpetuall <hi>Progresse,</hi> never to lye with her.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This did not a little revive me, to heare him so constantly expresse himselfe: Being therefore thus freed, from what I feared, I desired nothing more than to search out the occasion of this feare. Where I perceived, that a Mercenarie <note n="*" place="margin">A Frisking <hi>Fro,</hi> freigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hither in a <hi>Florentine</hi> Frigot.</note> 
                     <hi>Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician,</hi> who had taken upon her the state and stile of <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi> with more impudence than became her sexe, had chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged acquaintance of my <hi>Gentleman</hi>; which, though his Modesty did distaste, his Civility would not altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but permitted her like a thing of Sale, to lye apart from him on the open Stall. This propinquity of lying, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity of lodging, begot a groundlesse probability of their Loving. But how farre his affection was estranged from her, shall appeare by the entertainment hee gave to this <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,</hi> whom wee here tender; upon whose arrivall, hee expressed the true ground of his affection, after this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>With a chast Embrace of true Conjugall love, you are welcome. Let it not amate you, nor lessen my former esteeme with you, in that <hi>Report</hi> hath blaz'd me forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of you, by preferring an undeserving <hi>Choice</hi> before you. Fame were not her selfe, if all the grounds of her
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:45431:209"/>
reports were truth. Indeed, if either <hi>Titles</hi> could have drawne me, or <hi>Mercenarie</hi> respects seaz'd on me, I had bin neither yours nor mine owne; for in being lesse than yours, I could not possibly have beene mine owne. But tell me, my vertuous <hi>Choice,</hi> did you ever know me either taken with <hi>Titles,</hi> or deluded with <hi>Showes</hi>? Here is <hi>one</hi> indeed, who intrusively, and with lesse modesty than became her Sexe, pressed my acquaintance; but could her forwardnesse worke upon my affection, or leave with it the least retentive impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? No; should I chuse againe, as now my <hi>Choice</hi> admits no <hi>Change,</hi> I should equally prize the love of a Wench too <hi>forward,</hi> and of one too <hi>froward:</hi> and entertaine them both with that indifferent respect, as neither the <hi>forwardnesse</hi> of the one, should beget in mee a desire of <hi>winning,</hi> nor the <hi>frowardnesse</hi> of the other, move me to <hi>spin</hi> out my time in fruitlesse <hi>wooing.</hi> Indeed, I was seated in a warmer clime than where you resided. The South was my seate, while the North was your nest; yet could not that Clime make me discontinue my claime. Coole is that love which either ayre can distemper, or distance of place dissever, or any disastrous occurrent alter. You know what pledge I left you; nor did I ever since, engage it to any but you. Never shall you find me any such <hi>Paphlagonian Partridge,</hi> as to have two hearts. It is not <hi>title</hi> but <hi>substance,</hi> I affect. Your <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> were my first motives of affection; I did not eye your <hi>Descent,</hi> though nobly eminent; nor those <hi>outward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments</hi> of yours incomparably excellent; nor your <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi> in a worldings eye highly consequent. These I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, might produce rare effects, in such, whose conceits onely worke on outward objects. Mine eye was fixed in an higher Spheere; Spheered in a more glorious Orbe. What I observed in you, did so enamour me, as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that <hi>inward faire,</hi> which did so truely grace you, farre above those <hi>outward ornaments</hi> which did superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially adorn you. Could you imagine then, that a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine beauty could engage me, or a simpring civilized thing, whose best habilliments were borrowed, and whose very complexion, like a Bee in a box, preserved, should so weane me from what I deservingly fancied; as to become affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced to her, whose exposed liberty had made her publickly suspected? No; I never distinguished true merit by any of these: Being such weake supports, as should any one relye on them, they would faile them, if not fall under them. But mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempered shall my construction be of my deare Loves su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:45431:209"/>
I perswade my selfe, it was a surpassing affection that first begot this Conceit: which now sweetly allayed and attempered by reason, will admit of no such feare; seeing discreet fancie cannot dispence with faith, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat faith incline to any separation, till enforced by an inevitable fate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With these and such like amorous regreets, mixt with other variety of choice discourse, they entertained time; while shee, now safely seaz'd of him shee solely lov'd, and in whom her desires were fully cloz'd; importunatly sought rather, out of an apprehension of <hi>love</hi> than <hi>feare,</hi> (as what Creature more impatient of a Corrivall, or more solicitous of revenge in the quest of love than a woman) to know the true ground of that report, which rumor had dispersed; that any other should bee interessed in his love, whom so constant and continuate an affection had confirmed hers. Wherein hee fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her, by relating unto her, how amongst other imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Pasquils,</hi> usually foisted, and wherewith publick <hi>Presses</hi> are frequently farced, which begets in our age such a surfeite, as more learned labours become dis-rellished, and the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quedry of wit onely affected; a <hi>young Gentlewoman,</hi> whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous parts scarcely deserved that <hi>title,</hi> had by a secret or surreptitious claime made challenge unto him, but never durst to that day professe any such thing publikely before him; which hee so sleighted, as his thoughts never deigned to stoope to so low a lure; having long before, on a purer Object fixed his love, and to her sacred shrine sacrificed the remaines of his life.</p>
                  <p>This relation so cleared her from the least thought of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion, as it added now strength to her already-sufficiently strengthened affection. Equally communicated became their joyes, sociably attempered became their griefes: No sorrow could worke so violently, nor breake forth so passionately, which the sweet union and communion of their concording mindes, could not qualifie; No <hi>Solace</hi> could transport them so highly, nor seaze on them so hotly, wherein with joynt affections they did not partake mutually, and which, with a vertuous temper they allayed not mildly. Thus were they individually plighted, thus are they inseparably placed, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually pleased, immutably planted, equally solaced, and now to the publike view of the world, solemnely united.</p>
                  <p>Imagine then, if at any time you encounter with the <hi>Impression</hi> of any former Labour bearing this <hi>TITLE,</hi> that'tis but the <hi>Embrio</hi> of his braine, whose Mercenarie profession it is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge

any Corkie Subject, that may promise but the least hope of profit; resembling that ancient <hi>Pantotipe</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam</hi>; who publikely protested, that hee could bee well contented, that the <hi>Turkish Alcaron</hi> were Universally professed, so the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of it might bee to him and his Assignes solely granted.</p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Appendix,</hi> it was occasionally writ upon the report of publishing a <hi>Subject</hi> bearing this <hi>Title</hi>: which, belike, hearing of the coming forth of a more <hi>Deserving Consort,</hi> hath beene discreetly silenced, or by neglect of Time, in obscure privacy retyred. Now if any such <hi>Amphibium,</hi> after so long <hi>diving</hi> shall appeare <hi>venting,</hi> let it receive what it deserves to have, timely suppression.</p>
                  <p>For such <hi>Readers,</hi> as are rather taken with <hi>Titles</hi> than <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and become miserably enamoured on a beauteous <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, let our <hi>Gentleman</hi> with this his incomparable <hi>Choice</hi> be compared, and you shall find them equally matched, affectionately mated, and both for <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> compleatly graced.</p>

                        <p> that he had, amongst many other blessings which the Gods had bestowed on him, greatest cause of all others to give them thankes for three things: First was, for that they had made him a <hi>reasonable Creature,</hi> and no <hi>Beast</hi>: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was, for civilizing him a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and no <hi>Barbarian</hi>: Thirdly, in making him a <hi>Man,</hi> and no <hi>Woman</hi>: yet did hee sometimes ingenuously confesse the necessitie of them in winding up all his humane felicitie in these foure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</p>

what I reade, my memory to conserve what I have conceived and read, and a woman to serve me at my neede; should adversitie assaile me, it should not foile me; should an immerited disgrace lye heavy on me, it should not amate me; should my endeared friends forsake me, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying my selfe thus in mine owne family; I should laugh at the braves of fortune; account reproach my repute: and partake in the free soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of so sweet and select a friend within me, as no cloud without mee could perplex me.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Here was a brave Philosophicall resolution! He could see nought on earth, that could divert his thoughts from the contemplation of Heaven; provided, that he enjoyed that on earth, which made his earth seeme a second Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Some are of opinion, indeede, that hee had perused the Mosaicall Law, and that he bestowed much time in it, during his reside with his deare friend <hi>Phocion</hi> in <hi>Cilicia.</hi> No marvaile then, if he found there the <hi>excellency</hi> of their Creation: with their primary office or designation. Being made <hi>helpes</hi> for man: and so intimate to man, as she tooke her mould from man, as man his modell from mold.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but she was made of a <hi>rib,</hi> will some say, and that implide a <hi>crooked</hi> condition. No; but rather thus, A rib is <hi>bending,</hi> which presupposed her <hi>pliable</hi> disposition. And if that ancient Philosophicall Maxim hold good: "That the temperature of the soule followes the temperature of the body; we must necessarily conclude, that, as their outward temperature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure is more delicate: so their inward affections must be more purely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. No violent passion so predominant, which their mild temper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moderate; provided, that they be seasoned with <hi>grace,</hi> which makes them proficients in all spirituall <hi>growth.</hi> For a quicke unsanctified wit is a meere pery for the Divell: whereas witts accompanied with humilitie, make their privatest <hi>Soliloquies</hi> to converse with actions of glory.</p>
                     <p>These, and onely these reteine in memory the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And as those affectionate <hi>Sabines</hi> call'd their wives their <hi>Penates,</hi> their <hi>Houshold Gods,</hi> through that incomparable comfort they conceived in them, and benefits they derived from them: So are these <hi>Domi-portae, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae-portae, delitiae horti,</hi> as that witty Epigrammatist was sometimes pleased to enstile them, the choicest Sociates of humane Solace: So as; if the <hi>world</hi> were to be held a <hi>Wildernesse</hi> without societie, it might justly despaire of that comfort without their company. Whence it is, that the wise man concludeth; <hi>Without a woman would the house mourne.</hi>

                     <q>
                        <p>For, saith he, it is not the pouder, dust or ashes of any materiall shrine that can be possibly any way propitious to the gods: as the enormitie of our losses hath incensed them, so must the ashes of some living sacrifice appease them. My opinion then is posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively this: The ashes of some undefiled virgin must be sprinkled on their Altar, if we meane to preserve our state and honour.</p>
                        <p>This experience hath confirmed long since so highly usefull, as wee may reade what eminent states had perished; how their glory had been to dust reduced; nay, their very names in oblivion closed, and with dishonour cloathed, had not the fury of the incensed gods beene pacified, and by offertories of this nature attoned. This might be instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in those sacrifices of <hi>Iphigenia, Hesyone, Mariana,</hi> with many others: whose living memory raysed it selfe from dust, in so free and voluntary offering themselves to the stake, to deliver their endanger'd state; confirming their country-love with the losse of their dearest life. Search then no further, yee Conscript Fathers, how to appease their wrath; Virgin ashes cannot but be the <hi>purest dust</hi> of <hi>Earth.</hi> Whose sacred vowes, as they are dedicated to <hi>Vesta,</hi> who cannot admit her Temple to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by any impure touch: So ha's shee conferred such an excellent priviledge on a virgin state; as the fierce untamed <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> when nothing can bring him to subjection, nor attemper the madding fury of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: as if he had quite put off his nature, and assumed another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he will be content mildly to sleepe in the lap of a Virgin; and in eying her, allay his passion.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>With joynt voyce and vote all the <hi>Ephori</hi> inclined to his opinion: which so well appeased those divine furies, as their state, before by the Oracle so highly menaced, became secured; their Altars, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were before prophaned, purged: and those pollutions, whereof their City laboured, clearely expiated.</p>
                     <p>These poeticall Fictions, though they easily passe by the <hi>eare,</hi> yet they convey by a morall application, an Emphaticall impression to the <hi>heart.</hi> For hence might be divinely concluded: There is nothing comparably precious to a continent soule: Nothing of so pure nor pretious esteeme, as a virgin state. And that a woman, being the weaker vessell, when shee either in her virgin-condition remaines constant, or in her conjugall state loyall, she so much more inlargeth her glory, as her Sex or condition par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes more of frailtie.</p>
                     <p>But to divert from these; eye her in the <hi>Excellency</hi> of her <hi>Creation</hi> you shall finde her in her qualitie, an <hi>helper</hi>; in her societie, a <hi>comforter</hi>; in the perplexities of her consort, a <hi>counsellour</hi>; and in all these, a <hi>sharer.</hi> Had her beautie no other imbellishment, it were a moving object to entertaine a loving consort: But when inward ornaments accomplish that beautie, what a sweet perpetuall harmony runnes descant on their societie? This makes a private family an earthly paradise. No frayes within, no feares without: no illimited passion raging either within or without. The
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:45431:221"/>
reason is, she discreetly considers for what end she was created: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresseth the whole course of her affaires to accomplish that for which she was created. In eying her selfe in the glasse, she admires not her owne beautie; but his goodnesse, who bestowed on her so gracefull an image of Fancy not to winne others unto lightnesse, but to waine others by her example from the pathes of loosenesse; and by her patterne of pietie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them from vanitie, by chalking them forth a way to conduct them to happinesse.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O discourse more prevalent to goodnesse, then what is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by examples. On darke nights the least starre shewes her glory: which if it darted forth his lustre by day, would not be discovered so easily. Then is goodnesse most improved, when the indisposition of the time does least approve it. Those foure Cardinall vertues, whereon all others have and hold a necessary dependance; are compared by that devout and divine father, Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> to those foure rivers which issued from the foure borders of the Garden of Paradise: And of these <hi>imitable vertues,</hi> wee shall finde women such incomparable professours, as their actions deserve imitation and admiration.</p>
                     <p>How prudently did <hi>Artemisia</hi> and <hi>Zenobia, Thomyris</hi> and <hi>Penthisilea</hi> demeane themselves in the mannagement of their affaires whether publique or private! They might worthily take up the saying of that discreet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative <hi>Roman</hi>: "they were never lesse alone, then when alone. For these when they were left to themselves, they were not left eyther lesse fear'd or lov'd. These held up their states so wisely; disposed of their counsells so discreetly; governed their people with feare and love so equally: mannaging all their actions with those prudentiall grounds of policie; as their Allyes lov'd them, their enemies fear'd them: none about them, but did honour them, desiring nothing more then to enter into a firme and inviolable league with them.</p>
                     <p>So just likewise they were in all affaires of judicature; that if those dayes were accounted happy wherein <hi>Basill</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (and worthily might they be so esteemed) for that whensoever hee came to his judgement seate, he neither found partie to accuse, nor defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to answer: no lesse memorable were those Halcyon daies of theirs; when litigious Appellants were so handled, that if they commenced any suite without just ground, they were to pay to the Defendant double costs, to the publique state a mulct, and receive a personall disgrace: being disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ever after to beare any publique office, or be imployed in any Military or Civill state-service.</p>
                     <p>Worthy indeede, of high commendations was the answer of that invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Alexander</hi> to his Mother, who transported with passion (as what humane condition but subject to such affections) being desirous to execute an innocent harmelesse man, the better to prevaile with him, and the more impressively to worke on him, remembred him that herselfe for the space of nine moneths had carried him in her wombe, fed him with the substance
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:45431:221"/>
of her selfe, and for that reason he must not say her nay. Aske (saith he) good mother, some other gift of me:
<q>The losse of a mans life can be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with no benefit.</q>
And no lesse wisely did the Emperesse admonish her husband; when, without ever examining or discussing the qualitie of the crime, he was ready to pronounce the judgement of death upon a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; who, for ought he knew, might appeare innocent.
<q>O, quoth she, leave your game at Tables, and looke into the Tables of <hi>Moses,</hi> and you will finde how unjust it is to execute before you examine, to condemne before you advise.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So temperate too, were many eminent women both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, as they dis-relished nothing more than inconsiderate passion. That discreete and well-composed speech of <hi>Architas</hi> is much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who being angry with one of his Hindes, said,
<q>O how would I have beaten thee, had I not beene angry with thee!</q>
And no lesse deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving approvement was that noble Ladies assertion: "So farre aliened hitherto have my thoughts beene from any predominant distemper, as I have chused rather to give way unto death; then an indiscreet anger. Whence it was, that noble <hi>Biscoy,</hi> no lesse happy in his wives vertues, then his many victories; avouched:
<q>That though he had foiled all his assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, he could never yet foile his wives patience.</q>
Whereas, that girle was quit of all other humour, whom, when her husband found her one day, all off th' hinges; demanded of her,
<q>what had displeased her? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, because she saw nothing that could displease her.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>What excellent tempers many of their Sex have showne, if wee would insist on examples, or enlarge our discourse with varietie of instances; we might finde both our Greeke and Roman Annals stored with such choice and select flowers, as we should more easily finde arguments of admiration than imitation. For many of these acted the parts of rare Philosophers: knowing how to be silent in prosperitie, patient in adversitie, in neither of these to shew a distemper'd qualitie; in either of these to expresse motive arguments of Philosophie. In their <hi>discourse,</hi> they could argue without bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse; in their <hi>habit,</hi> goe neately without nicenesse; in the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of their affaires, live purely without affectednesse.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, sayes one, with whom thou conversest, and I will tell thee who thou art. This made them cautious with whom they consorted; lest others conversation might make them suspected. Those light examples of <hi>Iulia, Posthumia,</hi> and <hi>Semphronia</hi> deterred them from conversing with any that might corrupt them. These had not onely perused but practised that <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Proverbe: "To shut their five windowes, that their house might give light. These <hi>windowes</hi> were their <hi>senses</hi>; which, when they become most opened, the house of the mind becomes most darkened.

                     <p>Nor have their Sex showne lesse excellence in their <hi>fortitude</hi> of spirit: preferring their fame before life; their honour before the utmost extreames of death, danger or disaster.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough we have discoursed of this subject before, in our treaty of <hi>Temperance</hi>: yet to amplifie this point; wee shall finde, that there is no passion, whereto by reason of our humane frailtie we are most inclined, which we shall not observe by imitable Mirrors of this Sex to be strangely attempered, nay subdued.</p>
                     <p>And first, to begin with what worketh strongliest upon our weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: Revenge; which may reflect, by a proper and genuine division upon these three distinct objects, Life, Fame, Fortunes.</p>
                     <p>For the first, how bravely could that Noble <hi>Spartan</hi> Lady, when she was staged upon the Scaffold, to receive the stroke of death, becken to her injurious Accuser; with a mild and gracefull aspect advertise him of the wrongs he had done her: wishing him to lay his hand on his heart, and make his peace seasonably with the Gods!
<q>For my life, quoth shee, as it is of little use to the State, so I lesse prize it in regard I can benefit my Country smally by it. Trust me, I pitty more the indangering of your inward peace, then the losse of my life. This may be redeemed by an <hi>Elysian</hi> freedome; yours never to be prevented but by perpetuall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing. Indeede I lose my friends, but these are without me. But you should have a nearer friend within you, from whose sweet amitie and amiable familiaritie if you should once sever, (heare the last breathing words of a dying woman) you are lost for ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So easily did she remit that wrong which cost her life.</p>
                     <p>With what moderation did that triumphant <hi>Thomyris</hi> beare the death of her sonne! A feminine passion could not extract from her well-tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eyes one teare: nor from her resolved heart one sigh. She knowes how to shadow passion with a cloud; and immaske the designe of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge with the whitest vaile. She chuseth rather to perish in her selfe, then doe ought unworthy of herselfe. She could put on a countenance of content, when she heard how her sonne had paid to nature her debt, though in a reflexion to his youth, before his time.
<q>I was his mother, and hee is now returned to her, who is mother to us both. If I lov'd him too much while he lived with me, I will make satisfaction for that errour,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:45431:222"/>
by bemoaning his losse the lesse, now when hee has left mee.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I finde her <hi>moderation</hi> in this <hi>object,</hi> amongst all others most impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd; which I the rather here insert, because she was a rare Phoenix both in our <hi>time</hi> and <hi>clime</hi>: A woman nobly descended, richly endowed, which by her practise of pietie and workes of mercy became highly improved.</p>
                     <p>She, when she understood how passionately and disconsolately her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Husband tooke the death of his daughter whom hee infinitely loved; (for her promising infancy gave apparent arguments of succeeding maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: (made it one of her constant'st taskes to allay his passion; and by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part of a faithfull and discreet Consort, expostulates with the grounds of his immoderate sorrow in this manner:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>How is it Sir, that your wisedome should thus forget it selfe? Is it any newer thing to <hi>dye</hi> then to be <hi>borne?</hi> Are we here placed to survive fate? Or here planted to pleade a priviledge against death? Is our daughter gone to any other place, then where all our predecessours have gone to? Yea, but you will say, She dy'd in her blooming youth; before the infirmities of a decrepit age came upon her! The more was shee bound to her Maker. The fewer her yeares, the lesser her cares, the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er her teares. Take upon you then something more of man; and partake lesse of woman. These comforts which I make bold to apply to you, might be more seemingly derived to me by you.</p>
                        <p>To grieve for that which is remedilesse, argues weakenesse; and not to prevent what admits a probabilitie of cure, implies carelesnesse. Let us neither be too effeminatly weake in the one; nor too securely remisse in the other: so may wee cure the one with patience, and redeeme the other by a timely diligence.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the next <hi>Object</hi> reflecting upon their <hi>Fame: Nicetas</hi> sayes plainely, No punishment so grievous as shame. And <hi>Nazianzen</hi> yet more expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Better were a man dye right-out, than still live in reproach and shame. <hi>Ajax</hi> being ready to dispatch himselfe, used these as his last words;
<q>No griefe doth so cut the heart of a generous and magnanimous spirit, as shame and reproach.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a man to live or dye is naturall:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ambros.

And yet bravely-spirited <hi>Leonida,</hi> sleighted those Assailants of her fame with no lesse dis-respect then her foes sought to blemish it. I am more confident of my fame, said she, then to suspect how any light tongue should impeach it.</p>
                     <p>Nor was that vertuous <hi>Clareana</hi> lesse resolute, who directing her speech to her Accusers; told them;
<q>her <hi>fame</hi> was so farre distanced beyond the reach of their impeaching; as it ingenuously pittied the weakenesse of their detraction.</q>
This confirmed the resolution of that noble patron; who occasionally used these words in a grave and great assembly:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>No womans <hi>fame</hi> could priviledge it selfe from a dangerous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>For the last but least, which is <hi>Fortune</hi>: Many Heroicke spirits have we had of this Sex, who so farre dis-esteemed this <hi>outward rinde,</hi> (for no other title would they daigne to bestow on it) as one of them freely professed: "What matter is it, whether I be rich or poore, so my minde be pure? And these instances are not so rare, but we may finde another of the same
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:45431:223"/>
sex, to second so vertuous and accomplished a sister.
<q>The poorest thing on earth, is to suffer ones enlivened thoughts to be fixt on earth.</q>
And we have a third to make up a consort.
<q>She is of a weake command, who submits her thoughts to the command of fortune.</q>
And this a <hi>Quaternion</hi> of brave resolved spirits expressed, in delivering the noblenesse of their thoughts in these proper imprezes; which with their Diamonds they left writ in the panes of their owne chamber windowes: The device of the first was this:
<q>
                           <l>It is not in the power of fate,</l>
                           <l>To weaken a contented state.</l>
                        </q>
And the second scornes to fall short of her resolution:
<q>
                           <l>Fortune may sundry Engines finde,</l>
                           <l>But none to raze a noble minde.</l>
                        </q>
The third in contempt of Fortune, inlargeth this subject:
<q>
                           <l>Should Fortune me distresse,</l>
                           <l>My minde would be no lesse.</l>
                        </q>
The fourth, to shew her affection true Toutch, attests her constancy in this:
<q>
                           <l>Fate may remove</l>
                           <l>Life, but not love.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus have we showne their spritely tempers in their contempt of all oppositions that might assaile or assault them: <hi>Life</hi> they sleighted, being in competition with honour. <hi>Fame,</hi> though it was too high a prize to lose, yet being not conscious to themselves of any staine, they neglected with a gracefull scorne the irregular libertie of a loose tongue. And for <hi>Fortunes,</hi> they stood so indifferent, as they held <hi>Content</hi> their <hi>Crowne</hi>; and that <hi>Crowne</hi> the absolutest imbellishment of an infranchis'd mind.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Porphyrio,</hi> or <hi>Purple Cout,</hi> cannot endure to repaire to his nest, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he findes it stained with an adulterous foote: yet so loving is hee to his owne, as he scornes to take any unworthy revenge of his Make, but by an incessant passion of continued griefe, to weave out the web of his woes, and so dispatch himselfe.</p>
                     <p>It is reported of the Camell, that they usually hood-winke him, when at any time they bring his mother unto him: which act (observe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous hate) he no sooner knowes, then he tramples her under his feete, and kickes her to death with his heeles. So egregiously hatefull is incest, even to brute Beasts, whose native instinct abhorres such obscene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures.</p>
                     <p>Nay, to present to your eyes the spleenefull disposition of some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; who, to revenge their abused Loves, have reteined a memory above their qualitie, to expedite their intended tragedy. This might be instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that memorable example of <hi>Crathis</hi>; who dwelling in the towne of <hi>Sybaris,</hi> so monstrously, and unnaturally raged in the heate of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate lust; as on a time neglecting all humanitie, to extinguish the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent flames of his bestiall affection, came to a She-Goate, and coupled with her: which, the He-Goate as one seeing, yet reserving revenge for a fitter time, found the said <hi>Crathis</hi> one day fast asleepe: upon presentment of which opportunitie, to revenge the injury of his corrupted love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the horrour of his detested lust, hee presently fell upon him, and mall'd him to death with his hornes.</p>
                     <p>By these, you shall collect, how <hi>Myrrha</hi> never lookes better, then when <hi>Mya</hi> stands beside her: and how the preciousest Gems shew ever in the darkest places their fairest lustre.</p>
                     <p>Ladies we have here, who are so farre from a light assent, as they scorne to admit a weake assault:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>T. O.</hi>
                        </note> which confirmes the judgement of that nobly-accomplish'd, though unfortunate Gentleman:
<q>
                           <l>In part to blame is she that has beene tride,</l>
                           <l>He comes too neare, that comes to be denide.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This that noble minded Lady <hi>Armenia</hi> expressed; who being solemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to King <hi>Cyrus</hi> wedding, went thither with her husband. At night when those royall rites had beene solemnized, and they returned, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band asked her, how she liked the Bridegroome, whether upon perusall of him she thought him to be a faire and beautifull Prince or no? Truth, sayes she, I know not: for all the while I was forth, I cast mine eyes upon none other, but upon thy selfe.</p>
                     <p>Those receiving portells of her Senses, were shut against all forreigne intruders: Shee had made a morall league with her loyall eyes, to fix on no unlawfull beautie; lest her surprized eye might ingage her to folly.</p>
                     <p>Nor could these hold it to stand with their repute, either to heare, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ought that might worthily trench upon their husbands fame, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his reproach.</p>
                     <p>One of <hi>Hiero's</hi> enemies, finding nothing else in him, whereby he might revile him, or asperse disgrace upon him; reproaching him with a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath: went home and questioned his wife why she told him not
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:45431:224"/>
thereof? who answered, she thought all men had the like savour.</p>
                     <p>This confirmes that Maxim of divine <hi>Plato</hi>: The lover is ever blinded with affection towards his beloved.</p>
                     <p>But to enlighten the beautie of this Subject with one exquisite and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd example, for all; bestow your eyes upon <hi>Chiomara,</hi> wife of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giagon,</hi> a petty King of that Province, upon discomfiture of the <hi>Gallo-Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> being ravished by a Roman Captaine, gave a memorable patterne of conjugall vertue, and sponsall continency: for She cut off the fellowes head from his shoulders, and escaping from her Guard, brought it to her Lord and Husband.</p>
                     <p>We might enlarge this discourse by illustrious examples derived from the continence of those <hi>Dalmatian</hi> and <hi>Sabine</hi> Ladies: who preferred their honour before life; holding nothing in more contempt then loose love. That Princely care which <hi>Darius</hi> wife and his daughters had to preserve their highly-valued honour: and how much their care was cherished by that universall Conquerour.</p>
                     <p>And though youth matched with age, oft-times begets distracted thoughts, yet might we produce instances, not onely in the survey of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne States; but even within our native borders: how fresh-blooming youth, unequally affianced to hoary age, has borne it selfe so free from scandall, that, though they might professe themselves vestall Virgins at the funerall of their Husbands; yet so cautious were they to decline shame, as their modest thoughts scorned to incline to a prohibited embrace of sinne. Albeit, I must ever cloze in opinion with the Poet:
<q>
                           <l>There's nothing does more dully move</l>
                           <l>In fancies Orbe, then aged love.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Age then, with an ingenuous acknowledgement of his owne strength, should not fully such prime redolent blossomes with an earthy touch.</p>
                     <q>

                     <p>Thus have you heard how continent this weaker Sex has beene in their assaults: how constant in their resolves: how ready to encounter with the extreames of death and danger, rather then impaune that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gage of their honour. <hi>Love</hi> was the <hi>line</hi> by which they were directed; <hi>Fame</hi> the <hi>ayme</hi> to which they aspired: and <hi>Honour</hi> the <hi>centre</hi> wherein they closed.</p>

                     <p>But such as these, are such profest Traders in the merchandize of honour; as they merit no esteeme in the eye of goodnesse: For as these cloath their actions with habiliments of splendid sinne: so they close, for most part, their light spun Scene with apparent shame. These then, we resolve to leave behind us: addressing our penne to such vertuous patternes as are rank'd before us: And such, whose modest <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> scornes to entertaine the least acquaintance, either with <hi>scorne</hi> or too much <hi>smoothnesse</hi>; lest the one might imply <hi>pride,</hi> the other <hi>lightnesse.</hi> These cannot endure to <hi>partake</hi> of their despicable condition, who can shew an <hi>open-house,</hi> but reteine <hi>a shut count'nance.</hi> They have hospitalitie in the one, as well as the other: and to a vertuous Lover, have ever in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse a prepared harbour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I cannot remember, said that modest Matron; that I have suffer'd mine eyes to stray from me: nor to hunt after forreine Suiters, to bring them home to me. I have not ey'd that face, since I was married, which could either so take me, as to preferre it before his, who had best title to me; nor so delude me, as to beget in my thoughts a glowing fancy; and so corrupt me, by admiring a strange beauty.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>No doubt, but that princely Surveyor of his daughters dispositions, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>; could gather well enough by <hi>Iulias light lookes,</hi> as well as her <hi>loose Consorts,</hi> what received freest entertainment in her heart: as hee might, to his comfort, collect what vertuous thoughts accompanied his <hi>Livia,</hi> by observing those <hi>staid lookes</hi> and modest <hi>countenance,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd an incomparable addition on her virgin beauty.</p>
                     <p>Pietie, as it receives scandall from the countenance; and Chastity trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the eye, by conveying trecherous thoughts to the heart: so Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty runs many times on hazzard by the outward <hi>habit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All gorgeous attire is held the attire of sin. Being such as is either worne above our ranke; or by a garish and phantastick effeminacy, to introduce that broad spreading Tetter of vanity, or loosenes of folly into the State.</p>
                     <p>That simple old woman, belulled with a sleepy zeale, had a minde to goe to'th Church, purposely to take a nap: and many of our daintie ones, desire nothing more, then to goe to the Temple, to present to a deluded eye a new dresse. O the phrensie of humane vanitie, when the Sanctuary cannot plead priviledge from this selfe admiring Idolatry! It is a true position;
<q>As to lust makes one a sinner, so he falls into the same List who has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be lusted after.</q>
Modesty then, as it is the decent'st dresse for a Virgin, much more for a reverend Matron; whose demure <hi>looke</hi>; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected gate; civill <hi>habit</hi> should returne a president unto others; how to conforme themselves to the time without affectation: and how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themselves in the whole progresse of their life, as may deserve a vertuous imitation.</p>
                     <p>These, as they reteine a loyall <hi>heart</hi>: so they affect a civill <hi>habit.</hi> They have no lures for light eyes. These mould their course to the example of that religious-noble widow: Who, after the death of her truly honour'd and endeared Lord, could neither in the <hi>habit</hi> of her person; nor <hi>furniture</hi> of her Chamber, admit of any other colour, but the Sable livery of a Mourner.

And being one day demanded by a compleate Courtier; whose sense con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted most in sent, why shee would not put off that sullen-cloudy <hi>habit</hi>; seeing it was high time for her rather to thinke of a new choice, then still to confine herselfe to that disconsolate recluse.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Excellent was the Answer of that Heroick Stranger; who being asked why she addressed not herself to the <hi>habit</hi> of our countrey:
<q> Because, quoth she, I can finde no constancy in the <hi>habit</hi> of your countrey: you affect forraigne fashions so much, as it implies you dis-affect your owne: why should I then accommodate my selfe to yours, who have none of your owne?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The way then to preserve opinion is, in our choice of <hi>habit,</hi> to admire no selfe-affected fashion. We have choicer ornaments to beautifie us, then those whose outward splendour highly detracts from that inward beauty which should truly accomplish us.</p>
                     <p>Now, in our <hi>Expression of affection</hi>; which requires a great measure of discretion; we shall finde a rare temperance in the feminine Sex. These could shadow their reserved loves with a discreet secrecy: and with an absolute command of what soveraignizeth most over that Sex, decline ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent grounds of jealousie. That modest <hi>Mytilene</hi> confidently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd:
<q>That she had rather cease to live, then surcease to love: yet would she rather in exile live, then discover her exil'd love.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It argues, indeed, a modest policy, to reserve our affections to our selves; yet not so long, as to deprive us of the meanes to enjoy those whom we love equally as our selves.</p>
                     <p>Delay gives way to Corrivalls: <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> indeed, wonne by delaying, but delay seldome speeds so well in our Assay of loving: and yet, to see a declining Chrone, who had liv'd long enough to number her dayes; and whose aged furrowes had return'd a numerous Arithmeticke of expended yeares; play the wanton in a love-sicke expression, could not chuse but beget more sensible motives of derision then affection.<note place="margin">

                     <p>A woman, though she be a delicate creature, and, in her owne proper condition, of a sweet nature; yet in one respect she may be resembled to the Iuniper, which once kindled, will hardly be quenched.</p>
                     <p>No fury to be compared to the anger of a woman; which is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or attempered according to the qualitie of the wrong wherewith she holds herselfe injuried.</p>

                        <hi>Himetus</hi>; that it distreames or divides it selfe into two Channells: which send forth waters of different natures. The one is sweet and pleasing: the other brackish and dis-relishing. We may properly apply this divided Current to our present subject: by imagining a woman to this River; as she is compared in an higher Hieroglyphick, &amp; of a more enlivened nature. And in this Allusion, let us conceive these two Channells variously streaming, to those two distinct affections soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing over her, and in her severally working. These two similizing or discording passions shall borrow the names of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hate.</hi> In both which we may properly call most of our women <hi>Silla's</hi> daughters; then whom none ever shewed more <hi>love</hi> to his <hi>friend,</hi> nor more <hi>hate</hi> to his <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> And to discourse more amply of these; wee shall finde some kinde hearts dispatch their husbands by loving too much: others, meere Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the former, by loving them too little: This might be instanced in <hi>Lucia</hi> and <hi>Lucilla; Livia</hi> and <hi>Iulia.</hi> Two of these never held themselves so happy, as when their husbands were in presence; the other two ever held nuptiall love at such a distance; as they were never more disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then when they were present. Darke seem'd the house when their
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:45431:226"/>
husbands were in it:<note place="margin">

                        </note> clear'd was that Cloud, when their husbands had left it. Whereas those two other loyall Dames, exprest themselves true <hi>Theogena's</hi>; who so tender'd her <hi>Agathocles,</hi> as shee shewed admirable constancie, in her husbands greatest misery: professing her selfe most his owne, when hee was relinquish'd, and forsaken of his owne.</p>
                     <p>But this revenge, whereon wee insist in this Section; proceeds for most part from grounded jealousie, or too exuberant fancy: which will admit willingly of no Corrivall; but if it doe, the issue generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tragicall. Our Italian Theaters have at all times reeked with these bloody issues; which both in those <hi>Admirable Histories,</hi> long since pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: and in that subject entituled, <hi>Gods revenge against Murder</hi>; lately revived, and as I conceive from the former partly extracted, are copiously handled. Ancient times had their hands imbrued in these crimes. Their dye was as deepe; though their fact seem'd lesse, in regard they were not so conscientious of what they did. <hi>Hippolytus</hi> was guiltlesly murdered by a woman. <hi>Hercules</hi> poysoned by a woman. <hi>Candaules</hi> poniarded by meanes of a woman. Yet examine these in a direct line, and you shall find all these perishing through too much love. They could not inflict that torment upon their Lovers, which they themselves would not suffer, by designing themselves their owne Tormentors. Though <hi>Phaedra's</hi> love to <hi>Hippolytus</hi> were incestuously grounded; and that unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heate so impetuously enforced, as it could not be restrained, till it was with blood asswaged: yet her selfe became the sacrifice to expiate her love-sicke malice. And for <hi>Deianira,</hi> how constant she was in her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: how loyall in her love: how inviolable her vow: the Tragedian will returne you a faire account: and acquite her of all suspition, by the discovery shee made unto <hi>Nessus,</hi> of her affection. That shirt which was given her by treacherous <hi>Nessus,</hi> was intended to increase, as shee thought, a more vehement love in her <hi>Hercules.</hi> Lastly, for <hi>Candaules</hi> wife, her shamefull, and too naked discovery unto <hi>Gyges,</hi> justly expos'd his person to those miseries which he suffered: for the injury done to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, was the onely occasion to hasten his tragedy.</p>
                     <p>Now, I must confesse, wee have had in all ages savage Monsters, as well as civill Matrons. And these of <hi>Messalina's</hi> race; who would not sticke to quench the heat of their lust in the Actors blood.</p>
                     <p>Others no lesse cruell, but in their affections more loyall. And these had <hi>Servants,</hi> but they could not endure to have them reteiners to many <hi>Mistresses.</hi> This begot teares in their eyes, but stings in their hearts. Too much love quickned their revenge. Wronged Fancie transform'd it selfe into a fury. This may confirme that passionate admiration of that Heroick Tragedian:

                        <pb n="438" facs="tcp:45431:227"/>Their rivell'd skin merits not a light amorous touch: nor their rugged browes deepe-indented with aged furrowes, a gracefull looke. And the like may be said of our stale Batchelors; who are so long in chusing, and so singular in their affecting; as their affection fals into a neglect; their declining persons into a contempt. To these may that Similitude be not altogether improperly applyed: One having liberty given him to goe thorow a whole Wood, to make choice of the best staffe he could find; provided, that he chused it in his going on, but not in his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back; taking his course, and with a curious eye observing where hee might fit himselfe best: hee found many faire and streight plants that might serve his turne: but these would not content him; on hee goes still, expecting better: till comming to the end of the Wood, he found none but crooked ones to supply his choice, and of those no great change. Then, but too late, hee repented him of his too-much singularity, in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the opportunity of chusing what might give him content: and in submitting himselfe to a choice, which, in respect of those he refused, might deserve contempt.</p>
                     <p>Thus have wee discovered the grounds of those tragicke straits, which unhappy Lovers have falne into: either by matching where they did not love; or by being jealouse over those whom they did too much love; or by conceiving a mortall hate towards those, who were <hi>Corrivals</hi> in their love. Which cruelty, as it proceeded from jealousie; so that jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie sprung many times from the disloyalty of those inconstant servants, to whom they bore such intimate fancy: as may appeare more amply in this their ensuing Apology.</p>

Many of these were inflamed with such heat of love: as the Catastrophe clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as well with the losse of their owne life, as the life of their friends. Yea, could they have forgotten the injury done them by the disloyalty of their Servants: they could willingly have dispenced with that breach of faith: and expiated their guilt, with the haplesse embrace of their owne fate: Truth is, their impatience was too great, to expostulate with reason: which drove them into this fury, or phrensie of passion. And this that noble, but unfortunate <hi>Crescentia</hi> witnessed; when after such time as shee had set her affection on a disloyall Servant: and by her meanes, fortunes and favours, had highly advanced him: finding her love so meanely requited, as a strange Mistresse became entertained, where her fancy should have beene solely lodged: another, and she a light Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:45431:227"/>
harboured, where shee should have beene honoured: shee burst forth into these extreames: the issue whereof sealed the period of her love, with the forfeiture of her life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>O my <hi>Demetrius,</hi> were't not in restraint; and who did inlarge thee? Were't not hopelesse of fortunes; and who advanc'd thee? Were't not engag'd to the opposition of a powerfull foe; and who atton'd thee? Nay, were't not growne contemptible in the eyes of the lowest; and who restor'd thee? Were not thy dejected fortunes so farre distanced from hope of reliefe, as not the least beameling of comfort afforded thee redresse? Where was thy <hi>Sabina</hi> then to befriend thee? No, no, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> her light affection tooke first grounding from thy fortune, as thy fortune received birth from my too hasty loving, and too easie believing of so unthankefull a Servant. Yet shall it appeare to the World; that though my Love first issued from the Source of folly: yet even in that there appeared a loyall constancy; which, as it shall weave up the web of my <hi>fate</hi>; so shall it beare record to posterity of thy unjust breach of <hi>faith.</hi> But spinne forth no more protractive houres, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Gratiana,</hi> in expostulating with his breach: or to no purpose, in wasting thy tedious breath.</q>
                        <q>May my premature end, occasioned by my too credulous trust, become a caveat to all my sexe, to reteine more esteeme of their fame, and to be more carefull whom they trust. My indiscreet love brought me to ruine before my time: may my example bee a Memoriall to after-times, to prevent their ruine derived from such meanes: and closing their hopes with such fearefull ends.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor was her hand lesse ready to execute, then her tongue was to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. For with these words, shee closed her amorous woes:
<q>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Demetrius</hi>; and redeeme the injury thou hast done to me, in expressing thy constancie to <hi>Sabina's</hi> beauty. My best wishes shall attend thee: though thy subtilty did first wind me, then by surprizing my honour, wound me; and wounding, unthankefully leave me.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to divert from these memorable, though miserable instances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; with the wrongs they suffered by their too light credulity: wee will now descend to such particulars, wherein these censorious <hi>Timonists</hi> (whose poore degenerate spirits are ever delighted most in detracting from women, or aspersing some unworthy disgrace upon their sexe;) usurpe this liberty, to lay upon their purest reputes a lasting infamy. Wee shall in every place heare calumnious tongues too lavish in this error, and inveighing against them in this manner: What vice is there extant, which is not in the practise of women frequent? If vanity were lost, where were it to be found, but in their light bosomes? The forbidden <hi>fruit</hi> is ever in their eye: and ever dangling in their desire. Whatsoever is prohibited, is by them most affected: whatsoever by Obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, scornefully neglected. If young, they are lascivious: if old, they are covetous. Their whole life a Comedy of errors: their formall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a fardell of fashions. Alas poore Girles! Have you no <hi>Defence</hi> against such viperous tongues? When you desire to goe neat, or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your ranke, to hold your place; you are term'd proud, or ambitious. If frugall, you are covetous. If you discover your wrongs, you are malitious. If with admiration you chance to eye the fulnesse of anothers estate, you are envious. If you be sparing in your dishes, you are penurious: if choice in your dishes, you are delitious.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:45431:228"/>
If you innocently converse with a youthfull neighbour, you are streight lascivious: If you keepe home, you are lazy, or unsociably censorious: If you walke abroad, you are too liberall of your honour, and to light eyes suspitious. Nay, they will not sticke to presse this Argument yet a little further: If Goddesses themselves were wantons: what may wee thinke of the Hand-maids of those Goddesses? <hi>Dircetis</hi> that great God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of <hi>Ascalon,</hi> could be inflamed with love to a youth, who sacrificed to her: and gratifie his Oblation with a sensuall affection: yea, and close her loose love with as base a conception. 'Tis true; the Fable reports so much: yet if wee may give credit to the authority of a Poet: wee shall find this Goddesse resolving her eyes to teares: And, as one highly asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of her incontinency, exposing that adulterate Brat to the Desart: abandoning the society of that light amorous youth: and to make the Scene more fully tragicall, throwing her selfe downe into a Lake, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon <hi>Ascalon:</hi> To confirme unto the world, that if her staine were great, her sorrow was no lesse. The Harbinger of the morne, could not so soone usher in these roseat Consorts of the ensuing day: as this deluded Goddesse (If wee may grace her with such a title) offered her peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall teares to her polluted Shrine: her <hi>pleasure</hi> could not be so great, but her <hi>torture</hi> was more.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but these <hi>feminine Criticks</hi> will say; It is not enough for the youth of their sexe to glory in their growth of vanity: but even those old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarella's</hi>; whose very earthly breath divines their approaching returne to earth: as if they had perused <hi>Aesons</hi> Herball, and freely partak't of his Receipts: must assume a gracefull presence of youth; and fill up their irreparable decayes with Art-beauty: by new plaistring those crazy buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which had long since falne into the <hi>Lord Paramounts</hi> hand, for want of repaire.</p>
                     <p>Alas, is this all? If the weaker sexe deserve such reproofe, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to cover their rivals: or smoothing those rugged deformities, which their decline in nature has laid on them: what may wee thinke of those <hi>old Seniors,</hi> whose eyes have beene long since incased; and whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant aches in their bones, have beene above all other <hi>Prognostications</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: and yet these can vaile their reverend age with an artfull Peri-wigge: and court a <hi>light Piece</hi> with as much vaine Rhetoricke, as if their <hi>Winter</hi> had beene metamorphos'd into a <hi>Spring:</hi> and their <hi>silver-haires</hi> into <hi>downy blossomes</hi>!
<q>That old Blade had, no doubt, greene thoughts; who coming to a Barber to be trimm'd: and being asked by his complete Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, after what fashion hee would weare his beard whether he would looke amiable to his friend; or terrible to his foe; or point vice to his apparell? This ancient Fashion-favorite answered him, that hee would (in regard of the rarity of the cut) be trimmed <hi>point-vice</hi> to his <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</hi> Which this nimble <hi>Snap</hi> did; and that to a haire, till he had not left him one haire, to worke on: This rivell'd Scaledrake, having seene himselfe in the Glasse, durst hardly acknowledge his owne face: but terribly distemper'd hee was to see himselfe so strangely disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (which indeed might have beene prevented, if a sleepy distemper had not belulled him while he was trimmed.) Howsoever, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a stranger to himselfe, hee fell into a terrible quarter with his ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Trimmer: asking him in a cholericke manner, how he durst to abuse his face? Excuse me, Reverend Sir, said the Barber; I am but a
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:45431:228"/>
naked Trimmer, but your worship was the Director: you told mee, that you would be trim'd <hi>point-vice</hi> to your <hi>apparell</hi>; and I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your direction: for I have left your face as haire-bare, as your coat was thred-bare; and that was <hi>point-vice</hi> to your <hi>apparell.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next objection you can presse against them, is this: They are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. But tell me, can you find in all their sexe such a <hi>Midas,</hi> as to with the very meat he eate, to bee turn'd into gold? or such a passionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competible revenger, as with <hi>Silla,</hi> never to forgive, nor forget the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done him by an offender? or such a marrow-eating envious Tetter, as <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> who macerated himselfe in the prosperity of an other? or such an Idolater of honour, as <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who could not sleepe for the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition he bore to those triumphs of <hi>Miltiades?</hi> or such a Glutton, as <hi>Cambletes,</hi> who dreaming hee had devour'd his wife; as before, no dainties could asswage his hunger, he became his owne executioner, for feare of dishonour? or such a Catamite, as that <hi>Bithinian</hi>; who was a woman for all men; and a man for all women: an equall <hi>agent</hi> or <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> to satisfie nature? or such a lazie lollard as <hi>Margites</hi> was; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver digged, ploughed, nor sowed, nor ever did any good all his life long in the least weight or measure: but slept out his time in a sluggish, and uselesse manner?</p>
                     <p>But some will againe object; None can deny but they are light in their favours; changeable in their fancies: The <hi>posies of their Love-rings,</hi> ever hold check with this Impreze: "<hi>Our choice admits a change.</hi> No, no; you shall find their disposition of a more choice and constant temper. For should they imitate our wanton free-natur'd youths, who having lately enter'd <hi>Loves-lists,</hi> and brought some shreads of their fathers unnecessary providence to passe the <hi>Alienation office</hi>; you might find them accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with Myriads of amorous servants.

<q>Wooing, said that Arabian, was but a lovely seeking: now wee seeke not for that wee have, but what we have not.

It is for him then to seeke it; who, though hee may not have it: yet he seekes to enjoy her who has it.</q>

                     <p>Againe, will some say: but why were all the <hi>Furies</hi> women; those three <hi>fatall Sisters</hi> women; those <hi>Circean Witches</hi> women; those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Sirens</hi> women? Did not the first imply their cruelty? The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond their implacability? The third their impiety? The fourth their subtilty? And with these you might insert that late <hi>Chimera</hi> of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hog-fac'd Gentlewoman of <hi>Wirkham:</hi> all alike probably true, and credibly built upon equall grounds. But to answer these prodigies of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Tell me, yee <hi>Critick Cavallieres,</hi> who have surely got a stroak over shins with some <hi>French faggot,</hi> or you would never thus inveigh against so exquisite a subject; why were all the <hi>Muses</hi> women; all the <hi>Sibyls</hi> women; those watchfull <hi>Hesperides</hi> women; those <hi>Nine-Worthies,</hi> so lately memoriz'd, women?</p>
                     <p>Surcease then, and close with me in their <hi>modest Defence</hi>; If you see in them any lightnesse, impute that to their weaknesse. Againe, if you see in them that composednesse, which best becomes them: account that in them a reall goodnesse. Sweet sociable soules they are, when <hi>Grace</hi> conducts them. The path they walke in, is chalked forth by modesty: the track they pursue, is the practise of piety: where the period of so gracefull a Scene, closeth ever with felicity.</p>
                     <p>None ever but those proud Pharisees, who us'd to weare <hi>philacteries,</hi> and Ceremoniall <hi>philanties</hi> on their browes and elbowes, were knowne to winke at the approach of women: And may such winke still; who, though they have <hi>sealed eyes,</hi> they may have <hi>seeing hearts.</hi> For though <hi>desire</hi> come in by the <hi>Windowes:</hi> yet some mens <hi>Windowes</hi> may seeme to be shut, when the doores of their <hi>desires</hi> are open. <hi>Fancy</hi> may play the wanton within, while Modesty seemes to play the Goaler without.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you heard their <hi>Modest Defence:</hi> and how calumnious pens and tongues are ever most vers'd in traducing innocence. Where if a woman be demure, she is taxt of coynesse; if courteous, she is taxt of lightnesse; Affability and Disdaine equally ingage her to a rigid censure: yet for all this, pure minds cannot be so amated: nor goodnesse, which reteines with her an inseparable witnesse, so eclypsed. The Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in his fullest beauty, when hee breaks forth of a cloud. So vertue, when she has dispell'd those malignant vapours which interpos'd her, shewes her selfe then in her clearest feature. This in those divine <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms,</hi>
                        <pb n="443" facs="tcp:45431:229"/>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom these, no doubt, but the best principles of humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have derived their being and beginning. But as the best fruits are soonest corrupted, the earliest bloomes quickliest blasted; so have our choicest <hi>Maxims</hi> of this nature lost much of their lustre, by being diverted from that Object whereat they aymed. Pure Rils should not bee so corrupted, by giving way to such troubled or brackish <hi>Inlets</hi> as dis-relish the purest water, in making it quite degenerate from its owne primitive nature.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Aphorismes</hi> there bee (if they may merit that style) which lose much of their state, and detract too much from their light, by their too weake discovery of an <hi>Anacreonticke</hi> straine; which generally makes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene <hi>Pasquils</hi> of serious <hi>Apothegms.</hi> But these are not worth our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: It shall be our taske, to avoid distaste; by laying before you those witty <hi>Aphorismes, Apothegms,</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi>; the perusall whereof may afford both delight and profit; the one to cheare you, the other to store you: whensoever any occasion of such discourse shall be ministred to you.</p>
                     <p>That noble Lady, though her <hi>descent</hi> and <hi>fortunes</hi> might fixe her above an inferiour Spheare, shewed excellent arguments of a composed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and an humble nature in this resolution:
<q>As my descent exacts of me a tender eye to my reputation: so should my example be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident to others of imitation. For those, who commit any unseemely act in a publike presence, doe as much as lye in them, to murder those who take observance of them. My <hi>gate</hi> shall not publish me proud: nor my <hi>habit</hi> phantastick: For I find nothing in me, worthy such idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Sicilian Matron closed her content with an incomparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World; who publikely protested,
<q>That shee could eye nothing in this Theatre of earth, that might seeme worthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine so divine a Guest as her soule. And as of a finite to an infinite, there was no proportion: so it was impossible, that the circumference of earth should confine that infinite beauty of the soule to her dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That moderne Mirror of true nobility exprest her selfe a brave Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignesse over her affections: who held it the greatest derogation to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine honour, to discover the least distemper in subjects of anger.
<q>When I take a serious survey, said shee, of mine owne infirmity: and re-collect daily what cause I give my Maker to be angry with me: I am halfe ashamed to expresse my passion of anger to any. Can <hi>he</hi> forbeare me who made me; and cannot I forbeare them who are equall in their creation with me? Cannot poore dust containe it selfe in patience with dust, when <hi>he</hi> can shew his gracious patience to ambitious dust, who made all of dust?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="444" facs="tcp:45431:230"/>No lesse composednesse of Spirit did that heroick Parisian discover in her desire to see others flourish without repining: Yea, wishing with that divine Morall;
<q>That all envious persons had their eares and eyes seated in all Cities, that with others prosperities, being the proper objects which they most maligned, these, in the survey of them, might be more tormented.</q>
Nor is that noble attestation of hers to be here omitted; deserving so well in lasting Characters with the point of a Diamond to be inscribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I doe not see my Neighbours field flourish, but I wish it were more fruitfull; nor any one honoured, but I wish it amplifi'd, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be desertfull; nor any of my sexe beautifull, but I conceive joy in so faire a feature, being inwardly gracefull. It is an argument of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile quality, to dart an envious eye on anothers prosperity. If hee be rich, and worthy of what he possesseth, much good may it doe him; If unworthy of what hee enjoyeth; it were a malitious pitty to envie him, having within him what will undoe him. He is already seazed of such a Marrow-eating Tetter, as this festred Vlcer needs no other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A good proficient in the Schoole of vertue, had that Theban Lady pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; who held nothing so pretious as a <hi>continent Soule:</hi> vowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
<q>That, should shee find in her bosome a thought of incontinence; if it were possible, shee would estrange her selfe from an harbour of such lightnesse. Neither could that brest reteine any impression of shame, that could present a sacrifice of love to any, but her husbands shrine: Clozing her resolves with this divine impreze:</q>
                        <q>As my hand has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the gift of my heart: so shall the loyaltie of my heart confirme the testimony of my hand.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>When that princely Dame of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> had heard of those luscious and licentious feasts of <hi>Domenico Silvio,</hi> that <hi>Italian Cleopatra</hi>;
<q>Good God (said she) has not the flesh foments enough, but it must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, to the utter ruine of that <hi>divine part</hi> which should command it?</q> This is not to with-draw fuell from a flaming desire, but to feed it: and by feeding, famish that injuried Guest which suffers for it.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Alas! woman is not so strong, as to have all meanes diverted, by which her modesty might bee preserved: and to unrivet all those ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative secrecies of Art, by which their Forts of honour may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. The wanton Idumite is already too stirring; shee needs no fresh fuell to feed her affection.</p>
                        <p>It is strange, said the pious <hi>Edessa,</hi> that wee should so cast about by Sea and Land to feed those, who will feed upon us: and to throw forth baits to those, who meane to make a prey of us.</p>
                        <p>I never fare better, said that sage abstemious Lady, then when I seeme to fare worst. Abstinence is such a choice receipt, as it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no sensuall deceipt. What can delude me, so long as I make my appetite subject to Reasons soveraignty.</p>
                        <p>There is no day so tedious, said that discreet Consort, to a grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour, as that which is made a stranger to any taske. That Sun shall not shine on me: nor that place entertaine me, which shall not receive some argument of life from me. For better were it for me by dying to cease from living: then by living unprofitably to be ever dying. For my part, in all this continued <hi>Chesse-game</hi> of our life, I shall ever hold

him or her the greatest looser, who riots forth the rich treasure of time in fruitlesse pleasure: for, as the deepest staine to an active spirit is <hi>Sloath</hi>; so the greatest griefe that can befall an improving man, is his losse of time.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>It is rare likewise to observe what excellent Rules they not only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto others; but what they themselves reteined, that their owne exemplary life might publish to the world, they taught not others what themselves neglected: nor imparted by way of precept unto others those Lessons which they sleighted.</p>

What incomparable creatures these feminine Mirrors have showne themselves, even in these offices of <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,</hi> would this briefe <hi>Epitome</hi> give mee leave, I could here amply illustrate with many, both ancient and moderne Instances: where you might find some even reproving their Emperours for remisnesse of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in shewing too much lenity: or taxing their severity of justice, in their inflicting on easie delinquents too much cruelty. With instances of this sort our Roman and Greeke Annals are so plentuously stored, as this Subject shall little need to be further illustrated.<note place="margin">

And well might many of their pious resolves cloze in such conclusions: when they so divinely considered,<note place="margin">

                     <p>It seemes those three gentlemen, as if they had beene <hi>Trium-viri</hi> in
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:45431:232"/>
their fruition of this happinesse, could returne sufficient arguments of their Mistresses abilities in this kind: While one making choice of this Posy, expressed the absolutenesse of his choice in the neatnesse and elegancy of her discourse; which hee recommended to the impressure of his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in a Window:
<q>
                           <l>My choice is one, whose accents beare such weight,</l>
                           <l>As all discourses else to mee seeme light.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These lines when another Gentleman had perused; as one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd himselfe no lesse enriched by his choice; seconds the former in this manner, by engraving this Impreze to his Mistresse honour:
<q>
                           <l>Single's my choice, yet with her cheered am I,</l>
                           <l>As if that single conference were many.</l>

                     <p>The third nothing short in his Conceipt, of the like beauty, and for subjects of <hi>Discourse</hi> no lesse moving in the care of Fancy, to publish to the world that hee tender'd his deserving Mistresse no lesse affection, with a more enlivened or mounting invention, closed his opinion he reteined of her in this commendation:
<q>

                        </note>Such as these may wee well hold, with that eminent Statist, for <hi>old mens Nurses,</hi> and <hi>young mens Mistresses.</hi> Should their youthfull prime en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine by an enforced injunction a frosty Consort: their vertuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is such, as their enforced choice must admit no change. <hi>Euryala</hi> was never more obsequious to tender <hi>Ithacus,</hi> then these will expresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their decrepit husbands. Their disparity in yeares must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in their affections any disloyaltie of thoughts. Though they be <hi>young Brides,</hi> they will performe the offices of <hi>old Nurses.</hi> Their care must extend it selfe, instead of amorous embraces, to preserve health in their declining husbands: which they addresse themselves to with no lesse ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, then if they had beene matched to persons of more vigorous quality. These have made a league with their eyes; that they shall be no betrayers of their hearts. As it was their doome to marry unequally, and to bestow their Virgin youth on meere patients engaged to each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: so they have vowed solely to observe them; constantly to love them; peaceably to live with them: and amidst all overtures so to beare with their infirmities, as no peevish humour of age shall distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them: nor any groundlesse jealousie suggest to their revenge an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to wrong them. And this their Observance must not proceed from any by-respect; as many cautelous younglings doe; who usully accommodate themselves to their perverse husbands humour, with hope of a day to come after. Their affections are pure without dissembling; their care constant without projecting; their desires addrest to please without humoring.</p>
                     <p>Others wee shall find of their sexe, fit to be <hi>young-mens Mistresses</hi>;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:45431:232"/>
And these no lesse modestly pleasing, then vertuously affecting: These can stand upon their points without apish nicenesse: and hold their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance without a squeamish precisenesse.</p>
                     <p>They can love without fonding; ingratiate themselves without faun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Neate they desire to goe without phantasticknesse; Sweetly can they converse without affectednesse; These hold it a feminine madnesse to pride themselves in that, which stript their Predecessors of their purest state. These reflect upon <hi>Eve</hi> with a teare-swolne eye; and in a retired contemplation, and recollected affection, present her Image to their well-composed thoughts: And this they make their <hi>Diarie</hi> to the end it may worke upon their imaginations more effectually. O was not <hi>Eve</hi> created in her <hi>will</hi> free and innocent; in her <hi>reason</hi> sage and prudent; in her <hi>command</hi> strong and potent? And what deprived her of so blest a condition, but an indisposed heat of ambition? Had her thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd themselves to the lists of her present state, shee had never throwne upon her posterity such a surviving staine. O had shee beene content with what shee was, her sexe had never beene so miserable as it is. Her ambition became our perdition: Her pride our ruine. They sigh to see their sexe so vainely magnifi'd; to heare them with <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Worthies</hi> dignifi'd; to have their <hi>Portratures</hi> in such magnificent manner beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd; These they sleight with more religious contempt, then ever the victorious <hi>Vtican</hi> did the erection of his statue; being no embellishment, as hee accounted it, to the essence of vertue.</p>
                     <p>Well deserving a succeeding memory was that Motto:
<q>I did never in any thing to my selfe arrogate,<note place="margin">In nullo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam arrego, in quo mihi non derogo.</note> wherein I did not from my selfe derogate.</q>
And such is the modesty of these patterns of piety, as they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have their commendable actions too much observed, or publickly applauded, lest by hearing themselves praised, they might incurre vaine-glory, and so become deluded.</p>
                     <p>Their constant nuptiall Impreses, or Loves loyall Posies were these:

                     <p>Such as these famous Mirrors shall wee occasionally encounter withall, in our Readings: Who, though they were Ethnicks borne, reteined in them such impressions of morall goodnesse: as their memory left an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to posterity; being so much more to be admired, in regard those times wherein they flourished, were with mists of pagan ignorance clouded.</p>
                     <p>These desired to doe well, and not to be applauded; to advance ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and not to have their names recorded: nor their amiable features with glorious <hi>Frontispices</hi> impaled.

But well did those two Conceipts cloze, and in Creatures of this pettish and perverse humour ingeniously meet: While one, having had his handfull, no doubt, of such a wilde one, wrote these two lines with his Diamond in the Chamber Window of his disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peat:</p>

                     <p>Nor is this <hi>Conjugall Office,</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> restrained only to this limitation. As your affection is to be constantly continent to their <hi>Bed:</hi> so are you to be affably pleasant at <hi>Board.</hi> I have observed a strange kind of imperious and domineering soveraignty in some <hi>Husbands</hi>; who held it a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of State to insult over their wives: Nay, to be marvellously discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what dishes soever were served; to catch at offence, and to relish nothing better, than to discountenance those, whose desires were levelled only to please.

fortified his virile spirits, with soveraigne Receipts, against the invasive power of all poyson, as he could performe the part of a true Philosopher, in smiling upon affliction; and receiving all distastes with so composed a brow, as hee wondred much how any motives of anger should in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall soule beget the least distemper.</p>
                     <p>For, whosoever he be that in resemblance of this Morall Mirrour of admirable patience, can in <hi>Prosperity</hi> be <hi>silent,</hi> and not transported; in <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, patient,</hi> and not amated; in neither of these distempered; in either of these Philosophically composed; scornes to ingage his more airy thoughts, to an un-manly passion: having already sphear'd them in an higher mansion.</p>
                     <p>In the very same Scene, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> are you interessed; wherein should you fall short, or in the least measure defective: Most part of all our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators eyes are fixed on you, whose censure will prove as quick sighted, as your errour; accounting you unworthy those brave parts bestowed on you, because mis-acted by you.</p>
                     <p>Entertaine these then, to whom you are espoused, with a free, and no servile affection. Waine them from passion, if at any time they become ingaged to any, rather with a pleasing smile, then a daring frowne: for the former partakes more of an awfull soveraignty, then cheerfull fancy. The way to preserve in any family a sweet consorting, and concording harmony, is never to have the Master and Mistris of the house, at one time angry. Let the sweetnesse of the one allay the sharpenesse of the other.</p>
                     <p>It was an excellent resolution, which that <hi>Laconian</hi> Lady ever reteined:

Are you conceited, that shee whom you have married, is endowed with a sufficient measure of discretion to governe a Family: and without just exception can propose to her selfe, with those recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to her charge, rules of good Huswifery? Doe not intermixe your care with her charge. The disposall of a <hi>Daery,</hi> is more proper for a <hi>Mistris</hi> than a <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Family.</hi> Strong and manly Offices become the Man; soft and delicate the Woman. Nor is there any intrusion lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming then this; nor ought that more exasperates the spirit of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then to have her care suspected, or her charge interposed by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; either through a jealousie of her care, neglect of her charge, or disability to manage any such charge. Those two honest Rurall Lovers, though their estates were but meane, their quality obscure, their place of habitation poore; yet knew they how to distinguish their cares, by a fit addressement of themselves to their peculiar charge.<note place="margin">

                     <p>In a word, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as you have more generous imployments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine you, more improving cares and studies to entertaine you: so have you more imitable Patterns to propose unto you, what may infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you. Eagle spirits cannot stoop to low lures. Reflect upon your family; and by your faire examples, informe your Posterity. Leave to your noble <hi>Consorts,</hi> the care and charge of what best suits with their sex: Imploy your selves in what may better correspond with your state. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hands mixed in these, will rather redound to your prejudice, then profit; disparagement, then credit. As you have made your choyce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to that choyce her peculiar charge: this will heighten the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your discretion, and raise an addition to her care.</p>
                     <p>Thus if you shall demeane your selves to your well-disposed <hi>Consorts</hi>; you shall find them ready, with chaste and cheerfull bosoms, to receive you; with affable, and affectionate lookes to entertaine you; with sweet inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent smiles to enchaine you: For, so constantly united unto you shall bee their love, as they will hold it their highest terrestriall happinesse, there to plant where you love: your danger shall become their greatest terrour; your safety their gracefullest honour. For, as it shall be the fullest period of their joy to enjoy you: so shall it be accounted by them their dis-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionatest Scene of griefe to forgoe you. Nor shall you need any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to memorize their love, then those sweet joyes they conceive in your life, those sincere teares they sacrifice at your death.</p>

This was an excellent patterne to imitate! When no Object could so take her eye, as to convey the least impression of deluding fancy to her heart.
<q>There is small doubt, but those experimentall Maxims hold constantly currant: That the very state and composure of the mind is to be seene in the cariage and posture of the body: And that by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture and composition of the body, is to be discovered the quality, and disposition of the mind.</q>
So as, were one as cunning in his carriage, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in his; who could walke in the Clouds to his friends; and with pretended glozes delude his foes: Or as subtile, as that Apostate <hi>Iulian,</hi> whom <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> called a <hi>Chamelion,</hi> because hee could change himselfe into all shapes and colours: or as crafty as <hi>Herod An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipas,</hi>

                     <p>Ambition cannot walke so privately, nor retyre her selfe from the eyes of men so cunningly, nor deceive a weake eye so much with a seeming Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: but some action or other will draw out to life his Anatomy, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> may walke in the night, and have none but the Moone and Stars to be his Spectators; yet for all this, there be such observing Spies and Pioners within him, as the night cannot bee so darke, nor his retired thoughts so close, but humane eyes may see him; and discover too the necessitie of his walke: for they find by his discontented looke, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious gate, that <hi>Miltiades</hi> triumph will not suffer him to sleepe: So as, no sooner doe his inward thoughts betray him, then his outward eyes display him: Every trifling action becomes his Discoverer; every weake passion or broken fancy breaths forth the quality of his distemper.</p>

And in exchange of such friendly Consorts, entertaine society with light fantastick spirits, from whom no other profit can bee derived, then what Vanity hath suggested, and the conceit of a deluded fancy hatched.

                        <q>O my deare <hi>Quintianus,</hi> whence may these distempers grow? you had a <hi>Iuliana,</hi> I must confesse, a Consort well deserving your choice; and because your now espoused <hi>Chariclea</hi> supplies her place, doth it repent you of your change? And yet, me thinkes, should you recollect your selfe, and in an equall scale weigh your <hi>Chariclea's</hi> love, you would hold it an ungratefull guerdon, to requite her loyall love with a distastefull looke. Your first choyce was faire, incomparably faire, of a gracefull presence, perswasive language! It is confess'd. Yet knew this Abstract of perfection, to break forth into passion. But she knew her owne worth, so as passion lodging in such a Subject, might admit an easie dispensation; and make that <hi>Eagernesse</hi> appeare a <hi>Vertue</hi> in her; whereas even <hi>Mildnesse,</hi> seated in so imperfect a Peece as my selfe, may present it selfe like a <hi>Vice,</hi> being shrouded with so meane a Cover! Beleeve it Sir, as Nature has bestowed little on me, to make me proud; relinquish me for ever, if my respect to honour shall not supply those defects of a more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site feature: your anger shall not beget in me the least distemper; but, if at any time I be moved, it shall be, because you are discontented. Have you occasion to rejoyce? I shall increase it. Have you cause to grieve? I shall allay it. Should you in any extremity suffer, I should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing more then to become your sharer. Many, very many might you have had, more rich in portion, more choice in proportion, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any more true in her affection. In one word; as there is no office in <hi>Chariclea,</hi> which shall not bestow it selfe to <hi>Quintianus</hi> honour, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life: so may it be <hi>Quintianus</hi> goodnesse to accept the loyall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of her devoutest love.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Conjugall protest wrought so impressive an effect in her too pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate Husband; as, recollecting his dis-joynted affections, he became so truly inamoured of his <hi>Choyce,</hi> as the conceit of her imparallel'd vertues estranged his resolves, not onely from the least apprehension of a future <hi>Change:</hi> but fairely attemper'd in him all Motives of choller; so as, it was rare to find in him upon any occasion whatsoever, any appearance of distemper, much lesse of any inconsiderate anger. There is no doubt but grounds of distaste may be easily suggested; especially, where either <hi>Iealousie,</hi> arising from an exuberance of fancy; or an intended desire to displease, workes upon the conceit of the party. But admit, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> your eyes and eares were so strongly possest of your injuried Bed, as you may visibly perceive a breach and violation of that faith, which by a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred vote, should in reason and religion have admitted no blemish unto death: yet if you shall find a relenting disposition in them, doe not ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate your wrongs by too bitter an expression of them. The confession of a wrong should beget in you an indulgent smile; yea, though a modest

shame could not brooke to make too open a discovery of what loosenesse of folly had committed; yet, though never so covertly shrouded, being with a resolved contrition closed, and not hypocritically cloathed, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be ingenuously remitted. This might be in him instanced, who desirous by a line to discover the irregularity of his life, brought in a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Monument to witnesse unto the world the relenting guilt of a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull delinquent.</p>

One thing I am to advise you of, which observed, may prevent many occasions of distaste, which are usually ministred. As I formerly advertised your Husbands, not to intermedle in those feminine imployments, which concerne your charge: so be it your modesty to decline from those interesses, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly admit their care. It is an hatefull thing, saith that devout Father, to see a Man practise the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and a Woman to handle the <hi>Speare.</hi> You have peculiar offices equally designed; let them not bee improperly mixed. That <hi>Roman</hi> was much condemned for imparting secrets of state to his wife; but his wife was more publikely taxed for laying downe grounds how to rectifie the state to her Husband. This is a presuming evill, and too largely spreading, said that Cinick, to bee cured, till selfe-conceit, by a timely reproofe, be rebaited. Humility is the way to prevent it: for though Pride be a dangerous mate to accompany man: yet it is never so domineering, as when it pleads for Soveraignty in a womans mind. Remember then that divine Mandat; it will be a meanes to calme it:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note>

                     <p>This will make your Husbands to second what a Noble Gentleman sometimes pronounced in testimony of his good fortune, and approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his choyce: Who, as it was long before hee married, so did much happinesse crowne his expectance, after such time as hee was espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the way then, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> to ingratiate your selves in their bosoms with whom you live, and whom onely you are entirely to love; to make a contract betwixt your <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> when at any time you goe abroad, or are admitted to any necessary visit: that your eyes may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come treacherous <hi>Tarpeia's</hi> to your hearts. Nor suffer any intrusive thought to enter, that may incroach upon your honour. For it is no lesse errour to have a desire to be sought by others, then to seeke after others. To cast out deluding eyes, and, like subtile Falconers, with light deceiving lures, to seaze on amorous fooles; which howsoever it imparadise them, it cannot chuse but highly disparage you. For <hi>speaking eyes</hi> are such <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Orators,</hi> that though they allure others to folly, they ever ingage themselves most to apparent misery.</p>
                     <p>But your discreet moderation ha's taught you a better Lesson; your thoughts are impatient, in giving reines to any such diversion. One Sun is but for one Spheare; one Diadem for one Head; and one Conjugall Embrace for one Bed; this best becomes you, this crownes you. This, as it confirmes your loyall love, while you are living: so will it leave a memory of your goodnesse at your dying:<note place="margin">

                     <p>To prevent this malady (too Epidemicall in most places) be it your principall care to prepare such Tutors for them, as may instruct them in the Principles of divine and humane Learning: And by their incessant diligence, so enable them, as they may taste a sweetnesse in those Sciences they have learned. For the onely reason of his neglect, or remissenesse in Arguments of Knowledge, is their deficience in Knowledge. For did they but understand the sweetnesse of Learning, they would preferre the incomparable delight of one houres study, before a myriad of houres im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in vanity. That brave <hi>Picene</hi> had arrived, no doubt, at this port;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45431:247"/>
who, though his Descent was noble, his Revenues ample, and his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pleasure many; yet hee ingenuously protested, that the least graine of Philosophy, which either his Tutors industry, or his owne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity had purchased him, was of more weight in his scale, than all the revenues that were left him. Truth is, as youth is most docile to learne, so it is many times most facile to erre. And because diverse and sundry are the dispositions, with which our <hi>Masters</hi> are to encounter: so there is required in them; a free and plenteous measure of discretion, to the end they may accommodate their discipline to every ones disposition.<note place="margin">The highest point of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in a School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, is to find out the disposition of his Scholler.</note> Some natures they shall find sweet and affable; others rough and intractable.

He deserves not to be a Master, whose discretion applyes not it selfe to the disposition of his Scholler. Neither is our discourse only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Arguments of Learning. I am not ignorant how children descending from one root, may differ in the quality of their mind. Some are not capable at Schoole, who may shew themselves sufficient for a trade. As you then shall find your children disposed, be it your care to have them so bestowed: as neither your too much indulgence may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their improvement: nor your too remisse care beget in them a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their advancement. For youth, as it may become depraved by too much cockring, so may it be nipped in the bud, and consequently too much discouraged, by too rigid a curbing.</p>
                     <p>Be it then your prime care to lay a faire foundation: and to give them such accomplishment by a generous Education, as their very posture may confirme them branches of honour: Scorning to appeare in that designe, that may in the least manner derogate from their place, or lay a blemish on their blood. If thou beest <hi>Cato's</hi> sonne, said that brave Roman, doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unworthy of <hi>Cato's</hi> Father. This Patterne, but in a more divine imitation, should all children reteine in their memory: to prove unto the world, that they are true native Scienes derived from such a Family: from whence, as they received their birth, so they labour to improve it by presenting good examples upon this Theatre of earth.</p>
                     <p>O if inconsiderate youth did but know, what precious time it bestowes in trifling vanity;<note place="margin">Inconsiderate youth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the fruitlesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time a meere pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime.</note> as in dedicating those first houres of the day, in cris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping those wanton love-lockes; in cerussing and repairing a decayed beauty, by idolatrizing themselves in the reflexion of a flattering Glasse; by composing an adulterate countenance, purposely to induce fancy; and, like wanton <hi>Dalilah,</hi> to rob deluded man of his strength by their lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous folly! Againe, how it bestowes the after-noone in needlesse visits, Immodest Objects, light presentments; but scarcely reserves one minute, after so many mis-spended houres, for workes of devotion! O, I say, would youth but lay these to his heart, and cloze the period of his thoughts with this short expostulation: <hi>O what have I done</hi>! Hee would returne no doubt with the poore penitent Prodigal, and acknowledge his sinne; Hee would feed no longer on the husks of vanity; nor goe astray, any more in those by-paths of folly. He would returne, I say, with the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> truly mourning; bestow the remainder of his dayes in repenting: and desire no longer to live after he desisted from that pious resolution, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45431:247"/>
had so wholly possessed him, as it had left no hope for vanity to seize on him. Now to perfect this good worke, let it be the especiall care of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> to educate their children religiously, to season their infancy with Principles of Piety. For there is nothing that makes elther youth or age more wavering in points of Religion (next temporary respects, which too often times coole divine effects) then ignorance in the grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Now, as it is the office of <hi>Parents</hi> to plant them in it: so is it their duty to suffer no temporall respect to decline them from it.

                        </note>It is reported, that towards the North-west part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there is an Iland so temperate, or by some miraculous influence so indowed, as when any Inhabitant there becomes worne with age; or so enfeebled, as their life becomes an affliction: so tedious their houres; so fastidious their yeares; their Children or Friends must remove them out of that place, before they can dye. Whether there be any such enlivening Ile or no, I shall leave to the credit of the Relater: but I much feare mee, there be many remorcelesse Friends, and gracelesse Children, who would find ready hands to remove those <hi>eye-sores</hi> from that Iland; long before such times as any such decrepit age seized on them: desiring rather to enjoy their present fortunes then the presence of their persons. But such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature hopes resolve themselves into weake helpes: for where Sonnes are sicke of the Father, or Daughters of the Mother, they generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease no lesse in the prosperity of their estate, then quality of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Now, as <hi>Masters</hi> challenge to themselves a power to command: so are they to have discretion in knowing what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. In some cases, <hi>Servants</hi> may more conscionably dis-obey, then obey the commands of their <hi>Masters.

Lawfull things only, as they are by <hi>Masters</hi> to bee commanded; so are they with all alacrity by <hi>Servants</hi> to be obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Now to walke in such a faire a smooth path of commanding; as neither the <hi>Master</hi> may erre in the exhibition of his commands: nor the <hi>Servant</hi> shew himselfe remisse in observing what is commanded: the <hi>Master</hi> is to decline two <hi>extreames</hi>; the neglect whereof many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets either a <hi>contempt</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> in the <hi>Master:</hi> an <hi>insolence</hi> or <hi>remissenesse</hi> in the <hi>Servant.</hi>

That indiscreet act of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Pollio</hi> could deserve no lesse then an extreame censure; who, as one stript of humane nature, could so intemperately tyrannize over his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as to cause one to bee cast into a <hi>Fish-pond</hi> for breaking a Glasse, What an excellent rigid Master would this man have beene for our lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and spritely Gallants, who cannot present an <hi>Health</hi> to their britle <hi>Venus,</hi> without the breach of a <hi>Venice Glasse?</hi>

                     <p>Now, there be many <hi>Masters,</hi> who with <hi>Zimri,</hi> by seeking their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> lose themselves. These are so glued to the world, as they verily think the world has not enough mould to give every one an handfull. They never looke upon the wheele (for such Emblemes are farre from them) which in its motion has ever the least part or portion of all his proportion

upon the ground. Earth receives the least part of it; whereas earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes the most of their heart. These, though they reteine the title of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> are in their condition poorer then the lowest of their <hi>Servants.</hi>

So as, such miserable wretches as these, who are only rich in having, but poore in enjoying, want no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to discover the quality of their slimy nature, but that Epitaph or Inscription which was addressed for one of the like temper, and in this manner:

                     <p>It is farre better to possesse little, and enjoy it: then by possessing much, to be estranged from the enjoyment of it. These, as they are ever their owne Tormentors: so they for most part leave few Mourners, but fat Executors. I have observed many of these rigid and severe <hi>Masters,</hi> suited with the very sluggisht and sloathfull'st <hi>Servants.</hi> Such, as though they pretended diligence in their <hi>Masters</hi> sight, it was, but <hi>eye-service</hi> at the best: For their <hi>Masters</hi> absence gave them an easie dispensation with Conscience. Their seeming labour must then turne loyterer; their late distemper'd rest into a shady repose or plenteous repast. Such as these will be the aptest for taking up those words of that malapert Servant in the Gospel:<note place="margin">Luke 12.45.</note> 
                        <hi>My Master doth deferre his comming.</hi> Hee resolves therefore to take advantage of time; and to play the <hi>Commander</hi> in the absence of his <hi>Master.</hi> Where, like an imperious Censor, he begins to <hi>smite the servants, and maidens, and to eate, and drinke, and to be drunken.</hi> These are many times the fruits of parcimonious <hi>Masters:</hi> who, by tasking their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> too strictly: or by deteining from them what they are to render them in equity; either make them dissolute, or some other way desperate: whereof wee have such daily examples, as their too insulting command have brought many timorous <hi>Servants</hi> to a fearefull end. The like may be spoken of <hi>domineering Mistresses</hi>; who make their correction of their <hi>Maids,</hi> their sole recreation. And these for most part, are of that tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, as they will not afford a competence to their Family, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themselves to famine amidst of plenty. These, as they live without love, so they generally dye without teares. Their excessive care to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a posterity, as it expos'd them to an indiscreet parcimony; so it ever closed their memory with an incompassionate Elegy.

And to expresse your selves the better in the performance of this duty, let not such taskes nor imployments as are injoyned you, be done perfunctorily or remissely, but cheerfully, and with all alacrity.

                        <note place="margin">Eph. 6.5.</note> Whence you may collect, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of obedience without reverence and sincerenesse can purchase no acceptance. Let it bee your principall care to reteine a memory of your highest Master: by which you shall learne to performe those offices to his honour, which are recommended to your charge; and in the evening of your service, amply remunerate your care. <hi>Iacob,</hi> because hee did the duty of a carefull servant,<note place="margin">The duty of a servant to his Master, will make a servant an happy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> became a Master of dutifull Servants.</p>

Let not your Masters presence be the sole motive to your diligence: but when hee is farthest divided from you, addresse your imployments as if hee were present with you. Let no wandring <hi>thoughts</hi> distract you: as you are seated in a vocation, you must not suffer it to admit of the least distraction. This has made too many Labourers mighty Loiterers, by suffering their <hi>thoughts</hi> to wander amidst those interesses of their labour.

The sloathfull man is the Divels shop; there hee workes, ever most busie when men are lazie; ever intentivest when men are securest. For as mans extremity is Gods opportunity, such is his piety: So the Divels opportunity is mans security, such is his policy.

As you are then injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by a strict Covenant tyed; neglect no time wherein you may in a conscionable way render unto your Master an usefull account of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. And as this is required at your hands; so let this bee done with cheerfull hearts. For where alacrity accompanies any good, or pious action, it argues a sincere previous intention: which indeed, is the Crown of every action. For good actions may be ill done, either by being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their doing, or by being not intended before they were done. You are then to performe your labours with <hi>singlenesse of heart</hi>; which affords an high approvement to every act. There is one thing more, which you are carefully to prevent: for as the errour is more generall, so it requires a timely diversion, lest <hi>habit</hi> begin to sleight the quality of the offence, through an inurement or continuance of practise.</p>
                     <p>I have observed many <hi>Servants</hi> to hold this opinion: that if their care extend it selfe to what is committed to their charge; they are not bound in conscience to looke any further: The Charge of their <hi>Fellow-servants</hi> holds no relation with them: They doe what is injoyned them, and this (as they erroneously pretend) may sufficiently discharge them. It is true, indeed, as the world goes, such <hi>Servants</hi> may bee well received into the list of carefull Reteiners, who addresse their labour to what is peculiarly injoyned them by their <hi>Masters:</hi> But if they should duly consider the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45431:256"/>
office of a faithfull <hi>Servant:</hi> their care would dilate it selfe to an higher extent. For that <hi>Servant</hi> cannot love his <hi>Master</hi> sincerely, nor performe those offices which are required of him effectually,<note place="margin">It is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a Servant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his own peculiar charge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the neglect of their care. <hi>Vid.

For her Rule is, to doe as you would be done unto. But if you apparently perceive that those who are in Family with you, neglect their charge, or profusely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate your <hi>Masters</hi> goods; you are not in conscience bound to bee their Secretaries. For when no admonitions will reclaime them, corrasives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of cordials must be applyed to them.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you heard what you are to doe, and what you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. Much is expected from you, because much is committed to you.

of all that knew him, that a few maturer yeares would have so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd him, as his private friends might not onely have rejoyced in him, but the publique state derived much improvement from him.

                     <p>But leaving these, admit you should find him sorrowing for such a Subject, as deserves no wise mans teares: as for the losse of his goods. These teares proceed from despicable Spirits, and such whose desires are fixed on earth.

And these though their grounds of griefe appeare least, yet many times their impatience breakes forth most. Fearefull oathes and imprecations are the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mablest ayres or accents which they breath. These you are to chastise, and in such a manner and measure, as they may by recollection of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, agnise their error, and repeat, what that divine Poet sometimes writ, to impresse in them the more terror:

                        </note> These if you duly observe; when you see your <hi>Neighbours</hi> field look fat, (to use the saying of that wise Cinick) it wil not make your cheeks look leane. That marrow-eating envie cannot grind you, because your <hi>neighbours</hi> prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse doth infinitly cheer you. You will not stumble on his <hi>meere-stone,</hi> nor remove his Buttoll to inlarge your own, because you tender his welfare equally as your owne. His losse must not procure your curse: because your best wishes ever cloze with his successe. Let us draw in our Sailes, and contract all in one. Would you, Gentlemen, in your reflexion upon <hi>Conjugall Offices,</hi> performe the duty of <hi>good Husbands?</hi>

Be it then your care to preserve this faire contexture; trust mee, it will conferre on your Family, where vertue gives the best beauty, more true honour, then the easie-resolving varnish of fortunes, or whatsoever may outwardly accommodate you.

            <head>A CHARACTER OF HONOVR.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O write of <hi>Honour,</hi> and not amply, according to <hi>Honours Character,</hi> were a derogation to her: and to write exactly, would require a more expert and judicious Artist, then every rude <hi>Myson</hi> to take in hand a subject of such consequence; But <hi>vertue,</hi> as she is best adorned when least garnished with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall colours: so <hi>Honour</hi> is most lively when she seemes most naked of Rhetoricall Varnish. The best Moralls have ever pourtray'd <hi>Justice</hi> by a scale, poyzing every action duely, discussing every ambiguity throughly, without fixing of her eye on the object of Majesty commanding, or of Amity (with more easie meanes) perswading; They have deciphered <hi>Fortitude,</hi> not by <hi>Thrasoe</hi> boast, or a precipitate opposing her selfe to all dangers without mature judgement to foresee, and resolution to prevent the iminency of all occurrents: which made <hi>Homer</hi> dilate upon the essence of true <hi>Fotitude,</hi> represented in <hi>Hector,</hi> as an Archytipe no lesse imitable, then for mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all <hi>Assaies</hi> admirable: He brings him in dehorting his brother <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> from his inconsiderate purpose: with this good caveat. It becommeth us not to take Armes upon every sensuall respect, but to ground the motion of warre upon a cause honestly moving. To be brief, there should be no vertue which should not rather-character her selfe, by her owne purity, then be displaied by a curious or affective style; which rather detracts then aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments those perfect and unstained ornaments wherewith she is endued: and that which <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks of the <hi>office</hi> of an Orator, censuring that Speech as most vicious, which seemes most curious; may I speak of <hi>Honour,</hi> whose dependence is of <hi>Vertue</hi>: onely illustrated in her selfe, because her essence gives to her more eminence than the polish'd styles of the best Rhetoricians could ever effect. But I will descend into the particular discourse of <hi>truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi>: What they should be that arrogate that Name, and what they are that merit it. <hi>Honour</hi> relisheth best, when highliest descended: not boasting with <hi>Lycas</hi> in the Tragedy of noble Ancestors, but of inward vertues; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their mindes the purest mansions of Nobility; their vertues, the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolls of their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>scent and progeny. For what is it to challenge precedencie by our Ancestors, being made Noble by them, whom our owne actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, makes as ignoble? I can approve that disposition of <hi>Alexander</hi> the best; who rather wished his Fathers exploits (though not in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vy) to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured, whereby his owne memorable atchievements might purchase him glory, not by relation had to the prowesse of his Father, but his owne demerits;
<pb facs="tcp:45431:266"/>
yet not with a too listning eare of attention, hearing his warlike designes above truth praysed: but more willing to doe, then heare of his doings. For hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Aristobulus</hi> on a time commending his memorable acts farre above truth in his writings, He threw the booke into the river, as he was sailing over <hi>Hydaspis,</hi> saying, he was almost moved to send <hi>Aristobulus</hi> after.</p>
            <p>For this I have alwaies observed in an <hi>honourable minde:</hi> no popular conceipt can transport her above her <hi>Shpaere;</hi> She cannot endure a tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Humorist, that feedes on the aire of his owne applause; but like a wise <hi>Ithacus</hi> commits the sailes of his prudent and provident affections to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed by <hi>Vertue,</hi> stopping his eare at the Incantations of the voice-alluring <hi>Syren,</hi> or cup-attracting <hi>Cyrce.</hi> An <hi>honourable man</hi> stereth his Ship with no Sterne of Ambition, but with a temperate opinion of himself and his owne Actions: referring the whole current and passage of his intentions, purposes and endeavours to his Countries welfare: whose safety he preferres before his owne: wishing rather death with a good opinion of his country, then immerited honours with her detriment. The Truly <hi>Honourable</hi> will accept of no honours but such as her deserts challenge: nor those neither, if not obtruded. This moved many of the Ancient Heroes, whose acts deserve no lesse memory, then their lifes did glory, to expose themselves to all perils, whereby their names might be recorded in the Annalls of Fame: leaving not only Statues or Monuments of what they have been, but by the exact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of their vertues, what they are; for even the Pagans reserved a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> and celebrity to such as had either exempted their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the servitude of her enemy, or had augmented her glory by the voluntary resignation of their lives.

the whole world into one Monarchy? or <hi>Caesar</hi> so farre to have disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his glory, making his motto—<hi>Veni, Vidi, Veci</hi>?

<q>

            <p>Dust and ashes indeed; yet such, as albeit the slimy substance of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall man rest immured and incaged in the Bowels of earth; yet there is an aethereall, an heavenly aspiring beauty which cannot be depressed with the terrene and massie weight of earths interior centre—<hi>alta petit, nec cessat, quoad altissima perringit.</hi> It hovereth higher, as a Bird farre removed from her native repose, till it arrive at those Elysian Fields of true immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where her expected habitation is possessed—even the mansion of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Syon.</hi> Hence therefore may those carnall and epicureall men, who have wallowed in all mundane delights, drunke deep of the sensuall <hi>Lethe</hi> of their security, be confounded with shame; who relinquishing the offred time of grace, expose themselves to the Brothells of sin and impiety, forgetting all respect of <hi>honour,</hi> as <hi>Corvinus Messala</hi> did his owne Name—and when they behold the admired and most resplendent <hi>honours</hi> of our Time, either to decline by some in auspicious accident, or cut by the common Sithe of Fate, compare their contaminate lives with their refined vertues.

Thus will the <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> of our time descant upon <hi>honours</hi> ruine, interpreting life, vertues best reward: when no lesse distast is conceived by the truly vertuous, of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered humors, which proceed from the cachexie or evill disposition of our mindes, then that renowned Phylosopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> did by the vanity of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or <hi>Diogenes</hi> by the vain and fruitlesse rarities of <hi>Synope.</hi> For He is <hi>truly Honourable,</hi> who employeth his oyle, the faculties of his soule, so to his Countries availe, that he may attaine a more glorious seate, in his Country Supernall.</p>
            <p>Neither are we to hold the ornaments of <hi>Honour</hi> onely derivative from their <hi>Princes</hi> favour. We have seene many eminent in their eye, whose actions have throwne a worthy <hi>Odium</hi> upon their Persons,<note place="margin">☞</note> by abusing the grace bestow'd on them: and bringing a fatall and fearefull combustion

upon the <hi>State</hi> by their ambition, or appetite of revenge: or some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct aime; as all ages can present instances, and these of our owne, to our griefe, even in these our late distractions.</p>
            <p>And though Families of high extraction and <hi>innate honour</hi> might be held worthiest to fit at the <hi>Sterne,</hi> and to mannage the highest affaires of State; yet have Princes suffered in their too much confidence: and falne under their umbrage, by whom in their greatest extreames, they ought to have beene sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. And to inlarge our <hi>Observations</hi> in this particular; whence is it to be thought, that this <hi>degeneration</hi> ariseth? Is it from corruption of <hi>blood,</hi> or of <hi>time</hi>? We shall finde a decay or defection in both: Effeminacy or Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being generally Nursers of our <hi>Gentry:</hi> which cannot chuse but make <hi>Plants</hi> sprung from eminent Descents looke unlike themselves. So as, where <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> with other decoring endowments, should close in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with one another: <hi>Education,</hi> which is a <hi>second Nature,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes and tells them, that their <hi>Breeding</hi> never school'd them in any such notions.

               </note>Let us suppose a <hi>Prince</hi> (as in a <hi>Platonick Idaea</hi>) seated in his <hi>Chaire</hi> of <hi>State;</hi> and in a full Assembly as in his <hi>Senat-house</hi>: where Persons of quality and such as are elected for the benefit and indemnity of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try appeare Assistants. And in this Grand Convene, Proposalls of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne are debated: but clearely carried by the <hi>Plebeian Party;</hi> as in our Roman Annalls, we may finde sundry Presidents. Whence is it, I say, that the <hi>Candidates</hi> and those of nobler extraction should vaile to the <hi>Lower:</hi> and to their Princes prejudice and regall priviledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> subscribe to their decretalls? Is it weaknesse or personall interest, that begets in them this remissnesse? No; not wholly from weaknesse; though their judgements be not of the first sight, but their facility in subscribing to inferiour Votes, is grounded upon three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. <hi>Popularity; Self-ends</hi> and <hi>Pusillanimity.</hi> The reasons you shall hear thus discussed.</p>
            <p>It was well observed by a <hi>Statesman</hi> in our time; whose travells had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently read unto him, how <hi>Plebeian votes</hi> were ever for crying up <hi>libertie</hi> of <hi>Subjects;</hi> and <hi>subjection</hi> of <hi>Soveraignes</hi>: that nothing was more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to a State government, then this popular overswaying power: being ever over-clowded with discontents: and picking quarrells at the present Government, were it never so prudently managed, nor peaceably admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred. Innovation is the posture of State, they aime at: which, though it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce with it many fearefull consequences; they will chuse rather to smile on their owne approaching ruine; then admit that State or Condition be it never so calme nor serene, so long as they hold it incapable of a Change.</p>
            <p>Now would you know the cause why these <hi>Plebeian votes</hi> passe for current; and receive no opposition? We are to understand, how Highest Families are not ever indued with the pregnant'st wits, nor percivest judgements. They find <hi>subtil groundlings,</hi> who, though they came but th' other day from Cart &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:45431:267"/>
never look't so high as into the glorious Horizons of a Court; yet they have found the way how to over-wit those <hi>perfumed ingenuities</hi>: who ravell out time in their Court-dialect: and by intending more the <hi>trimme</hi> then the <hi>dress;</hi> spoile the pursuit of their arguments: and give easy way to their rurall Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents: who, though lesse <hi>neat,</hi> hold more to <hi>Substance:</hi> and win ground upon those <hi>State-popinja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> by taking advantage upon their impertinencies. But to omit these; for all of them retaine not a savour of this Cask; there is another bait, which these <hi>Lordly Lobsters</hi> usually nibble at; being a politike designe, as they conceit it; the apprehension whereof (though it expire like an airy fancy) has great influence over them. And what is this illusion, but a <hi>popular opinion</hi>? Their desire is to feede on vulgar aire; the steame whereof for most part choakes them. They have heard perchance, of some Persons, who by suffrage of the people, and their applause, have swolne great in the opinion of the State: and sometimes by being borne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their shoulders, have attained the highest pitch of Command. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, how the fame of mens actions receives more life from popular opinion, than any other Instrument of State.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>These be they who rubricate their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: preferring a singular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion before a Consistory.</hi>
               </note> And in this they canonize their owne fancies, by applying that rapsody of the Poet, to the imaginary extension of their spreading shadowes:
<q>
                  <l>Quàm pulchrum est digito monstrari, &amp; dicier hic est?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Theater,</hi> whereon they act their mimick-tyming parts, are hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the <hi>Arras</hi> of vanity: so their prime care is to woo and ingratiate their <hi>Spectators,</hi> and by winning in upon their affections, to purchase their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause in the Cloze of their Actions. But as we commonly note, that <hi>By-standers</hi> see more then the <hi>Gamesters;</hi> so fares it with these deluding Changelings. For by labouring to please those of inferiour judgements, these <hi>Mechanicks</hi> below the <hi>Stage;</hi> they lose themselves in the opinion of these serious and mature Censors; those <hi>Gallant Gallery wits</hi> (to passe by those <hi>Feminine Boxes,</hi> where pregnancie even in Criticisme, oft-times transcends the quality of their sexe) who can discover their defects; for so enlivened are their judgements, and so farre distanced from a popular verge, where conceipt, like a restrained vassall, is ty'd to the demension of the <hi>Object</hi> they looke on, and no further; as they know well how to distinguish betwixt a <hi>Roscius</hi> and a <hi>Lysias. Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity</hi> is an affected kinde of Action; which the higher it mounts, it ever lesseneth it selfe the more in the eye of judgement.</p>
            <p>Surely would <hi>Honour</hi> equally Ballance her owne worth, and enter into a serious consideration with its owne extraction; she would blush at nothing more, then in suffering her selfe to be deluded with such a phanatick shadow of fruitlesse glory: which (though it promise much) is ever failing in her reality of performance: and not onely failing the expectance; but drawing the too credulous Believer into a dangerous precipice; from which no thread, were it never so curiously spun by the artfull or subtill hand of an <hi>Ariadne,</hi> may ever free him. It is prevention that is the life of Policy; but if oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity be not taken by the <hi>foretoppe;</hi> He failes in his pursuit of prevention, by neglecting the season. Let <hi>Honour</hi> beware of aspiring, or raising herself one Story higher, either by indirect wayes, or weake hopes; both which She shall finde, like so many <hi>Egyptian Reedes,</hi> rather <hi>piercing</hi> than <hi>strengthning</hi> her in her <hi>Progresse,</hi> or <hi>Ascent</hi> to Greatnesse in her pursuit of <hi>popular fame;</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:45431:268"/>
seldom or never accompanied the merit of any action: but observes the issue, &amp; upon that successe grounds the <hi>basis</hi> of their opinion. <hi>Honour</hi> should derogate much from her true native value, in entertaining such flitting and fly blown <hi>Followers;</hi> who act nothing with alacrity but innovation, faction &amp; disloyalty.</p>
            <p>Thus farre you have heard what strong influence this <hi>Popular Froath</hi> has upon <hi>Adulterate Honour;</hi> which, as it retaines a <hi>Glo-worme Light,</hi> so it deceives others with its <hi>false splendor,</hi> and makes the pursuers of it most unfortunate. We shall litle need to strengthen this Assertion with Instances: our owne Chronicles may afford us variety, without ranging further.</p>
            <p>Now to the second Motive; wherein we shall lay open unto you, how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>Self-ends</hi> operate upon this painted Greatnesse. Their <hi>Revenues</hi> are such <hi>Land-marks,</hi> as they direct their course by them. These make them conclude positively, though poorely for Persons of descent and quality:
<q>
                  <l>Si mihi res constet, Satis est; quo publica flerem?</l>
                  <l>Non aliâ pendet compage nostra domus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Publique safety is the lightest feather in their Skale. So they may riot and play the sensuall Libertines in the free and undisturbed injoyment of their own; they hold the Game well plaid to their advantage. No defection of Subjects; no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Government, no decrease of Commerce, no hostile invasion by a surre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitious Nation; can work much upon their Affections: or resolve their ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine temper to a compassionate teare, The wheel of their Fortune holds a constant course, amidst these inconstant and vertiginous wheelings of the State. And this is enough for them.</p>
            <p>Now to preserve these, and stand at distance, like priviledg'd Persons, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd from exception or opposition; they ever have an intentive eye upon the <hi>stronger Party.</hi> And these they follow with a servile reverence.</p>
            <p>How happy had it been for these <hi>Moaths</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> to have been <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> or younger Brothers, or persons of inferiour quality; that the lownesse of their condition might have freed them from the pursuit of such dishonourable <hi>Self-ends.</hi> The <hi>Maxim</hi> is true: <hi>O quàm multi foeliciores fuissent, si minus possedissent!</hi> whereas, a spirit cloathed with true habilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of honour, will rather suffer all extreames; then admit an injurious or disgracefull bargaine in the sale or prostitution of his honour.</p>

               <hi>Badge</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> let feminine delicacy arrogate to it self, the <hi>style</hi> of <hi>Valour.</hi> But these be dull-pallid colours in the Annals of Heraldry: and deserve no other deblazonry (to beget a glowing blush in their successors) then lines blanch'd with infamy.</p>
            <p>Let us here then in the Cloze of our <hi>Character,</hi> present these <hi>Advertisements</hi> to <hi>Honour</hi>; that she may know how and in what posture to preserve her State clear'd from the opinion of a deceiving lustre: by appearing more <hi>really-gracefull,</hi> then <hi>poorely-popular.</hi> To compleat this Worke, it will conduce highly to her advantage, to be a constant professor of <hi>fidelity</hi>; in the first place to <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> And next in all offices of <hi>Amity.</hi> An affable smile gives an excellent grace to the countenance of <hi>Honour. Amicitia nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam minore acquirenda est dispendio quàm Clementiâ.</hi> Clemency gains most with least cost. In her expresse of bounty, or works of Charity, let <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> be her <hi>Almoner:</hi> By an indisposed liberallity, many have lost more then they have won. In Actions of valour, <hi>Honour</hi> should be rather <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> than <hi>daring:</hi> and in nothing more confident then in the maintenance of a <hi>good Cause.</hi> For <hi>Habit</hi>; more <hi>comely</hi> then <hi>gaudy,</hi> is the nearest livery: being to be knowne better by what we <hi>are,</hi> then what we <hi>weare.</hi> For <hi>Diet</hi>; delicacy should be a stranger to her palat. These <hi>Olia's</hi> of our Time have brought an <hi>Odium</hi> upon our <hi>State.</hi> Lastly, a princely command or composure of Her Affections, will returne Her absolute in all.</p>
