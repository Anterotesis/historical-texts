            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>May It pleaſe your Highneſs,</opener>
            <p>THe two ſmall Books, which I did preſume to preſent unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were ſo kindly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that having no otherway in any meaſure to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this favour, but the
<pb facs="tcp:93262:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dedication of this, I thought I could do no leſs, than to dedicate it unto ſo good, ſo wiſe, meek, and generous a Perſon as your ſelf; being not only a true and ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, nor only a living Member, but alſo an unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable Pillar of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and though Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, that the Gates of Hell ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it, yet the Devil having a root of Evil, and enmity in himſelf, night and day ſeeks its deſtruction: To effect which, he ſubtilly, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi>-like, appears in different
<pb facs="tcp:93262:3"/>
forms, aſſaulting it ſeveral ways; either by raiſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> inſinuating that we, being ſeparated from them, are excluded all hopes of Salvation; and that they are bound with fire and ſword to ſeek our utter ruine and deſtruction; or inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to other Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that to live up to the ſtrict Rule and Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, they are obliged to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it. This Maxime is received in Philoſophy,

Church. I do not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any Panegyrick, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Highneſs takes much greater pleaſure in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, than in hearing the repeated Ecchoes of your Princely Merits, looking on your Noble Virtues, as a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subject for the Records of Honour, in which your Highneſs will be praiſed to all ſucceeding Ages. There your brave and warlike Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Wiſdom, Prudence, Goodneſs, piercing and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Underſtanding in all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Affairs, diſcreet Conduct, and diligent Cares
<pb facs="tcp:93262:5"/>
for the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, and Catholick Faith, againſt all Superſtitions, Errors, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, and cruel Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will be much better deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, than I could here have done with my Pen. There every one may read, that at 13 years of Age, your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs march'd to the Siege of <hi>Rhynberg.</hi> At the Age of 18 Commanded a Regiment of Horſe in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, in 1642 came into <hi>England,</hi> fought and defeated Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sands</hi> near <hi>Worcester;</hi>

               <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet in ſuch a bold reſolute, but prudent and diſcreet way, that you ſoon put the Enemy to the flight. And though we live in an Age, wherein every one ſeems to be free to ſpeak what he will, and not to ſpare even thoſe whom they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:93262:6"/>
to ſpeak againſt; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſaid, but in your Praiſe and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. I conclude this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, humbly begging of your Highneſs to accept of this ſmall Treatiſe. I could have enlarged it, had I not known that Princes, who are commonly incumbred with ſeveral important Affairs, have no time to read great Volumes. When your ſpare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours will allow to make a peruſal of this, which though little, yet contains much, I hope your Highneſs will receive ſome ſatisfaction,
<pb facs="tcp:93262:6"/>
and ſee that my whole inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to wiſh the Peace of this Nation; the Glory of God Almighty; the good of his holy Catholick Church; the Salvation of the Souls of men; and the reducing of the wandring ſheep, whether Popiſh, or other Diſſenters, into Uniformity; which is heartily deſired by</p>

            <p>AS it is not enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from evil, but we are obliged to do good: Even ſo it is not enough to have prov'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Heretick, but alſo to make appear, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the holy Catholick Church. But if in reading what I have written, thou ſayest I have not done well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:93262:8"/>
thou doſt not underſtand it, blame my Diſcourſe, not my Faith. It may be, another might ſpeak more clearly upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; nevertheleſs no man did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak ſo, that in all things he could be underſtood by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alike. Therefore let him who is not pleaſed herewith, ſee whether he underſtands others better, when they ſpeak or write concerning the ſame things: And if he doth, let him ſhut my Book, yea let him throw it into the fire, and employ his time in reading thoſe that he underſtands better. However let him not think, I was bound to be ſilent, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:93262:8"/>
I have not written ſo clearly as thoſe which he underſtands; for all that is written, doth not fall into the hands of every man; and it may be alſo, that thoſe which read what I have written, may not find any Books, wherein ſuch Queſtions are handled more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherefore it is good to have ſeveral Books of a different ſtyle, though not of a different Faith, concerning the ſame Queſtions, becauſe the ſame thing is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſome conceived one way, by others another. But if he that complains, he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things, could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, when others have
<pb facs="tcp:93262:9"/>
diſputed about them with ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let him deſire God, that he would be pleaſed to enlighten his Spirit, and ceaſe to blame me, and to ſay, it had been better for me to be ſilent. But ſhould the Reader object, I very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is written, but what is written is not true; let him prove his Opinion, and let him confute mine, which if he doth with charity and truth, and makes it appear unto me, I ſhall confeſs my ſelf very much obliged unto him, and think my Endeavours in compoſing this ſmall Treatiſe, ſufficiently rewarded. I know (Opinions concerning Religion
<pb facs="tcp:93262:9"/>
being many in this Nation,) I cannot be without a great many Foes; but if they conſider, that I have no other intention, than to manifeſt the Truth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Peace among our ſelves; love towards one another, and union to the holy Catholick Church, out of which whoſoever is, is a Schiſmatick, and excluded all hopes of Salvation, as I will make appear hereafter, then they will ceaſe to hate, and begin to love me. But oftentimes it happens quite contrary to our good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as when Jeſus Chriſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto the Jews the Vices which they were given to, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb facs="tcp:93262:10"/>
was that they ſhould hate their ſins, and not the Phyſician who was willing to heal them: But it hapned on the contrary; <hi>they were ungrateful,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, for being grown mad, they aſſaulted the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who came to cure them.</hi> I may ſay the ſame thing, concerning thoſe who are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear Chriſtian Doctrines; their Intereſt is to know them, ſince it concerns their eternal Salvation, and therefore they ought to receive thoſe who are ſo charitable as to instruct them, with a greater kindneſs, than a King doth the deareſt of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
<pb facs="tcp:93262:10"/>
But too often we ſee the contrary: They look upon thoſe Phyſicians of their Souls, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their greateſt Enemies; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſince there are ſome, who are glad to hear the truth, and receive it in meekneſs, to thoſe eſpecially I direct this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, my deſign is to convince them, and ſo to draw them out of the Error, in which they have walked many years; wherein, I hope, with God's aſſiſtance, to have good ſucceſs, becauſe I ſhall ſay nothing, but grounded upon ſound Reaſon, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the holy Scripture, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which I ſhall quote faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb facs="tcp:93262:11"/>
to the end, that theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities may be as many Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to defend me from all the ſtroaks, which ſome would offend me with, that I may not be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before I ſee them run through and overthrown. Naked Truth, and the publiſhers of it are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hated in this World. And though it be written in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> that Truth is ſtronger than Wine, than Women, than Kings, yet we daily ſee by experience, that for all its ſtrength, it is oftentimes cruelly aſſaulted, and miſerably ſubdued upon Earth. Every one knows, what Perſecutions Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, becauſe he would
<pb facs="tcp:93262:11"/>
make it appear unto all men; his Apoſtles, Diſciples, and Martyrs were not only hated, but after his Example endured ſeveral Torments, even death it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would defend and make it manifeſt. If I have written any thing not agreeable to the Word of God, or ſound Reaſon, I ſhall be very glad and thankful in being informed of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſubmit this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to the cenſure of the Church, and to the judgment of all learned and godly men, whoſe delight is to draw Truth from the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

other cruel torments upon them, as it is at this time the Cuſtom in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cruel. I grant that in the Apoſtle's time, and firſt Ages, I mean, when they obſerved the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both in its Practice and Doctrine, they could juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſt of this glorious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Holy Cacholick.</hi> But ſince they were corrupted, and have diminiſhed from, and added unto the holy Scripture ſeveral points of Faith, which they impoſe upon us, under pain of Damnation; and ſince they are fallen into Hereſie, they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93262:14"/>
have loſt this fair and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Title: Theſe words, <hi>Holy Catholick,</hi> cannot be juſtly attributed unto them; it is the Church of <hi>England</hi> which now moſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and gloriouſly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes theſe honourable Qualities.</p>
            <p>But as women that have loſt their honour, &amp; are grown debauch'd, when they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with them that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call them Whores firſt, leſt that villainous and odious name ſhould be caſt upon themſelves; ſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt the fair qualities of <hi>Holy Catholick,</hi> and being fallen into Hereſie, is wont

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93262:15"/>
that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> which being proved, (there being but one <hi>holy Catholick Church)</hi> it will appear that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath loſt this glorious and noble Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>But before I make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it will be neceſſary rightly to underſtand the words, <hi>Church, Holy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word, <hi>Church,</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually taken, either for the place, where people are gathered together to pray and worſhip God; or elſe for a Congregation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Perſons profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>We accept the word <hi>Church,</hi> in this latter ſence; wherefore by the Church, we underſtand a Body or Collection of humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, profeſſing the ſame Faith in Chriſt, gathered together in ſeveral places of the World, for the

            </p>
            <p>The Church that we are ſpeaking of, and call holy, is that that embraces all the Profeſſors of the true Faith of the holy Scriptures, when they are in this World; which Church comprehends good and bad, being both externally called, and profeſſing the ſame Faith; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 24, 30.</note> of Heaven is like unto a Field, in which Wheat and Tares grow together into the Harveſt: Like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Net, that was caſt into the Sea, and gathered of

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93262:18"/>
Beaſts, clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; This is that great houſe, in which there are not only veſſels of Gold and Silver, but alſo of Wood and Earth, and ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour.</p>
            <p>Therefore when we ſpeak of the <hi>Holy Church,</hi> we do not conſider her in reſpect of the Vocation, which is holy; neither of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Powers, which likewiſe are holy; nor in reference to the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the preſence of God; nor in relation to the Perſons, who compoſe the Church in this Life, ſince in that reſpect the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93262:18"/>
Church comprehends both good and bad; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Doctrine taught therein, which is pure and holy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh.</p>
            <p>The Church thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed is alſo called <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is, <hi>univerſal;</hi> which word is uſed in our Creed, to teach us to diſcern the true Church from the falſe. The word, <hi>Catholick,</hi> may be taken either in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to time, or relation to places, or in reſpect of Perſons; or elſe in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Doctrine. It is here taken in reſpect of the Doctrine only; ſo that by the Catholick or univerſal Church, we mean, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93262:19"/>
Church that teaches and believes the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine. For as the Holy Ghoſt did lead the Apoſtles into all truth, ſo did the Apoſtles leave all truth unto the Church, which is called <hi>Catholick,</hi> from the univerſality of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſaving Truths contain'd therein.</p>
            <p>This being granted, it follows, that that Church which embraces the Faith once delivered to the Saints, and keeps the holy Scriptures in Purity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding to, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing from them, is the holy Catholick Church; for whatſoever Church pretendeth to be holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93262:19"/>
and keeps not the whole Faith once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Saints, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes things to be believed, which are not found, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be deduced from the Scriptures by evident and neceſſary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth) falſly attributes this name to her ſelf. Since then the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> keeps the Faith once delivered to the Saints, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the holy Scripture in its Purity, and impoſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be believed, but what is therein diſtinctly contained, or can be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therefrom, by evident and neceſſary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it follows, that ſhe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93262:20"/>

            <p>Read over the Old and New Teſtament, and if you can make it appear, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves or practiſes one point of Faith, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or doth not believe or practiſe thoſe Articles of Faith, which are contained therein, (as too often the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth) then I will grant freely, that ſhe is not the holy Catholick; bnt no body being able to make this appear, I am in the right, in aſſerting the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the holy Catholick Church. 'Tis certain, they do not make unto themſelves any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93262:20"/>
graven Images; nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, kiſs, and ſerve them; neither bow, pray, and offer Incenſe unto them. They do not make Images of God the Father in the ſhape of an old man, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Globe of the World in his hands, nor of the Holy Ghoſt in the form of a Dove, nor of the Croſs, and do not worſhip them (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth) with a Worſhip of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, with a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due unto God only.</p>
            <p>They do not believe in any other Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer than Jeſus Chriſt; they hold him for their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediator and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and they will not put
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93262:21"/>
their truſt and confidence in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any other. They do not believe any other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, than the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; nor believe that the Pope with a little Indulgence laid unto a Bead, or Croſs, or Medal, or with a Maſs ſaid upon certain days of the week, is ſufficient to procure a releaſe to the Souls of men detained in torments, wherein, to fill his Trunks with Money, and to fatten his Kitchin, he would make ignorant People to believe, they are impriſoned. They do not believe that he is Infallible; that he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Power to depoſe Kings and Princes from their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93262:21"/>
Throne, to diſpenſe their Subjects from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or to kill thoſe that he calls Hereticks. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they believe that Chriſt's Body is ſtill upon Earth; they believe and put it in practice, that we are bound to ſing, pray, and give thanks to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in a known tongue; they believe they ought to give the common People the liberty of reading the holy Scriptures in their own Tongue. They give the Sacraments of Chriſt's Body and Blood with Bread and Wine; give leave to eat Fleſh at all times; do not forbid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, and thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93262:22"/>
which are in orders to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> knowing that ſuch a Doctrine is the Doctrine of Devils; they add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to, nor diminiſh from the holy Scriptures, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> often doth, therefore it is clear, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> believes the whole Chriſtian Doctrine, as it was once delivered to the Saints, and conſequently, that ſhe is the <hi>Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> believes in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> but the word, <hi>Trinity,</hi> is not found in the holy Scripture; therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a point of Faith not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93262:22"/>
contained in the Word of God, therefore ſhe is not the holy Catholick, for as you ſaid before, to give the denomination of holy Catholick to any Church, it is requiſite, ſhe ſhould believe the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, as it was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition to, or diminution from the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though that word, <hi>Trinity,</hi> be not found in the holy Scriptures, yet the thing ſignified thereby, is found therein; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Go ye therefore and</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93262:23"/>
               <hi>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And more evidently by thoſe of the<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7.</note> firſt of St. <hi>John: There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and theſe three are one.</hi> That Conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not good, which ſaith, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not the holy Catholick, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in the Trinity, that word not being expreſs'd in the holy Scripture; for provided the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be found there in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent terms, or may be deduced from thence by clear and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, 'tis ſufficient, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93262:23"/>
matters not, if the word it ſelf be not expreſſed. But as I have juſt now made it appear by the Texts of Saints, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the Trinity is there very clearly expreſſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c. But you may further urge that by the word, <hi>Trinity,</hi> we mean three eternal and infinite Perſons, really diſtinct one from another, ſubſiſting in one Nature numerically; but this is contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is not found in the holy Scripture, nor can be deduc'd from it by clear and neceſſary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; therefore it may be rightly inferr'd, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93262:24"/>
the holy Catholick Church, it believing a point of Faith, which is neither found diſtinctly, nor in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent terms in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Probatur minor,</hi> Firſt, That the Trinity is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to humane Reaſon, which is proved thus. For as it is contrary to humane Reaſon, that <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who are three diſtinct Perſons, have but one Nature Numerically, ſeeing that every Perſon hath its Nature different from th'other, if not <hi>in Specie,</hi> at leaſt <hi>Numericè,</hi> and it cannot be otherwiſe; ſo it is centrary to Reaſon, that the Father, Son, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93262:24"/>
Holy Ghoſt ſhould be three really diſtinct Perſons, and notwithſtanding, have but one nature <hi>Numericè;</hi> which can't be, ſince from three Perſons do naturally follow three ſubſtances or natures; which is proved thus. Perſon in God is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a being, or nothing; we can't ſay that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe the three divine Perſons ſhould then be nothing at all, therefore it muſt be a Being: If Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either it is real or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; we can't call it mental, becauſe <hi>ſublato Intellectu,</hi> the Perſons ſhould be no more; therefore it remains that it is a real Being; if real, either it is a Subſtance,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93262:25"/>
or an Accident; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>Medium</hi> between Subſtance and Accident. We can't ſay that it is an Accident, becauſe we do not admit any in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for the great Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which follow from thence; therefore it muſt be a Subſtance; and if a Subſtance (ſince there are three really diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) it follows, that there are alſo three really diſtinct Subſtances, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is neither found di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, nor in equivalent Terms in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is eaſily proved. The former is without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93262:25"/>
for if ye read over the holy Scripture, ye ſhall no where find the word, <hi>Trinity.</hi> And the latter is proved thus. If the Trinity be there in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent terms, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Text, <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;</hi> or elſe in this, <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and theſe three are one.</hi> For, though in the one and th'other mention be made of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and conſequently, of three Perſons, becauſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93262:26"/>
the Father is a Perſon, the Son a Perſon, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt a Perſon; yet we cannot infer that theſe three Perſons have but one nature or ſubſtance <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericè;</hi> for although ſome infer it from that word, <hi>in the Name,</hi> which is in the ſingular number, yet that is not convincing, ſince I may ſay, ſuch a thing is commanded in the Name of the King, and his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor, and yet, though that word be in the ſingular Number, we can't infer, that the King and his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor have but one nature <hi>Numericè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93262:26"/>
Neither can the Trinity be inferred from theſe words of St. <hi>John, and theſe three are one;</hi> becauſe, by that Unity we may very well underſtand a Unity of Will, Agreement, and Spirit, and not of Nature or Subſtance; ſo that, when 'tis ſaid, <hi>there are three that bear Record, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> It is the ſame thing as to ſay, theſe three are one in Will; do agree one with another; what one Will's, the other willeth alſo. And this is confirmed by the words of St. <hi>John,</hi> wherein Jeſus Chriſt prayeth his Father<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 21.</note> that we may be one, as he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93262:27"/>
is one with his Father; that is, that we may do what he will have us to do, as he doth what his Father will have him to do. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body may ſee clearly that we are not, nor can be one in nature, <hi>Numericè,</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt, it being contrary to Reaſon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot infer by a clear and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt have but one nature or ſubſtance, <hi>Numerice,</hi> therefore the Trinity is neither found in the holy Scriptures diſtinctly, nor can be deduced from them by evident and neceſſary Conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93262:27"/>
Firſt, I anſwer thus. I muſt confeſs with all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, that the Myſtery of the Trinity is above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon; that it can't be comprehended in this World by any Creature whatſoever. We may ſooner reckon the Sands of the Sea, the Leaves of Trees, than underſtand that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Myſtery; for how can we apprehend one and the ſame thing, to be one, and yet many? How can we apprehend that one and the ſame Eſſence may be begotten, and yet unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; that one and the ſame thing was from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and yet was truly and properly begotten?

This is above humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

               <hi>pertinet ad unitatem eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, non ad diſtinctionem Perſonarum; per rationem igitur naturalem cognoſci poſſunt de Deo ea quae perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ad unitatem eſſentiae, non autem ea quae pertinent ad distinctionem perſonarum.</hi> That is, <hi>It is impoſſible by natural Reaſon to come to the knowledg of the Trinity of divine Perſons; becauſe by natural Reaſon we cannot come to the knowledg of God, but by Creatures, which lead us to the knowledg of God, as effects to the Cauſe. Therefore by natural Reaſon that only may be known of God, which by neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, as he is the principle of all things. But</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93262:29"/>
               <hi>the Power of creating in God is common to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, therefore it belongs to the unity of Eſſence, and not to the diſtinction of Perſons. We may then by reaſon know the things belonging to the unity of the Eſſence of God, but not the things belonging to the distinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That though it be contrary to Reaſon, that <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who are three diſtinct Perſons, have but one nature <hi>Numericè;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, who are three really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Perſons, have but one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93262:30"/>
nature or ſubſtance <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricè:</hi> For it is otherwiſe in divine than humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And although Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in God be a real being, and conſequently (being really taken) a Subſtance; yet it doth not follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are three really diſtinct Perſons, that there are three Subſtances really diſtinct one from another. For God being an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Being, he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be infinitely Perfect, and knowing himſelf to be ſo, he loves himſelf: The term of his Intellect is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son, as we call the Holy Ghoſt the term of his love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is not ſo with the term of the Intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93262:30"/>
Love of God, as with the term of the Intellect and Love of men, becauſe this is an Accident, that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; I ſay, a Subſtance; becauſe no Accidents can be found in God, as it is the conſent of all Writers; therefore ſince the term of the Intellect of God, and the term of his Love is a Subſtance, and ſince one is call'd the Son, and the other the Holy Ghoſt; it follows (ſince three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances cannot be in God, becauſe it would import three Gods, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of God, to Reaſon, and to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures,) that they have but one and the ſame
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93262:31"/>
Subſtance, as it is taught both in the Symboles of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, That though the Trinity be not found diſtinctly in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, yet it may be inferred from thence by clear and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. And though the two Texts of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be not ſufficient to convince the Reader, ſince they may be explained as they are in the Objection; nevertheleſs, the eſſential Attributes of God, as his Eternity, Immenſity, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, Creation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the World, Sanctification of Souls, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93262:31"/>
of the Bodies, Prayer and Worſhip being equally attributed to the three Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, (as it may be ſeen in ſeveral places of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and I will ſhew in the ſequel of my Diſcourſe,) it follows, by an evident and neceſſary Conſequence, that they are God, and therefore that they have but one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Nature <hi>Numericè,</hi> which is called <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> believes that the Son is <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> with the Father; but the word, <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> is not found in the holy Scriptures;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93262:32"/>
therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, which is not in the word of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is not the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Though that word, <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> be not read in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and meant by that word, is found therein. For when we ſay and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Son is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with the Father, we mean that he hath one and the ſame Subſtance with his Father, which is inferred from the holy Scripture by clear and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequences; for theſe words of St. <hi>Jahn, I</hi>

pleaſure they are, and were Created.</p>
            <p>Now ſince by theſe Texts of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ye ſee that the Name of the true God, which cannot be proper to a Creature, is not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Son, but alſo all the eſſential properties of God are attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, it follows, by a clear and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that he is Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial with the Father, or that he hath with him one and the ſame Subſtance <hi>Numericè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may further urge, if the Son be Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with the Father, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he is really and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93262:34"/>
properly true God; but he cannot be properly and really true God, <hi>ergo,</hi> he is not Conſubſtantial with his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>is proved out of the holy Scriptures.</hi> There is none other God but<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> one. <hi>The Lord of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is that true God, for</hi> there is none elſe beſides him. <hi>The</hi>

               <hi>be that are called Gods,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>To the Third, I ſay, that the Son of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humane Nature, knew not the day and hour of Judgment, as he knew not <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, when he asked his Siſters, where they had laid him.

Secondly, I ſay, becauſe Chriſt emptied himſelf, and took upon him the form of a Servant, therefore for a little time he laid down his knowledge, that he might be leſs than the Angels, and that in all things he might be like unto us, ſin only excepted; and that he were born like other Children, who got their knowledge by degrees, as it is written<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 52.</note> in <hi>Luke, Jeſus increaſed in wiſdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</hi> Or according to <hi>Austin,</hi> he<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Trin.</note> is ſaid ignorant of the day of Judgment, becauſe he doth not make them know it, that is, he knew it not ſo, that he would manifeſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93262:39"/>
it to his Diſciples. But he was to declare it in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time; of which time to come, ſpeaking as if it were paſt, he ſaid, <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants, for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made them known into you.</hi> Which things he had not yet declared, but becauſe he was to manifeſt them certainly, he ſpake as if he had done it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for he tells them, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 12</note>

Judgment; and therefore he hid it from them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that kind of expreſſion, a man is ſaid to be ignorant of that which he keeps from another.</p>
            <p>To the Fourth, I ſay, though the Son be of the Father, and as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> ſaith, he be God of God; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he is not dependent, becauſe he is begotten from the Father neceſſarily.</p>
            <p>To the Fifth, I anſwer, that Chriſt who is the Son of God, and God of God, according to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> is Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the Father and men; and ſo he being a Perſon really diſtinct from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93262:40"/>
the Father, we cannot ſay that he is Mediator between men and himſelf.</p>
            <p>To the Sixth, I ſay, it is true that which was <hi>in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> was not always; but the Son is begotten <hi>ab aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> becauſe he is begotten neceſſarily, and therefore he was always.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, that though by the aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Texts of the holy Scriptures, and Arguments deduced from them, it ſeems that the Father only is really and properly true God; yet ſince we read in the holy Writings, that the Son is called <hi>God, the true God, the eternal Life, God bleſſed over all, the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:93262:41"/>
               <hi>equal to the Father,</hi> and that all the eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Godhead are aſcribed unto him, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he is really and properly true God, and conſequently, Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with his Father.</p>
            <p>You may further urge againſt this, that the Son may be called <hi>God, true God, Almighty, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, the Creator,</hi> and have all the other eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al properties of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and yet not be really and properly true God; becauſe all theſe divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are aſcribed unto him dependently, and as a ſecond and inſtrumental Cauſe, as it appears by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93262:41"/>
Texts of the holy Scripture, as for Example, <hi>By whom he ſpoke unto us in theſe last days, by whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he made the Worlds,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. <hi>And he was a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God by Miracles, Wonders, and Signs, which God did by him,</hi> Act. 2. 22. <hi>God created all things by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ,</hi> Eph. 3. 9. And as it is related by ſeveral Fathers, <hi>Deus cum mundi creationem meditaretur ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ſuum protulit, quo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministro in rerum molitione uteretur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Godhead, are in God independently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as in the firſt Cauſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince they are found
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93262:42"/>
in the Son dependently, and as in an inſtrumental Cauſe, it follows, that he is not really and properly true God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is not Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial with his Father.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That though this inſtance appear to be good and convincing, yet it is of no value, ſince the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is read upon every Sabbath, and written by ſo many learned and godly Perſons, hath declared in that very time, when ſuch Queſtions had almoſt infected all the World, that the Son was <hi>God of God, very God of very God, being of one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Father, and</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:93262:42"/>
               <hi>that by him all things were made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may urge again; if becauſe the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> hath declared, that the Son is <hi>God of God, very God of very God, and of one ſubſtance with the Father,</hi> it is a powerful motive to be convinced of it, why do ye not believe in the Invocation of Saints, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. ſeeing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo compoſed of ſeveral learned and pious Perſons, did declare it ſo?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeveral learned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93262:43"/>
and godly Perſons, which is in Queſtion, ſince ſome amongſt them have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it was a Popes Cabal, it doth not follow, that we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, and Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. becauſe it is ordained ſo by that Council; for they command points of Faith, which can neither be found diſtinctly in, nor deduced from the holy Scriptures by clear and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as I have made it appear in a little Treatiſe, intituled the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> evidently proved Heretick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93262:43"/>
But it is not ſo in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> becauſe they would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an Article of Faith, which, though it be not in the holy Scripture in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and expreſs words, yet it is deduced from it by evident and neceſſary Conſequences, as ye have already ſeen, and ſhall be made more evident in the following Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of it, we muſt ſuppoſe one thing which is true,</hi> viz. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt or the Son of God, had a real Being before he was born of the bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>as it appears by his own words, when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93262:44"/>
               <hi>to his Diſciples, he</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 62.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith,</hi> What and if you ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcending up where he was before. The bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven; I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own will, but<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 27</note> the will of him that ſent me. I came forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and am come into the World, again I leave the World, and go to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The real exiſtence of the Son of God, before he was born of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is again proved clearly by this Argument. Whoſoever was before <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ſome
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93262:44"/>
ſpace of time before Chriſt was man, or begotten of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, or the Son of God was really exiſtent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and before <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scripture, <hi>This</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>is he of whom I ſpeak, he that cometh after me, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before me, for he was before me. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, before</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 59.</note> 
               <hi>was, I am.</hi> And by theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, By whom alſo he made the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 11, 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Worlds.</hi> This being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and true, I argue thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93262:45"/>
The Being which Chriſt had before he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was not any created, but the divine Eſſence by which he was always tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly God: For he who was ſubſiſting in the form of God, and thought himſelf to be equal with God (in which thought he could not be deceived nor injurious to God) muſt of neceſſity be truly and eſſentially God, becauſe there can be no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality between the divine Eſſence which is infinite, and any other whatſoever, which is finite; but ſo was Chriſt, as we may ſee by theſe words, <hi>Being in the</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93262:45"/>
               <hi>form of God, he thought it</hi>
               <note place="margin">phil. 2. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied himſelf, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of man.</hi> Out of which words naturally reſult three Propoſitions, fully demonſtrating my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, Firſt, That Chriſt was in the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant as ſoon as he was made man; Secondly, That he was in the form of God, before he was in the form of a Servant; Thirdly, That he was in the form of God, that is, did as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really ſubſiſt in the divine Nature, as he was in the form of a Servant, or in the nature of a man:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93262:46"/>
For he was ſo in the form of God, as thereby to be equal with God: But no other form, beſide the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential which is the divine Nature it ſelf, could infer an equality with God. There can be but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Eternal, and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Being, and there can be no Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that Infinite, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Independent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what is Finite, Temporal, and Dependent. He therefore who did tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think himſelf equal with God, as being in the form of God, muſt be conceived to ſubſiſt in that one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, eternal, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Nature of God: And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93262:46"/>
therefore as here Chriſt was really and eſſentially man, of the ſame Nature with us, in whoſe ſimilitude he was made, ſo certainly was he alſo really and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially God, of the ſame Nature and Being with him, in whoſe form he did ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>This truth is confirmed by theſe words of the 1ſt. of <hi>John, We know that the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Son of man is come, and hath given us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Christ, this is the true God, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> And by theſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93262:47"/>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Out of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> From whence we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he who was truly ſubſiſting in the form of God, and equal with him, before he was in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and who is called God, and the true God, the Almighty, and that in all thoſe ways, by which the ſupreme Deity is expreſſed, hath an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and indiviſible Eſſence and Nature with God. But Chriſt was ſo, and is ſo called, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreover, is it not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your Law, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ye are Gods?</hi> Are not theſe the very words
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93262:47"/>
of the eighty ſecond Pſalm? If God himſelf ſo ſpake, or the Pſalmiſt from him; if this be the Language of the Scripture; if Kings and Magiſtrates, and they be called Gods, unto whom the Word of God came, may we not ſay with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reaſon, of him whom the Father hath ſanctified,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> and ſent into the World, and in whom dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, that he is God?</p>
            <p>We grant, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the true God; we grant that God only is to be worſhipped and ſerved, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Therefore we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93262:48"/>
muſt grant that the Son alſo is the true God, ſince we are commanded to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is given to him, as to the Father, which is ſeen<note place="margin">Paul.</note> by theſe words, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> and by theſe of <hi>John, Who</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>hath committed all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> If then we be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, if we be alſo commanded to give the ſame worſhip to the Son, which we give to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> it is neceſſary, that we ſhould believe that the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93262:48"/>
Son is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conſequently truly and properly God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is ſeen clearly by theſe words of</hi> Austin, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe of St.</hi> John, All<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 9.</note> things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made: Neque enim dicit omnia, niſi quae facta ſunt, id est, omnem Creaturam. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde liquido patet ipſum factum non eſſe per quem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta ſunt omnia, &amp; ſi factus non eſt, Creatura non eſt; ſi autem Creatura non est, ejuſdem cum Patre ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae est. Omnis enim ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia quae Deus non est, Creatura est, &amp; quae Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atura non eſt, Deus est. Et
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93262:49"/>
ſi non eſt Filius ejuſdem ſubstantiae cujus est Pater, ergo fact a ſubstantia eſt, ſi facta ſubſtantia eſt, non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia per ipſum facta ſunt, at omnia per ipſum fact a ſunt, unius igitur ejuſdem<expan>
                  <am>
                     <g ref="char:abque"/>
                  </am>
                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan> cum Patre ſubſtantiae eſt, &amp; ideo non tantum Deus, ſed &amp; verus Deus. <hi>That is,</hi> For he doth not ſay all things, but the things which are made, to wit, all Creatures. From whence it appears clearly, that he, by whom all things were made, was not made. And if he was not made, he is not a Creature; if he be not a Creature, he is of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, for every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which is not God, is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93262:49"/>
a Creature; and that which is not a Creature, is God. And if the Son be not of the ſame Subſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then he is a Subſtance made; if a Subſtance made, all things were not made by him, but all things were<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 3.</note> made by him, therefore he is of the ſame Subſtance with the Father, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is not only God, but true God.</p>
            <p>Which is confirmed by theſe words, wherein he is ſaid <hi>to exiſt before all things;</hi> for if he was not true God, he ſhould be a Creature; if a Creature, we could not ſay that he is before all things, becauſe he who ſhould have created him,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93262:50"/>
ſhould have his Exiſtence before him; for every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuppoſes a Being ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent from whom it hath received its Exiſtence. Since therefore he is ſaid to be before all things, it is, becauſe he is the true God; for none but the true God can be ſaid properly to be before all things; every Creature having its Being of him, and he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, nor can have his Exiſtence from any thing whatſoever, having it of himſelf from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> believes as an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, that the Holy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93262:50"/>
Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son; and though they can make it appear, that he proceeds from the Father, from the words of St. <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. yet they cannot prove that he proceeds from the Son.</p>
            <p>I anſwer as before, to wit, that theſe words <hi>(the Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceeds from the Father and the Son) are not found diſtinctly in the holy Scripture; but yet are inferr'd from it by clear and neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. So theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>All things</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that the Father hath, are mine;</hi> and thoſe of the 17.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93262:51"/>
               <note place="margin">v. 17. 10.</note> Chapter, <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine,</hi> prove this evidently; for if it be true, as it is granted by all Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> That all things that the Father hath, the Son hath likewiſe, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Paternity only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the Father produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Holy Ghoſt, it follows, that the Son doth produce him alſo, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Son, as he proceeds from the Father.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſted by<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 7.</note> theſe words of St. <hi>John, It is expedient for you, that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:93262:51"/>
               <hi>part, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> And by that of the<note place="margin">15. 25.</note> 15. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you from the Father.</hi> For if ye ſuppoſe, what ye do already believe, and as I will make appear in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of my Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt is God, as it is declared by the words of the 5th. of the <hi>Acts, To lie to the Holy Ghoſt, is to lie unto God;</hi> and as it appears by the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Attributes of the Godhead, aſcribed unto him, as the Sanctification of Souls, and Omniſcience, <hi>For the Spirit ſearches all</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> It follows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93262:52"/>
he cannot be ſent as Servants are by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or Ambaſſadors by their Lords, ſince in that miſſion there is always ſome dependency; there is a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and inferior; there is one <hi>Major</hi> and one <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> which can never be found in God; it follows, I ſay, by a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, he being ſent from the Father and the Son, it is becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from both.</p>
            <p>You may further urge, the Holy Ghoſt is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly God; therefore he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Father and the Son, according to the manner, as it is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93262:52"/>
in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Antecedent appears by theſe words of St.</hi> John, When the ſpirit of truth is<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 13</note> come, he will guide you into all truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak, and will ſhew you things to come. <hi>From whence I thus argue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, He that doth not ſpeak of himſelf, ſuppoſes another diſtinct Perſon, from whom he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Inſtruction; but the Holy Ghoſt doth not ſpeak of himſelf, therefore he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes another diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from whom he hath received Inſtruction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93262:53"/>
he is not truly and properly God, becauſe he that is truly and properly God, cannot ſuppoſe any other Perſon, from whom he ſhould receive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He that ſpeaks what he heareth, ſuppoſes another Perſon ſpeaking diſtinct from him that heareth; but the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh what he heareth; therefore he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes another Perſon ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinct from him; therefore he is not truly and properly God, becauſe he that is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly God, cannot ſuppoſe any other Perſon ſpeaking unto him, from whom he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93262:53"/>
could receive Inſtruction; this being contrary to the Nature of the true God. The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition of theſe two Arguments is clear and certain, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is from St. <hi>John,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 13.</note> it follows, that the Holy Ghoſt is not truly and properly God, and conſequently, that he doth not proceed from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant that the Holy Ghoſt doth not ſpeak of himſelf, but ſpeaks what he heareth, he being not of himſelf, but of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son; however
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93262:54"/>
it doth not follow, but that he is truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God.</p>
            <p>But before I make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it is neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Holy Ghoſt is ſometimes taken for God himſelf, ſometimes for a divine Quality, ſometimes for a Perſon really diſtinct from the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is taken for God himſelf, <hi>God is a ſpirit, John</hi> 4. 24. For God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holy and a Spirit, it is evident that he is holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Reciprocally, he that is called holy Spirit <hi>per Excellentiam,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependency, is God. For theſe Terms, <hi>God,</hi> and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93262:54"/>
               <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> are really one and the ſame thing; as likewiſe theſe following, <hi>Eternal, Lord, Creator, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator.</hi> They differ only in reference to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects, which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to. God is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Eternal,</hi> becauſe he is without Beginning and Ending: Is called <hi>Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Power over all things; <hi>Creator,</hi> becauſe he made them of nothing; and <hi>Conſervator,</hi> becauſe he keeps them from returning into nothing: And he is called <hi>Holy Ghost, per Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentiam;</hi> becauſe, to ſpeak properly, none but he is truly Holy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he receives his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93262:55"/>
from no body; all other Creatures whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have their holineſs by Communication and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency. In that ſence the Holy Ghoſt is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinguiſh'd from the Eternal Father, but only <hi>per Intellectum,</hi> or in as much as the Definition which is aſcribed to the Eternal Father, is different from that of the Holy Ghoſt, as the Eternal is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. For although it be really one and the ſame thing, yet our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conceive the Eternal otherwiſe than the Creator, in as much as the Eternal is a Being without beginning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93262:55"/>
and ending; and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator is a firſt and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſe, who produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Therefore in that ſence, the Holy Ghoſt being not really diſtinguiſh'd from the Eternal Father, we cannot ſay that he proceeds from him, becauſe it would follow, that one and the ſame thing ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the ſame time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting and not exiſting; exiſting, becauſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be ſo; and not exiſting, becauſe in that inſtance of Reaſon, when we ſhould conceive it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father, it ſhould not be exiſting,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93262:56"/>
which is contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we can conceive the true God not to be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows, that the Holy Ghoſt in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſence doth not proceed from the Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is taken for a <hi>divine Quality,</hi> as when the Holy Ghoſt ſaid unto thoſe of <hi>Antioch, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 2.</note> 
               <hi>me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I have called them.</hi> We muſt conceive it was God, who ſpake theſe words, but becauſe God did all this, by that Power within him, which is his Spirit, therefore theſe words and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93262:56"/>
actions are attributed to the Holy Ghoſt; in that ſence likewiſe the Holy Ghoſt is not really diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from the Eternal Father, and conſequently, is not proceeding from him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is taken for a Perſon really diſtinct from the Eternal Father; and that he is ſo, is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by theſe Texts, <hi>Grieve not the holy ſpirit of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption;</hi> and by this to the <hi>Romans, The ſpirit it ſelf maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
               <hi>for us, with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which cannot be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and by that of the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10.</note>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93262:57"/>
               <hi>ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> For Grief is certainly a perſonal Affection, of which a quality is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We can underſtand what is an interceding Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but we have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of interceding and groaning Qualities; and we underſtand alſo, that to ſearch is a property belonging to a Perſon, and not to a Quality.</p>
            <p>You will urge, that it is ordinary in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to find the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which are proper unto Perſons, given unto thoſe things which are no Perſons; as when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Charity ſuffereth</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93262:57"/>
               <hi>long, and is kind; charity</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. All which perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Actions are attributed to Charity, which is no Perſon, but belonging to that Perſon which is chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; becauſe that Perſon, which is ſo qualified, doth perform thoſe Actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to, and by the vertue of that Charity, which is in him. In the ſame manner, perſonal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, which is no Perſon, but only the Virtue, Power and Efficacy of God the Father, who is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and doth perform thoſe perſonal Actions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93262:58"/>
by the Virtue, Power and Efficacy in himſelf, which is the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This giveth no ſatisfaction; for there are ſeveral perſonal Attributes given in the holy Scriptures expreſly to the Holy Ghoſt, which cannot be aſcribed to God the Father; as for Example, to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, is a perſonal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this Action is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Spirit of God, as it appears by theſe<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 27.</note> words of St. <hi>Paul, Becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the Will of God.</hi> But to make Interceſſion is an Act, which cannot be attributed to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93262:58"/>
God the Father, for it would follow, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould make Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to himſelf, which is abſurd, becauſe he that maketh Interceſſion, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be diſtinct from him, to whom he maketh Interceſſion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, To come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men as being ſent unto them, is a perſonal Action; but the Comforter, or the Holy Ghoſt did come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent, as it is ſeen by theſe words of St. <hi>John, When the Comforter is come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 26.</note> 
               <hi>whom I will ſend you from the Father; and if I go</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 7.</note> 
               <hi>not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93262:59"/>
unto you;</hi> ergo, the Holy Ghoſt cannot be aſcribed in this place to God the Father, ſince God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſendeth, but is never ſent.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak and hear are perſonal Actions, and both together attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, in ſuch a manner as they cannot be attributed to God the Father; as it appears by<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 13</note> thoſe words of <hi>John, When the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that he ſhall ſpeak.</hi> Now to ſpeak, and not of himſelf, cannot be attributed to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93262:59"/>
ſince he doth all things of himſelf. And to ſpeak what he heareth, cannot be alſo attributed to God the Father, who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Inſtruction from another. Seeing then the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh, and not of himſelf, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what he heareth, it followeth evidently that he is not God the Father, neither a divine Quality, which cannot be ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to ſpeak and hear, but that he is a Perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father.</p>
            <p>Now that the Holy Ghoſt as a Perſon really diſtinct from the Father, is truly and properly God, appears by theſe words of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93262:60"/>
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth<note place="margin">Act. 5. 4.</note> the ſame Queſtion, in reference to the ſame Offence, <hi>Why hast thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</hi> He means there the true God, as it appears by theſe words, <hi>Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</hi> For, when he ſaith, <hi>Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God,</hi> it is as if he ſhould ſay, thou haſt not lied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Creatures, ſince men are Creatures, but thou haſt lied unto him who is no Creature, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93262:60"/>
unto him who is true God. And if the Holy Ghoſt could be taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a Creature, this Propoſition of St. <hi>Peter, To lie to the Holy Ghost, is to lie unto God,</hi> would not always be true; therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking without diſtinction, and without a limited ſence, 'tis to prove that this word, <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is never taken in the holy Scripture, but for the true God.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to whom the divine Attributes do belong, as certainly as they belong unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly God, becauſe theſe are divine Attributes, which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93262:61"/>
are properties of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and none can be indued with, to whom the Nature of God doth not belong: But the divine Attributes, as Omniſcience, the Sanctification of Souls, and the like, do belong as certainly unto the Holy Ghoſt, as they do unto God the Father; therefore it followeth, that the Holy Ghoſt is truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, and conſequently that he proceedeth from the Father and the Son as it is declared in the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of <hi>Nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nor practice all that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93262:61"/>

               <hi>to Idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> therefore ſhe is not the holy Catholick Church, ſince the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is that, that believes and practiſes the whole Chriſtian Doctrine, as I have made it appear already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in the time of the Primitive Church, but was aboliſhed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> would not eat things ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, nor Blood, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles enjoyned, that the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93262:62"/>
               <hi>Gentiles</hi> embracing the Chriſtian Religion, ought in Charity to Conform herein to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not give Offence where the thing was it ſelf indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 13</note> ſaith, <hi>If meat make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend, I will eat no fleſh, while the World ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, leſt I make my brother to offend.</hi> But now this Commandment is paſt, and aboliſh'd by the Apoſtles, and therefore it is not true, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe any thing contrary to the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>For the-better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Truth, we muſt know, that in theſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93262:62"/>
words enjoyned to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> embracing the Chriſtian Religion, to wit, <hi>Abſtain from pollution of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and from Fornication, and from things ſtrangled and from blood,</hi> there is ſomething bad in it ſelf, and ſomething bad by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; ſomething bad for a time only, ſomething belonging to the Moral Law, and ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Ceremonial. The thing bad in it ſelf for ever, and belonging to the Moral Law, is to abſtain from Idolatry, and from Fornication; and the thing bad by accident, for a time only, and belonging to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93262:63"/>
Ceremonial Law, is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from things ſtrangled and from Blood. Now it is certain, that to abſtain from Idolatry, and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is a part of the Moral Law, ſeeing it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no</hi>

               <hi>other Gods, but me;</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt not commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi> It is alſo true, that theſe things are bad of themſelves, and for ever, becauſe they were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in time paſt, are now unlawful, and ſhall be for time to come; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Neither Fornicators, nor</hi>

               <hi>'Tis likewiſe certain, that to</hi> Abſtain from things strangled and from Blood, <hi>belongs to the Ceremonial Law; it is alſo without doubt, that it was aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is ſeen in theſe words of St.</hi> Paul, Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 25.</note> is ſold in the Shambles, that eat, asking no question for Conſcience ſake, for the Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof; if any of them that believe not bid you to a Feaſt and ye be diſpoſed to go, whatſoever is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, eat, asking no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for Conſcience ſake. <hi>And by theſe to</hi> Timothy, <hi>where it is ſaid, that</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature of God is good,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> and nothing to be refuſed, if

            <p>And that ye may not ſay, that theſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> were written before thoſe of the Council held<note place="margin">Act. 15. 29</note> at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or of the 15th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is to be ſeen in the eighth Chapter, wherein it appears, that after theſe things <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and continued there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93262:64"/>
a year and ſix months, teaching the Word of God amongſt the People of that City, to whom he did write two Epiſtles ſome years after. From whence it is evident, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to abſtain from Meats and things ſtrangled and from Blood, is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that if any Perſon would keep himſelf wholſom, and have a mild and benign Temper, he ought to abſtain from both; for ſeeing that Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome is received amongſt Phyſitians, <hi>ex his consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ex quibus nutrimur;</hi> and ſince experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that thoſe who feed

upon Blood, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruel and bloody; and thoſe that feed upon Meats ſtrangled are neither ſo healthful, nor live ſo long as thoſe that abſtain from them, it ought to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to perſwade us to abſtain from both. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in eating Blood and Meats ſtrangled, there is no ſin. And to make it appear, we muſt know the Ceremonial Law changeth as the ſhadow of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when the Sun ſhines upon it differently; and ſo may be conſidered in three different times. Firſt, when God did eſtabliſh it by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,

Thirdly, From the manifeſtation of the Goſpel, unto the end of the World. In the firſt time that Commandment, <hi>To abſtain from things stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and from Blood,</hi> ought to be kept, and the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors were caſt out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Synagogue, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the People of

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> believes, and puts it in practiſe, that we ought to baptize young Children, before they can uſe their

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93262:67"/>
believeth, and practiſeth an Article of Faith, which is not agreeable to the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, I grant, that the Baptiſm of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is not <hi>Neceſſary neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate medii,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, teaching that they cannot poſſibly be ſaved, unleſs they receive the Water of Baptiſm; becauſe the Grace of God doth not always depend upon Elements, which are not in our power at every time. And the Baptiſm that ſaves us, ſaith St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Is not that that puts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93262:67"/>
               <hi>towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore that which ſhuts the Gates of the Kingdom of Heaven againſt us, is not a meer and innocent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Baptiſm, but the Contempt and Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay, That the Baptiſm of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> that is to ſay, as much as it is poſſible to obey the Commandment of Jeſus Chriſt; and though this Precept be not found in the holy Scripture, in diſtinct and expreſs words, yet it may be inferred from

thence by clear and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My firſt Proof concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Baptiſm of young Children, is from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, wherein God makes appear the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Riches of his Mercies and Compaſſions in ſo great a meaſure, that he receives no body in that holy Covenant, without receiving their Children likewiſe; as it is ſeen in theſe words, which God ſpake to</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note> I will establiſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed

after thee. <hi>And by thoſe of the</hi> Acts, <hi>wherein St.</hi> Peter <hi>ſpeaks thus unto the</hi> Jews; Be baptized every<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39.</note> one of you in the Name of Jeſus Christ, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, for the promiſe is unto you, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. <hi>From which words I infer theſe two Arguments.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, All that are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Covenant of Grace, ought to be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Seal of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſign of our entring into that Covenant; now not only the Faithful are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers

            <p>Secondly, Unto whom the Promiſe is made, they ought to be baptized, as it appears by the words of St. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 39. But the Promiſe is made unto the Children, as well as unto their Parents; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Children ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93262:69"/>
Which is confirmed by theſe words of St. <hi>Matthew, Go teach all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 29. 18</note> 
               <hi>them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> now young Children are of the number of Nations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto them belongs Baptiſm; therefore they ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>You may further urge, Immediately before that Text in the <hi>Acts, Be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed every one of you,</hi> &amp;c. it is read, <hi>Repent.</hi> And in that of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> we read, <hi>Teach all Nations;</hi> and ſo Repentance and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are preſuppoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm; but young Children, who cannot uſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93262:70"/>
their Reaſon, neither are capable of one, or the other; therefore it follows, they ought not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ought to teach them that are able to be taught, and baptize them that are able to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Repentance and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are neceſſary in adult Perſons, but not in young Children. Otherwiſe it ſhould follow, that the new Law, which is a Law of Grace, ſhould be leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, than the old, which is a Law of Rigor; and that Jeſus Chriſt were come to leſſen the favours of God, and not to increaſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93262:70"/>
them; ſeeing in the old Law, young Children were circumciſed; now ſince Baptiſm is in the place of Circumciſion, weare to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize young Children, ſince they were circumciſed; and ſeeing Circumciſion, which was a Ceremony, and divine Inſtitution, did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther require Doctrine, nor Repentance in young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in adult Perſons, as it appears in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in all others who turned <hi>Jews;</hi> even ſo Baptiſm, which is a Ceremony, and a divine Inſtitution, doth neither require Faith, nor Repentance in young Children, although it doth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:93262:71"/>
               <hi>Which is confirmed by the words of St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>where it is ſaid, that</hi> They<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 13</note> brought unto Jeſus Christ little Children, that he ſhould put his hands on them, and pray, and that the Diſciples rebuking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, Jeſus ſaid, ſuffer little Children, and forbid them not to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God. <hi>From whence I argue thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom do belong the things ſignified, unto them belong the Signs alſo; as the Crown, which is the Sign and Mark of Royalty, belongs to him, to whom the Kingdom belongs; but unto little Children belongs the Kingdom of God, as it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93262:71"/>
is written in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 19. 13. Therefore unto them belongs Baptiſm, which is the Sign of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into that Kingdom. For <hi>except a man be born of</hi>

               <hi>water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Therefore young Children born with original ſin, (as it appears in ſeveral places of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, but eſpecially by theſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, By the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencof</hi>

               <hi>one, Ju dgment came upon all men to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)</hi> are not to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Baptiſm, leſt they ſhould not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; which is the Reaſon that St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93262:72"/>
and <hi>Auſtin</hi> have ſo often declared the Baptiſm of little Children to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if they brought unto Jeſus Chriſt young Children, and he put his hands on them, and prayed for them; why ſhall they not bring unto him little Children in the Church? Why ſhall not the Miniſter pray for them? And why ſhall he not confer unto them the Ceremony, or the Inſtitution of Baptiſm, as Jeſus Chriſt gave unto little Children the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Inſtitution of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands? I ask this Queſtion, whether the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Impoſition of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93262:72"/>
hands was in vain, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they received by it ſome particular Grace from Chriſt? Ye will not ſay, that it was in vain, becauſe then Jeſus Chriſt in whom were hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg, would not have uſed it; if they received by it ſome ſpecial Grace, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith, which they were not then capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, why ſhall not young Children now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Ceremony of Baptiſm, and thereby all Graces annexed unto it, though they be not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? When a Father or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93262:73"/>
Mother were baptized, all thoſe of the Houſhold were baptized alſo, as it appears<note place="margin">Act. 16. 13</note> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Lydia</hi> a ſeller of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the City of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was baptized, and her Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold; and that the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Priſon was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, he and all his. And in the firſt Chapter of the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 16</note> firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he hath baptized the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of <hi>Stephanus;</hi> but it is probable, though not convincing, that in ſo many Families there were Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>And ſince our Fathers and their Children were<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 2</note> baptized in the Cloud, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93262:73"/>
in the Sea, and they being the Figures of our Baptiſm, as is evident by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that that which is by them figured, may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Children now ought to be baptized in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. It is forbidden in ſeveral places of the holy Scriptures, to Swear, or to take an Oath.</hi> Ye have<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 33, 34.</note> heard that it hath been ſaid to them of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but I ſay unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, &amp;c. But let your Communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh o evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and in</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93262:74"/>
               <hi>the Epiſtle of St.</hi> James,<note place="margin">Jam 5 12.</note> Above all things, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſwear not, leſt ye fall into Condemnation.</p>
            <p>But the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not againſt ſwearing, or taking an Oath; yea ſhe uſes, and maintains it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; therefore ſhe believes and practiſes an Article for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; therefore ſhe is not the holy Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Before I give an Anſwer, it is neceſſary to know, that an Oath is an Invocation to God, or an Appeal to him, as a Witneſs of the Truth of what we ſay; ſo that in caſe that that we ſwear be not true, we, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, at leaſt virtually
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93262:74"/>
invoke God as a Judge and Avenger.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of Oaths, one Aſſertory, and the other Promiſſory; an aſſertory Oath is, when we promiſe by Oath ſomething that is Future; and if our promiſe be made directly and immediately to God, 'tis called a Vow; if to men, an Oath. That being ſuppoſed;</p>
            <p>I Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That an Oath is not only lawful, but alſo is ſometimes neceſſary, as when mens Eſtates are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and no Evidence can be had to decide and clear the matter, but what is aſſured by Oath. Then it is neceſſary to make an
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93262:75"/>
end of, and decide the Controverſie; as it appears by theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>An Oath for Confirmations, is to them an end of strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And its lawfulneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by ſeveral Texts of the holy Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God, who is truth it ſelf, and cannot lie, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might be believed of men upon his bare word, and without neceſſity of making an Oath, yet to confirm his promiſes, is willing to take it. For when God made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he could not ſwear by a greater, he ſware by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And verſe 17. <hi>God willing more abundantly to</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93262:75"/>
               <hi>ſhew unto the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath.</hi> Therefore if God himſelf ſwears and takes an Oath, why ſhall it not be lawful to men to take an Oath in dubious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of great Concern, and when no Evidence can be had to decide and clear them?</p>
            <p>Was not <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſpared becauſe of the Lord's Oath, that was between them, between <hi>David</hi> and<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul?</hi> Did not the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in many caſes require them? Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſe them oftentimes? as when he ſaith, <hi>God is my witneſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9. to J. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:93262:76"/>
               <hi>call God for a Record upon my Soul. Before God I lie not.</hi> Which Oaths, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was to teach the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſt to others, ſhould not have uſed, if they had been unlawful, and forbidden in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt himſelf, as ye may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 63, 64. did not refuſe it, when the High-Prieſt asked him to anſwer upon his Oath, whether he was the Son of God. <hi>I adjure thee,</hi> ſaith the High-Prieſt, <hi>by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God that thou tell us, whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God, and Jeſus ſaid unto him, thou haſt ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:93262:76"/>
Therefore ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt himſelf doth anſwer, when he is adjured upon Oath, &amp; St. <hi>Paul</hi> oftentimes called God to witneſs, for the Confirmation of what he ſaith: ſeeing <hi>David</hi> and ſeveral others have uſed it in the Old Teſtament, and God himſelf, who cannot give us a bad Example, uſed it for the Confirmation of his Promiſes, it is a clear and evident ſign, that it is lawful, and that we are to explain theſe words of St. <hi>Matthew, I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all;</hi> as alſo theſe others of St. <hi>James, above all things, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſwear not;</hi> they ought to be interpreted not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93262:77"/>
generally, but in a limited ſence, as only forbidding ſwearing in common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Commerce and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as it appears by the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz. Let your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it follows, though Swearing or Oaths ought to be avoided in our Converſations, becauſe they are then ſo many ſins, yet there is a time, and there are occaſions, as when the matter is doubtful, and of concern, and no Evidence can be had to clear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93262:77"/>
it, when they are not only lawful, but alſo very neceſſary. And therefore when at certain times, and upon certain occaſions the Church of <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to ſware or take an Oath, and believes it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſhe doth neitherbelieve, nor practiſe any thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. It is written in the 20th. Chapter of</hi> Exod. Remember to keep holy the<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 8, 9, 10.</note> Sabbath day, ſix days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93262:78"/>
Son, nor thy Daughter, thy man-Servant, nor thy maid-Servant, nor thy Cattel, nor thy Stranger that is within thy Gates, for in ſix days the Lord made Heaven, and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not keep this divine Commandment, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the firſt day of the week, inſtead of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; therefore ſhe is not the holy Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Before I give an Anſwer to this Objection, I will give leave to my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93262:78"/>
to ſay all that he can, to eſtabliſh his Opinion.</p>
            <p>When I read, ſaith he, theſe words in the 20th. Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> or when I ſee them written in great Letters in our Churches, or hear them pronounced aloud at the Communion Table, the firſt day of the week, which we call Sunday, I think that the words of <hi>Iſaiah, Hear ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 9. and Mat. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not,</hi> may be well here adapted. And may not this be juſtly attributed unto us, ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtians ſcattered in the <hi>North;</hi> we neither
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93262:79"/>
practiſe what we read, nor what we hear. And that this may appear clearly, it is neceſſary to conſider without any prejudice, that the aforeſaid words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a day determined by God, which we are bound to keep holy, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ought to reſt. But it is the ſeventh day which God kept holy, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he reſted, therefore it is that and no other, which we ought to keep holy, and whereon we are bound to reſt. That it is the day upon which God reſted, which we are bound to keep holy, appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by theſe words: <hi>In it thou ſhalt not do any work;</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:93262:79"/>
For what mean theſe words, but thou ſhalt not do any work in the day, whereon God reſted? This is the moſt natural Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a man can give to them. But God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing he ſhould be forgot by his Creatures, gives us warning, ſaying, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to keep holy the Sabbath day.</hi> And that that day is the ſeventh, which we call Saturday, appears again e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently, Firſt, by theſe words, <hi>But the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> Secondly, by the next, <hi>In ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is, and reſted the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93262:80"/>
ſeventh day.</hi> Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>God reſted on the ſeventh day from all his works, which he had made, and God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</hi> Therefore it is that day which is to be kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for it is an Axiome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> that men neither can, nor ought to change, what was eſtabliſhed and determined by God; as for Example, Water in Baptiſm, and Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper, cannot be changed by men, becauſe they have been eſtabliſhed and determined by Jeſus Chriſt, who is received as God among Chriſtians. Is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93262:80"/>
it not written, Curſed is he that addeth any thing to the Law, or diminiſheth from it? doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbid, not to think of men<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 6.</note> above that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? and doth not Chriſt himſelf ſay in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> In vain they do worſhip me teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men? That the ſeventh day is our Saturday, is again manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, Firſt, becauſe ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> who did always, and do ſtill keep the ſeventh day, do keep our Saturday for their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Secondly, Becauſe as Sabbath among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is the ſeventh day, <hi>Sabbato</hi> among the <hi>Italians,</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:93262:81"/>
               <hi>Sabbado</hi> among the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; Samedy</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi> ſo is Saturday a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men. Thirdly, Becauſe the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts ſaying in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, that Jeſus Chriſt was riſen the firſt day of the week, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Language of the Scriptures, is the next day after the Sabbath; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows evidently, our Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day preceding the firſt day of the week, and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath being the ſeventh day, that the ſeventh day is our Sabbath. But it is in vain to bring ſuch Proofs unto them, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to have changed the Saturday or ſeventh, to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93262:81"/>
the firſt day of the week. Therefore ſince our Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is the ſeventh day of the week, and God reſted on it, bleſſed, ſanctified it, and commanded us to keep it holy, is it not juſt, in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, to keep it ſo?</p>
            <p>Some will anſwer, ſaith my Adverſary, that that change was made, Firſt, That we might have no Communication with the <hi>Jews;</hi> Secondly, Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt aroſe upon the firſt day of the week; Thirdly, Becauſe we read, that the Apoſtles met on that day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:93262:82"/>
To the firſt Objection my Adverſary replyeth, that we ought to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the <hi>Jews</hi> in all things which are good: Otherwiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> believing in one God, we ſhould not believe ſo; and they believing in the Old Teſtament, it ſhould not be the Object of our Faith.</p>
            <p>To the Second he ſaith, that a Queſtion may be made, whether he roſe on the firſt day of the week; none of the Evangeliſts in the Original ſaying in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 1. Luk. 27. Joh. 2. 1.</note> words, the firſt day of the week, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> But though this be true, is it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93262:82"/>
a ſufficient Reaſon to change the day which God himſelf hath preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, bleſſed, ſanctified and commanded? We may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the day of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and keep it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but we ought not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he roſe upon the firſt day of the week, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the true Sabbath, to tranſpoſe it to another day, without an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, either of Chriſt or of his Apoſtles. And if that Reaſon were good, might we not ſay, becauſe he dyed on ſuch a day, we ought alſo to transfer the Sabbath unto it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:93262:83"/>
And to the third Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is true, ſaith he, we read in our Tranſlation, that the Apoſtles met on the firſt day of the week, but, mark ye, that it was<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1</note> 
               <hi>Concerning the Collection for the Saints,</hi> as ye may read in the 16th. Chapter of the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And though it were alſo <hi>to Preach and break Bread,</hi> as<note place="margin">Act. 20. 7.</note> it appears in the <hi>Acts;</hi> yet, ſaith he, if this Reaſon were ſufficient for the changing of the Sabbath into the firſt day of the week, this ſhould be ſufficient alſo for the continuing of it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; ſince we read that the Apoſtles met oftentimes together on the Sabbath to

pray, preach, and baptize.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 13, 14, 15.</note> And Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles were ſtrict Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-keepers, they even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. And Chriſt ſeems to favour this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when in the 24th. Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 20</note> ſpeaking not only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſtruction of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eruſalem,</hi> but alſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſaith, <hi>Pray ye, that your flight be not in the Winter, neither on the Sabbath day.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. From which words this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is deduced: In Chriſt's time the Sabbath was on the ſeventh day, therefore when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to pray, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93262:84"/>
at the day of Judgment, our flight ſhould not be on the Sabbath day, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to pray that it ſhould not come on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day; and ſince this Commandment of Chriſt is ſtill the ſame at that time, in reference to the laſt day of Judgment, the ſame day ought to continue ſtill, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Threatnings are vain.</p>
            <p>And it ſignifieth nothing to ſay, that in the words of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is ſomething moral, as the Sanctification of days without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, which cannot be aboliſhed; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93262:84"/>
Ceremonial, as the determination of a day, which may be changed. For if the determination of the ſeventh day be meerly Ceremonial, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be changed, likewiſe the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt day of the week is meerly Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and therefore may be changed alſo. Wherefore the Reaſon why this is kept rather than another, is meer Policy, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Confuſion, which we could not prevent, if there were not a day determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But if that Reaſon be valid, is it not better to take the day aſſigned by God, whereon he reſted,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93262:85"/>
which he ſanctified and bleſſed above all others? upon which he declares, he will bleſs them that keep it holy, as he will curſe and puniſh the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it; which was kept by Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded usin expreſs words, and which Chriſt doth now command; for, as I have made it appear, this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Pray ye, that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath,</hi> ſtands at this very day. Is it not better, I ſay, to take that day, than that whereof we find no Commandment in the holy Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93262:85"/>
Again, It ſignifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, it is written in the 2d. Chapter to the <hi>Coloſſians, Let no man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>judge you in meat or in drink, or in reſpect of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, or of the new Moon, or of the Sabbath days, which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt;</hi> for in this place, the word, <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> inſtead of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſeventh day could be changed into the firſt of the week, ſerves only to make it appear, we ought to have no determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned day. Therefore ſince it is certain, and granted by all men, that though we are to ſanctifie all the days of our life, that is to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93262:86"/>
ſay, to live holily; yet we ought particularly, to ſet aſide one day of the week, whereon we ought to reſt, and keep holy to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: Theſe words then of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood concerning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath aſſigned in the 20th. Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> but concerning other Sabbaths, which beſides this, the <hi>Jews</hi> did keep.</p>
            <p>It is then evident, if we lay down all prejudices, that the ſaid Objections are not ſtrong enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what is before aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> that men neither can, nor ought to change what is eſtabliſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93262:86"/>
by God, as it is the conſent of all Divines, and holy Scriptures; and notwithſtanding all that I have juſt now alledged, the Church of <hi>England</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeventh, unto the firſt day of the week, to keep it holy, it is manifeſt, ſhe breaks the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and conſequently, is not the holy Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the words contained in the fourth Commandment do not bind equally, ſome contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Commandment, as <hi>Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day;</hi> and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93262:87"/>
a Permiſſion, as, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 25.</note> the <hi>Corinthians, Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſold in the ſhambles, that eat, asking no Question for Conſcience ſake.</hi> In theſe ſorts of Expreſſions God doth not command, but gives only permiſſion and leave to eat of whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles: As well as to eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden, excepting the Tree of Life, which was forbidden our firſt Parents. It is then clear, that theſe words, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work,</hi> include but a Permiſſion; for I think
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93262:87"/>
no body will ſay, that it is not lawful to a man on any other day of the week, to abſtain from groſs and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh works, to the end he might meditate God's Works and Perfections, and apply himſelf unto Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Charity and Piety.</p>
            <p>Second Anſwer, All that are contained in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, are not, <hi>ex Jure naturali,</hi> nor belong to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, are not Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for the Preface, <hi>Hear</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>out of the Houſe of bondage,</hi> ſheweth evidently, that God ſpeaks unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93262:88"/>
to the Fleſh, as they were a Type of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Spirit; and puts them in mind of his renowned favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in delivering them out of the bondage of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as a Type of our ſpiritual Redemption, and ſlavery under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Sin, and Death. Now if either we conſider the Type, or the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, neither of them are <hi>ex Jure naturali,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Moral Law, (which is the ſame, and Immutable at all times, and among all Nations) but are grounded upon the good pleaſure of God, who, by his ſpecial goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93262:88"/>
that People, was pleaſed ſo to deal with them.</p>
            <p>Third Anſwer, Theſe words of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>In it thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy man-Servant, nor thy maid-Servant, nor thy Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, nor the Stranger which is within thy Gates,</hi> could not have relation to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when they were firſt created; becauſe in that ſtate they ſaw no ſtrangers in their Family. Theſe words were eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to the ancient <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had lived in <hi>Aegypt</hi> like ſtrangers, to the end they might learn,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93262:89"/>
when they ſhould poſſeſs the Land of Promiſe, to deal with all the World, otherwiſe than the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> had dealt with them. And therefore the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned cannot be underſtood, <hi>ex Jure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali,</hi> as belonging to the Moral Law, it being alike and the ſame among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Fourth Anſwer, The next words, <hi>For in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and allthat in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day,</hi> do not infer in themſelves an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſity; for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doubts, but that God could create this great
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93262:89"/>
World with all its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in a leſs time, yea, in a moment, if he had pleaſed; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he could appoint another day than the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth to be kept holy, as for Example, the third, if on that day he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Creation of the World. But being finiſh'd in ſix days, the Queſtion is, whether the ſeventh be of an indiſpenſable neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Fifthly, That the day aſſigned by God for his Worſhip, was Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, Myſtical, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ought to be aboliſhed, and ſo was not of an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93262:90"/>
Neceſſity, and therefore did not belong to the Moral Law. That the inſtitution of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day was ſuch, may be ſeen clearly, becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> the firſt of all men, was able by the ſtrength of his natural Reaſon, in the ſtate of Innocency, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what belonged to the Natural and Moral Law; but by the ſtrength of his Reaſon, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtand why the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ought to be kept holy, rather than another. Therefore the Reaſon of it was the good Will of God, which <hi>Adam</hi> could never underſtand of himſelf, wanting a ſpecial Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93262:90"/>
or poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, wherein the Reaſon of it might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted unto him.</p>
            <p>And it ſignifies nothing, to ſay, that it is written, we are bound to keep holy the ſeventh day <hi>for ever,</hi> becauſe by the word, <hi>for ever,</hi> is meant only a long ſpace of time aſſigned by God, as it appears in theſe Texts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 13. <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 8, 9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 13. Wherein though the word, <hi>for ever,</hi> be uſed; yet we ſay it belongs to the Ceremonial Law, and conſequently, ought to be aboliſhed under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 17.</note> where the body of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93262:91"/>
theſe things, whereof they were but a ſhadow, is made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that the Inſtitution of the ſeventh day,</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicativé ut ſic, <hi>could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, appears by the words of the Prophet</hi> Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.<note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 12.</note> I gave them my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths to be a ſign between me and them, that they might know, that I am the Lord that ſanctifie them. <hi>An by the other words of St.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 16, 17.</note> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Coloſſians, Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new Moon, or of the Sabbath days, which are ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ. <hi>Now, ſeeing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93262:91"/>
the Plural Number con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all Singulars; Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths being taken in the Plural Number, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that that contained in the Decalogue, and which is here in Diſpute, is alſo included therein: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe St.</hi> Paul <hi>would not have failed to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sabbath,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>was made for man, and not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 2. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>man for the Sabbath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> Now he that is the Lord of any thing, can diſpoſe of it as it ſeems good unto him, therefore the Son of man being Lord alſo of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, he may diſpoſe of it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93262:92"/>
as he pleaſeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might aboliſh it; and conſequently, it doth not belong to the Natural or Moral Law, which cannot be changed, even by God himſelf.</p>
            <p>And it ſignifies nothing, to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles, have kept and ſanctified the ſeventh day; for they did keep it as they did ſome other Commandments of the Ceremonial Law, which were all aboliſhed in their convenient time; to the end that they might not offend the <hi>Jews,</hi> among whom they were born, and to whom eſpecially they were to preach the holy
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93262:92"/>
Goſpel; but might convert them to Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and call them that were predeſtinated, <hi>and might by all means ſave ſome;</hi> and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note> ſo propagate the more the Kingdom of God, <hi>Which doth not conſiſt in meat and drink, or in diſtinction of ſabbaths, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it follows, that the Sanctification of the ſeventh day, <hi>reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivé ut ſic,</hi> did not belong to the Moral Law, and conſequently, might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed. I ſay, the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the ſeventh day, <hi>ut ſic,</hi> for in reference of that which is Moral, I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93262:93"/>
mean, the true Piety and Worſhip due unto God, it could not be aboliſhed, and no man in the World in whatſoever dignity, yea, nor God himſelf, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with.</p>
            <p>Now the Worſhip due unto God may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two reſpects, inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or out wardly, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the firſt ſence, it reſpects our Confidence in God, our Obedience to his Commandments, our Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Praiſes, and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings. Conſidered in the latter, it reſpects places, where are publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wherein the Word of God is preached, and his Sacraments are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93262:93"/>
In reference to the outward Worſhip due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, it is neceſſary (to avoid Confuſion from whence proceed great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils) to eſtabliſh ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to appoint certain days and hours to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that we might praiſe and worſhip our Lord, call upon his holy Name, and give thanks for all his unmeaſurable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Now the Church, to which Chriſt gave his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power, and whoſe Ordinances he will have us to keep, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by theſe words, <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 17</note> 
               <hi>let him be unto thee as an

heathen man, and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> had good and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Reaſons to change the ſeventh into the firſt day of the week. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being Typical and Myſtical, and not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Moral Law, as I have made it appear, it might be aboliſhed, as all the other Precepts of the Ceremonial Law were: For<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Christ blotting out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſeventh day being ordained unto us, to the end we might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93262:94"/>
the day and benefit of our Creation, as it appears by the words of the 11th. verſe, <hi>For in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. The Church which we ought to obey in all things, not contrary to the holy Scripture, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the day of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, yea, much more excellent than that of our Creation, as it appears by the words of Jeſus Chriſt, concerning <hi>Judas, Good</hi>

            <p>Secondly, I ſay, when the Church of <hi>England</hi> commands and uſes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers, ſhe doth not think of men above that which is written, nor tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for Doctrines the Commandments of men, becauſe in ſeveral places of the holy Scripture, we have a Command to pray, yea, to pray by a form; <hi>For when you pray,</hi> ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>pray after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Jeſus Chriſt not only commands his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to pray, but alſo to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93262:97"/>
pray after a Form, which Example they ought to follow in all other Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, 'tis a ſign that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers, which are made according to that form which by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is ſet as a Pattern, I mean, which conduce to the Glory of God, and Salvation of Souls, and wherein nothing is found contrary to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are not only lawful, but ought to be uſed in Churches, and preferred before <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers. I ſay, that they ought to be preferred before <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers; Firſt, Becauſe in this ſort of Prayers, we may let ſlip (as it happens
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93262:98"/>
too often) a bad Doctrine, or ſome points contrary to Faith; and either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration or ignorance we may ask that which is contrary to the Will of God, and hurtful to our Salvation; and what good effect can a man hope from ſuch Prayers, wherein are found ſo many Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But none of theſe faults are found in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers; we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are Orthodox, and that therein we ask nothing hurtful unto us, nor contrary to the Will of God, they being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Church, I mean, by a conſiderable number
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93262:98"/>
of learned and godly men, who before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be uſed in publick, did ſeriouſly conſider, whether they were wholly conformable to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Becauſe in the Prayer made</hi> extempore, <hi>as Dr.</hi> Beveridge <hi>did very</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge.</note> 
               <hi>well obſerve in his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sermon of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Common-Prayer,</hi> We muſt firſt liſten to what the Minister will ſay next, then we are to conſider, whether what he ſaith be agreeable to ſound Doctrine, and whether it be proper and lawful for me to joyn with him in the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he puts up to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93262:99"/>
And if we think it is ſo, then we are to do it; but before we can well do that, he is got to another thing; by which means it is very difficult, if not moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible, to joyn with him in every thing ſo regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we ought to do. But by a ſet form of Prayer, all this trouble is prevented for having the Form continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in our mind, being thorowly acquainted with it, fully approving of every thing in it, we have nothing elſe to do, whilſt the words are ſounding in our ears, but to move our hearts and our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſuitably to them, to raiſe up our deſires of thoſe good things, which are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93262:99"/>
for, to fix our minds wholly upon God, whilst we are praiſing of him, and ſo to employ, quicken, and lift up our whole Souls in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our Devotions to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I confeſs that there are unlawful Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. They being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſly Idolatrous, or elſe directly conducing to Idolatry, as ſome are found in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as to bow before Images, pray and offer Incenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But I muſt alſo confeſs, that there are ſome lawful, they either condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to have more reſpect towards God Almighty, or ſerving to incite our cold
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93262:100"/>
hearts, and inflame them with the love of God, and heavenly things.</p>
            <p>The Ceremonies which are practiſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are lawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are good, and have no other end than the edification of Souls, and to cauſe in us more and more reſpect and love towards holy and Celeſtial things; and are not contrary to the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>That there be lawful Ceremonies, it can't be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, unleſs we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the holy Scripture, and the Practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and of Jeſus Chriſt, who ordained and kept them. Which is manife
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93262:100"/>
ſted by theſe words, <hi>Now</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 2</note> 
               <hi>I praiſe you brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances, as I delivered them to you;</hi> and verſe 34. <hi>The rest will I ſet in order when I come. When ye come together,</hi> ſaith<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26.</note> the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning meeting in Churches, <hi>Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> And verſe 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> And what means all this, but that there were Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies uſed among the firſt Chriſtians in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, propoſed by them, whereof no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mention is made in the holy Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:93262:101"/>
               <hi>And to make it plain, and remove all doubt, mark the following Ceremonies. Is not the Ceremony of the holy Kiſs ordained by St.</hi> Paul, <hi>when he ſaith,</hi> Salute one another with an holy kiſs? <hi>Is not the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of putting off the Hat, commanded to every man when he prayeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God?</hi> When a man pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>ſaith</hi> Paul, he ought<note place="margin">1 Cor.</note> not to cover his head. <hi>Was not the Ceremony of the Impoſition of hands on young Children uſed by Chriſt himſelf? As in theſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 13 Mar. 10. 14</note> 
               <hi>words,</hi> They brought unto him little Children, that he ſhould put his hands on them, and pray, and the Diſciples
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93262:101"/>
rebuked them; but Jeſus ſaid, Suffer little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me, for ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven, and he laid his hands on them. <hi>Was not the Ceremony of waſhing the feet uſed by Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> He poured<note place="margin">Joh. 13. 5. &amp; v. 14, 15.</note> water into a Baſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to waſh the Diſciples feet, and to wipe them with the Towel, wherewith he was girded; and ſaith, if then your Lord and Master have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet, for I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:93262:102"/>
               <hi>Is not the Ceremony of anointing them that are ſick, ordained by St.</hi> James? <hi>When he ſaith,</hi> Is any ſick<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 14.</note> among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing him with oyl, in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>I will not here mention ſeveral other Ceremonies uſed among the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as to mingle Water with Wine, to ſignifie that the blood of Chriſt had a cleanſing virtue in it, which Myſtery was repreſented by the Water which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood, from our Saviours ſide. As to give Milk with Honey to drink unto baptized Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93262:102"/>
to ſignifie that they were like new born babes, who ought to deſire the ſweet and ſincere Milk of the Word. And as to ſtand up in all their Devotions from <hi>Easter</hi> to <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,</hi> to ſignifie that Chriſt was riſen from the dead; becauſe (though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances here mentioned may be ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to follow their Example in the uſe of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,) thoſe that I have brought out of the holy Scripture ought whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to convince us.</p>
            <p>It is then certain, that there are lawful Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which have no other end, than the Glory of God,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93262:103"/>
the Salvation of our Souls, and are not contrary to the Word of God. And that the Ceremonies command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are ſuch, I will make it appear. But, Firſt, We muſt be certain, though the Church have no Power to eſtabliſh points of Faith, belonging to God only, as it is the conſent of all Divines; yet ſhe hath power to ſet up Ceremonies, which are neceſſary, either to the decent adminiſtration, or reception of Sacraments; or to make us remember the holineſs and purity, which we ought to have, when we are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93262:103"/>
to ſing Pſalms unto God, to call upon his holy Name, to beg his Mercies, and give him thanks for all his Favours, or to inflame our hearts, and lift up our minds towards heavenly things. I ſay, that the Church hath now this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſince there is but one Catholick Church, and that the ſame now as was in the Apoſtles time, and ſince in the Apoſtles time, there were Ceremonies, as I have made it appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and may clearly be inferred from theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, let all things be done decently and in order.</hi> For what is it meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but that the Word of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93262:104"/>
God ſhould be preached, his praiſes ſung, his holy Name worſhipped and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, thankſgivings returned unto him, and his Sacraments adminiſtred and received with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies eſtabliſhed by the Church? Which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inferred from theſe words, <hi>Decently, and in order.</hi> Therefore ſince there were Ceremonies in the Church then, it is lawful now to have them; but had there been none in the Apoſtles time, it doth not follow, that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden at this. God left Authority enough to his Church to ſet any, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as I have ſaid before,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93262:104"/>
they conduce to his Glory, the Edification of Souls, and are not contrary to the holy Scripture. But the Ceremonies uſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are ſuch; therefore they are lawful. To ſhew it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>Doth not the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſign of the Croſs, uſed immediately after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm, conduce to the Edification of our Souls? Being to put us in mind, that we are not to be aſhamed, to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, but manfully to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Banner, againſt ſin, the World, and the Devil; and to continue Chriſt's
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93262:105"/>
faithful Souldiers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto our lives end. And doth not this conduce to the Glory of God? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we take from thence an occaſion to praiſe and give him thanks for his great love manifeſted unto us, in ſending his only Son into the World, to die upon the Croſs, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind. And can an y body make appear that this is contrary to the Word of God? No, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it, will undoubtedly fail in his undertaking.</p>
            <p>Is the Cuſtom of God-Fathers and God-Mothers in Baptiſm contrary to the Word of God? In what
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93262:105"/>
Chapter or Verſe is that to be found? I have read the Scripture over, and I do not remember to have read that it is forbidden. But on the contrary, I find this Cuſtom very good, yea, very neceſſary; becauſe our ſpiritual Generation, which is by Baptiſm, is in ſome manner like unto our carnal; wherefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all malice and all guile, as new born babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word.</hi> And as in carnal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Child newly born wants a Nurſe, and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to breed him up, ſo in the ſpiritual Generation of Baptiſm, ſome body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93262:106"/>
who taking the place of a Nurſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, brings up the Child, and inſtructs him in the Faith of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherefore becauſe the Miniſters cannot do it, being imployed towards the common care of the Souls committed to their Charge, and the Childs Parents may die, before he be grown to Age, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what belongs to the Chriſtian Faith, the Church requires God-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and God-Mothers, that they might receive in their Charge, the Child baptized, and promiſe to ſee him brought up to, and underſtand (as much as is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93262:106"/>
in their Power) the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Is the Cuſtom and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſtanding up in reading Hymns, Pſalms, the Goſpel, and the Creed; and of kneeling down in making our Prayers unto God, forbidden in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, have we not an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jeſus Chriſt, who prayed upon his knees, ſaying, <hi>Father, if thou be willing, remove this Cup from me, nevertheleſs, not my will, but thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we are ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the reading of Pſalms and Hymns, it is to ſhew, that we ought to lift up our mind towards
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93262:107"/>
Heaven; and by our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Creed and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we give to underſtand, that we are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them to the utmoſt of our Power, againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition whatſoever. And doth not this conduce to the Edification of our Souls, and to the Glory of God?</p>
            <p>Is the Cuſtom of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Surplice, of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and playing upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, forbidden in any Chapter of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If they were, pray inform me where it is. What evil conſequence follows therefrom? Inſtead of this, doth it not ſerve to diſtinguiſh Lay-man from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93262:107"/>
Clerk, and to cauſe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſpect to be given to the things belonging to the Worſhip of God, and to put him that wears it in mind, that when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Church to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter divine Service, he ought to be pure in his heart, which is ſignified unto him by the whiteneſs of his Surplice, which is the Symbole of Purity. And doth not Muſick and Organs, uſed eſpecially in Cathedral Churches, ſerve to raiſe up our minds; to inflame our hearts with the love of God; to lift them up towards Heaven; and to cauſe them to deſire to be for ever in that holy and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93262:108"/>
bleſſed Company, wherein with an Harmony, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſſes our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick here upon Earth, they<note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 3.</note> ſing <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> And is it not conformable to ſeveral Texts of the holy Scripture, wherein it is<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.</note> ſaid, <hi>Sing aloud unto God our ſtrength, make a joyful noiſe unto the God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>Take a Pſalm, and bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Timbrel, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Harp with the Pſaltery, blow up the Trumpet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is clear and certain, that the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are lawful, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not contrary to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93262:108"/>
Scripture, but condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Glory of God, and Edification of our Souls. Now becauſe theſe words, <hi>Not to think of men above that which is written,</hi> and theſe, <hi>In vain they do worſhip me, teaching for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood concerning Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but concerning points of Faith; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Ceremonies uſed among the firſt Chriſtians, even in Chriſts, and his Apoſtles time, whereof ſome were ſpecified (as I have made it appear alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) and ſome not ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereof no particular mention is made in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93262:109"/>
Scripture, as it may be inferred from theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, Let all things be done decently, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> it follows, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the holy Catholick Church, ſince ſhe believes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes nothing but what is agreeable to the Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>It is then without good Reaſon, that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeparate themſelves from that Church, it being the holy Catholick. For thoſe, who, knowing her to be ſuch, ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from her, are <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> and <hi>out of hope of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:93262:109"/>
Firſt, I ſay, that they are <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> becauſe they have not ſufficient Reaſon to warrant their Separation. For, as ſaith <hi>Irenaeus, Schiſmata operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
               <note place="margin">Irenaeus, lib. <hi>4.</hi>c <hi>62.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>qui ſunt immanes, non habentes Dei dilectionem, fuamque utilitatem potius conſiderantes, quàm unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Eccleſiae, &amp; propter Modicas, &amp; quaſlibet cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas magnum &amp; glorioſum corpus Christi dividant, &amp; quantum in ipſis est interfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt, pacem loquentes &amp; bellum operantes, verè li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantes culicem, &amp; Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum tranſglutientes. Thoſe are Schiſmaticks, who are cruel, having not the love of God before their eyes, but</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:93262:110"/>
               <hi>rather embracing their own In<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terest, than the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, and for ſmall and light cauſes divide the great and glorious Body of Chriſt, and murder it as much as is in their power; ſpeaking Peace, and making War, ſtraining at a Gnat, and ſwallowing a Camel.</hi> Ceremonies are no points of Faith, therefore he that ſeparates himſelf becauſe of Ceremonies, ſeparates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>light Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and therefore he is a <hi>Schiſmatick;</hi> and if he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates himſelf from the Church for ſmall and light Cauſes, as ſaith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and is granted by Divines; then
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93262:110"/>
on the other hand, he is no <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> who ſeparates himſelf for great and weighty Cauſes, as for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and other Articles of Faith, which they will have us to believe, under pain of eternal Damnation, and which are not found in the holy Scripture, or are directly contrary to it. Therefore we ſeparating our ſelves from thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for great and weighty Cauſes, it is manifeſt, we are not <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> and as no man ſhould ſeparate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a Church, for ſmall and light Reaſons, ſo he is bound to ſeparate himſelf, when he finds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93262:111"/>
that that Church believes and practiſes Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, which are not in the holy Scripture, or are directly contrary to it; which is enjoyned unto us by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come out frone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor 6. 17 Iſa. 52. 11.</note> 
               <hi>them, and be ye ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. For what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? And what Communion hath light with darkneſs? And what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord hath Christ with</hi> Belial? <hi>Or what part hath he that believes with an Infidel? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols?</hi> This is the only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cauſe of Separation, and for this Cauſe, we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93262:111"/>
our ſelves from thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or rather they ſeparte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from us, for <hi>Schiſm</hi> is not to be Imputed unto us, becauſe we believe, and practiſe nothing in the Church, but what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the holy Scripture. Wherefore it may be juſtly imputed to them, becauſe they do not only believe and practiſe, but alſo will have us to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſeveral Articles of Faith, which are neither diſtinctly contained in the holy Scripture, nor can be deduced from it by clear and neceſſary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93262:112"/>
They then that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Ceremonies, do ſeparate themſelves for <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>light Cauſes,</hi> and conſequently, are <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay, they are out of hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for as man is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a body and ſpirit; and as his body liveth by his ſpirit, whilſt it is united to the body. So if we will live by the Spirit of Chriſt, we muſt be united to Chriſt's Body; but the Myſtical Body of Chriſt is the Church, therefore they that are ſeparated from the Myſtical Body of Chriſt,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93262:112"/>
cannot be vivified by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot be ſaved; for thoſe only are ſaved, that are vivified by the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Which is very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Deluge and Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> for as all periſhed temporally by the Deluge, that were not in the Ark, ſo all ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh eternally, who are out of the Catholick Church.

            <p>If any men be Plotters, or contrive any evil againſt the King or Government, or breed Sedition and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the Kingdom, they muſt ſuffer according to the Law; but if they be

And to this end, they deſire our Saviour to give them Power to call for fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, as <hi>Elias</hi> had done in a like eaſe. But Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſeeing them in this heat, notwithſtanding all the Reaſons they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their paſſion, and for all they ſheltered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Elias,</hi> doth very calmly, but ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this temper of theirs,<note place="margin">Luke.</note> ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of;</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:93262:126"/>
               <hi>for the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> Ye own your ſelves to be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but do you conſider, what ſpirit now acts and governs you? Not that ſurely which my Doctrine deſigns to mould and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you into, which is not a furious and perſecuting and deſtructive ſpirit, but mild, and gentle and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tender of the lives and intereſt of men, even of thoſe who are our greateſt Enemies. You ought to conſider, that you are not now under the rough and ſowr diſpenſation of the Law, but the calm and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable inſtitution of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93262:127"/>
Goſpel, to which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Elias,</hi> though he was a very good man in his time, would be altogether inſuitable. God permitted it then under the imperfect way of Religion, but now under the Goſpel, it would be intolerable. No diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Religion, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Zeal for God and Chriſt, can warrant and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this paſſionate and fierce, this vindictive and exterminating ſpirit. This perſecuting, killing and deſtroying one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, is contrary to Chriſts Doctrine, for, <hi>He is not come to destroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> He came not to kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93262:127"/>
but for <hi>the healing of the Nations,</hi> for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Redemption of mankind, not only from the wrath to come, but from a great part of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and miſeries of this life.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which our Saviour here reproves in his Diſciples, is directly oppoſite to the main and fundamental Precepts of the Goſpel, which command us <hi>to love one another,</hi> and <hi>to love all men,</hi> even our very <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> and are ſo far from permitting us to perſecute thoſe who hate us, that they forbid us to hate thoſe who perſecute us: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93262:128"/>
us to <hi>be merciful, as our Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is merciful;</hi> to be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>tender-hearted, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another; if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us;</hi> and <hi>to put on as the Elect of God, bowels of mercy, meekneſs and long ſuffering;</hi> and <hi>to follow peace with all men,</hi> and <hi>to ſhew all meekneſs to all men.</hi> To all which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts nothing can be more oppoſite, than inhumane Cruelties and Perſecutions.</p>
            <p>Chriſts great buſineſs was to be beneficial to others, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; <hi>He went about doing good</hi> to the Bodies
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93262:128"/>
and to the Souls of men. He could if he had pleaſed, by his miraculous Power have confounded his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and have thundred out death and deſtruction againſt all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; but intending that his Religion ſhould be propagated in humane ways, and that men ſhould be drawn to the Profeſſion of it by <hi>the bonds of Love,</hi> and by the gentle and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable methods of Reaſon and Perſwaſion, he gave no Example of a furious Zeal, and religious Rage againſt thoſe who deſpiſed his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. When he went about making Proſelytes, he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed violence to no man, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93262:129"/>
ſaid, <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, if any man will come after me.</hi> And when his Diſciples were leaving him, he doth not (as the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> ſet up an Inquiſition to torture and puniſh them for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Faith; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſays, <hi>Will ye alſo go away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in Imitation of this bleſſed Pattern, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church continued to ſpeak and act for ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And this was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the holy Fathers, <hi>Lex nova non ſe vindicat ultore gladio. The Christian Law doth not avenge it ſelf by the Sword.</hi> This was then<note place="margin">Greg. ad Epiſc. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinop.</note> the Style of Councils, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini ad credendum vim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre.</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:93262:129"/>
               <hi>To offer Violence to no man to compel him to Faith,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nova &amp; in audita praedicatio, quae ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beribus exigit fidem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed if Hereticks and Schiſmaticks from the holy Catholick Church were to be perſecuted, the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who were both Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and had affronted our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf in his own Perſon, the honour of God, and of that Religion which he had ſet up in the World, ought certainly to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; ſo that if ever it were warrantable to put on this fierce and furious Zeal, here was a caſe that ſeemed to require it; but even in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93262:130"/>
theſe Circumſtances, Jeſus Chriſt thinks fit to rebuke and diſcountenance this ſpirit, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of.</hi> And he gives ſuch a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as ought in all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Religion, how wide ſoever they be, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men from this temper. For, ſaith he, <hi>The Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them;</hi> that is, this ſpirit is utterly inconſiſtent with the great deſign of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the end of Chriſts coming into the World.</p>
            <p>What then hath the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other whatſoever, to plead for her Perſecution to men
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93262:130"/>
for the cauſe of Religion, which <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> might not much better have pleaded for themſelves in their Caſe againſt the <hi>Samaritans?</hi> Does ſhe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe theſe ſeverities out of a Zeal for truth, and for the honour of God, and Chriſt, and the true Religion? Upon theſe very accounts it was, that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> would have called for fire from Heaven to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other whatſoever perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that thoſe whom ſhe perſecutes are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and that no Puniſhment can be too great for ſuch Offenders?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93262:131"/>
So <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were perſwaded of the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and upon much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds: For they had ſome Excuſe in their Caſe, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not; and that was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: And this Apologie JeſusChriſt makes for them, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of.</hi> But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in any other Chriſtian Church whatſoever, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Caſe of particular Perſons may be, as to the whole Church, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning part of it, this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is wilful and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and therefore inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. For the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they profeſs
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93262:131"/>
to embrace, doth as plainly teach the contrary, as it doth any other matter whatſoever: And it is not more evident in the New Teſtament, thatChriſt dyed for ſinners, than that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not perſecute and deſtroy one another for the miſ-belief of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of revealed Religion; much leſs for the diſ-belief of ſuch Articles as are inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, or are impoſed as only Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe whom we call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schiſmaticks, ſaith</hi> Salvian, <hi>do not think they are ſo.</hi> They are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks in our Opinion, but in their own they are not: For they think they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93262:132"/>
are Catholicks, in as much as they call us Hereticks; therefore what they are to us,<note place="margin">Salv.</note> we are to them. Haeretici ſunt, ſed non ſcientes apud nos ſunt haeretici, apud ſe non ſunt, nam in tantum ſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licos eſſe judicant, ut nos ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos titulo haereticae pravitatis infament. Quod ergo illi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſunt, &amp; hoc nos illis. <hi>Therefore as we would not have them to perſecute us for our Religion, ſo, we ought not to perſecute them for theirs,</hi> As ye would that all men ſhould do unto you, ſo do you unto them.</p>
