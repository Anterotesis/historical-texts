         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

and knowne, that the Aſſociation, Confederation

Corporall Signes, which man could ſee and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate

our firſt and common Father, were committed and
giuen vnto him to keepe, without diminiſhing, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or waſting of them, vpon paine of eternal death.
Wherefore wee muſt in faith beleeue, that they were
not vaine Signes and Sacraments, or as a meere and
ſimple Picture, but whereas life or death depended
on them: they comprehended both the ſignes and
thing ſignified; wherein conſiſted the knowledge and
wiſedom to feare God,<note place="margin">Prou 7. 2, 3.</note> and obey him. And therefore
they were called the Fruits of the knowledge of good
and ill, &amp; the Trees of life; For in the careful keeping
of theſe ſacred fruits, and obeying God, there was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7993:12"/>
promiſed etetnall life; whereas on the contrary, by
abuſing the Sacrraments, and oppoſing the will

any humane workes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50</note> or to bee nouriſhed with the
bloud of beaſts, or with terreſtriall fruits, yet hee had
alwayes a deſire to draw man vnto him, in an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
obedience and feare, by Signes, Sacrifices, and
Sacraments: ſo as the Sacrifice of Lambes, offered
by <hi>Abel,</hi> were agreeable and pleaſing to God. <hi>Noah</hi>
in like manner, after the inundation of waters paſt,

               <p>Moreouer, Circumciſion was appointed onely for

eight dayes after the Natiuity; and the cutting of

               <p>By which Signe, he hath inſtituted his holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

by <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> whereof notwithſtanding no
manifeſt proofe appeared. The Phrygian Montaniſts
condemne the Quartodecumans, which obſerued the
fourteenth Moneth; and that they ought herein to
bee gouerned by the courſe of the ſunne, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
it at the ſprings <hi>Aequinoctiall:</hi> And for this reaſon
they celebrated it the eight of the Ides of <hi>Aprill,</hi>
which was the fourteenth of the ſaid Moneth, though
it fell vpon a Sunday.</p>
               <p>And there was not a contention onely touching
the adminiſtration of this holy Sacrament,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 5. cap. 24.</note> on the
ſeuerall dayes aſsigned for celebrating thereof: but
there was likewiſe a notable deuiſion among the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7993:27"/>
Chriſtians, about the Ceremonies inuented, whereby
worthily to receyue the ſame. For ſome, as in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> obſerued the Faſt, or Euen, three
weekes before the day it ſelfe of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The <hi>Illyrians,</hi>
and all <hi>Greece,</hi> as likewiſe the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Quadrageſima, to faſt for ſixe weekes. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ordained a ſeuen weekes abſtinence, with an
Intermiſsion from fiue to fiue dayes.</p>
               <p>Then was another Iewiſh Ceremonie reſtored,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Tripar. Chap 38.</note> the
more to corrupt the holy Sacrament of the Supper,
through diffrence and diſtinction of meats. For ſome
prohibited during the Feaſt, the eating either of Fiſh,
or Fleſh: Others forbade the vſe of Fleſh onely, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
men to eate Fiſh, or Fowle; which they ſaid,
according to <hi>Moſes,</hi> did participate of the ſubſtance
of the Water. Some in like manner ordained, that
men ſhould only eate bread and Water: Others faſted
till noone, without any diſtinction of meates. And
to reſolue briefly: there was in the beginning, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Corruptions and Cuſtomes, in the
Communion of the holy Sacrament of the Supper, by
meanes of the Ceremonies renewed, about difference
of daies and meates, abrogated by the Grace and
Law of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But was there any holy Apoſtle of God,<note place="margin">Col. 2. Galat. 4. Heb. 7.</note> that euer
left in writing any Law or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of daies and meates, in celebrating the holy
Supper of Ieſus Chriſt? Their intention was not to
inſtitute a Religion of Feaſts, a diſtinction of dayes
and meates: Their Doctrine onely aimed to inſtruct
men how to liue well; and that one onely God was
to be adored and worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we muſt neceſſarily hereupon inferre,
that the Ceremony and Feſtiuity of the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> or Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
proceeded from a cuſtome; for none of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
left any thing thereof in writing.</p>

To qualifie ſuch Diſſentions and Corruptions,<note place="margin">Hist. Tripar. lib. 9. cap. 38.</note>
many Councels were aſſembled; one, at <hi>Sangariae</hi> in
<hi>Bithinia;</hi> by which, to auoid all contentions, euery
man was apermitted to celebrate the Paſſeouer, when
he would.<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 5. cap. 23</note> Another Councell was held in <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> by

               <p>After theſe petty corruptions, there ſucceeded

                  <note place="margin">In the yeere of Chriſt, 114.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1.
of that name, being raiſed to the ſuperintendencie of

the mingling of water with Wine, before the

the holy Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, which inſtituted the
Communion of his Body and Bloud, vnder the two
kindes of Bread and Wine; but <hi>Alexander</hi> added
thereunto a third kind, which was water.</p>
               <p>He alſo renewed the Iewiſh ceremony of vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
bread, wherewith to celebrate the Paſſeouer, as
the Iewes did; following herein the opinion of the
<hi>Ebionites,</hi> who taught, that the Ceremoniall Law of

As alſo, if it were His pleaſure, for
accompliſhing the Law of Ceremonies, to vſe one
daies appointed vnleauened Bread, muſt wee needs
therefore returne to the rigour of this Ceremonie,
abrogated by the complete Sacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt?
In what place of Scripture did <hi>Alexander</hi> learne to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7993:28"/>
mingle water with Wine? and to reſtraine Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to vnleauened Bread; as alſo his other inuention,

               <p>As for the Purgatory Water by him ordained, wee

But touching the mixture of water with Wine,
he might peraduenture be inſtructed by the ancient
Idolaters; who, in celebrating their ſacrifices, were
wont, in a Chalice, to conſecrate Water with Bread:
eſpecially vpon the Feſtiuals dedicated to the Sunne,
which the <hi>Perſians</hi> worſhipped, called by them, <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thros.</hi>
And in the Feaſt of the <hi>Nephalies,</hi> they alſo
vſed Water for ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>With this compariſon,<note place="margin">Iuſtin. in Apolo. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> relates the

in the conſecration of Bread, Wine, and Water:
by the one, which is to ſay by the Idolaters, in the
name of their Idols; and by Chriſtians, in the Name
of their True God.</p>
               <p>And yet this firſt corruption in the adminiſtration
of the holy Sacrament, by the mixture of water with
Wine, perſeuered not without contradiction: For
the <hi>Greekes</hi> were of a contrary opinion;<note place="margin">Inno lib. 4. cap. 5. de officio Diſial.</note> and that it
was not requiſite to brew water with Wine, neither
would they herein follow the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amarcanus</hi> was of the ſame opinion as <hi>Alexander;</hi>
affirming, that the mixture of water with Wine was
neceſſary. <hi>Scotus</hi> the ſubtile Sophiſter, abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that it was neceſſary to mingle the water with
the Wine: becauſe, ſaith he, it cannot then be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
nor tranſubſtantiated into Bloud, except the ſame
were firſt changed into Wine.</p>
               <p>Some others, more ingenious, laboured to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
this Inſtitution of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by alleadging, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7993:28"/>
the wine was conuerted into blood: but as for the
water, it was tranſubſtantiated into the water that
came out of Chriſts ſide.</p>
               <p>This firſt corruption of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> gaue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

wherewith to beſmeare the bread of the holy Supper
of Ieſus Chriſt as the Cataphrigians, who brought
in a kinde of tranſubſtantiation of wine into bloud,
really and corporlly.</p>
               <p>Some others added cheeſe thereunto,<note place="margin">Epiphan. lib. 2. tom. 5. haeret. 49.</note> called Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirites;
which is to ſay, Cheeſe-bread-mongers. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
alſo abuſing this holy Sacrament, in ſtead of
wine, put in water, vnder pretext of the greater
abſtinence. Others had an Inſtitution of ſteeping
bread in the wine, the which cuſtome the Meſſalians
alſo retained in their Miſſall ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>For another deteſtable corruption of this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
ſome Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> forbade their Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
ſacrificers, not to adminiſter to Chriſtian people,
whom they call Lay-men, the Body of Ieſus Chriſt
in both kindes, but onely vnder the ſacred ſigne of
Bread, and not of Wine; which they reſerued for
their Meſſalian ſacrificing Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Is not this corruption directly againſt the holy
Goſpel, and Inſtitution of the Supper of Ieſus Chriſt,
ordained and commaunded, that all faithfull men
ſhould eate his body, and drinke of his blood? When
he tooke the Cup, did he not vſe theſe proper words?
Drinke all of this Wine, in memoriall of my Bloud
ſhed? Vſed hee any other words for the eating of his
Bodie in the ſymbole of Bread, then hee did of
his Blond,<note place="margin">Matth. 29. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Corint. 11.</note> vnder the ſigne of Wine? For if wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the ſacred ſigne, ordained by God in the Church
of the Iſraelites, being a Figure of the Communion of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7993:29"/>
the body of Ieſus Chriſt, which was the true Paſchal
Lambe, whoſe fleſh was ordained to bee eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the Iewes; betweene the Leuites being of the
race of ſacrificing Prieſts, and others of the common

               <p>To bring in another odious corruption, the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians
inſtituted in their Miſſall-Idolatries, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and offer the Body and Bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterating
by this means the Sacrifice fully conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Ieſus Chriſt, which cannot bee reiterated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was, not according to the forme of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
but of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11,</note> the Eternall Sacrifizer and
Prieſt, without leauing any ſucceſſor. As alſo when
the Apoſtle admoniſhed the Corinthians to celebrate
ſacredly the Supper of Ieſus Chriſt, were they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſacrifice? No; but to eate, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
together of the Body, &amp; to drinke of the blood
of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the Supper, was not to kill or
immolate, or to ſacrifice any beaſt, or oblation to
God; but onely to eate and drinke at his holy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
prepared for vs by Ieſus Chriſt, the Eternall
ſacrifice, and Sacrificer; who reſerued onely for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
this Eternall Prieſthood; yet neuertheleſſe, hee
left vnto vs a ſacred Inſtitution of a banquet, ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs in the Bread and Wine, which repreſent his
Body and Bloud.</p>
               <p>After theſe aboue-named corruptions, Satan, a
diligent Babylonian Architect, employed all his
power and means, to rayſe an inexpugnable Fort of
Idolatry; to the end that hee might wholly demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and ſubuert the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, when
hee vndertooke to ſuborne the Maſſe, in ſtead of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7993:29"/>
holy Sacrament of the Supper, as wee will briefly

               <p>All of them, as well as my ſelfe, will confeſſe, that
the ancient Romane Religion was either wholly, or
for the greateſt part inſtituted by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi>
the ſecond King of the Romanes, about ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres before the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt.
Then were your high Prieſts inueſted, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
were reduced to a certaine number,<note place="margin">Titiuill. lib. 1. deca. 1.</note> euen to
foure: then the number was augmented to eight:
and afterwards by <hi>Silla</hi> to fifteene.</p>
               <p>In the Colledge of Prieſts,<note place="margin">Feneſtell. lib. de Magiſt. Rom.</note> there was one <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex

the pettie Prieſt purple-Cardinals make the election
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7993:30"/>
of their great Romane Pope, out of their place, order,
and dignitie.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Pompilian</hi> Religion was ſo religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the Romanes from father to ſonne, as it was
neuer poſsible to irradicate, or ſupplant it: but it
continues euen to this day, as euery one ſhall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly

               <p>To confirme this point, no man can be ignorant, if

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7993:35"/>
the Author of the Romane Religion <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi>
neuer thought of the Hebrewes, when he firſt inſtituted
the Maſſe: neither can this word <hi>Miſſa,</hi> or <hi>Meſſe,</hi> take
originall from the Greekes. Becauſe there is no ſacrifice
of this name or title, though ſome haue brought in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
reaſon from this Greeke word <hi>Myzein,</hi> which
is to ſay in French; to hide or keepe in ſecret: as if the
<hi>Meſſalian</hi> Sacrificers receiued from the auncient idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Greekes, to mumble ſecretly the principall words
of their Maſſes, that the Auditors might not heare them:
but they vſed to murmur and whiſper betwixt the teeth,
the Canons, and ſome ſpeciall words, which neither
themſelues, nor they that looke on vnderſtand. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
neither the Hebrew nor Greeke words cannot
properly be applyed to the <hi>Miſſall</hi> Sacrifice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt repaire to the true etimologie of the word
<hi>Miſſa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Maſſe drawne from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Latine Romanes.</note> or <hi>Meſſe,</hi> drawne from the ancient Latine Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,

and <hi>Miſſio:</hi> euen as in French we have <hi>Meſſager, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,</hi>
and <hi>Meſſiues,</hi> for letters ſent. Wherefore, when the
ancient Romane Idolaters meant to diſmiſſe the Aſſiſtants
at the Sacrifices celebrated, they pronounced in the end
theſe words.<note place="margin">Amongſt the Greekes the Prieſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſpake aloud in this manner.</note>

of the Paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, ſay, that by the

in his Treatiſe of <hi>Dreames,</hi> ſubtilly deuiſeth, that the <hi>Aube</hi>
ſignifies the ſolidity of the moſt reſplendant light of the
Dyetie, which he calls <hi>Ens.</hi> The linnen alſo whereof the
<hi>Aube</hi> is made, they expreſſe for the ſubtilty of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
As for the <hi>Amict</hi> inuented by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> they adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
it, for the Vayle wherewith Chriſt was couered,
when the Iewes mocking him in <hi>Caiphas</hi> houſe, did ſmite
him. <hi>Titilman</hi> one of the ſubtileſt Miſſalians, deuiſeth,
that in the <hi>Amict,</hi> Chriſts Deuinity, concealed in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
was intimated. Some likewiſe confeſſe, that the
<hi>Amict</hi> was ſubrogated in ſtead of the Iewiſh <hi>Ephod,</hi> by
the <hi>Zone, Maniple,</hi> and <hi>Stole,</hi> which are three Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they vnderſtand the three Cordes wherewith
Chriſt was bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drawne before the high Prieſts:
and after that, before the Romane Lieutenants in <hi>Iudea.
Biel</hi> another pregnant Miſſalian, by the <hi>Zone,</hi> conceiues
the rods wherwith Chriſt was ſcourged: By the <hi>Stole,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in forme of a Croſſe, there was ſignified the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
or Croſſe, which Chriſt bare vpon his ſhoulders. The
Maniple alſo which he weares on his left arme, to figure
the band of loue, wherewith Chriſt was bound. Another
Mummerie they haue for the Zone, wherewith the <hi>Aube</hi>
is truſſed, and this ſignifies the band of Gods charity.
The Stole put ouer the Amict, at the Miſſalians necke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
forme of a Croſſe, deciphers Chriſts obedience, euen to
the death of the Croſſe. The Maniple worne on the left
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7993:37"/>
hand, ſignifies the reward of Chriſts eternall felicitie. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſophiſtries there are vpon the Amict, as that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
faith: the Stole humility and obedience: the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the vigilancie and hearty deuotion of the Miſſalian
Prieſt. <hi>Tittilman</hi> hath another ſubtle deuiſe for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niple
worne on the Prieſts left hand; which as he ſaies,
doth expreſſe the battaile and power of Chriſt, againſt
all viſible and inuiſible dominations, being as a buckler
againſt all temptations: and the Buttons of the Maniple,
portend finall perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>He alſo further ſophiſticates, that by the left hand is
vnderſtood the humane infirmity of Chriſt, which being
tyed with the Maniple, that Chriſt is tyed and bound by
his diuinitie, like a mad man. <hi>Brunus</hi> another Miſſalian
Doctor, fantaſticates, that by the Maniple is inferred the
Miſſalian Prieſts ſpeciall care to driue away bad affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
or elſe that it figures the Cord, wherewith Chriſt
was bound by the Iewes; and that the Stole is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Lords yoake, which the Maſſe-prieſt muſt
weare garniſhed with the Armes of Iuſtice on the right
and on the left hand. The other painted Ornament inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
formerly by the Magitian <hi>Numa,</hi> they diſguiſe by
the name of a Planet, as an errant Veſtment; otherwiſe
called a Cap, or Chaſuble, which they ſay reſembles the
Purple Robe preſented to Chriſt, in <hi>Pilates</hi> Hall, when
they mocked and called him King of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>There is another ſophiſtrie, how this Veſtment implies
the Nature of Chriſt, wherein the Deity was couched.
<hi>Philo</hi> the Iew immitating <hi>Plato,</hi> interprets this Veſtment
ſo adorned with colours, to be a Figure of the ſignes, and
coeleſtiall Starres. Now the Maſſe-Prieſt being roabed,
with his Aube, Amict, Zone, Maniple, Stole, and his
Chaſuble, or Cap of diuers colours; he muſt ſtretch out
his armes, to play two parts at an inſtant, repreſented by
the Chaſuble, whoſe quarter before, is leſſe then that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,

If <hi>Alexander</hi> had not yeelded to the vſe of ſalt,

would rather haue followed the Iewiſh ceremonie, and

that is to ſay, little round loaues dedicated to diuers

the Miſſalian Doctors ordained the Prieſt, to vtter
certaine exorciſmes, and coniurations, with many ſignes of
the croſſe. Firſt, hee muſt make three croſſes vpon this
round hoſt, to figure the trinall tradition of Chriſt; that
is to ſay, by the Father, by himſelfe Chriſt, and by the holy
Ghoſt, in pronouncing theſe words; <hi>Haec dona, haec
munera, haec ſancta ſacrificia illibata.</hi> Some other

the Maſſe-Prieſt continuing in his fooleries and moncke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſtretcheth out his armes, to delineate Chriſt ſpred
vpon the Croſſe: then, he lifts the round hoſt printed with
imagery on high, that it may be adored: Afterwards, he
returnes to make three croſſes; one ouer the hoſt, another
ouer the Chalice, and a third ouer himſelfe: to play herein
the part of three eſtates or conditions: of thoſe that are in
Heauen, in Purgatory, and in the earth. Then he thumps
vpon his breſt, to play the penitent theefe that was hanged
vpon the Croſſe. This thumping of his ſtomacke muſt bee
performed with the three laſt fingers of his hand, becauſe
the thumbe and the next finger are reſerued to conſecrate
and tranſubſtantiate the round hoſt. Moreouer, he muſt
beat his breſt three times, to figure a triple offence, of the
heart, of the mouth, and of reall act; exalting his voice,
to repreſent the Theefe or the Centurion which confeſſed
God in the Paſſion. Sixe other Croiſadoes are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the three houres that Chriſt hung aliue vpon
the Croſſe; and three other croſſes are made ouer the
open Chalice, and the round hoſt, being once more eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to decypher the three houres, that Chriſt hung dead
vpon the Croſſe. Then does he adde two other croſſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Maſſe-monger hath kiſt his Chalice, to deſcribe
the myſtery of blood and water iſſuing out of Chriſts ſides.
Beſides all the aboue mentioned mute mummeries, the
Prieſt muſt lift the vaile ouer the Chalice, and releaſe
it from the Plataine, to repreſent the rent vaile in the
midſt, at Chriſts death. This being done, the round hoſt
is laid vpon the Chalice, and couched in the corporall, to
figure the burial of Chriſt. When the Maſſe prieſt hath
plaia the part of the hang'd theefe, of the traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> of
Chriſt, of the Publicanes, hee afterwards comoediates
the Centurion, ſinging the Pater Noſter. But <hi>Durandus

vertues; or the ſeuen mortall ſinnes. When this ſong is
ended, the Prieſt remaines ſilent for a while, to repreſent
the ſilence and repoſe of Chriſt in the graue. Another ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or monckery is plaid by the Maſſe-prieſt, with the
round hoſt, which he layes vpon the Pix, to decypher the
vnion of his diuinity with his humanity: but when hee
plaies the ſecret myſtery, the hoſt is hidden out of ſight.</q>

neither grew to this abominable idolatry: what

the Maieſtie of God in the forme of humane ſimilitude

Miſſalians,<note place="margin">Againſt the idolatry of round Hoſts.</note> to corrupt the holy ſacrament of the Supper
of Ieſus Chriſt, in deuiſing theſe little round loaues and
Hoſts, but the Magician <hi>Numa?</hi> When Ieſus Chriſt
celebrated the holy Supper with the Apoſtles, did he
appoint them to haue little loaues or round Hoſts, to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7993:51"/>
print them with humane characters and effigies, to
coniure and exorciſe them with croſſes and croyſadoes
in equall or vnequall numbers, and cauſe them to bee

more then ſeuen hundred years before the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Ieſus Chriſt; who did not inſtitute for you
theſe rotundall hoſts, or that they ſhould bee rather
round then ſquare, tryangle or octangle: ſo farre hee
was from ordaining the round figure correſpondent
to <hi>Numaes</hi> forme, that on the contrary, when he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the Sacrament of the Communion of his body,
he vſed a fraction of bread by morſels, which he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to his Apoſtles, for a Symbole, ſigne, and figure,
ſignifying really and ſacramentally his body by the
power of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And the Miſſalians haue not onely made choice of
the round forme in their conſecrated hoſts, printed
with Images, to make them be adored after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the ancient Romans: but moreouer they haue
exceeded all other Idolaters. For in the daies of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>

them that aſſiſt in their Miſſall ſacrifices?</p>
               <p>Is this to follow the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, who
brake the bread and diſtributed it to his Apoſtles?
Ieſus Chriſt the eternall Prieſt, ſtood he alone neere to

Images, when he celebrated the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of his
body. O you Miſſalians, more deteſtable, and leſſe chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Idolaters, then all the other ancient Romanes;
can you ſo ſophiſticate and iuggle, as to procure your
Miſſall ſacrifice (wherein the Prieſt alone deuoures
the little round printed Hoſt with Images, giuing no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7993:52"/>
ſhare of it to others) to be taken and receiued as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
cauſing them that are preſent at your Maſſe
by an admirable Magicke to beleeue, that they haue
communicated together with the Prieſt, though they
neither eate, nor receiue any portion of the round
Hoſt.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And yet further, for a more extreame Idolatry, the Miſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Doctors Interpreters informe, that the round Hoſt
muſt be diuided into three parts, one for thoſe that are in
Paradiſe, another for thoſe that are in Purgatory, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
remiſſion of their ſinnes, and a third ſteept in wine,
for thoſe that are liuing in the world. But <hi>Durands</hi>
Alcoran ſets downe, that the three broken portions of the
Hoſt, repreſents the triple forme of Chriſts body, ſleeping
in the graue, lying on the earth, and afterwards raiſed
vp from the dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Biel</hi> another ſubtil Doctor, not to confeſſe the body
of Chriſt to be broken or bruiſed in the round hoſt, deuiſeth
the fraction of the Hoſt to be made of an accident without

ſoules that are in Paradiſe, or Purgatory communicate:
inſtituted by <hi>Sergius</hi> a Mahumetan Doctor, by the

               <p>But peraduenture (Miſſalians) you may obiect vnto

               <p>The round Hoſt is azimall, and the holy bread made

the round Hoſt is adored, and the holy bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

the round Hoſt is in part ſteeped in wine, and the holy

               <p>To conclude, there is ſo great a difference betweene
theſe two ſeuerall Communions, as there is betweene
the law of the ancient Idolaters, and the Law Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall:

when mention is made of ſacred ſignes, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
or ſacrifices ordained by God, is it ſaid that
the ſigne or ſacrament was tranſubſtantiated? But on

as ſuccinctly we haue before declared.</p>
               <p>But tell me O Miſſalians, when Ieſus Chriſt made
it knowne how himſelfe was the true bread of life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from heauen, to conferre life eternall; and how
theſe ſacramentall words of eating his fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his blood,<note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Ieſus Chriſt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eating of his body.</note> were to be vnderſtood, wherewith the

teach vs in this interpretation, that to eate his fleſh
ſhould be meant, by a little round tranſubſtantiated
hoſt? that the round hoſt of flower, and the wine, is no
more bread or wine, but accidents without ſubſtance?
Is this your abhominable magicke, the doctrine of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. Nothing leſſe. But Ieſus Chriſt like a true
and heauenly Lawgiuer, who can onely ſincerely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
his owne law, made anſwer to the Capernait Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
how they were groſſe and carnall minded,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note>
minding onely the fleſh, as you Miſſalians doe, though
the fleſh alone profits nothing: alleaging how his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
words were ſpirituall: The fleſh ſaith he, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
nothing: but the ſpirit quickens. As alſo, O Miſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
how can you religiouſly accord your tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
with the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
and aſſureth eternall life to thoſe, that ſhall eate
his fleſh, and drinke his blood, if you conceiue theſe
words carnally? For you cannot be ignorant, but that
your owne bodies when they haue deuoured theſe
round tranſubſtantiated hoſts into fleſh and bones,
drunke and taken downe the tranſubſtantiated wine
into blood, notwithſtanding liue &amp; are mortal through
the neceſſity of the law. Wherefore eternall life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
by this communion, cannot be vnderſtood by a
mortall body, or fleſh. And therefore of neceſſity you
muſt needs acknowledge, for the moſt ſacred interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that to eate the body and drinke the blood of
Ieſus Chriſt, muſt haue reference to a ſpirituall and

heauenly life: and that the fleſh profits nothing, but
the ſpirituall words; and the communion of the body

               <p>Another interpretation of the holy Doctor and
author of the ſacramentall law is deſcribed, when Ieſus
Chriſt was interrogated by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> of the meanes
how a man might be regenerated, and borne anew. Is
it poſſible ſaith <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> that a man can returne again
into his mothers wombe? Did Ieſus Chriſt anſwer
this demand, by affirming that in the holy ſacrament of
Baptiſme, the water was conuerted into the body, into
fleſh &amp; blood, and tranſubſtantiated in a carnall womb,
to be there againe ingendered and regenerate? Was
there not alſo as great reaſon, according to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,
to haue returned this anſwer, as well as in the
holy Sacrament of the Supper? for by the one of theſe
two Sacraments, we are regenerated, and by the other
nouriſht. Now regeneration is as admirable to humane
wiſdome, as nouriſhment; for conformable to humane
and carnall iudgement it may ſeeme vnpoſſible, that
we can be twice engendered and begotten. But our
good God vſeth the like interpretation of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as of the communion of his fleſh and blood:
which is, that theſe ſacramentall termes muſt bee ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
conceiued, and not carnally: for the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
not; but the ſpirit quickens. What is of the fleſh
is carnall, what of the ſpirit, ſpirituall.</p>

we haue aſſurance of eternall life; euen as bread
and Wine ſerue for corporall nouriſhment, and that he
meant and ordained theſe ſacred ſignes, to bee to vs for

determin we ſhould hereby Capernize, &amp; Nicodemize,
to enquire, or make doubt of Gods power how it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to eate the body, or drinke the blood of Ieſus

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7993:60"/>
to beleeue, that the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt
was really and ſacramentally offered, to communicate
thereof for our ſpirituall nouriſhment, and to grant vs
eternall life, through the Bread and Wine conſecrated,
with giuing of thankes; the bread being truely his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and the Wine his Blood, which we muſt worthily
receiue by faith, and puritie of conſcience, as ſacred
ſignes and markes of the diuine Character, without
ſearching too ſubtilly after the meanes, other then the
plaine interpretation of Ieſus Chriſt, that the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits

are ſpirit and life? Should wee doubt whether God
hath power, by the ſymboles of Bread and Wine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to make vs communicate of the bodie and
blood of Ieſus Chriſt, though the bread remaine bread,
and the wine wine? If it were otherwiſe, this could be

the miracle of tranſubſtantiation,<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> changing the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

as he did the communion of his body &amp; blood

               <p>Was it not alſo as eaſie for God to change the Wine

Againe the ſame author vſeth this interpretation, The
Sacrament viſible is the new Teſtament, that is to ſay,
the ſacred ſigne of the inuiſible ſacrifice: the like inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations

Wherefore then O Miſſalians, haue you not followed
the authority of theſe holy Doctors, of the Church
which would not blaſphem againſt God by the magick
of tranſubſtantiation, but haue freely and vertuouſly

in offring himſelfe his ſoule to God, for the
which Chriſt Ieſus was crucified; &amp; that by that holy
