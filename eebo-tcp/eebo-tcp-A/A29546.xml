            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Freehold Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> it ſelf the beſt Fund or Security.</head>
            <p>AFTER ſo many Aſſurances given by ſome Perſons, to furniſh the Freeholders of <hi>England</hi> with Money, upon the Securities of their Eſtates, one would have thought no Landed-Man in the Kingdom could have remained under any Difficulty to raiſe Money for ſupplying his Occaſions, or to clear off his Incumbrances, and that Leaſes of Ejectment, and <hi>Sub-poena</hi>'s in Chancery to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe <hi>Equities of Redemption,</hi> would have been out of Date; but notwithſtanding all that hath been promiſed, we find the Freeholders under as bad if not worſe Circumſtances than ever. The Bank of <hi>England,</hi> who have cauſed many Advertiſements to be inſerted in the <hi>Gazettes,</hi> of furniſhing the Freeholders with Money at 5 l. <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> not meeting with one Title in an hundred that will pleaſe them, have turn'd the Current of their Buſineſs another way, and are ſetting up Banks in Foreign Countries, leaving the poor Freeholders to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Orphans Bank</hi> have ſet out an Order to lend Money upon a Depoſite of Gold or Silver, and to diſcount Bills of Exchange at 3 l. <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> but mention not one word of lending Money on Land-Security.</p>
            <p>In fine, tho all make uſe of that pleaſing and popular Argument, of eaſing the Freeholders, and raiſing the Value of Land, yet not one ſtep hath been taken therein, nor muſt we expect ever will, ſo long as the Management is in private Hands, and not by Perſons appointed either by the Publick, or by the Freeholders themſelves; but all that hath been ſaid or promiſed (if one may have leave to judg by Mens Actions) ſeems only a Pretence, without the leaſt Reality or Purpoſe to perform the ſame. Now when the <hi>Revenue of the Exciſe,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Income ſettled on the Orphans,</hi> the <hi>Lottery-Tickets,</hi> the <hi>Annuities for Lives,</hi> and indeed almoſt any thing that has but the face of a Security, altho depending on Contingencies, are made uſe of for Funds whereupon to iſſue out Bills, and have ſome of them actual Credit for three times more than the real Value; It cannot but ſeem ſtrange to any conſidering Man, that the <hi>Freehold Eſtates</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or rather <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, which all muſt acknowledg to be the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of thoſe Funds, ſhould be diſregarded; and the iſſuing out Bills on Land-Security for a far leſs Sum than the Value, ſhould be ridiculed, and made a Jeſt of: yet ſome People have had ſo little Senſe as to paſs their Cenſures on my Propoſals to the Parliament, for iſſuing out <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on Land-Security; and the Bill which was brought in by Mr. <hi>Brockman</hi> this laſt Seſſions by Order of the Honourable the Houſe of Commons, entituled, <hi>An Act for the Improvement of the Freehold Eſtates of</hi> England, <hi>and the Encouragement of Trade,</hi> and which was referr'd to a Committee, who made a conſiderable Progreſs therein, was by ſome Perſons op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for no other Reaſon as I could ever hear of, but becauſe it would have been prejudicial to their particular Intereſts. I did therefore once deſign to have printed a Breviate of the ſaid Bill, that all Perſons might have ſeen whether the ſame was reaſonable or practicable; but upon further Conſideration I forbore it, finding too many led more by Humour than Reaſon, and that they will not believe any thing poſſible to be done, until they ſee it effected. I ſhall therefore (being encouraged ſo to do by ſeveral Perſons of great Worth) reduce the ſame into Practice, and to lay the Foundation of a <hi>National Bank</hi> (and probably the greateſt Bank in the World) ſo far as it is capable of being done, without the Aſſiſtance of an Act of Parliament; ſtill ſubmitting the ſame to ſuch Regulations, Alterations, or Amendments as the great Council of the Kingdom ſhall in their Wiſdom at any time hereafter think needful to make.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps who are deſirous to keep the Freeholders Necks ſtill under the Servile Yoke of 6 l. <hi>per Cent. per Annum</hi> Intereſt, beſides other Charges, which with the Taxes hath eaten up ſeveral of their Eſtates, may make trivial Objections againſt theſe my Propoſals, and demand where will the Money be found to anſwer the Bills of Credit? But I do not think my ſelf obliged to acquaint every impertinent Queriſt with the Methods I have to propoſe for raiſing a Fund of Money: It is ſufficient I have hitherto born the whole Charge of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this Buſineſs, which when accompliſhed will be ſo greatly for the Freeholders Advantage, and <hi>will more than double the Value of their Eſtates.</hi> All that I deſire of the Freeholders is that they will enable me to do it by ſubſcribing, and ſettling their Eſtates in Truſt upon <unclear>credible</unclear> and ſubſtantial Perſons of their own naming, and to chooſe ſome from among themſelves to put in Practice thoſe Methods I have to lay before them, ſo far forth as they ſhall appear agreeable to Reaſon and no farther.</p>
