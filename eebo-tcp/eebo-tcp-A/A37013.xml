            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN this Corrupted Age where <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> are as frozen as <hi>Charity,</hi> and where timorous and unsettled Hearts are so irresolute and wavering, that they had rather side with <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> for the sake of <hi>Interest</hi> or fear of Particular disquietude, than give a generous Vote or Assistance to a Cause Noble and Honest, who can expect this <hi>Play,</hi> though written upon an excellent and never to be forgotten <hi>Theam,</hi> should meet a favourable Reception; when there are so few that feelingly remember the fatal Scene of <hi>Boscabell;</hi> and so <hi>many,</hi> who though they do, yet resolve rather to look on it as an <hi>Exigence</hi> of <hi>Fortune</hi> than the <hi>Effect</hi> of their own <hi>Villany:</hi> However to those <hi>few</hi> do I Dedicate this <hi>Comedy,</hi> grac't with His Majesties <hi>Royal Approbation</hi> and <hi>Presence,</hi> and second to none in Loyal Candor and Honesty, tho modesty excusing its Defects, when compar'd with some excellent Authors. And as the Moral Ancients, in the mid'st of all their Feasts and Luxurious Entertainments plac't a dead Man's Scull upon the Table to qualify their Ioy, and give a Contemplative Reflection of their Mortality, so would I have every Impartial Royalist look on the <hi>first Act</hi> of this Play as a <hi>Memento</hi> of <hi>past,</hi> or as a <hi>Caveat</hi> of <hi>future</hi> Mischiefs and Diabolical Practices.</p>
            <p>I have heard some Knights of the <hi>Geneva Order,</hi> otherwise dignified with the Titles of <hi>Viceroys</hi> to the new Elected Warpt Monarch of <hi>Poland,</hi> often muttering to this effect, <hi>That His Majesty having past his Royal Seal to the Writ of Oblivion, should not in Justice suffer his Licentious Subjects to upbraid or 'twit 'em with the Crimes or Treasons of their Friends and Ancestors;</hi> to which the King, according to his


<pb facs="tcp:54476:3"/>
accustomed Goodness and Clemency, answers, <hi>With all my heart.</hi> But says the good Subject, <hi>This Act of Oblivion is out of date and cancell'd, not only by the three years Expiration—but by their new repeated Associations and Treasons: Nor is it proper we should forget (though the King can) offences of that barbarous and unparallell'd nature, but rather strive with our utmost vigillance and power to oppose and detect 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then starts up an Old Stanch <hi>Whigg,</hi> that perhaps was a little before <hi>Foreman</hi> of a Iury, and suppos'd to be <hi>more capable</hi> for that office, because he <hi>formerly</hi> headed the <hi>Rabble</hi> down to <hi>White-hall,</hi> to demand Iustice against that Glorious Monarch and Father of his Country King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the first. I name no Body, for fear of <hi>Ten Thousand Pound Actions,</hi> but the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be <hi>easily</hi> found out; for as a true bred Spaniel can know a Thief by the <hi>villainous scent</hi> he carrys, so can a true bred <hi>Royalist,</hi> a stigmatiz'd <hi>Rebel.</hi> But begging pardon for my digression, this <hi>Whigg</hi> (I say) just reeking from the <hi>Amsterdam Coffee-house,</hi> and fluster'd with Mundungus Tobacco, and the sower dregs of Coffee, to oblige the Company, and show a sample of his Parts, bawls out, <hi>Popery—Popery—down with it—cut it off Root and Branch! Popery—Powder-Plot, Godfrey, King Killing in jest</hi>—and the Devil and all. To which a knavish Daw that sat Pearcht upon a bundle of Loyal <hi>Observators</hi> in the Window, answers in the same dialect, <hi>Presbytery, Treason, Solemn League and Covenant, Association, Remonstrance, Votes of Common Council,</hi> and <hi>King Killing in earnest, abhor it, kaw kaw, down with it I say:</hi> Thus my Speech-maker is husht, and the business done for that time—I speak this only by the way of <hi>Courant,</hi> a certain extraordinary manner of writing, which an <hi>Ale</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> Author about Town here is <hi>every week</hi> very famous for.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Phanatick</hi> is a <hi>Miscellanie of Mischief,</hi> and has like a Hound a Clog about his Neck, or else he would be perpetually running up and down, and invading every ones <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Prerogative;</hi> First, he has no <hi>Justice</hi> but what is <hi>forc't</hi> upon him, for the sake of the <hi>Cause</hi> (as he calls it) and his own sham Opinion: Secondly, no <hi>Temperance</hi> or <hi>Chastity,</hi> unless at home with his Wife and Family: Thirdly, I am sure he has no <hi>Religion,</hi> because in that Text of Scripture, viz. <hi>Fear God and honour the King,</hi> he had rather renounce the <hi>first,</hi> than by complying with the <hi>last</hi> bugbear words offend his <hi>tender Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54476:3"/>This some call a <hi>Whigg Anatomiz'd,</hi> but I call it rather a <hi>Whigg Bottomiz'd,</hi> where the Cabinet is unlockt, and the Trumpery laid open; and in that Point I am sure your <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Phanatick</hi> have an entire <hi>Union</hi> and agree to a <hi>hair,</hi> I mean as to the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:</hi> For as in the first, we have <hi>Cowls, Hoods, Rags, Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispensations, Pardons, Bulls</hi> and the like; so in the last, they make use of <hi>sly sneering demure Faces, picked Beards, little plain Bands, short bobtail'd Cloaks,</hi> with <hi>high</hi> and <hi>mighty Capes, Petitions, Libels, Raree shows, Hatfield Maids, lying Intelligences,</hi> and a number more, which they call their <hi>Engins</hi> of <hi>Democrcay,</hi> and very properly too, for since they are out of love with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and cannot dispence with <hi>lawful</hi> Inheritance, Prerogative, Right, Iustice, or any Priviledge, unless it be their own, to set up a sort of Government, where the Magistrate is chosen from out and by the People, what better Engins could they possibly make use of than those before recited?</p>
            <p>And, to say truth, these <hi>Common-wealth-Mongers</hi> have for some years lately past had a blessed time on't; their Arms and Hands that must do this mighty and Soul-saving work (I mean the <hi>Mobile</hi>) have been a long time ripe for <hi>Mischief,</hi> and when Ease, Luxury, and Idleness prompt their Flagitious and unthinking Souls to Villany, 'tis not my honest friend in the long black Canonical Cassock, for all his Morals of Humanity, Loyalty or Religion, that can divert or appease 'em.</p>
            <p>Here ye shall see a Butcher, a great Common-wealths Man, bloated with Brewis, and fatned with the grease of his own Tripes, railing against the Succession, and swearing bloodily by all the Oxen, Calves, Hogs, Sheep and Lambs in his slaughter house, the <hi>Duke</hi> shall never come to the Crown, vows he will fight for the Establisht Religion till he is slic't into Cutlets, yet bid him make Confession of his faith, and 'tis ten to one he mistakes the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Creed.</hi> In another place you shall hear a Taylor, sitting Cross-leg'd upon his Shopboard, railing at the Government with great animosity and fury, for not calling a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and protesting by his Sheers, Bodkin and Thimble, that he will make one in the next <hi>Petition;</hi> and that he is resolv'd not to permit <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> to be trampl'd under foot; yet ask him how many <hi>Commandments</hi> there are, and 'tis an even wager he remembers only <hi>Nine,</hi> being very willing to leave out the <hi>Eighth,</hi> because it tells him <hi>he shall not Steal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54476:4"/>Such as these it seems are to be the <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Nation, and when <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Barbarity</hi> sit at the Helm, and give Laws and Orders, all must needs imagine the Poets will have a hopeful Time on't: But that <hi>Card</hi> is not yet plaid, nor by the leave of my good <hi>Republicans,</hi> I am of opinion never will, though I cannot but imagin, their best endeavours are never wanting to play the best of the Game, and make what advantage they can of the <hi>present disturbances:</hi> But the famous <hi>black</hi> Gentleman, with the <hi>Square</hi> Chin having lost his Friend and dear Brother <hi>Jurator,</hi> has produc't so few Miracles lately, that the <hi>Cause</hi> begins extreamly to flag, and very little or nothing has happened that's worth the believing; but we doubt not, but like a suttle Fencer he lies cunningly upon his guard, and watches an opportunity to snap, like a Mastive for a pudding in the dark; besides, we know that he's as sly and inveterate as wrong'd Women are, and in some points agrees exactly with their humours; for as they are bitter and revengeful, so is he—and I am sure as <hi>mad for a Parliament</hi> as the worst of 'em.</p>
            <p>Things going thus, this Play must needs be in a fine condition, yet I have this hope that the <hi>Royalists,</hi> for whom it was writ, will accept and defend it, and then tho the <hi>wasps</hi> swarm round the hive, I shall not fear but the <hi>Loyal Bees</hi> will keep their Station; for my own part, I am careless of my future fortune in it, since I have already so well succeeded.—And therefore leave it to the wide and censorious World, to seek its fortune; which if good, I shall be glad; if not, it has but the common fate: And therefore I have the greater reason to have patience.</p>

                     <p>A bitter fellow—I have often seen the picture of Honesty painted with a sober Sheeps look, just like one of yours, and wearing a plain gray Coat. Prithee canst thou tell me the meaning of that?</p>

                     <p>Oh very easily—humh; why look you as to the sheep, that I believe was design'd a Bob for you Court-mutton-Eaters: but the sober wise look deciphers that honesty has no pride; and then by the plain suit is infallibly demonstrated, that honesty never runs in debt, but always pays his Taylor.</p>

                     <p>Yes, and observ'd your eyes, Madam, and the lustre that adorn'd your face when you beheld his gracefull Carriage, and heard him refuse to compound for his Estate.</p>

                     <p>'Tis impossible I could grace my self with a languishing Air like what you put on to oblige Mr. <hi>Heartal,</hi> Cousin: I hear you have got his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Sir <hi>Oliver,</hi> and methinks it is but reason that I shou'd do the same for the stranger.</p>

                     <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                     <p>But what if he shou'd not accept it, when 'tis done; for I hear he's a man of a strange nice critical humour, and scorns to be oblig'd to a Woman; no, though 'twere for her Maiden head.</p>

                     <p>I know not that, but one that looks in his face would imagine he valued a Maiden-head at a greater rate than you speak of: If he balk his Bottle or his Mistress I'm mistaken—ah—there's nothing like a <hi>Royalist</hi> at a fair Lady.</p>

                     <speaker>Aur.</speaker>
                     <p>No, for like a Bee he is perpetually Buzzing about, and sucking every flower he comes near, till at last with tired Wings, and laden Thighs, he returns home to his Winter-quarters, humming a melancholy complaint for his no better success in his Rambles.</p>

                     <p>Let him ramble: I know he has too much honour to wrong in any point a kind young Lady that lov'd him—besides, I am clearly for liberty in Love; your dull low spirited constant Couple are like two Chickens in a Coop, they are always either sleeping or pecking at one another.</p>

                     <p>Liberty; why 'tis like Air to a flame, Life wou'd soon extinguish without it. But to be Marry'd, in my sence, is the best of Liberty! oh heav'n! Marriage is a heavenly thing sincerely.</p>

                     <p>Nay, there I must beg your pardon. Your Polititian is the worst at Love-matters of any: He is setling the Nation abroad, when he should be setling himself at home with his Wife; and I must confess, I would not willingly marry a Lump, a Stone, a Log; I would not have a Husband like a School-boys Top, that should go no longer than just I was a whipping him on.</p>

Yet pardon, if a tear break from my Eye, when I reflect on your past noble life; and see the man, whose bounty had no equal, reduc'd to make his Dinner of a Morsel.</p>

                     <p>A Morsel! rather a Feast my Friend. Content has made it rich and riotous. In my Prosperity I could observe how little suffic'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from thence knew that all <hi>overplus</hi> was needless. Besides, is not this better than to lie for a well-dress'd dish of wild-fowl, or pawn my soul to the Devil, or forfeit my Honour and Loyalty for a Fricasee or a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goust? I have known a Roundhead do it for a dish of butter'd Eggs! Oh! may I feed on Grass, Roots, Berries, Acorns; drink the green puddle of the standing Poole; any thing that our appetite counts Nauseous, rather than for the Luxury of Emperors, do the least Act dishonourable or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal.</p>

And why the Devil should a man be Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of the no Favour, when the detected Clod is so vile in all its Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; I'le give thee a short account of it. First, for your Courtier, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity pinch you, and you make your suit known to him, He's deaf—and in return, tells you a Story of his Miss, and what a new way of obliging she has. If you go to a Citizen, he wants Security, the times are hard, yet cannot forbear telling you a lucky hit he had that morning with a young Heir, which he calls a <hi>Bargain,</hi> but is indeed a <hi>Cheat.</hi>

I have known a Lover vow, what he never mean't to keep; and a Courtier positively promise, what he never could perform But see, yonder I think is a Petticoat advancing this way—Hoh! my Lady of the Lake, is it you?</p>

                     <p>Officers, I command you in the Protector's Name to discharge him. Sir <hi>Oliver,</hi> you are hereby also Commanded to re-deliver to this Noble Gentleman all his Sequestred Lands.</p>
                     <stage>A Warrant.</stage>
                     <p>And further, Sir, the Protector bid me tell you he had heard so large a Character of your Fidelity and Vertue, that he would at any rate buy your Friendship.</p>

                     <p>Sir, for my Estate I thank him: but for my Service and Loyal Allegiance, they are Sacred to my Prince, and shall continue so.</p>

                     <p>Now I am resolv'd to hang my self; for I'd as leive lose my life as my estate: A pox on Power, I say: A man can never thrive in an Age
