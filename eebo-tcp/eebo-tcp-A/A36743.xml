            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late had lived in happier Times, he would probably have exerted thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:48944:4"/>
great Talents which he carried far in ſo dark an Age, in Services of a high nature. He had a true Judgment and firm Courage, with a generous Temper, and was a great Patron and Promoter of Learning; He deſpiſed Wealth, was free from aſpiring, and aſſerted the Rights of the Crown, and the Liberties of this Church againſt Papal Uſurpations. Theſe were great Qualities, and ſo much the greater, becauſe the Corruptions of the Clergy from the Papacy down to the Begging Orders, were then to an inſupportable degree.</p>
            <p>In any other Age the publiſhing a Life which has ſo great a Relation to the moſt Glorious part of our Hiſtory might have lookt like a reproach of the Time in which it came out. But the Preſent Age may well bear it, in which if we have not carried our Conqueſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> as was then done, yet we
<pb facs="tcp:48944:4"/>
ſee a <hi>GREAT PRINCE</hi> who has far out-done the Performances of that time. Then a Feeble King and divided Court made the <hi>Work</hi> as eaſy in it ſelf, as it looks great in Hiſtory: But we have ſeen a Mighty and United Power managed by Wiſe Counſels, fluſh'd with a long courſe of Succeſs, that gave Law to All about it, ſtopt in its full career by a King born to be a Bleſſing to the preſent Age, and a Wonder to all Succeeding ones; to Whoſe Reign the moſt renouned Pieces of our Hiſtory are but foiles to ſet it off, and make it ſhine the brighter.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I could not be long in ſuſpence for the choice of a proper Patron to my ſmall Intereſt in this Work, which is only the care of the Tranſlation of it into <hi>Engliſh:</hi> The <hi>See</hi> that you do now govern with ſo Apoſtolical a Temper, and in none of the eaſieſt Times, is not the chief reaſon of my addreſſing to
<pb facs="tcp:48944:5"/>
Your Grace the Life of one of the moſt Eminent of all Your Predeceſſors. I could give many more Reaſons for the choice that relate immediately to Your Self, but I will rather leave it to the Reader to find out, than offer a thing ſo ingrateful to Your Lordſhip: I pay Your Grace ſo profound a Reverence, that I will not venture on that which I know will offend You, for I am with the trueſt Zeal, and the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect poſſible,</p>

            <p>This was the laſt Provincial Synod that the Archbiſhop held: From that time he bent all his thoughts, as far as publick buſineſs would give him leave, upon finiſhing his College, which he deſigned to dedicate to the ſervice of Learning. For by this time the Walls of it, which were very ſtately and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, were built, and the Workmen
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48944:89"/>
had begun to lay the Roof; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop had alſo purchas'd Lands and Mannors for the perpetual maintenance of his Foundation, all which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the King with, and humbly beſought him that he would permit the College to be founded in his Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">The Archbiſhop pray'd the King to ſuffer his College, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt finiſhed, to be founded in his Royal Name.</note>the Lawyers were of opinion, that the Splendour and Authority of the King's Name was of great importance toward founding a College in due and lawful manner.</p>
            <p>Now the King was always very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably inclin'd towards the good of the Church, and the encouragement of Learning, and had a great love and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for his Godfather the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
