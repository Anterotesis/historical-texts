         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thee, which in common right is my due: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thy good conceit and fauourable cenſure of
my trauell: which albeit not polliſhed with fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of phraſe yet it is beautified with truth of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as God gaue abilitie, my ſmall knowledge in
the tongue, and the miſery of the place aforded. If
any will charge me with folly and preſumption in
attempting this tranſlation, better beſeeming ſome
of riper iudgement. I graunt there is cauſe: yet thou forward taxer of faultes, in
others, why doeſt thou not rather iudge &amp; condemne thy ſelf? that hauing a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

ſithens this worthy worke was firſt publiſhed, haſt not bettered thy country by thy
paines taking, nor benefited others by tranſlating it thy ſelfe. For my part, I hold
it fitter, that the body rather brooke a meane repaſt then ſtarue for want of foode:
And had rather my raſh ignorance ſhould be publiſhed in print, and ſo noted of
thee (for of better minds I expect better thoughts) then that ſo heauenly a light of
Chriſtian knowledge, ſhould reſt obſcured in the myſty darkneſſe of a ſtrange
language: and ſo precious a treaſure be buried in ruſtie ſilence, without comfort
or commoditie to my countrey. For among ſo many worthy labourers in the Lords
vineyard, raiſed vp by God in this latter age, there is none (pardon me good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if my ſimple iudgement faile me) that hath exceeded, nay few or none that
hath equalled this Authour, in the matter and method of this booke. Wherein by
way of Antitheſis, are liuely ſet forth Chriſt and Antichriſt. To the end that two
contraries oppoſed, Chriſt the true light may appeare more glorious: and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
the child of darkenes may be viewed in his proper colour, that the one may be
imbraced with all obedience, and the other abandoned with all deteſtation and
horror. For if thou wouldeſt know by the word of God, and be aſſured by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his holy Spirit that Ancichriſt foretold by the Prophets and Apoſtles, is
already come, and the ſonne of perdition renealed, if thou wouldeſt know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time, the place, the maner and markes of his reuelation. If thou wouldeſt
know and be acertained by the ſame Spirit, that the Pope is a falſe Prieſt, &amp; that
very ſame Antichriſt, ſo proued by his abominable life and doctrine, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of Gods ſacred word, and vnrefutable arguments drawne from the ſame. If
thou wouldeſt know and be aſſured likewiſe, that the Maſſe is a diueliſh prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Supper of the Lord, a moſt blaſphemous, idolatrous, and falſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
derogating from the moſt precious bloud, death &amp; paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt. If thou
wouldeſt know &amp; by the ſame Spirit be aſſured that the ſame Ieſus Chriſt, true God
&amp; true man is the only Lord, Sauiour and redeemer of the world: the onlie aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
Interceſſor &amp; Mediator betweene God and man: the only &amp; alone king Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and true high Prieſt, which entred into the holy place once for all, and found
eternall redemption. If thou wouldeſt know that his body and bloud once offred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the altar of the croſſe, is the only &amp; alone true ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſauor in
<pb facs="tcp:19632:4"/>
the noſethrils of God his Father, for the remiſſion of ſins: whereby onlie Gods wrath
is appeaſed, we obtaine pardon, peace &amp; reconciliation with God, grace, fauor
and euerlaſting life. If thou wouldeſt know and be likewiſe aſſured, that this moſt
holy ſacrifice of Chriſt one only time offered is all ſufficient for the ſins of all men, &amp;
that no place remaineth for any other reiteration of the ſame ſacrifice. If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
know the true meaning, vſe &amp; practiſe of the holy Supper of the Lord Ieſus, &amp;
the benfit thereof to the Faithfull. If thou wouldeſt certainlie know, and be fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by the ſame Spirit of Grace, which is the ancient doctrin of God, leading to all
bliſſe and true bleſſedneſſe, confirmed with his ſacred word, contained in the bookes
of the old &amp; new Teſtament, and penned by the finger of the holy Ghoſt: and which
is the new doctrine of men, pointing the pathway to hell, death &amp; deſtruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
with vaine apparitions, dreames, falſe miracles, and illuſions of the diuell.
Come and ſee, &amp; except the god of this world hath blinded thy mind, that the light
of Chriſtes glorious Goſpell ſhould not ſhine vnto thee: except thou liſt to grope
at noone day, and wilfully ſay, I will not ſee: except thou haſt ſhaken hands with
death, and made a couenant with hell: except God for thy wilfull obſtinacie, hath
giuen thee ouer vnto a reprobate ſence, to oppoſe thy ſelfe againſt him &amp; his knowne
truth. In reading this booke without partiall preiudication, thou canſt not but ſee,
exactly perceiue and taſt to thine vnſpeakeable comfort, how ſweet are the mercies
of the Lord, in reuealing to thee (duſt and aſhes) the myſterie both of the one and

ouer the conſciences which Ieſus Chriſt
our redeemer, with his death &amp; paſſion hath
freed, I ſhould neuer (Chriſtian Reader) haue
entred a labyrinth ſo confuſed, and rugged, as
is to write the liues of Popes. For thou muſt
know, that the Romiſts themſelues concord not
nor agree in the number of the Popes. Some ſet downe more, and others
leſſe. And hence it commeth that ſo little they agree, touching the time
that they poped (Let it be lawfull for me, as of a king, he is ſayd to raigne
to ſay of a Pope to Pope) Some of theſe ſelfe ſame alſo, that all confeſſe to
haue bene Popes of ſome of them ſay great Laudes and praiſes, extolling
them to the heauens. Of theſe ſelfe ſame, ſay others filthie things, caſting
them downe to hell. An example of the firſt S. <hi>Gregory</hi> (As ſaith Friar
<hi>Iohn de Pineda</hi> 3. part cap. 8. ¶1. of his Eccleſiaſticall Monarchie) was the

Italians. And had we alleaged more authors, more diſagreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
ſhould we haue found. Of this diuerſitie ſpringeth the diſorder,
which is in the time that ſome Popes Poped. For they which reckon leaſt
Popes put the yeares which they take from 4 or 5 Popes (whom they reckon
not) to other Popes. <hi>Carança</hi> in his <hi>Summa conciliorum,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Boniface</hi> 3.
(this was the firſt Pope as in his life ſhalbe ſhewed) ſaith theſe words. There
is diuerſitie among writers how long time <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. was Pope. For of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
is it gathered, that he was nine monthes. Others ſay 8 monethes and a
halfe: others a yeare, and 25 dayes: Others a yeare, 5 monthes, &amp; 28 daies.
Others ſay, that he died, hauing bene Pope 8 moneths and 22 dayes. This
farre <hi>Carança.</hi> The ſame might we ſay of many other Popes. For example of
the ſecond, will we put <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Formoſus,</hi> beſides many others that we
might ſet downe. <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Formoſus</hi> ſome of the papiſts themſelues, do
cannonize, and others doe curſe them. <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith: that <hi>Liberius</hi> was an
<pb facs="tcp:19632:5"/>
Arian <hi>Panuinus</hi> ſaith: that he was holy. Read his life, which of diuerſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
we haue gathered. As touching <hi>Formoſus Stephen</hi> 6 or 7. condemned
him. So did alſo a Councell holden in the time of this <hi>Stephen</hi> condemne
him. But Romanus ſucceſſor of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Theodorus.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 10 or 9 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Stephen,</hi> and iuſtified <hi>sn Formoſus.</hi> And this did not theſe 3 Popes
onely, but a generall Councell of 74. Biſhops, holden in the time of <hi>Iohn</hi>
10. did alſo the ſame. But all this notwithſtanding, the third time, that
<hi>Sergius</hi> was Pope, he tooke part with <hi>Stepben</hi> againſt <hi>Formoſus</hi> Condemding
that which 3 Popes, and the Councell had done, and was moſt cruell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the bodie of <hi>Formoſus,</hi> vntombing it, and doing that vnto it, which
vpon his life, we will declare. Read their liues (Chriſtian Reader) Dogges
ſhalt thou ſee that teare in peeces, and eate one another: Not men ſhalt
thou ſee: but diuels incarnate. Thou muſt alſo vnderſtand, that in the
names of ſome Popes, there is great diſagreement. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the laſt, <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
calleth the 24. and in order 214. <hi>Carança</hi> calleth him 24. But the 213.
in order, <hi>Pero Mexia</hi> calleth him the 24. Another way carrieth <hi>Panuinus</hi>
22. he calleth him, or 23. and ſaith: that he is the 209. in order. Thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
he from out the Catalogue. Fiue Popes: two whereof be <hi>Iohns:</hi> And
it is alſo to be noted, that from <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. which was a wicked woman. All the
<hi>Iohns</hi> almoſt, haue bene peſtilent fellowes Read their liues.</p>
            <p>Three cauſes there be, why ſome do number leſſe Popes. The firſt is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome Popes a very ſmall time Poped. The 2. is, becauſe many reckon
not for Popes, all thoſe that were not cannonically elected. The 3. is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome will not hold them for Popes, who albeit they were connoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
elected, yet in there Popedome wickedly gouerned. For the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
many reckon not for Pope, <hi>Stephen</hi> 2. who but three, or as ſome ſay, 4
dayes Poped. For the 2. reaſon exclude they all thoſe, whom they call An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipopes,
choſen in the time of Schiſme. 30: Schiſmes counteth <hi>Panuinus</hi> to
haue bene, wherein at one time were 4 Popes, another time 3. another 2.
Herehence is it, that they count not <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. Whom others call 17. nor <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi>
nor <hi>Clement</hi> 8. And therefore <hi>Clement</hi> 9. they call 7. nor <hi>Benedict</hi> 5 nor <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>
7. called they 6. nor <hi>Benedict</hi> 13. For theſe 2 reaſons exclude they al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that by wicked artes, deceipt, force, gifts, or promiſes were made Popes.
Such doe the Councels and decrees of the Popes themſelues not hold for
Popes. Read that which the Councell of Lateran holden in the time of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
2. ordained touching this matter. And ſo many hold not for pope,
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> 2. Who being a lay-man and without any orders, was by force
made Pope. Should this decree be obſerued. neither <hi>Silueſter</hi> 2. the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter,
nor <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. nor <hi>Gregory</hi> 7 nor an infinit nomber of Popes, which
by wicked artes, &amp;c. Were made Popes ſhuld be called Popes &amp; ſo very few
ſhuld remaine in the catalogue of the Popes. The 3. reaſon why ſome be not
counted Popes, is that albeit they were cannonically choſen, yet, during
their Popedome, either in life, or in Doctrin, or both in life &amp; Doctrin were
they abhominable. For this cauſe ſome count not Lando. Read his life. For
the ſame cauſe, ſome reckon not <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. a whore before, &amp; when ſhe was
Pope. Were this reaſon ought worth, very few ſhould be counted
for Popes. For all the Popes ingenerall from <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. vntill
<pb facs="tcp:19632:6"/>
               <hi>Siſtus</hi> 5. who now tyrannizeth, haue either in life or Doctrine bene wicked.
And ſo, ought not to be connted. <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. Of whom ſay all, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
like a Foxe, liued like a Lyon, and died like a Dogge. And alone was
not he, that did this: he had many companions. Theſe be the cauſes, why
ſome reckon leſſe Popes, then others. And in theſe names, <hi>Stephen, Iohn,
Clement, Benedict, Conſtantine, and Felix,</hi> ſhalbe found this abridgement
of Popes. There are no liues of kings nor Emperors, were they Chriſtians,
pagans, Iewes, Turkes, Scithians; or of whatſoeuer other nation, ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
and diuerſly written, as are the liues of the Popes. And that which is
more to be maruailed, written, imprinted, and approued by the papiſts
themſelues. The holy Ghoſt it ſeemeth, hath purpoſely caſt into the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their liues, this confuſion. For the Popes being kings and Lords of
Rome. And Rome as ſay Saint <hi>Ierom, Petrark, Laurentius Valla,</hi> and many
others) is Babilon. And Babilon, as much to ſay, as confuſion, all whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
the Popes haue done, doe, and ſhall doe, is and ſhalbe confuſion:
And ſo can no order be held in counting of them. And with what more
proper name then Babilon, or confuſion, can that Church be called, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they ſo pray and ſing in ſtraunge &amp; confuſed Language, that one vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
not another. And that yet which is worſe he, him ſelfe that praieth
of ſingeth, vnderſtandeth not oft times that which is ſayd. My deſire is
(friendly Reader) to aduiſe thee of this confuſion: That if thou ſhalt read
in one author that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 24. for the great villanies and hereſies which
in his preſence, and to his face were proued, was condemned in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Conſtance: and others ſay this happened to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. &amp; others,
to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. then nothing maruaile: For theſe 3 <hi>Iohns</hi> 22. 23. and 24. be
one ſelfe ſame Pope <hi>Iohn.</hi> Concerning the concurrences of the kings of
Spaine, which I place with the Pope, I haue followed <hi>Don Alonſo de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena</hi>
Biſhoppe of Burgos in his Latine Hiſtorie of the kings of Spaine,
which he calleth Anacephalaeoſis, as much to ſay, as a Recapitulation. No
other hath bene the purpoſe and motiue me mouing to write theſe 2. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
of the Pope, and of the Maſſe. But the great deſire I haue that they of
my nation, might enioy the ſame mercies, which the Lord in theſe laſt
times hath ſhewed to many nations in Europe, giuing them liberty of
conſcience (&amp; this not to let looſe the raynes to ſerue the luſts of the fleſh,
but in ſpirit and truth to ſerue the liuing God, whom to ſerue, is to raigne)
I very much ſorrow, that my nation to whom the Lord God, for the
things of this world, hath giuen ſo much wit, hability and vnderſtanding
(which other nations cannot deny) In things pertayning to God, in the
things concerning the ſaluation of their ſoules, or going to heauen
or hell, is ſo blockiſh and blind, that it ſuffereth it ſelfe to be carried by
the Maſſe, that it ſuffereth it ſelfe to be gouerned, troden vnder foote &amp;
tyrannized of the Pope, of the man of ſinne, of the ſonne of perdition, of
Antichriſt, whom as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe
that he is God. And that moreouer which S. <hi>Paul</hi> 2. Theſſ 2. ſaith. All the
euill of the Spaniards co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto them of a falſe perſwaſion which they
haue conceiued of the authority of the Pope. The Pope, they beleeue to
<pb facs="tcp:19632:6"/>
be the ſucceſſor of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Vicar of Chriſt, God vppon earth. They
beleeue, that all whatſoeuer the pope doth on earth, God doth it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and what ſoeuer he vndoeth in earth, God vndoeth in heauen. This firſt
Treatiſe, ſhall ſerue to open the deceipt vnto them: very palpably &amp; plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will it ſhew the pope, not to be the ſucceſſor of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> But of <hi>Iudas.</hi> Not
to be the Vicar of Chriſt, but of Sathan (whom the holy ſcripture calleth
prince and God of this world) And that we therefore ought not to obey the
pope, nor make more reckoning of him, nor of that, hee ſhal commaund,
then we doe of that which our mortall enemy commaunds vs. Mine harts
deſire and prayer to God is, for my nation, that they may be ſaued: that
his Maieſtie deliuer them from the power of darkneſſe, and transfer them
into the kingdome of his beloued ſonne. I would if I might by any meanes
prouoke my nation. I would they had an holy enuie at other nations. Why
doe they (and not the Spaniards) read and heare the word of God, in their
owne Language, as in the holy Bible it is written? Why do they (&amp; not the
Spaniards) receiue the holy ſacraments with the ſimplicity that Ieſus Chriſt
did inſtitute and celebrate them. Wherewith, without any humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſuperſtitions, and Idolatries, he commaunded his Church to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
them? This teſtimony giue I of my nation, that they haue the zeale
of God: and ſo ſhall you ſee few Spaniards to be Atheiſts, which haue no
religion. But this their zeale, is not according to knowledge: for by the word
of God is it not ruled: but by that which Antichriſt of Rome commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
Who hath taken from them, and forbidden them the reading of holy
ſcripture. For well knoweth Antichriſt, that if the Spaniards ſhold read it,
then would they fall into account, and know the abhominable life of the
popes, and their wicked Doctrine: And ſo would forſake and deteſt them.
And ſhould Spaine once forſake the pope, the pope would reckon (as they
ſay) with the <hi>Oleados</hi> or annointed, of whom there is no hope of life: O that
if God pleaſe, I may ſee this day. And if the pope ſhould fall, then alſo in a
moment, would fall the Maſſe, and all the other Idolatries which the pope
hath inuented. This is the cauſe why our aduerſaries ſo greatly fight, to
intertaine, and mainetaine the authority of the Pope. For very well they
know that the Pope once fallen, the popiſh religion of neceſſity muſt fall
to the earth. Very well did <hi>Pedro de la Fuente</hi> (or <hi>Fontidonio,</hi> as others call
him) a diuine of Seuill vnderſtand this: who in a ſermon which he made,
the laſt day of September in the Councel of Trent, greatly inueied againſt
the proteſtants, calling them heretiques, ſaying: that they ſought to caſt
downe the 2 pillars of the Church. To wit, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe &amp; the
Pope, This Diuine ſayd moreouer: that the Councell ought to employ all
it force, to ſuſtaine and vphold them. The pillar (ſaid he) of the ſeat papall
once pulled downe, that the whole Church would fal to the earth. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which he gaue was, becauſe the funerals and obſequies of the Church
went iointly, and accompanied with thoſe of the Pope. There is nothing
(ſayd he) that the aduerſaries with deliberate purpoſe more endeuour to
doe, then to put downe the Pope, &amp;c. Our aduerſaries haue fallen in the
reckoning, and this is the cauſe, why they maintaine and adore (and many
<pb facs="tcp:19632:7"/>
of them doe it, againſt their owne conſcience) The Pope, howſoeuer abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
wicked, and great an Atheiſt he be. I humbly beſeech his maieſty
to ſend the true <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which is Chriſt, who with one pluck, may wholy
pull downe theſe two pillars, and ſo the houſe of Dagon may fall vtterly
to the earth. Iudg. 16. 29. I know that were the Pope, and his Maſſe pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
built vpon the rock, vpon the cornerſtone Chriſt, that neither the gates
of hell, nor whatſoeuer men could imagine, ſhould euer preuaile againſt
them. But becauſe they be not founded vppon this firme foundation: but
rather vpon humane inuentions, any ſmall thing whatſoeuer, that carrieth
any reaſon, maketh them eaſily to ſtagger. The thing which wholy ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
them, is the word of God. As by the Lordes aſſiſtaunce in theſe
two Treatiſes ſhalbe ſeene. His Maieſtie I hope, whoſe cauſe we here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
will draw ſome fruit out of this my trauaile. To him I commit the
charge therof. For as ſaith his Apoſtle 1. Cor. 3. 7. Neither he that pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth is
any thing, nor he that watereth, but God, which giueth the encreaſe. His
cauſe it is, to him I commend it. That which in the meane time Chriſtian
Reader, I beſeech thee, for that which thou oweſt to the health of thy ſoule
(the which if thou looſeſt, what ſhal it profit thee to haue gained the whole
world) is that thou read, conſider and weigh the reaſons which we giue in
theſe two Treatiſes, for confirmation of that which we ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſee which
more agreeth with the word of God, with that which the ancient Doctors
and Councels, and which naturall reaſon, teach: that which we haue ſaid,
or that which our aduerſaries ſay. The holy, and true, who hath the key of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> which openeth, and no man ſhutteth, which ſhutteth, and no man
openeth; Open vnto thee the gate, that thou maieſt conſider and adore his
holy law. He euer bewith thee, Amen. The 25. of Iune 1588.</p>

that is, or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be imagined. For the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
like a traitor to him that made him,
directly &amp; manifeſtly committeth high
treaſon againſt his God. He endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
what in him lieth, to caſt God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his throne, &amp; therin to place that which himſelfe worſhippeth,
albeit the worke of his owne hand. To ſhew the grieuouſneſſe
of this ſinne, very ſeuerely hath God puniſhed it: as he plagued
the Iſraelites (we ſee) when they made the Calfe. For the which
the Lord had wholly deſtroyed them, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtept in, a
very good Mediator. Notwithſtanding there died of them in
one day by the ſword about three thouſand men. And it is to be
noted,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> that neither <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor the Iſraelits were ſo blockiſh, nor
fooliſh,<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 14.</note> to thinke the calfe which they had made to be God.
That which they ſuppoſed was this, that the honor done to the
calfe they did it vnto God. And ſo Aaron when he ſaw the calfe
he built an Altar before it: and proclaimed, ſaying: <hi>To morrow
ſhall be a feaſt vnto Iehouah,</hi> This he ſaid, for the repreſentation
of God, which he and they ſuppoſed they had made in the calf.
This maner of Idolatrie had the people of Iſraell ſeene in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.
For the Egyptians,<note place="margin">The cauſe why the Iſraelites worſhipped the molten calfe.</note> beſides infinite other things, adored
the figure of <hi>Apis,</hi> which they alſo called <hi>Sirapis,</hi> being the
name of an Oxe. The Iſraelites applyed to their religion, the
manner of worſhip which they had ſeene in Egypt: and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
viſible things by which they might repreſent and worſhip
God, they made of ſet purpoſe, a Calfe of mettall, as is read in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19632:8"/>
Exod.. 32. 4. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>formed it with the grauing toole, and

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Ieroboam</hi> renewing this Idolatrie,<note place="margin">1. king. 12. 28.</note> made two calues of

ſaid as his predeceſſors in the wilderneſſe had ſaid, <hi>Theſe be thy

be thought (as before we haue ſaid) that either <hi>Aaron,</hi> or the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
or after them <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> or his people were ſo ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to thinke that the Calfe, or calues (which they themſelues
with their hands a little before had made) was God, whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is from euerlaſting. That which they thought was this: that
God which had brought them out of Egypt, repreſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in the Calfe, had poured thereinto, a certaine diuinitie,
and therefore would be worſhipped in the ſame: as they did
worſhip him. This doing, they tooke quite away the worſhip
which they only owed to God, and gaue it to the creature. For
this cauſe (ſaith <hi>Dauid)</hi> that the Iſraelites turned the glorie of
God into the ſimilitude of a Bullocke, &amp;c. &amp;c. Pſal. 106. 20.
The ſame ſay we to our aduerſaries. They beleeue not (will
they ſay) that the image of our Ladie of <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> nor that of

They beleeue not (ſay they) that the woodden Crucifixe of

that they take away the honour which is onely due to

            <p>The Iewes endeuour what they can to excuſe their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ſo lay the fault of this ſin vpon the poore baſe people
of the Egyptians, which, together with the Iſraelits went out of
Egypt. But that which the Lord ſaith to <hi>Moſes,</hi> caſteth wholly
the fault vpon the Iſraelites, not once naming the poore people:

their forefathers: their owne Rabbins doe witneſſe that the ſin

of glorie (as in Eſa. 53. through the whole chap. Dan. 9. 20. and
other places was propheſied) the Iewes afterward committed
another no leſſe wickedneſſe. For which ſo enormious a ſinne,
God cut them off, being the naturall branches, from the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greene
oliue tree, which is his Church, &amp; in their place graffed
in vs Gentils, branches of the wild oliue tree. Rom. 11. And note
that the maner wherein we are ingraffed, is farre different from
the common &amp; naturall graffing. For we are not ingraffed, the
the wild Oliue into the Oliue tree, nor the wilde peare into the
peare tree: but contrariwiſe, the oliue into the wild oliue tree, &amp;
the peare into the wild peare tree: &amp; ſo our ingraffing into the

Three great Captiuities (beſides others not ſo great) haue
the Iewes ſuffered.<note place="margin">The firſt capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of 400. yeares.</note> The firſt in Egypt: the ſecond in Babylon:
the third, that which now they ſuffer, ſcattered like chaffe,

foretold them how long they ſhould be captiues. So he ſaid to
<hi>Abraham:</hi>

               <hi>Know thou for certaine, that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in

foure hundred yeares. But the nation which they ſhall ſerue, will
I alſo iudge: and then ſhall they come forth with great riches,</hi> as in
Exod. 12. 36. 37. appeareth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As touching the ſecond captiuitie,</hi>

            <p>Concerning the third captiuitie,<note place="margin">3. Captiuitie of infinite yeares.</note> wherin aboue theſe fifteen
hundred yeares they haue bene, and yet are, and ſhall bee
ſcattered throughout the world, without king, without high-prieſt,
without ſacrifice, without <hi>Peſah</hi> (that is, the Paſchall
lambe) without Prophetes, and many other things by God
commanded, ſubiect to ſtrange nations, and not (in ſome ſort)
but as ſlaues, no word in the Scriptures mentioning how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares this captiuitie ſhall endure. But contrariwiſe, ſaith
the Angell to <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 9. 27. that Ieruſalem ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and that the Moyſaicall worſhip and Temple ſhould
neuer more returne. This third captiuitie for three reſpects is
worſe then the ſecond. Firſt, for the time: That endured ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares: This hath endured aboue fifteene hundred yeares.
2. In the ſecond, the Iewes had Prophtes, and miracles, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,
Ezechiel, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> the three children were deliuered
from the fire, and <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lyons: In this haue they
had neither Prophet nor miracle. The third reſpect: In the
ſecond they had great dignitie and riches: as <hi>Ioachin</hi> the king
<hi>Ieremie</hi> the laſt. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three companions, <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
Zerubbabel:</hi> but in this they are much deiected. True
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19632:9"/>
it is, that this generall promiſe they haue made them by God:
That whenſoeuer they ſhall repent them of their wickedneſſe
committed, and turne vnto God, that he will pardon them, and
gather them from all partes of the world where they ſhall be
ſcattered and afflicted.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that God doth not gather, nor deliuer them
from ſo long and painfull captiuitie, as is that which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:
it followeth, that they are wholly obſtinate in their ſinnes,
and turne not truly vnto God. For if they would turne, God
being true in his promiſes, would gather them. But we ſee the
contrarie, that they ſtill be ſcattered, and abide in captiuitie,
therefore they repent not. And ſo it pleaſeth God to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe
them, as he ſayd vnto Moſes, Deut. chap. 28. 63. 64. And
it ſhall come to paſſe (ſaith he, ſpeaking of the Iewes) that
as the Lord did reioyce ouer you to doe you good, and to
multiply you, ſo ſhall the Lord reioyce ouer you to confound
and deſtroy you: and ye ſhall be plucked out of the land, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the which ye now enter to poſſeſſe it. And God will ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thee through all nations, from the one end of the earth to
the other. And there ſhalt thou ſerue ſtrange Gods wood and
ſtone,<note place="margin">God for vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe puniſheth the Iewes vntill this day.</note> &amp;c. whom thou nor thy fathers haue not knowne. Their
obſtinacy, and vnbeleefe, not knowing the day of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
and contemning and killing their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is the
cauſe of this ſo miſerable captiuitie: wherein they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
vntill they ceaſe to be incredulous, and acknowledge
God, and Chriſt or <hi>Meſſias</hi> whom he hath ſent, and ſo they
ſhall be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, concerning that which we haue ſayd,<note place="margin">Iudges. 2. 19. 20</note> the booke
of Iudges is full of Gods puniſhments vpon the Iſraelities for
their idolatrie, whom he deliuered ouer into the hands of their
enemies. But as a good God, and mercifull father, when
they repented, he reſtored or deliuered them. And eftſones
they returned to idolatrie, and God eftſoones did puniſh
them. We read alſo that the Iſraelites turned away, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
themſelues more then their fathers, following ſtrange
gods, ſeruing them, and bowing downe before them, and
nothing diminiſhed their workes and wicked wayes. And
the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael. And Deborah
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19632:10"/>
in her ſong conceiuing them ſaid:<note place="margin">Iudges. 5. 8.</note> In chooſing new Gods,
warre was at the gates. So greatly did God abhore Idolatrie,
that oftenne commaundementes which he gaue; the two firſt
be againſt Idolatrie. Firſt. <hi>Thou ſhalt not haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any
ſtraunge Cod before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any Image, nor the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath,
or in the water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two kind of Idolatrie.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them,
nor worſhip them: for I am the Lord thy God, a iealous God, &amp;c.</hi> In
the firſt commaundement, internall, and mentall, and in the
ſecond externall and viſible Idolatrie are forbidden. So hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and enormious is the ſinne of Idolatrie that God who is
a iuſt Iudge, doth puniſh it with moſt ſeuere puniſhment that
can be in this world. God giueth vp Idolaters into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
ſence; ſo that forſaken of God, and by his iuſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
deliuered ouer, and made ſlaues to Sathan, they may
doe that which is not conuenient, as ſaith Saint Paule, Romans
1. 25. concerning Idolaters, which turned the truth of God
into a lie, honoring and ſeruing the creature, before (or
more) then God. And in the twentie eight verſe, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the puniſhment, he ſaith; that God gaue them vp vnto
a peruerſe minde (which we call a reprobate ſence) to doe
that which is not conuenient: namely, the abohmination there
mentioned. The anſwere which the Romiſts make, in defence
of their Images, is friuolous, They adore not, nor honour (ſay
they) the Images, but that which they repreſent. Whereunto
I anſwere; that as little did the Pagans worſhip their Images,
but that which they repreſented. For they beleeued not the
Image of <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but to preſent <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Much
more doe the Romiſts, not onely commaunde Images to be
made, but to be reuerenced, and which is more, worſhip
them themſelues. And in the ſecond Action alſo of the Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen
Councell (not of that holy and good firſt Councell of
Neece) but of the ſecond, aſſembled by that ceuell Empreſſe
<hi>Hirena,</hi> it is ſaid: We doe worſhip the pictures of Images.
And in the third Action, The inuiſible diuine nature is not
permitted to be pictured, nor figured. For no man euer ſawe
God at any time: but we worſhip the Image of his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19632:10"/>
pictured with colours. So alſo doe we reuerence and
adore the Image of our Lady the mother of God, &amp;c. See
here, how the Romiſts doe contradict themſelues, on the one
ſide, they ſay; they worſhip not Images. And on the other
parte, in their generall Councels, they commaund them to
be worſhipped. Anſwerable to this Doctrine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
doe they ſing in their hymne. <hi>O Crux aue, ſpes vnica hoc
paſſionis tempore: auge pijs Iuſtitiam, reiſ<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>

to ſay. O Croſſe onely hope, in this time of paſſion, increaſe
righteouſneſſe in the Godly, and graunt pardon to offenders.
Alſo in ſhewing the Croſſe, they ſay: <hi>Ecce lignum Crucis, veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
adoremus.</hi> That is, Behold here the wood of the Croſſe:
Come and let vs worſhip it. Alſo <hi>Crucem tuam adoramus
domine.</hi> Thy Croſſe doe we worſhip, O Lord. <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
in his Brieffes or partes, ſpeaking of Adoration, ſaith. That
the Croſſe ought to be worſhipped with the ſame Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as God himſelfe. And ſo they doe: and vppon good
fryday chiefly, proſtrate on the ground, doe they adore the
Croſſe, and offer giftes vnto it: which adoration (ſay they)
Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> ordeyned. But how can this be truth, which
they ſay of Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> when the ſayd <hi>Gregorie</hi> writing to
<hi>Seremus</hi> Biſhop of Marſella, who had cauſed Images to be
pulled downe, broken, and burned, vſeth theſe wordes, hadſt
thou forbidden to worſhip the Images, we ſhould haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thee.<note place="margin">S. Gregorie forbad the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage worſhip.</note> And a little lower: Which were placed in the Temple,
not to be worſhipped, but for inſtruction onely of the ſimple.
See here how vntrue it is that they ſay, Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the adoration of the Croſſe. True it is, he ſaith, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were the bookes of the ſimple and ignorant people. But
let him pardon vs, if in this we diſſent from him, to yeeld vnto
that,<note place="margin">Habakuk. 2. 18. 19.</note> which the word of God doth teach vs. <hi>Habakuk</hi> ſaith, what
profiteth the Image; for the maker thereof hath made it an
Image, and a teacher of lies, though he that made it,
truſt therein, when he maketh dumbe Idolls. woe vnto him,
that ſaith to the wood, awake, and to the dumbe ſtone, ariſe,
it ſhall teach thee: beholde it is layd ouer with gold and
ſiluer, and there is no breath in it. In like manner. The
ſtocke, ſaith <hi>Ieremie,</hi> is a doctrine of vanitie. Againe: Euery man
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19632:11"/>
is a beaſt by his owne knowledge: Euery founder is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by his grauen Image: for his melting is but falſhood, and
there is no breath therein. They are vanitie and the worke of
errors, &amp;c. wherefore well ſaid <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> When a liuing

people of <hi>Anablatha,</hi> where the veyle was, to prouide that no
ſuch veyles which be contrary to that which Religion permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
ſhould thenceforth be had in the Church of Chriſt. So
greatly did this epiſtle pleaſe Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> that he tranſlated the

afterward the chiefe kind and partes thereof,<note place="margin">A true deuiſion of te ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</note> hath ſhee made

Let vs looke more neerely. The belly (ſay they) hath no cares:

               <note place="margin">Numb. 21. 8.</note> that brake
the braſen ſerpent which Moſes had made, when he ſawe the
Iſraelites to burne incenſe vnto it, as in the 2. Kings. 18. 4.
appeareth. Read the chapter. See if our aduerſaries adorne
their Images with flowers, with garlandes, with crownes,
decke them, cloth them, girde them, hang vpon them purſes,
light tapers, candles and lampes before them, perfume, incenſe,
carry them vpon mens ſhoulders in proceſſion, kneele before
them, and in their neceſſities craue helpe and ſuccor of them.
Reade for this purpoſe, the epiſtle of Ieremy recited to Baruc in
his 6. chap. and thou ſhalt fully ſee the ſame that nowe is done
in Spaine, Italy, and manie other places of the world beſides.
If this be not Idolatrie, and ſuperſtition, what ſhall be? If
that good king <hi>Ezechiah</hi> nowe liued, what would he doe to
theſe Images? That which he did to the braſen Serpent: breake
and bray them in peeces. Our Aduerſaries excuſe the matter.
The ſame might the Iſraelites alſo,<note place="margin">The braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was the image and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt.</note> and it may be they did ſo,
yet for all their excuſes, the good king brake it. And thinke not
that this Serpent, ſet vp on high, which <hi>Ezechias</hi> brake, was
of ſmall ſignification. Knowe thou, that it was a figure of the
ſame Chriſt, that was to be lift vp, and placed as an Enſigne,
which all thoſe might followe, that ſhould beleeue in him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19632:13"/>
beleeuing in him might haue euerlaſting life: euen as thoſe
which beheld the Braſen ſerpent were cuted of their bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
So they which behold Chriſt, beleeue in him, and
follow him, are no leſſe healed of their ſpirituall infirmities.
This is not mine but Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> interpretation, whoſe words
be theſe: <hi>And as Moſes lift vp the ſerpent in the vvilderneſſe:
ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifted vp, that all that beleeue in him,
&amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 3. 14. Although this Serpent was made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
by the commandement of God, and with ſo high a ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> giues it, making it the image and figure of
Chriſt. And albeit it had ſo many yeares remained among
the people of God, from the Iſraelites being in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
vntill the reigne of <hi>Ezekiah:</hi> all this notwithſtanding,
this good king (ſeeing the ſuperſtition of the people that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
incenſe to it) caſt it to the earth, and brake it. This good
zeale of his is commended in the Scripture. And in the ſecond
booke of Kings chap. 18. 3. theſe words are vſed. <hi>He did that
which was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that his
father Dauid had done. Hee tooke away the high places, and
brake the Images, and cut downe the groues, and brake in peeces
the braſen ſerpent which Moſes had made.</hi> For vntill that time,
the children of Iſraell burned incenſe vnto it, and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it <hi>Nehuſtan</hi> (as much to ſay) as a peece of braſſe. Would
God the Chriſtian and Catholike kings would imitate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
zeale of this good king. Would God they would ſeeke to
be truly informed, and ſee with their eyes, what be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
and Images which they haue in their kingdomes, and
their miracles, and the truth or falſhood of them. But (ô

                  <l>A miracle it is, and the diuell doth it.</l>

Images, is meant of thoſe that are made for religion, ſeruice, &amp;
worſhip, and to honour, ſerue and adore them. Such Images
are forbidden by the law of God. And ſo the Arte of caruing,
grauing, painting and patterne making, not done to this end,
is not forbidden, but lawfull. The ſuperſtition and Idolatrie
taken away, the Arte is good. If there be any people or nation
that haue, and doe commit inward, and outwarde Idolatrie
it is the Popiſh Church. For what elſe ſee we in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

            <p>In the ſecond Treatiſe, we will alſo proue, by the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,

And becauſe our chiefe purpoſe is not ſo much to beat downe
falſhood,<note place="margin">The argument of the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</note> as to aduance the truth: after we haue ſhewed the

and onely Prieſt, and his moſt holy body and bloud which he
offered vnto his father vpon the Croſſe, to be the true, and only
ſacrifice, where with the eternall father is well pleaſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth

and giuing vs his holy ſpirit of Adoption, whereby we crie
Abba father, and liue in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the

            <p>Many will wonder that we with ſo great conſtancie (or as
they call it) ſawſineſſe reiect, condemne, and abhore the Pope

of the health of our owne ſoules. A reaſon will we giue
in this firſt Treatiſe vnto all that deſire to heare &amp; vnderſtand
it, of that which we beleeue &amp; hold concerning the Pope, and
his authoritie. And chiefely, if we be asked, becauſe (as ſaith
Saint <hi>Peter)</hi> we ought to be ready with meekeneſſe and reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to make anſwere to euery one that demaundeth a reaſon
of the hope which we hold. The reaſon then, which we giue
for reiecting, condemning, and abhorring the Pope, and flying
from him, as from the peſtilence, is his euill life, and wicked
doctrine. Note alſo what the Doctors and ancient Councels, &amp;
the holy Scriptures, in three wonderfull places chiefly for that
purpoſe ſay concerning him. In the ſecond Treatiſe, we will
declare what wee thinke of the Maſſe, and the holineſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>The Pope and Maſſe, two pillers of the Popiſh church, be
very ancient, For it is now a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeares paſt, ſince they firſt
began to be buylded. Their beginnings were very ſmall: but
they dayly increaſed, adorning and decking themſelues, vntill
they attayned to the eſtate wherein we now ſee them; For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
the Pope, as the Maſſe, is holden and called God. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
are they made very beautifull, couered ouer with ſilke,
gold, ſiluer, cloth of gold, rich ſtones: but within is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
hypocriſie, and Idolatrie. I haue often pondred with my
ſelfe, whether of theſe two pillers, the Pope, or the Maſſe, were
ſtrongeſt, and more eſteemed. The vertues, excellencie, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and diuinitie, which they ſay, is in the Maſſe, who can
declare? How profitable it is for al things liuing, and not liuing,
quick &amp; dead? By co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof, the Maſſe I ſuppoſed was
chiefeſt,<note place="margin">The reaſon prouing the Pope to be of greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then the Maſſe.</note> and therefore ought to begin with it. But the Pope
vpon better aduiſement, mee ſeemed notwithſtanding to be
the chiefeſt piller. The reaſons mouing me ſo to beleeue, are
theſe, that the cauſe in dignitie is before the effect, the creator
before the creature; the maiſter before the ſeruant, the Prieſt
before the ſacrifice which he offereth. The Pope is he that
made and created the Maſſe: as afterwardes (God willing) we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19632:15"/>
will proue.<note place="margin">Read the booke Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Pontifie. 1. Sect. cap. 3. alſo Sect. 12. cap. 10. &amp; 4.</note> Therefore is the Pope of greater dignitie then the
Maſſe. This proueth the Pope to be maiſter, and the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his ſeruant: becauſe, when the Pope goeth from one
people to another, he ſendeth before him, yea and ſome time
a day or two dayes Iourney, his ſacrament vpon a horſe
carying at his necke a little bell, accompained with the ſcumme
and baggage of the Romane court. Thither goe the diſhes and
ſpits, old ſhooes, caldrons and kettels, and all the ſculery of
the Courte of Rome, whores and Ieſters. Thus, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
arriued with this honorable traine, at the place whither
the Pope is to come, it there awayeth his comming. And
when the maiſter is knowne to approach neere the people,
it goeth forth to receiue him. Open thine eyes O Spaine: or
which is better. God open them, and behold what account the
Pope maketh of the ſacrament, which he himſelfe (ſaying it is
thy God) for thy money, ſelleth vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Fryar <hi>Iohn de Pineda,</hi> in the third part of his Eccleſiaſticall
Monarchie, lib. 23. ¶2. ſaith. That the firſt Pope, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Sacrament to be carried before him, was Benedict. 13.
(a Spaniard) when for feare, he fled from France into Aragon:
&amp; from that time remained it in cuſtome, that the Pope caried
the moſt holy Sacrament, for his gard before him.</p>
            <p>The Popes in this carrying of the Sacrament before them,
doe imitate the kinges of Perſia, before whom went a horſe,
carrying a little Altar vpon him: whereupon, among a few
aſhes ſhone a ſmall flame of holy fire: which they called <hi>Oriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada.</hi>
This fire, as a certaine diuinitie, did the Perſians reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and adore. So that the King, to ſeeme more then a man,
and to be ioyntly worſhipped with the diuinitie, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him, with this pompe went he publikely. Read for
this purpoſe, the Embleme of Alciatus. <hi>Non tibi, ſed Religioni,
pag.</hi> 17. where he treateth of a little aſſe, that went laden with
myſteries.</p>
            <p>He alſo that ſacrificeth, is of more dignitie and eſtimation,
then the ſacrifice which he offereth. For God regardeth not
ſo much the gift, or ſacrifice to him offered and preſented, as
the perſon that offereth it. The Lord, ſaith the ſcripture, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to <hi>Abell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 4.</note> and his preſent: and: to <hi>Caine</hi> and his preſent

he had no regard.<note place="margin">Hebrew, 11. 4.</note> The Apoſtle giueth a reaſon ſaying. <hi>By ſaith
Abell offered to God a better ſacrifice then Caine.</hi> The Pope is
the Prieſt, the Maſſe is the ſacrifice which he offereth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the Pope of more dignitie then the Maſſe. By theſe
reaſons, and others that may be drawne, I conclude, the Pope
to be chiefe piller that ſuſteyneth the Popiſh Church Of it
we will firſt take hold: not to ſupport it, but to caſt it downe:
and then we will after intreat of the Maſſe. And this by the
helpe of the almightie God, the Father ſonne, ond holy Ghoſt,

the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; firſt taking of the name of Pope, but againſt
the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Which name, well agreeth with him: for the Pope Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all to himſelfe: that is to ſay, he deuonreth and glutteth it
vp: as he himſelfe ſaith, All power is giuen me in heauen and
in earth. And ſo the late writers take this name <hi>Papa, pro In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gluuie,</hi>
that is to ſay, gluttony, As <hi>Anthonie de Lebrixa</hi> in his
dictionary doth note it.</p>
            <p>Ieſus Chriſt, our Maiſter, whoſe voyce the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
vs to heare, and thereby, to gouerne our ſelues,
hath giuen vs a ſure marke, and infallible token, to diſcerne
the good tree from the bad, the true Chriſtian from the falſe,
the good ſhepheard from the hierling. <hi>A good tree</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>bringeth foorth good fruite.</hi> Matth. chap. 7. 17. This he ſaith,
that we may knowe the hypocrites, by their fruites, or workes;
Speaking alſo of himſelfe, he ſaith, The workes which I doe
they beare witneſſe of me, Ioh. chap. 5. verſ. 30. The ſame
Lord ſaith, that the good ſhepheard giueth his life for his ſheep,
&amp; not the hierling, but rather flyeth, Ioh. chap. 10. 11. Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot
iudge but that which they ſee God onely knoweth the heart.
Following then the counſel which the Lord hath giuen vs, let vs
ſee what hath bin the life &amp; doctrine of the Popes vntill this day:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19632:17"/>
and ſo will hold them, either for good or bad, for the true
miniſters of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the Biſhops of Rome into, 3. orders.</note> or of the diuell. And to make that more
manifeſt whereof we intreat, let vs deuide into three partes
or orders all the Biſhops that haue bene in Rome. The firſt
ſhall conteyne, all thoſe, that from the beginning, were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
vntill the time of Saint <hi>Silueſter.</hi> The ſecond, all thoſe
which were from <hi>Silueſter,</hi> vnto <hi>Boniface.</hi> 3. The third, all thoſe
that haue bene from <hi>Boniface.</hi> 3. vnto <hi>Clement.</hi> 8. who this
yeare of the Lord, 1600. doth tyrannize in the Church.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the firſt order.<note place="margin">The firſt order.</note> The common opinion hath
bene, that S. Peter was the firſt Biſhop of Rome, the which by
holy ſcripture can no way,<note place="margin">Saint Peter was not Biſhop of Rome.</note> but the contrary rather, be proued.
Many haue handled this argument: to whom I referre thoſe
that would knowe it. For my part, that which our aduerſaries
ſay, concerning this matter, to me ſeemeth impoſſible. Firſt
they ſoy, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ued after after Chriſt paſſion, 38. yeares.
which they count in this maner. That he was for a time in <hi>Iudaea</hi>
&amp; after at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he was Biſhop, 7. yeares. So ſaith <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmew
Caranza,</hi> in his <hi>ſumma Conciliorum.</hi> But if that be true
which they ſay, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> liued but 38. yeares after Chriſt,
the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gal. ſheweth this to be impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul alſo, in 1. chap. of his ſaid Epiſtle declareth, that
after his conuerſion, he went not to Ieruſalem: but into Arabia,
and thence turned to Damaſcus; and that, 3. yeares after he
came to Ieruſalem; where he found Peter, with whom he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
15. dayes; not to learne ought of him, but to confer with
him. 14. yeares after this (as he ſaith in the chapter following)
he came againe to Ieruſalem: where thoſe that were pillers
of the Church, <hi>Iames Cephas,</hi> which is <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue him
the right hand of fellowſhip. Theſe yeares were, 18. at the leaſt,
3. (ſaith he) and afterwards, 14. and the time which paſſed
from the Paſſion of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

After this, they both were at Antioch: where S. <hi>Paul</hi> reproued
S. <hi>Peter</hi> for his diſſimulation. If there he was ſeuen yeares, and
twenty fiue yeares afterwardes at Rome, ioyned with the
eighteene yeares, before mentioned, ſhall make fiftie yeares,
at the leaſt. Then ſhall it be vntrue which they ſay, that Saint
<hi>Peper</hi> liued thirty eight yeares after the death of Chriſt (as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19632:17"/>
ſaith <hi>Caranza</hi> in his <hi>ſumma Conciliorum)</hi> And much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
ſhal be that, which <hi>Humfridus Panuinus,</hi> in the Chronicle
of the Roman Biſhops, and in his annotation vpon <hi>Platina,</hi> in
the life of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaith, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was martyred 34.
yeares, 3. moueths and 4. dayes, after the paſſion of Chriſt.
Count thus the yeares the S. <hi>Peter</hi> liued after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From the death of Chriſt, vntill the 2. yeare of the death of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> were 10. yeares, all which time, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> abode in
and departed not once from <hi>Iudea.</hi> This time paſſed, he came
to Rome, where he abode 4. yeares, from whence, by <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
Edict againſt the Iewes, he departed, and returned to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:
from Ieruſalem, he went to Antioch, and there abode,
7. yeares: in which time died <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> ſucceeded
him in the Empire. In the beginning of <hi>Neros</hi> reigne, S. <hi>Peter</hi>
returned to Rome: whence, after ſome time, he departed, and
trauelled almoſt throughout all Europe: which peregrination
being ended, he returned the third time to Rome. From Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> firſt enterance into Rome, vntill his death were, 24.
yeares, 5. monethes, and 12. dayes, which ioyned with the
10. yeares before paſſed in Iudea, make 34. yeares, three
moneths, and 4. dayes. All this ſaith <hi>Panuinus.</hi> Herein, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traieth
his owne authors, which affirme <hi>Peter</hi> to haue bene
7. yeares in Antioch, and 25. after at Rome. And <hi>Gracian,</hi> in
a certaine decree ſaith, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by reuelation paſſed
(or tranſlated) his ſeate from Antioch to Rome. And ſo Fryar
<hi>Iohn de Pineda</hi> in the 3. part. booke 20. chap. 5. Sect. 1, following
this opinion, ſaith. In Antioch (before Rome) had S. <hi>Peter</hi> his
ſeate Papall. <hi>Caranza</hi> in his <hi>ſumma Conciliorum,</hi> ſpeaking of S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> counteth thus. He ſate (ſaith he) in the biſhops chaire at
Antioch 7. yeares: and departing thence, came to Rome in
the time of the Emperor <hi>Claudius;</hi> where he ſate in the Biſhops
chaire 25. yeares, 2. moneths, and 3. dayes. We ſee now the
count of <hi>Caranza</hi> and <hi>Panuinus</hi> to be falſe. In this they agree,
that he was crucified at Rome. Betweene the death of the Lord
and the death of <hi>Nero,</hi> were 37. yeares. The ſaid <hi>Panuinus</hi> ſaith,
that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified in the the laſt yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> then ſhal
it be 37. yeares, and not as he ſaith, 34. yeares, after the death
of Chriſt. The Legend, and Cannon ſay, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19632:18"/>
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> were in one ſelfe ſame yeare, day, and hower be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
at Rome. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Paul</hi> was killed with
a ſword, and <hi>Peter</hi> crucified: <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, that the one was
beheaded, and the other crucified. We demaund, and chiefly
of our Spaniardes, which ſo much beeleeue theſe thinges.
when came Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to Rome, how longe there ſtayed
he,<note place="margin">This proueth S. Peter was nduep at Rome.</note> when, and of what kinde of death, and where dyed he,
who was his ſucceſſor (for ſome ſay <hi>Linus,</hi> others <hi>Clement)</hi>
we ſhall finde great confuſion, and diſorder amongſt them:
as already we haue ſeene? and how deale they ſo with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
whoſe faith is to be founded vpon the word of God. The
Popes Supremacie, to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, they ſell for an
Article of our faith, inſomuch (as ſaith <hi>Boniface.</hi> 8.) it was
<hi>de neceſſitate ſalutis</hi> neceſſarie to ſaluation, and who ſo beleeued
it not, could not be ſaued: behold vpon what holy ſcriptures
it is founded? vpon a legend of mens ſayinges diſagreeing
among themſelues. The cauſe taken away, the effect ceaſeth.
If Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were not Biſhop of Rome, it followeth, that
all whatſoeuer is ſayd touching the ſucceſſion, &amp; Primacie of
the Pope, is meere lyes, and faſhood. Alſo Saint Peters Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was to be Apoſtle of the circumciſion among the
Iewes, and that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of the vncircumciſion among
the Gentiles. Gal. 2. 7. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans themſelues,
alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 20.</note> that he preached the Goſpell, where none had
once made mention thereof: and giueth a reaſon. Beaſt
he ſhould ſeeme to build vpon a ſtraunge foundation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it followeth, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not at Rome. Alſo in
the Epiſtles which he wrote, being priſoner in Rome, he
ſent ſalutations from the faithfull, which were then in Rome,
without any mention made of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And had he bene in
Rome, it is to be thought, he would haue named him. Read the
4. chapter of the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians. from the 10. verſe
vnto the 14. where he ſaith. Salute <hi>Ariſtareus,</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> called <hi>Iuſtus,</hi> which be of the circumciſion. Theſe onely
be they, that aſſiſted me in the kingdome of God and were a
comfort vnto me. Whereupon it followeth, that Saint Peter was
not at Rome, ſeeing he neither did aſſiſt, nor comfort him.
This Epiſtle was written from Rome. And in the 2. to Timoth.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19632:18"/>
cap. 4. 1. 2 which ſome what before his martyrdome he wrote
the ſecond time being priſoner in Rome: and in the Epiſtle to
<hi>Philemon,</hi> verſe 23. and 24. Alſo in the Epiſtle which he wrote
to the Romanes, he not once maketh mention of Saint Peter,
to whom no doubt he would haue ſent ſalutations, had hee
bene in Rome: and which is more: Saint Peter, being Biſhop
at Rome (as they ſay) 25. yeares. Read the laſt chap. of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
and thou ſhalt ſee the catalogue which S. Paule maketh
from the fift verſe to the fifteenth, he ſaith onely: Salute ſuch a
one, ſalute ſuch a one, &amp;c. without naming of Saint Peter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he neither was Biſhop of Rome, nor yet was in Rome.
Alſo, the Iewes which dwelled in Rome (as reciteth S. Luke,
Act. 28. 21. 22.) ſaid to S. Paule, when he came priſoner to
Rome, that they had not heard nor vnderſtood any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him: and prayed him to declare his opinion touching
that ſect, which was gainſayd and euill ſpoken of in all places,
vnderſtanding by this ſect the Goſpel which Saint Paule prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
Who will beleeue that S. Peter which (as they ſay) was
before come to Rome, and a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, had
not taught nor ſpoken ought vnto them of the Goſpell? Theſe
reaſons taken out of holy Scripture, are me ſeemeth (as they be)
very ſufficient to proue the common opinion holden of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being Biſhop of Rome, and that 25. yeares, to be falſe.
Whereupon that of the Papiſts appeares plainely to be meere
ignorance, or (which is worſe) extreame malice, when they call
the Pope Saint Peters ſucceſſor, Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt, as though
hee were Saint Peter, and therefore vniuerſall Biſhop. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Primacie of the Pope, we will ſpeake in the end of
this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Seeing then Saint Peter was not Biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Linus.</note> we place
<hi>Linus</hi> for the firſt. All the Biſhops of Rome that were from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
to <hi>Sylueſter</hi> (who was in the time of the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
the great) whom we will put in the firſt order, were
in generall trulie Biſhops and holy men, who with their
good doctrine, and holy life and conuerſation, wrought great
fruit in the Church of God: They were the ſalt of the earth,
the light of the world, a Citie built vpon a mountaine, a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
light, and ſet vpon a candleſticke. Theſe be the titles
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19632:19"/>
wherewith Chriſt adorneth his apoſtles and miniſters, Math. 5.
Theſe were the Angelles of God according to the ſaying of
<hi>Malachie;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 6. 7.</note> ſpeaking of Leuie, and conſequently, of the good
Miniſters: <hi>The lawe of trueth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was in his mouth, and no
iniquitie was found in his lippes: In peace and equitie he walked with
me, and turned away from iniquitie: For the prieſtes lippes ſhould
preſerue knowledge, and they ſhould ſeeke the lawe at his mouth:
for he is the Angell of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Many more titles are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in the holy ſcriptures, wherewith the true miniſters are
adorned: which I will paſſe ouer, to auoide tediouſnes. In the
ende, theſe good biſhops of Rome, ſealed the Goſpell which
they had preached with their bloud: and ſo were Martyrs
of Ieſus Chriſt. Men they were, poore in ſpirit, and ſimple of
heart, ſtrangers to couetoſnes and ambition. they were true
biſhops for the ſpace of almoſt three hundred yeares:<note place="margin">300 years good biſhops in Rome.</note> And ſo
the Church of the Lord hauing ſuch miniſters, was then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
and rich in the ſight of God: albeit in the eies of men,
contemptible &amp; miſerable; ſuch as the Apoſtle in the eleuenth
chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, from the 36. to the 38.
verſe deſcribeth. <hi>Others</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue benetryed by mocking, and
ſcourgings, yea, moreouer by bonds and impriſonment. 37. Others
were ſtoned; others were hewen aſunder. Others were tempted.
others ſlayne with the ſworde. Others wandered vp and downe in
ſheepes skinnes, and in goats skinnes, being deſtitute, afflicted and
tormented 38. whome the worlde was vnworthie of: they wandred
in wilderneſſes, and mountaynes, and dens, and caues of the earth,
&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Biſhops caried on their heads, not Miters, but coifes,
not honor, but diſhonor: not riches, but pouerty: following
herein their Maiſter, as Eſaias the Prophet in his chapter 53. 3.
doth liuelie deſcribe him. <hi>Deſpiſed and forſaken of men: a man
full of ſorrowes, hauing experience of infirmities, and we hid</hi> (as it
were) <hi>our faces from him; he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him
not.</hi> This was the outward apparance of the Primitiue Church;
and ſo hath it bene in our time: ſithens the reformation of the
Church began theſe 70. or 80. yeers vnto this time, how many
haue bin burned, drowned, beheaded, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, baniſhed, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſgraced and died of hunger. Truly innumerable; and that
which is more admirable, the more they burned and killed, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19632:19"/>
more they increaſed and multiplied. For the bloud of the
Martyrs (as ſaith <hi>Tertullian)</hi> is the ſeed of the Goſpell. From
the paſſion of the Lord, vnto Saint <hi>Silueſter,</hi> which is the time
of the firſt order, were almoſt three hundred yeares: wherein
the Emperours of Rome became Lords of Spaine. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
in two hundred and ſo manie yeares, that they conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Spaine, vntill the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> were neuer
abſolute Lords thereof. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was the firſt that vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the Montaniſts and Biſcayes, and made himſelfe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Lord of all Spaine.</p>
            <p>The Romiſts, as thoſe (ſay they) that haue held the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and ſtaffe for many yeares, to giue antiquitie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to their ceremonies, and humane traditions, haue
falſly reported, that manie of theſe good Biſhops of Rome
(whom we place in the firſt order) ordained them. <hi>Clement</hi> the
fourth Biſhop of Rome (ſay they) ordained the confirmation
of young children, the Maſſe, and holy garments wherewith
the Prieſts are clothed. They do not conſider that he was a
a man poore, and for preaching of the Goſpell baniſhed into
mines, where he hewed Marble ſtones, and tyed in the end to
an anchor, they caſt him into the ſea.</p>
            <p>D. <hi>Illeſcas,</hi> ſpeaking of Pope <hi>Caius</hi> in his Pontificall hiſtorie
ſaith: He ordained that no laye man might bring a Clearke to
iudgement: That no pagan nor heretike might make accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt a Chriſtian, &amp;c. How can this be true, ſith <hi>Caius</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and died in the time of the tenth perſecution: which (as
<hi>Illeſcas</hi> himſelfe ſaith) was of all the moſt cruell, and laſted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares? Let the Romiſts be aſhamed, and ceaſe with lies to
confirme their religion. Now is it not the time that was wont
to be, when the blind led the blind, &amp;c. So ſay they alſo, that
<hi>Euariſtus, Alexander</hi> and <hi>Siſtus,</hi> fifth, ſixth and ſeuenth Biſhops
of Rome, made the popiſh decrees; namely, the ordering of
the Clergie: holy water, and holy garmentes. <hi>Teleſphorus</hi>
(ſay they) that was the eighth Biſhop of Rome, ordained three
Maſſes to be ſayd on the day of the Natituitie. Theſe good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
had other cares, and embraced not ſuch childiſh and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
toyes. Saciety and idleneſſe brought them forth. O
what euils haue riches wrought to the Church of God? Wiſely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19632:20"/>
therfore ſaid Frederick the Emperour: <hi>Detrahamus illis nocentes
diuitias: hoc enim facere, opus eſt charitatis:</hi> Let vs take away,
(ſpeaking of the Pope and clergie) the riches, which ſo much
hurt them, for this to do is a worke of charitie.</p>
            <p>Here it is to be noted (as reciteth <hi>Panuinus</hi> in his chronicle)
30 Siſmes to haue bin;<note place="margin">1. Siſme.</note> and that which happened in the yeere
252. betweene <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Nouatus,</hi> is counted for the firſt:
and the ſame only hapned in the firſt order: wherin were good
all the Roman Biſhops, except <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> who offred incenſe
to Idols: but touched by God, he greatly repented, ſo came
into the Councell holden at Seſſa, in the kingdom of Naples;
where were preſent (as ſaith D. <hi>Illeſcas)</hi> three hundred Biſhops
and thirtie Presbiters, or (as ſaith <hi>Platina)</hi> 180. Biſhops, and
there asked he with teares, God and them pardon, of the moſt
grieuous ſin which he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Seſſa he went to Rome
and there did chide <hi>Diocleſian</hi> for compelling him to ſacrifice
to Idolles: wherefore <hi>Diocleſian</hi> commanded to kill him. When
<hi>Marcellinus</hi> was dead, the ſeate was voide 7. yeeres and a halfe;
as ſaith <hi>Illeſcas,</hi> and 25. daies, or (as ſaith <hi>Platina)</hi> 25. daies.</p>
            <p>The ſecond order conteineth the biſhops of Rome from
<hi>Silueſter</hi> 1.<note place="margin">The 2. order.</note> vnto <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. Theſe neither in life, nor doctrin
agreed by far with the biſhops of the firſt order. For perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nowe ceaſſing, they gaue themſelues to idleneſſe and
pleaſure and made Cannons, and Decrees, wherby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the ſeate of great Antichriſt. Thoſe of the ſecond order
were called for the ſpace of 200.<note place="margin">Archbiſhops.</note> yeeres Archbiſhops. It is to be
vnderſtood, that from the yeere 320. vnto that of 520. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
from the yere 520. vnto that of 605. they were called
Patriarks.<note place="margin">Patriarks. Liberius an Arrian.</note> S. <hi>Silueſter</hi> was then the firſt Archbiſhop, whome
<hi>Marcus, Iulius.</hi> 1. and <hi>Liberius</hi> ſucceeded: <hi>Liberius</hi> in the
beginning of his Biſhopdome thought well of the diuinitie of
the ſonne of God; and for ought the Arian Emperour <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
did, would not be drawne to condemne <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> for
which cauſe he was baniſhed Rome. <hi>Theodoretus</hi> lib. 2. ca. 16.
of his hiſtorie, reciteth the conference that paſſed between him
and <hi>Conſtantins,</hi> when he was baniſhed; wherein <hi>Liberius</hi>
ſhewed himſelfe verie conſtant. Three yeeres (ſaith <hi>Platina)</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19632:20"/>
this time held a Councell,<note place="margin">Felix. 2.</note> wherein they choſe for biſhop <hi>Felix</hi>
ſecond. This <hi>Felix</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Platina)</hi> was a very good man: and

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſacius,</hi> and
<hi>Valens,</hi> which held part with <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Arrian Emperour,
were depoſed. Theſe two went to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and complained
vpon <hi>Felix,</hi> praying the Emperour to reſtore againe <hi>Liberius,</hi>
who wearied with the trouble of his baniſhment, and nowe
changed his opinion, through ambition, and the counſell of
<hi>Fortunatus,</hi> Biſhop of Aquilea. His baniſhment pardoned,
and <hi>Liberius</hi> reſtored to his Biſhoprike, in and by all things (as
ſaith <hi>Platina)</hi> he agreed with the heretikes. This reſtoring of
<hi>Liberius,</hi> and depoſing of <hi>Felix</hi> cauſed great tumult in Rome,
ſo that the matter came to blowes, and many Prieſtes and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall

others for an Arrian, and both the one and the other

we haue ſaid) a Catholike, but after without repentance, an
obſtinate Arrian. Note we here what an euill beaſt is ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He that ſtandeth, let him take heed leſt he fall. It ſufficeth
not to begin well, but to end well is needfull. He that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the end (ſaith the Lord) ſhall be ſaued. God giue vs
grace to tame our ambition, which we all haue need of. For
there is none which reputeth not himſelfe for a demi-God:

the day of Conſecration, now called coronation, is a ſolemne

by ſo much the more theſe two beaſts increaſed. It is
now almoſt 1000. yeares ſince, that by ſuperſtition and falſe
Doctrine, the light of the Goſpell began to be darkened. This
miſerable firſt Pope, before a yeare of his Popedome was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ended, went to viſite the Diuell the Father of ambition,
and with him there remayneth. And albeit this firſt Pope
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19632:24"/>
was ſo ambitious and, in his Ambition obſtinately dyed.
Yet <hi>Panuinus</hi> calles him Saint <hi>Boniface</hi> notwithſtanding.
At this time in Spaine, the moſt Catholique <hi>Recaredo</hi> 1. reigned.</p>

               <hi>Boniface</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Boniface 4.</note> ſucceeded <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. who (as ſaith <hi>Platina)</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned

<hi>Pantheon</hi> (to wit of all the Gods, becauſe it was dedicated to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylla,</hi>
and all the others Gods. This Temple did <hi>Boniface</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate

               <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> of <hi>Carthagena</hi> Biſhop of Burgos, vpon the life of

farre the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Here is to be noted the ſaying of the Biſhop, <hi>Platina</hi> and
many others. That the Pope demaunded of the Emperour this
Temple, and that the Emperour did graunt it. Doctor <hi>Illeſcas,</hi>
as a flatterer of the Pope, in his <hi>Hiſt. Pontif.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
did conſecrate the Temple, &amp;c. the which (ſaith he) well
pleaſed the Emperour <hi>Phocas:</hi> and ſaith not: that he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it of the Emperour, leaſt he he ſhould ſeeme to impeach
the authoritie of the Pope. Of that which we haue ſaid it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
that the Pope was not then Lord of Rome: For had he ſo
bene,<note place="margin">The falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</note> he would not haue requeſted the Temple of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
This onely reaſon (were there no other) ſufficeth to
proue the donatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine</hi> (as they call it) to be falſe, which
was almoſt 300. yeers before: wherin he made the Pope (ſaith
they) abſolute Lord of Rome, and of many other lands which

their Maſſes did commit Idolatrie according to their owne

thing hapned; and for that it was one of the wonderfull chances
that euer hapned in the world, I will here declare, as in faithfull
authors I find it written. There was a woman borne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19632:29"/>
who with a man greatly learned liued in her youth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoneſt
life, of whom being welbeloued, and he of her, taking
mans habite, and calling her ſelfe <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſhee left her natiue
countrie, and went with him to the citie of Athens in Grecia,
wherein at that time, was a great Vniuerſitie, and generall
ſtudie. With her excellent wit, and great ſtudie, ſhee there ſo
much learned, and attained ſuch knowledge, that ſome yeares
after ſhe came to the citie of Rome, alwayes in the habite of
a man, tooke the Chaire, and taught openly in which, and
in publike diſputations, ſhee caried ſuch eſtimation, that
ſhe was holden for the moſt learned man of that time: and
ſuch fauour and authoritie among all men obtained, that
the ſeate Apoſtolike by the death of <hi>Leo,</hi> the fourth of that
name being voyd, in the yeare of the Lord 852. ſuppoſed to
be a man,<note place="margin">An. 852. Pope Ione was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</note> ſhe was choſen for chiefe Biſhop of Rome, and
Pope vniuerſall in the Church of God: and in that ſeat ruled
two yeares, and thirtie and ſo many dayes. And albeit placed
in this throne, yet liued ſhe not chaſtly, but vſed priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
with her ſlaue, in whom ſhe much truſted, and by
whom ſhe was great with child, yet ſo diligently ſhe cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
it, that no other but himſelfe knewe it. And as God
would not ſuffer ſo great wickedneſſe to reſt any longer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed:
ſo it happened, that vppon a day (being the time
of her child-birth) as ſhe went with accuſtomed pompe to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Saint <hi>Iohn de Lateran:</hi> of a ſecrete ſinne it pleaſed God to
ſhew an open puniſhment: and comming to a certaine place
betweene the Church of Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> and the Theater,
which they call improperly <hi>Coliſeo,</hi> with extreme paine ſhee
brought forth a creature, to the wonderfull amazement of
thoſe that were preſent: and therewithall ſodainly died: and
without honour, or pompe was buried. For this ſo ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
in this place happened, it is commonly ſayd, that when
the chiefe Biſhops go ſithence to the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pope tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth aſide, and the cauſe.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
neere vnto it, they turne aſide &amp; go not that way, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of ſo horrible a chance. And leſt happily another ſuch
like woman might worke the like deceit,<note place="margin">A ſeat and for what cauſe.</note> there is now in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

The Romans now aſhamed at the ceremonie for which his

Another like ſeat there is, or was if it be not thence taken,
in the Monaſterie <hi>de Monte Caſſino,</hi> where in olde time they
choſe many Popes. The ſame Author proceedeth. In that way
(ſaith he) is alſo a ſtatue of ſtone,<note place="margin">A ſtatue in Rome of Pope Ione.</note> repreſenting the child-birth
and death of this bold woman. Thus farre <hi>Pero Mexia.</hi> That
which he ſaith of the ſtatue, and the cauſe of it there being, is
moſt true.<note place="margin">The ceremonie of the ſeat now not vſed, and the couſe.</note> But it is to be vnderſtood, that the ceremony of the

was Pope, called <hi>Iohn</hi> the fourteenth. <hi>Innocentius</hi> 8. had 8.
ſonnes, and as many daughters. But leauing out the auncient
let vs come to our later Popes. How manie hee and ſhe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards
had our Spaniſh <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth? Of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth
it is ſayd, that he had baſtardes, and that <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth
was his ſonne, of whom the Biſhop <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> counteth
manie abominations. <hi>Paule</hi> the third had baſtardes, among
whom was one, and <hi>Pero Lewis</hi> his name, the moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Sodomite of his time, and for the ſame was put to
death. Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth, not long ſince decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
before and when he was Pope, had alſo baſtardes. <hi>Iohn
Pannonius</hi> giueth the like reaſon with vs in theſe verſes:

Logitian, I further anſwer: that an argument taken <hi>ab autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate

this word: therefore it is not Latine: but if any other Latine

As ſhe by their owne Cannons was not Pope: ſo all thoſe that
ſhe ordained were not Prieſtes, nor did celebrate, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate.
And all the people in hearing their Maſſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
idolatrie. Who then was head and vniuerſall Biſhop of
the Church? Who Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour? Who the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car

was Pope, and after. <hi>Pero Mexia</hi> hereof aduiſing, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
that albeit neither ſhe, nor any other woman, be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to receiue any character of ordination, nor to ordaine,
nor abſolue anie, and thoſe which were ſo ordained, ought to
be againe ordained; yet the grace of the Sacrament did ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
for thoſe that with a good faith, by an inuincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
did receiue it. I anſwer, he deceiues himſelfe: for thoſe
are not Sacraments, which are not adminiſtred by thoſe whom
God hath ordained, albeit they haue many imperfections;
yea although they be hypocrites, as by the Prieſtes that liued
in the time of Ieſus Chriſt, appeareth: which, albeit they were
wicked, yet becauſe they were of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> and ſo
outwardly called, their Sacrifices were Sacrifices, and their
Sacraments were Sacraments. And ſo the Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
when they found them ſacrificing and celebrating in
the Temple, held them for ſuch. Contrariwiſe the Sacrifices
which the Prieſtes of <hi>Ierohoam</hi> did offer, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by them adminiſtred, were no Sacrifices, nor Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe they were not adminiſtred by thoſe of the
Tribe of <hi>Leuie,</hi> whome God himſelfe had ordained. <hi>Ione</hi>
then, being a woman (I ſay) was no Prieſt, and being no
Prieſt, had authoritie neither to ordeine nor yet to conſecrate
and therefore the Prieſtes by her authoritie ordained, were
not the Prieſtes of God, but of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> or of <hi>Baal.</hi> And

Thus farre Cardinall <hi>Bennon.</hi> This <hi>Hildebrand</hi> demanding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

he caſt the ſacrament into the fire,<note place="margin">The Pope bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> albeit the Cardinals

named another Emperour, to whom he wrote this verſe:</p>

This <hi>Rodulph,</hi> was Duke of Sueuia. <hi>Henrie</hi> here with
diſquieted, left his Imperiall ornaments, and with his wife and
little ſonne in the middle of winter, came to Canuſium, where
the pope remained. The Emperour clothed in linnen, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
made a ſpectacle (as ſaieth Cardinall <hi>Bennon)</hi> to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

he faſting from morning to night, humbly crauing mercie.
The beaſt muſt be cut off; his horne hath very much increaſed.
Somewhat long is the hiſtorie, but we will make it ſhort. Thus
abode there the Emperour for three dayes ſpace: and when he
inſtantly craued licenſe to enter. The Biſhop (he was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)

ende, the fourth day, at requeſt of the Counteſſe <hi>Mathilda,</hi>
(who ſayth the hiſtorie much loued the Pope) and others, the

<hi>Aelexander</hi> hearing of ſuch, and ſo great victories, beganne

would newly aſſaile him. To preuent ſo great a miſchiefe, by

his followers. His people on horſeback all that day and the next
ſought him, and not finding him, it was bruited through the
hoſt, that the Emperour was drowned. And ſuppoſing that

the Emperour was preſented to the Souldan, he fained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

happened, that he gaue him libertie, with this condition, that
an euerlaſting peace ſhould be betweene them, and that he
ſhould pay an hundred thouſand duckets for his ranſome: for

the Soldan diſmiſſed the Emperour, and giuing him many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,

34 horſemen to attend him, &amp; ſo came he to <hi>Brixia,</hi> where
he abode. The Gemane Princes hearing of the Emperours
arriuall, came to kiſſe his hands, and giue him the welcome-home.
The Emperour rewarded the Souldans people that had
attended on him, and ſent them backe to their Lord againe.
This done the Emperour held a Diet in Norinberge: where he
recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that which had hapned, the great treaſon of the Pope,

the Emperor with an Armie ſent <hi>Otho</hi> his ſonne: &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him not to fight before his comming. The young
Prince deſirous of fame, ſought with the Venetians againſt the
commandement of his father, of whom he was vanquiſhed,
and carried priſoner to Venice. This was a notable victorie: for
the Generall of the Venetians, called <hi>Ciano,</hi> brought but thirie

loue he bare to his ſonne, did all whatſoeuer he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
He came to Saint <hi>Markes:</hi> where the Pope before all the
people commanded the Emperour to proſtrate himſelfe, and

Another ſuch like thing as this, to the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> (of

like vnto ſtumpets, which no longer loue their ruffians, then
they do them ſeruice. In the time of this Pope, which was in

the 1212 yeare, ſome of the Nobles of Alſacia (as <hi>Huldericus

he ſuffered not the Prieſts to be maried: And becauſe certaine

becauſe he had taken ſome citties of the Patrimonie of Saint

for his excuſe, he would not heare. He incited manie Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, which thing the Emperor ſeeing, to auoyd the furie
of the Pope, he went to Paleſtina to make warre with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
as the pope commanded. But when the Emperor was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the ſea, then the Pope made himſelfe Maiſter of Pulla, and
would not conſent that the croſſed ſouldiers, which were to
go and ſerue the Emperour, ſhould paſſe the ſea. The Emperor
went thither, where ſo valiantly he behaued himſelfe, that he
wan Ieruſalem and other cities, and made truce with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
for ten yeares. All which, by his Embaſſadors he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Pope, ſuppoſing that the Pope would haue reioyced:
But ſo farre off was the Pope from reioycing at the newes,<note place="margin">A cruell and lying Pope.</note> that
he commanded thoſe which brought them to be ſlaine, leſt
they ſhould tell them to others, and bruted it abroad, that the
Emperour was dead. This did the Pope, that thoſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
citties of Pulla, which were not yet rendered, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Emperours death might yeeld themſelues vnto
him. Herein the Pope ſhewed himſelfe a murtherer and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the verie ſonne of the diuell. And that the Emperour
might not returne, the Pope by letteres requeſted the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
not to deliuer the holie land vnto him. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
ſet all things in good order, returned into Italie, and
recouered againe that which the Pope had vſurped in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.
The Pope ſeeing this, did excommunicate him againe,
obiecting againſt him, that hee had made truce with the
Souldan: yet in the end by the mediatiation of the Princes
the Pope abſolued the Emperour, prouided that he payd for
his abſolution an hundred thouſand ounces of gold, or as ſaith
<hi>Hiſt. Pontific.</hi> vpon the life of this <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, a hundred
twenty fiue thouſand ounces. But <hi>Nauclerus,</hi> Friar <hi>Iohn de Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda,
Rerum Germanicarum Epitome:</hi> and <hi>Carion lib.</hi> 5. ſay,
120000. ounces of gold. How deerely the Pope ſelleth his vile
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19632:49"/>
merchandiſe here appeareth. There is no Mercer, chapman,
nor Pedler, which ſell ſo deere their wares, as the Pope ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his inke, paper, waxe, and leade. When the Emperour
was departed out of Italy, hee vnderſtood that the Pope and
his confederates ſought to depriue him of the Empire: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he returned into Italy and chaſtiſed the rebelles. The
Pope hearing thereof, did eftſoones excommunicate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
as then in Pauia, who now vnable any longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the couetouſneſſe, ſauſineſſe and tyranny of the Pope,
reſolued to make them knowne to all faithfull Chriſtians,
that they might fly from the error &amp; falſe religion of the Popes.
For this cauſe he commaunded a man well exerciſed in the
Scripture, to preach in his preſence, wherein he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of Excommunication, and the Roman Church. And ſo
it was. The Sermon being ended, the errours of the Romane
Church were ſo diſcouered and the craft and ſubtiltie of the

enemie. I will here recite what ſaith <hi>Ieronymus Marius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Pope, of him ſaith he: that being Pope he held a
Councell againſt the Emperor at Lyous in Fraunce: in which
Councell the Pope himſelfe cited the Emperour. The Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of the Emperour beſought the Pope to giue him time
to come to the Councell: this time the Pope refuſed to graunt,
but there, like a mad man, excommunicated and depoſed
the Emperour: commaunding that none ſhould obey him,
and the Princes to chooſe another Emperour: whom he ſo
ſollicited, and with promiſes deceiued, that they choſe for
Emperour <hi>Henrie,</hi> Lantgraue of Turingia. <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
vnderſtanding hereof, againſt the Pope and the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelfe valiantly, vntill being in Pulla, he could not
eſcape the ſnares of the Pope, where a certaine man by the
Pope corrupted, did poyſon him. Yet began he notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to recouer,<note place="margin">The Pope cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to be poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> vntill a young man called <hi>Manfredo</hi> with
money alſo (as ſome ſay) by the pope corrupted, ſtrangled
him with a towell. Concerning this good Emperour, no
credite is to be giuen either to <hi>Blundus, Platina, Eſtella,</hi> nor
<hi>Sabellicus,</hi> becauſe they wrote the ſayings of the Pope and his

               <note place="margin">Preachers preach againſt the Pope.</note> In Sueuia at this time were preachers, that with great
libertie preached the truth, againſt the Pope and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
they iuſtified the cauſe of the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19632:50"/>
ſecond and <hi>Conrad</hi> his ſonne: and boldly affirmed, that neithe
the Pope, Cardinals, nor Biſhops had any authority, becauſe
they were ſtained with Simony, and that they held no power
which Chriſt had giuen them. The Prieſts (ſayd they) being in
mortall ſinne, did neither bind nor looſe, nor yet conſecrate at
al, &amp;c. At the end of their ſermons, they ſaid, that the indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
which they preached, were not feigned of the Pope, nor inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his Prelates, but graunted by the omnipotent God. In
the foreſayd Councell of Lugdanum,<note place="margin">Hats clokes &amp; trapped horſes.</note> 
               <hi>Innocent</hi> ordeined, that
the Cardinals ſhould vſe red ſhadowes (which they call hattes)

to adorne his order of Cardinals. Note for this purpoſe,
concerning the Cardinals, that which <hi>Pero Mexia</hi> vpon the
life of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth ſaith: where to paint
Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> with a hat is made a mockerie: for Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>
died aboue 850 yeares before <hi>Innocent</hi> inuented the hattes.
This Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth had many baſtards; whom, after
the popiſh cuſtome he called Nephewes. Vntill the time of this
Pope (as noteth <hi>Bibliander)</hi> there was no article of faith,<note place="margin">Tranſnbſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation &amp; adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread &amp; wine.</note> nor law
of the Church, that men ſhould worſhip the bread and wine in

by his tranſubſtantiation: albeit true it is, that <hi>Honorius</hi> 3. began
this building. This Pope offered to <hi>Henry</hi> 3. king of England,
the kingdome of both Sicils,<note place="margin">Anno 1254.</note> if he would buy it. In the 1254.

and therefore contenting my ſelfe to haue put downe the

who, (he or ſhee) vpon this day, will not ſee, and be ſeene;
&amp; that beſide which paſſeth, more to be lamented then laughed

               <hi>Clement</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Clement. 5. a cruell Pope.</note> a Frenchman was like his predeceſſors, cruell, and

<hi>Philip</hi> king of France, and <hi>Charles</hi> king of Sicill, hearing of this

of Paris ayded by the fauour of their king <hi>Phillip</hi> the faire,
who had withdrawne himſelfe, and all his kingdome from the
Popes obedience; compelled the Pope (as he did) to recant: &amp;
not without ſound of trumpet, for feare of looſing his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
as <hi>Iohn Gerſon</hi> in the ſermon of Eaſter, doth witnes. The
errors of this Pope which now we will reckon are according to
the papiſts,<note place="margin">Pope Iohn 23. diſalowed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</note> errors; but according to Chriſtian religion perfect
truth. He commaunded the Nunnes, called <hi>Beguinas,</hi> to marry.
He could not abide to ſee pictures, nor Images. He affirmed
that Ieſus Chriſt gaue no other rule to his Apoſtles, then that
which he had giuen to all faithfull Chiſtians. The Apoſtles (ſaid
he) neuer vowed Chaſtitie; And that vowes make not them
perfect, which vowe them; nor put them in the ſtate of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

the Emperour <hi>Lodowicke</hi> of Bauiera for a Rebell, Siſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,

for that the Emperour being elected by the Princes, without
othe of ſubiection to the Pope, as <hi>Clement</hi> 5. had commanded,
tooke vpon him the adminiſtration of the Empire. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to auoyd contention, ſent his Embaſſadours to the Pope,
being then at Auignon: requeſting at his hands the authority
and title of the Emperour. But ſo farre of was the Pope from
graunting this, that he ſent home with a miſchiefe, and verie
euill intreated the Ambaſſadours;<note place="margin">Nothing is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the Pope to the Emperour.</note> peremptorily cyting the

knowing the tyrannie which the Pope vſurped in the Church,
and perceiuing that he had receiued onely of God his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
Maieſtie, would not, as a ſeruant, ſubiect himſelfe, nor
come to Auignon. Affecting peace notwithſtanding, he eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones
by Embaſſadours did gently requeſt him to graunt
what he demaunded. The Pope was ſtill obſtinate, and for
the hate which he bare to the Emperor, excommunicated the
Vicounts, whom the Emperour had placed to gouerne Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.
When the Emperour ſawe his obſtinacie, he came to
Rome: where he was very magnifically receiued: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of the Romanes that which the Pope had denyed
him: The Nobles of Rome hearing this, ſent their meſſengers
to the Pope, beſeeching him to come to Rome, and graunt that
which the Emperour deſired: which if he denyed to doe, they
would doe (ſaid they) according to the law and auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the Romans: yet for all this was the Pope nothing
moued, but rather much more incenſed, and caſt them from
his preſence, with many iniuries and threatnings. When the
people of Rome ſaw this, they determined to graunt that which
the Emperour demaunded: and ſo the Senators <hi>Stephen</hi> and
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> by commaundement of the Clergie &amp; people crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Emperour, with his wife the Empereſſe. This knowne
to Pope <hi>Iohn;</hi> he made great proceſſe againſt the Emperour
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19632:57"/>
calling him heretique, and ſaying he had committed high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
he depriued him of all that he had, excommunicating
him a new, with a moſt cruell excommunication. Thus farre
<hi>Ieronymus Marius.</hi> Diuines and lawyers in thoſe times were
not wanting that affirmed Chriſt and his Apoſtles to haue
had nothing in proper, and that the Emperour in temperall
thinges was not ſubiect to the Pope. The Emperour and
Nobles of Rome well perceiuing the villanies of the Pope; and
the Romans much ſtomacking their meſſengers bad intreatie
with the Pope; all with one conſent determined that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cuſtome of chooſing the Roman Biſhop, ſhould bee
eftſoones obſerued:<note place="margin">The ancient cuſtome of Pope chooſing renewed.</note> namely, that the Pope being choſen by

Italians, &amp; 13 Frenchmen) aroſe great contention. The French
being many more in number, might eaſily haue preuailed, but
they durſt not, for the Romans were in armes, and threatened
them, except they choſe an Italian. For which cauſe on Fryday

requiring with weapons in their hands, that the Pope ſhould be

&amp; all the reſt almoſt Neapolitans. <hi>Pandulphus Colenucius,</hi>
a moſt learned Lawyer, addeth in his Latine Neapolitan hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another cruelty, much greater then this we haue ſpoken of.
This <hi>Vrban</hi> (ſaith he) being in Genoa, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to death three
Cardinals, commanded their heads to be cut off, their bodies to
be roſted in a furnace &amp; being roſted, to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into ſackes, and
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer he went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one people to another, he caried them
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 3 horſes: &amp; that it might be known they had bin Cardinals,
they placed their red hats vpon the ſackes. All this he did, to be
feared: &amp; that none ſhold dare to attempt ought againſt him.
Thus far <hi>Colenucius.</hi> This <hi>Vrban</hi> vnable by force and artes, to be
reuenged on Queene <hi>Iane,</hi> ſent to intreat <hi>Charles,</hi> nephew of
the king of Hungarie, to come aid him with an hoſt, &amp; he would
make him king of <hi>Naples. Charles</hi> aided with the counſel &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
of the king his vncle, came and ſeazed the kingdome of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19632:61"/>
Naples: tooke Queene <hi>Iane,</hi> who was retired to Newcaſtle,
a fort in Naples, and ſo taken, put her to death. The Pope vntil
this time was a great friend vnto <hi>Charles:</hi> but as peace among
the wicked doth not long continue, ſo this great loue of the
Pope turned into much more hatred. And why, deeme you,
his Diuelliſhneſſe was ſo much offended? The cauſe was, for
that <hi>Charles</hi> refuſed at the Popes requeſt, to make the Nephew
(or as ſome thinke the ſonne) of the Pope Prince <hi>Campano.
Platina, Colenucius,</hi> and others recite this hiſtorie. When the
Pope could not obtaine this, being a man vnciuill, vngentle,
and ill beloued, began to threaten. Wherere with the king was
ſo much offended, that the Pope for certaine dayes durſt not
go abroad. But the Pope a while diſſembling this iniurie, for
exceſſiue heate, as he ſaid departed by the Kings conſent from
Naples to Nocera. The Pope come to Nocera, there fortified
himſelfe, and made new Cardinals. He made proceſſe againſt
the king, and ſent to cite him to appeare before him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the king anſwered: that he would come quickly to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera,
not only with words, but with weapons to iuſtify his cauſe.
The king came, and with a great campe beſieged the citie. The
Pope ſeeing himſelf ſo beſieged, eſcaped and went to Genoua,
where he acted that, which we haue before ſpoken of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.
When <hi>Lodowicke</hi> king of hungarie, and vncle to <hi>Charles,</hi>
was dead, the Nobles of Hungarie ſent for <hi>Charles</hi> king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to make him king of Hungarie:<note place="margin">Anno 1385.</note> whither <hi>Charles</hi> went, in
the yeare 1385. &amp; by great treaſon of her that had bene Queen
of Hungarie was ſlaine. When <hi>Vrban</hi> (as reporteth <hi>Colenucius</hi>
in his Neapolitane hiſtorie) heard of the cruell death of <hi>Charles,</hi>
he tooke great pleaſure: and when the ſword, as yet bloudie,
wherewith <hi>Charles</hi> was ſlaine, was preſented vnto him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
and did contemplate the ſame with great ioy aud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
So did not <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> being a pagan, no Chriſtian,

is confirmed in the 3.<note place="margin">Notable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gerſon.</note> and 18. Seſſions of the Councell of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile.
In the Councell of Conſtance, was <hi>Iohn Gerſon.</hi> a famous
diuine, preſent; who not onely with wordes, but alſo with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
approued and extolled this decree, that the Pope was to
be ſubiect to the Councell. This decree, he ſaith, deſerued to be
fixed in all Churches, and in all publike places, for a perpetuall
remembrance. He ſaith, that thoſe which brought this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
into the Church, that the chiefe Biſhop ought not to
obey the Councell, and that the Councell neither ought, nor
could Iudge the Pope, were pernicious flatterers. As though
the Councell receiued all that power and dignity of the chiefe
Biſhop, and could not be aſſembled but at the will of the Pope:
As though there were no law for the Pope, nor account to be
demaunded of that which he did. Such monſtrous words (ſaith
he) ought to be far from vs: as thoſe that be contrary to lawes,
equitie and reaſon. He ſaith: that all authoritie whatſoeuer
the Church holdeth, the ſame holdeth the Councell, and
that apleales from the Pope ought and may be made to the
Councell.<note place="margin">As the whole is greater then part. So the Councell is greater then the Pope.</note> He ſaith: that they which demaunde, whether
the Pope or Church be greater? Doe no leſſe then they,
that demaunded, whether the whole or parte bee greater?
The Councell (ſaith he) hath authoritie and right, to chuſe,
Iudge, and depoſe the chiefe Biſhop. All which, with the
Councell of Conſtance, <hi>Gerſon</hi> confirmed. This Councell
Iudged the cauſes of three Popes <hi>Gregorie 12. Benedict</hi> 13. and
<hi>Iohn</hi> 24. and finding them all there faulty, depoſed them and
elected <hi>Martin 5. Eneas Siluius,</hi> afterwardes called <hi>Pius</hi> 2.
was preſent in the Councell of <hi>Baſill,</hi> and wrote all whatſoeuer
was there debated, extolling to the clouds that was there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed:
but afterwards being Pope, he changed his opinion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
that the Councell ought to be ſubiect to the Pope. The v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie
of Paris (a few moneths before <hi>Luther</hi> handled the
queſtion of Indulgence) from <hi>Leo</hi> 10. appealed to the Councel
This decree of the Councels of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſill,</hi> did not,
nor yet doth pleaſe the Popes flatterers, who againſt their
owne conſciences make the Pope God in the earth, &amp; abſolute
Lord of all. <hi>Iohn Wickeliffe</hi> an Engliſhman before in England
deceaſed, for freely preaching, the euangelical Doctrin which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19632:65"/>
diſcouereth hypocriſie and falſe papiſticall doctrine,<note place="margin">Hiſtoria Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia cap. 36.</note> was in this
Councell condemned: For the ſame alſo were <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> &amp; <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
of Prage, who ſuffered their Martyrdome with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
and ioyfulnes, condemned and burned. <hi>Pius</hi> 2. ſaith: that
<hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was greater in age &amp; authoritie, but <hi>Ierome</hi> was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in learning and eloquence. And a little before, he ſaith: both
ſuffered death with a conſtant mind,<note place="margin">The Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Iohn Hus and Ierome of Prage.</note> &amp; as if they had bene inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſome banquet, they prepared themſelues to go to the
fire. When the fire began, they ſung a Pſalme, which the flame
&amp; ruſhing in of the fire could hardly hinder. None of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
with ſuch conſtancy &amp; fortitude of mind is read to haue
ſuffered death, as theſe men endured the fire. <hi>Eneas Siluius,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
an enemy, thus ſpeaketh of them. Vnder ſafe conduct
came theſe two to diſpute &amp; maintaine their cauſe, as they did
in the Councell. But neither faith, nor promiſe regarded, they
againſt all law and reaſon were condemned and burned. The
reaſon, which the Papiſts yeeld for this deed doing, is, becauſe
no faith is to be kept with heretiques. This faith-breach, was
cauſe of great bloodſhed in the great warres which afterwards
happened in <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Bohemia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Conſtancie.</note> as <hi>Siluius</hi> himſelfe reporteth. Great praiſe
worthy are the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> that with great conſtancy, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed
in the good Doctrine, and reformation, which theſe
holy martirs of Ieſus Chriſt taught them. And ſo much the more
is their praiſe, by how much the more they haue ſuffered trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
&amp; perſecutions for almoſt 200 yeares: &amp; yet by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God doe they ſtil vſe this good doctrine, and reformation,
which from thence hath crept to <hi>Morauia</hi> and <hi>Polonia</hi> the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
regions. In our time, hath God ſtretched the ſame
through Germany, &amp; from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſpread throughout al Europe,
and hath further paſſed the great Ocean ſea, and gone to India,
all the lets of Antichriſt, by meanes of his Inquiſitors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
and the more they ſhall burne, the more will it ſpread
abroad, becauſe (as before we haue ſaid of <hi>Tertulian)</hi> The bloud
of the Martirs, is the ſeede of the Goſpell. <hi>Carança,</hi> in his <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Councel, for chuſing ſuch a Biſhop. And proſtrating
himſelfe before the Pope, kiſſed his feete. This pope embraced
him as his brother, &amp; gaue him thankes, that by his meanes and
trauell the Church was quieted, after ſo great a Siſme. But for
all this friendſhip, the Pope ſecretly departed from Conſtance:
as ſaith <hi>Volateranus</hi> againſt the will of the Emp. and ſo came to
<hi>Florence:</hi> where taking his pleaſure, he 2 yeares remained. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he departed from Conſtance, the Emp. and other Princes
exhorted him, to giue ſome good order for reformation of the
ouermuch libertie &amp; euill cuſtomes of the Clergie. Whereunto
<hi>Martin</hi> anſwered. That this was with time, nature &amp; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be done, and for confirmation of his anſwere, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically
aleaged the ſaying of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> that euery prouince
hath it cuſtomes &amp; maners, which could not ſodainly be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
without great trouble and damage. How much better
ſhould he haue put his hand to the worke,<note place="margin">The Popes will heare no man to ſpeake vnto them of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> &amp; begun to reforme
himſelfe, and his court of Rome? To ſpeake of reformation to
the Popes, is to ſpeake or preach death vnto them. And this is
the cauſe, why they cannot brook to heare tel of a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they then know, that each one, <hi>tam in capite, quàm in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris:</hi>
Aſwell in the head as in the members,<note place="margin">The Councels haue depoſed Popes and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted others.</note> wil begin to ſpeake
of reformation. They reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that the Councels haue depoſed
Popes, and placed others. They remember that in the Councell
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19632:66"/>
of <hi>Piſa,</hi> celebrated in the 1410. yeare, 2 Popes were depoſed,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> elected: that in the Councell of Conſtance, in
the 1416. yeare, were 3 depoſed, and <hi>Martin</hi> choſen: And in
the Councell of Baſil, in the 1432. yeare, <hi>Eugenius</hi> was depoſed
and <hi>Amadeus</hi> choſen.<note place="margin">The Popes enemies to the Councels.</note> For this cauſe would the Popes haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
no Councels: And albeit for ſhame they cannot but
graunt that a Councell ſhalbe, the Pope feareth (as to eate poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
to be preſent therein; but ſendeth his Legats; which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomably,
as in the laſt Trident Councel (which buried ſo many
Popes, and none of them appeared in the Councell) was ſeene.
The Popes doe feare (as before we haue ſaid) leaſt the like to
them (as to the others Popes) ſhould happen in the Councels.
For theſe cauſes, made <hi>Martin</hi> a decree, that no Councel, after
that of Conſtance, before 5 yeares paſſed ſhould be holden; &amp;
after that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, ten yeares ſhould paſſe, before another Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

deſire. If any Pope, in maners be leſſe wicked (for in Doctrine
be they al Antichriſts) &amp; in his Roman Court wiſheth &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
ſome reformation: then doubtleſſe enſueth ſome conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
againſt him, that they giue him a morſel wherewith they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch

yeare,<note place="margin">The Councell of Baſil.</note> was the <hi>Eugenius</hi> cited by the Councell of Baſil. But he
knowing that the Councell would be aboue the Pope: and that

king of Caſtile, albeit he had ſent his Embaſſadors, and learned

incited <hi>Lewes</hi> the Dolphin of France, with an hoſt to go to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil
and breake off the Councell, whereof enſued great miſchief.
This <hi>Eugenius</hi> was the cauſe of the vnfortunate death of <hi>Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus</hi>
king of Hungarie,<note place="margin">A miſerable example, for ſuch as keepe not their faith albeit to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel.</note> in counſelling him to breake his faith &amp;

but of 22 yeares, tooke: &amp; ſo ſet vpon the Turke, when (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

ſeeing this vnfaithfulnes, reinforced himſelfe, &amp; returned vpon
him. In which battel the king, with Cardinal <hi>Caeſarinus</hi> the Popes
Legate was ſlaine, &amp; his hoſt deſtroyed. It hath wontedly bene
argued, whether faith and promiſe giuen to an infidell, might
lawfully be broken: wherunto I anſwer that, which Frier <hi>Iohn de
Pineda, lib. 26. cap.</hi> 28. ¶1. to this purpoſe ſaith. There is no doubt
(ſaith he) but faith is to be kept aſwel to an enemy, albeit he be
an Infidel, as to a friend &amp; Chriſtian: the reaſon which he giueth
is this: becauſe the bond to obſerue it, iſſueth from the law of
nature, which is indiſpenſable, God hauing bin put for witnes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19632:67"/>
of the truth that each one promiſeth to another, &amp;c. So that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi>
the fourth was wicked indiſpenſing: and <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> was
periured againſt God, notwithſtanding the Popes diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Wickedly did the Councel of Conſtance, which brake faith
with <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Ierome of Prage.</hi> Much better did the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Don Charles:</hi> who being but young, of 21 yeares, ſent
with ſafe conduct for <hi>Luther,</hi> who appeared before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
at Wormes, and publikely gaue an account of his faith;
and the Emperor (keeping with him his word) ſent him backe,
albeit the Spaniards did incite him to kill him. Much better did
the Captaine <hi>Mondragon</hi> in keeping the faith which he had
promiſed to the Prince of Orange,<note place="margin">Thomas Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> whoſe priſoner he was. This
<hi>Eugenius</hi> moſt cruelly burned a Frenchman, called <hi>Thomas Re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
a Carmelit, for ſaying, that in Rome were committed great
abominations: that the Church had need of great reformation:
and that when Chriſts glory was in queſtion, the Popes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
ought not to be feared. <hi>Antoninus part. 3. tit. 22. cap.</hi>
10. maketh mention of this <hi>Thomas.</hi> And <hi>Baptiſta Mantuanus</hi>
in the laſt chapter of his booke <hi>de vita beata,</hi> giueth him an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
teſtimonie, calling him holy and a martyr. This <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
(as reporteth <hi>Platina)</hi> was verie vnconſtant in his life. In the
beginning of his popedome, guided by euill counſell, he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
things diuine and humane. This <hi>Eugenius</hi> celebrated a
Councell in Florence, to match with that which was holden at

good Patriarke of Conſtantinople, to tranſlate the bible, after
the vulgar latin editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which is that which the Roman Church
approueth) into Greeke: that this tranſlation might among the
Grecians, as the other among the Latines be eſteemed. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things did the Greekes conforme themſelues in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

of tranſubſtantiation: notwithſtanding did the Councell and
Pope allow them for faithful; as ſpeaking of Tranſubſtantiation

Thus far this booke. And in two words to ſpeak all;

that our aduerſaries may be aſhamed, ſeeing there
be ſome that vnderſtand them: and ſo may turne to the Lord,
who onely is he that pardoneth ſinnes: and graciouſly this for
his ſonne Chriſts ſake. In the 1477. yeare, <hi>Siſtus</hi> 4. did inſtitute

there. And being brought to this ſhut gate, ſaith the 9. verſe of
Pſal. 24. <hi>Atollite portas principes veſtras, '&amp;c.</hi> Lift vp your heads

Iubile, enter by that gate: for if they enter by another gate, they
ſhall not obteine it. The matter that murreth the gate, is ſo
within vndermined and prepared, that when the Pope ſtriketh,
then falleth it downe. And ſo great is the preſſe of the people
to enter, that ther is no Iubile wherin ſome or more perſons be
not ſtiffled. And ſuch is the ſuperſtition of the common people,
and fooliſh and ignorant deuotion: that it leaueth neither ſmall
ſtone, nor morter, nor earth, nor duſt of that broken wall. Each

depart out of bondage, and haue freedome as the reſt, and that

with great pleaſures: neuer in Rome had ſword players, fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,

people of Rome had leſſe freedome: A great multitude of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
were in his time, and for the leaſt matter, or word, the
puniſhment was death. All this the diuelliſh father permitted,
for the fooliſh loue, that he bare to his children. For he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
his predeceſſor <hi>Innocent,</hi> put all his felicitie in aduancing,
and without all ſhame enriching his baſtards: The leaſt of his
ſonnes he made prince in Sicilia the ſecond, called <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he

Tyber. All this the Pope his father vnderſtood and knew;
yet diſſembled the ſame: For this <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which was the worſt

ambition and auarice he ſlew him. The brother beeing dead,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> eſteemed not the hat, but gaue himſelfe wholly, to
milytary excerciſes: and carrying with him great treaſure, he
went into France, where he married with a neere kinſwoman

by meanes of the king of France, and the Pope his father,

all came out with confuſion, and loſſe of goods,

diſcouered? Aragon as it were by force, receiued afterwardes
the Inquiſition: and ſo they killed the firſt Inquiſitors. In the

reſeruing to himſelfe the determination of ſuch cauſes, as
of a thinge concerning the Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction.
Thus farre Doctour <hi>Illeſcas.</hi> Some yeares after, one <hi>Saya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedra
Cordoves,</hi> perſwaded the king of Portugale that he was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19632:77"/>
ſent a <hi>Nuncio</hi> from <hi>Paul</hi> 3. vnto him. And ſo in the 1545. yeare,
thus brought in the Inquiſition into Portugale. There went
out of Portugale 30000. Iewes. Time brought it to light, that
the Pope had not ſent him, and ſo was he condemned to the
gallies. Another pleaſant conceate haue I heard of this <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
an excellent writer he was, and well knewe to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite
what handſoeuer. This <hi>Nuncio,</hi> remayning in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
came a poore woman to beſeech the Generall of the
gallies, to ayde her with ſome almes, for the mariage of her
poore daughter. The General made anſwere; that very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would he helpe her: but preſent want of money, was the
cauſe he could not. The poore woman with this anſwere depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
weeping; of whom, when the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſaw her weepe, hee
demaunded the cauſe of her weeping: She told him, that
which ſhe had paſſed with the Generall. Then did he comfort
her, ſaying: that he would effect what ſhe deſired. And taking
inke and paper, he wrote theſe words: Steward, vpon ſight of
theſe preſents, giue ſo many thouſand marmades (the number
I remember not) to her that ſhall giue you this ſcedule, which
ſcedule the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſubcribed, as if the Generall himſelfe had
done it. The poore woman departed with her ſcedule to the
Stewarde. The ſteward anſwered: that he wondered his Lord
would in ſuch a time ſend that ſcedule. But ſith ſuch was his
pleaſure, he would giue her that which he commaunded
him to giue her: and ſo gaue it indeede. When the day came
that the Generall tooke account of the ſteward, the ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
preſented the ſaid ſcedule vnto him: which he read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ſaid to the ſteward. True it is, that ſuch a poore
woman came to me to aske an almes: but I anſwered her,
that I could not helpe her for the preſent. And beholding the
ſubſcription ſaid: this is my hand, but I wrote it not. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made inquirie in the gally who had written it: and it
was proued to be the <hi>Nuncio.</hi> For which cauſe the generall
would haue cauſed his hand to be cut off: but at requeſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
his hand cutting was ſpared and he put to the oares. For
by reaſon of his wealth, he rowed not-before. D. <hi>Illeſcas</hi> in the

of the chiefe cauſes of the low countries reuolt: wherein ſo many

Let them then that doe euill be puniſhed; but not tyrannically.
All lawes permit the delinquent to know who is his aduerſarie,

neuer knewe nor ſaw the delinquent, is made partie, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
howe infamous, what villaines ſoeuer, or great enemies
they be, are neuer named, and ſo cannot be excepted againſt.
The which is contrary to all diuine and humane Iuſtice. If the
witneſſes haue witneſſed againſt one, three or foure things, the
Inquiſitors doe charge him, as though the witneſſes had ſpoken
of ten or twelue things, much more horrible then the witneſſes
haue depoſed. And ſo maie the Inquiſitors doe what they liſt,
knowing that there is no reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iudge, which is to take account
of that they haue done. Againſt this tyrannie doe we ſpeake.

the Pope being far of from any ſuch matter (for that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels

in the 1511 yeare.<note place="margin">Anno 1511.</note> The cauſes that moued them ſo to

had they called a Councell: Their purpoſe was, to depriue him
of his Popedome: where vnto he had aſpired through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and bribes. But <hi>Iulius</hi> vnderſtanding hereof commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

When the king of France perceiued that the Pope had
ioyned with the Venecians to make war with him;<note place="margin">Eſaias 5.</note> he called a
Councell at Tours,<note place="margin">Anno 1513.</note> and there propounded theſe 5 queſtions:
whether it were lawfull for the Pope to moue warres, and that
cauſeleſſe, againſt any Prince: whether ſuch a Prince defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his countrie, might ſet vppon him that had inuaded him,
and depart from his obedience? It was anſwered, that it is not
lawfull for the Pope to moue warres, &amp;c. and that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for ſuch a Prince, in defence of himſelfe, to doe that a
foreſaid: and that for the kingdome of France, the law pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmaticall
ought to be obſerued. That no account was to bee
made of the Popes cenſures and excommunications, if then
hee ſhould paſſe them. The King receiuing this anſwere, ſent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19632:80"/>
it to the Pope, praying him eyther to be content with a peace,
or elſe to call a generall Councell, purpoſely to examine and
determine this buſines: but the Pope admitted, neither the one
nor the other. This wretched <hi>Iulius,</hi> as ſome authors report, was
reputed for a great Sodomite. Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of France (ſay they)
ſent 2 youthes to Cardinal <hi>Robertus Nanetenſis</hi> to be inſtructed:
whom the Pope abuſed: the like report, another author ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of an Almaine youth, &amp; great Lord, with whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the like wickedneſſe. Theſe be things, which neither
honeſt pen ought to write, nor chaſt eares to heare: yet is it
needfull to diſcouer the ſhames of the Roman Courte; that
Spaine thereby be no longer deceiued. And for this, pardon
mee good Chriſtian reader. Albeit that ſuch a one was <hi>Iulius;</hi>
yet wanted he not thoſe, that did extoll him for very Godly,
wiſe, prudent, and a man of Counſell. Woe vnto you that
call euill good, and good euill. When <hi>Iulius</hi> had Poped 10.

that miſerable young man committed ſo great abhomination.
It was alſo by the ſame Parliament of Paris (which is the Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
royall of France) commanded; that the Prieſts and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

it was commaunded to all the kings ſubiects, that none of

which were out of the kingdome, to be in them inſtructed, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame paine <hi>Laeſae Maieſtratis.</hi> All that which I haue ſaid
be the ſelfe words of the Sentence. Thus then were the Ieſuits,
for their treaſons and villanies out of all France baniſhed. But
they, as vnquiet ſpirits, and friends to blodſhed, haue not
ceaſed to effect their buſines, And ſo haue printed a booke,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19632:87"/>
wherein wickedly they ſpeake againſt the king, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that gaue ſuch Sentence. They iuſtifie, ſanctifie, and
Canonize the foreſaid traitor <hi>Iohn Caſtell,</hi> incite the people,
and euery one of them, either by force or treaſon to kill their
Princes and Lordes, if in and by all things they agree not with
that which the Ieſuites teach. This their ſhameleſſe boldneſſe,
cauſed the moſt prudent Parliament in the 1598. yeare, eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones
to confirme the Sentence which it had formerly giuen
againſt the ſaid Ieſuites. <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> king of Portugale, for
liſtening to theſe Ieſuites, and being gouerned by them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
himſelfe and his kingdome. They perſwaded his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Barbarie, where he valiantly fighting, with the whole
Niobilitie of Portugale, was deſtroyed, Theſe Ieſuites are the
cauſe of the vprores in the kingdome of Swethland. They of
the kingdome being proteſtants, would not that the king (at
his returne from Polonia) ſhould place Ieſuites about him. The
king, who was gouerned by the Ieſuites, would place them.
So that of neceſſitie it came to blowes. Then let other princes
and Lordes beware of ſtrange directions, and in no wiſe ſuffer
the Ieſuites in their lands: becauſe they nought ſerue for, but
ſpies, and diſturbers of the peace publique, ſetting Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Princes. And that which worſe is, all this which they do,
they ſanctifie with the title, pretext and collour of religion.
Much puffed vp they are with the title which they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the fellowſhip of Ieſus: as though the reſt of the Prieſts
and Fryars, and all other Chriſtians were of the fellowſhip of
the deuill. Many of their owne Papiſts, doe now begin to ſmell
and vnderſtand. And ſo the Franciſcans, Dominicans, &amp; others
eate no good crommes (as they ſay) with them. I wil here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this matter of the Ieſuites, with a terrible lie: which to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce

proceede with their lie: The <hi>Lantgraue</hi> of Heſſen (ſaid they)

They ſaid alſo; that their Ieſuites had gone to diſpute with the
miniſters of the elector of Brandenberg: and that they had ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

the moſt learned <hi>Beza:</hi> the other miniſters of Geneua did brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

what hope is to be had of the Councelles, where the Pope

Venice, his religious conſort demaunded whither he went.
Whether I goe, anſwered he, can ye not come: giuing them
to vnderſtand, that he went to Rome, to be Pope, if he might.
He gaue it out before he was Pope, that he nought elſe deſired,

Church among them, that it is not now the Chuch of Chriſt,
but of the diuels. The Popes (ſaith he) hauing itching eares,
haue heaped vp Maiſters, which entertaine them in their
luſtes and concupiſcence. That through the Cardinals, and

nothing but Symony is ſeene in the Church: That the
Prelates bee verie ambitious, and couetous: That in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19632:91"/>

is full of whores. Theſe thinges and other ſuch, doth this booke

which is taught in Rome: nor yet of the tyranny of
fire &amp; bloud, wherewith ſuch are handled, as indeauor to ſerue
God in ſpirit and truth doth it ſpeake. But when he was Pope,
how did he amend it? As did <hi>Benedict 13. Pius 2. Pius</hi> 4. his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
and others (who before they were Popes, much ſpake
of the dutie of the Pope; but being Popes, did the like, or
worſe then the reſt) euen ſo did he. For the cauſe of Religion,
certaine <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friars, many Biſhops, and a great nomber of
the faithful, he impriſoned, tormented, and did them in the end,
what euill he could: Not for that they were adulterers, nor
Inceſtuous perſons, Simoniſts, nor blaſphemers: was all this:
but for the Chriſtian religion, which they profeſſed. Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then caſt aſide: he was occupied in the warres, againſt
<hi>Don Phillip</hi> our king, and the Spaniſh blood. Deny him then
(O Spaine) for father, who from the ſonne taketh the cloake.
The which this <hi>Paul</hi> from the king <hi>Don Phillip,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> 7.
from <hi>Don Charles</hi> the Emperour indeauoured to take; as in the
life of <hi>Clement</hi> 7. we haue before declared. This <hi>Paul</hi> being a
Neapolytan, and ſo vaſſall to the king, was to him a traitor, &amp;
teacher: taking part with <hi>Frauncis</hi> his kinges enemy. His great
ſeruant <hi>Panuinus</hi> ſaith: that ayded by the French &amp; Swizzars, he
raiſed great warres againſt king <hi>Phillip:</hi> and renewed the old
hatred. For the Spaniſh name, had he long before deteſted,
that (as ſaith <hi>Panuinus)</hi> for publique and particular Iniuries, and
ſo the Neapolitanes he well hoped, would haue riſen againſt
their king. When he was Cardinall, he perſwaded <hi>Paule</hi> 3. to
warre againſt the Imperials in the kingdome of Naples: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
him his ſeruice, and the ayd of many Neapolitans: of
whom he had many friends (ſaid he) within that kingdome:
But <hi>Paul</hi> 3. was more wiſe, and refuſed his Councel. Then Duke
<hi>Dalua</hi> vnderſtanding that this Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 4. conſpired againſt
the king to take Naples: with a great camp, came vpon Rome
and ſent a letter to the Pope, wherein he ſhewed all, that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens

vehemently exhorted him to peace, warning him, that if hee
ſaid not, and that quickly, what he would doe touching warre,

To the Colledge of Cardinals, he wrote alſo to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
and after fifteene dayes, when the Duke perceiued that
the Pope prolonged the time, he entred vpon the Church lands
and very many of them tooke, which he kept (ſaid he) for the

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aler,</hi> many that heard and conferred with him,
had knowledge of the true religion: &amp; chiefly that famous and

               <note place="margin">D. Edigius.</note> Cannon &amp; preacher in the great Church
of Seuill, that ſo much good did in Seuill, both with his good

good life and Doctrine. I haue long dwelled vpon diſcourſe of
this Hiſtorie of <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aler</hi> was the
firſt, that openly, and with great conſtance, diſcouered the
darkeneſſe in our time in Seuill. After this perſecution of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo
de Valer,</hi> many others were perſecuted, ſome of whom
eſcaped: as Doctor <hi>Iohn Perez,</hi> who came to Geneua: where
he imprinted the new Teament, &amp; other bookes in the Spaniſh
tongue, others aboade there ſtil, of whom many perſeuered.
And others of the Inquicitions conceiued ſuch feare, that they
denyed the truth: and which is worſe, were perſecutors therof
as was doctor <hi>Herman Rodriguez,</hi> &amp; maiſter <hi>Garci Arias,</hi> whom
commonly they called maiſter <hi>White.</hi> But God ſhewed mercy
vpon <hi>White,</hi> and of a woulfe, made him a lamb, &amp; ſo was he with
great conſtancie burned. This <hi>White,</hi> when God had made him
truly <hi>White,</hi> ſaid freely vnto the Inquiſitors, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they examined
him in the audience, that they were fitter to follow a droue of
aſſes, then to ſit and Iudge matters of faith, which they nothing
vnderſtood.<note place="margin">Anno 1555.</note> In the 1555. yeare, ſeuen perſons, men and
women went out of Seuill, and came to Geneua, where they
made their aboad.<note place="margin">Anno 1557.</note> In the 1557. yeare happened maruelous
things in Seuill, &amp; worthy of perpetuall memorie: namely, that
in a monaſterie called S. <hi>Iſidor,</hi> the moſt famous and rich in all
Seuil, the buſines of true religion went ſo, &amp; ſo plainely forward:
that vnable with good conſcience, there to ſtay longer, 12 of
the Friars in ſhort time departed, ſome one way, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
al which within a yeare came to Geneua; whither at their
departure, they determined to goe. None of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was that
paſſed not great dangers &amp; perils: but from all theſe perils God
did free them, &amp; with a mighty hand brought them to Geneua.
Theeſ, that abode in the monaſterie (for it is to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
al thoſe of the monaſterie, albeit they went in woulues
habits, had knowledge of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion) ſuffered great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution:
taken they were, tormented, diſgraced, very hardly &amp;
cruelly intreated, and in the end many of them burned: and in
many yeares almoſt was there no act of Inquiſition in Seuill, in
which there went not more or leſſe, out of this monaſterie: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe that went out, and came to Geneua, was the <hi>Prior,</hi>
vicar &amp; procurator of S. <hi>Iſidor,</hi> &amp; with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Prior</hi> of the Vale
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19632:94"/>
of <hi>Ecija,</hi> of the ſame order. And God with his mightie arme, did
not only deliuer theſe 12 from the cruel grype eſ the Inquiſitors
before the great perſecution began in Seuill: but afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the time of the great perſecution, deliuered other 6 or 7
from the ſame monaſterie, making fooliſh; and of no worth nor
effect, all the ſtratagems, Councels, ſubtelties, craftes, &amp; deceits
of the Inquiſitors, that ſought, but could not find them: for who
ſhall deſtroy, whom God wil preſerue? In the ſame yeare of the
Lord: 1557. another memorable thing hapned alſo in the ſame
citie of Seuill. And this it was, that one called <hi>Iulian Hernandez</hi>
(whom the French, by reaſon of his ſmall ſtature, called <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
le petit)</hi> with the great deſire, and zeale that he had to doe
ſome ſeruice to God, and his countrie, drewe out of Geneua
two great drifattes, full of Spaniſh bookes, of thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we haue ſaid Doctour <hi>Iohn Peres</hi> to haue printed in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua;
Which bookes, and moreouer all thoſe that taught
true Doctrine and Godlineſſe, had the Inquiſitors forbidden:
becauſe the ignorance, and darkenes of Antichriſt, loueth not
the wiſedome, and brightneſſe of the Goſpell of Chriſt: for
feare that their workes ſhould be conuinced and reproued.
<hi>Iulian</hi> by Gods great miracle, carried all theſe bookes, and
put,<note place="margin">Iulian brought many bookes to Seuill.</note> and diſperſed them in Seuill. Yet ſo ſecretly could he not
doe it, but (by meanes of a fearefull man, an hypocrite,
which ſould himſelfe for a brother, and was in deede a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>das)</hi>
it came in the end to the Inquiſitors eares: and ſo
they tooke <hi>Iulian,</hi> and many others more. So great was
the takeing, that they filled the priſons, and ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
houſes alſo.<note place="margin">800. priſoners for the teligion in Seuill.</note> There was eight hundred then taken for
the Religion in Seuill: a thing which aſtoniſhed the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
themſelues. Among theſe priſoners, and them alſo,
which were afterwardes taken, were found many men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in life and doctrine. As were Doctor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> maiſter

There were alſo people both men &amp; women, rich &amp; of qualitie;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19632:95"/>
among whom, was that truely illuſtrious, in pietie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<hi>Don Iohn Ponce de Lyons,</hi> brother to the Countie of Baylen,
and eldeſt ſonne of the Duke of Arcos: and Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> wife
of the Lord <hi>de la Higura;</hi> to whom (newly deliuered of childe)
the Inquiſitors gaue the torment called <hi>del Borro,</hi> in the Caſtle
of Triana: and ſuch was the torment, that thereof ſhe dyed. For
the cordes pearced the very bones and marrow pipes of the
armes, of the muſcles, and of the legges. And ſo tormented,
they caried her to her priſon as dead, caſting out of her mouth
bloud in great aboundance; by reaſon that her intralles were
broken in her bodie. Eight dayes after this cruel torment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
company, or any aſſiſtance (ſaue onely a young maide,
which a few dayes before was likewiſe tormented) in the end
ſhe died. Oh Inquiſitors, more cruell then wilde beaſtes, how
long ſhall the Lord ſuffer your tyrannies and cruelties. O yee
Spaniardes, that ſo much loue your wiues; and ſo zealouſly,
keepe them: how long will ye ſuffer that theſe curſed Elders of
<hi>Suſanna,</hi> ſhould ſee your wiues and daughters in their ſmocks,
yea in a manner naked, taking pleaſure to behold them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fter
giuing them torments, hauing ſometimes formerly made
loue vnto them, ô that all that were knowne, which in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
paſſeth. A certaine Inquiſitor there was, which in
merriment and ieſt, ſaid of his companion; that he contented
not himſelfe to beate a cutle, but alſo to eate it. This ſaid hee,
becauſe the Inquiſitor, had whipped a faire young maid, that
was taken for a Iewe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lay with her, &amp; burned her afterwards.
By this ſubtillty may the reſt be vnderſtood, which the Lords
Inquiſitors vſe with the women, which they hold priſoners. Of
this great number of priſoners, where many burned by twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ties,
or fewe leſſe, it chaunced that they burned them. The reſt were
vnhappily handled.<note place="margin">The like was done of the houſe of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Cacalla in Vallodalid.</note> The houſe of <hi>Iſabella de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aena,</hi> where the

This ſo great a lie, they inuented, that the vulgar ſort, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

command them to know and beleeue, ſhould abhorre the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the preachers thereof, ſith being deſperate like <hi>Iudas</hi>
they killed themſelues. This D. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was one of the moſt
learned, and eloquent men, that of long time our country of
Spaine yeelded: confeſſor, &amp; preacher he was, to <hi>Don Charles</hi>
the Emperor &amp; K. of Spaine; &amp; thereby might (if he had would)

died, and by the ſame was afterwards burned. About this ſame

were the Chriſtians in old time ſlaundered, of the very ſame
thinges are we now falſely ſlaundered. About the ſixty fiue
yeare <hi>Nero</hi> cauſed Rome to be fired: which burned nine
dayes: and the tyrant gaue it out, that the Chriſtians had done
it. About the 170. yeare, the Gentiles forced with tormentes
the ſeruants of the Chriſtians, to ſay of their maiſters, many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations:
and among others, that they eate their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>Celſus</hi> the Gentile <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> accuſed the Chriſtians for
diſloyall, and traytors: and ſaid: that their religion they had
taken from the Barbarians and Iewes. <hi>Origen</hi> defended the
Chriſtians, with 8 bookes which he wrote againſt this <hi>Celſus.</hi>

Read the bookes intituled of the citie of God, where Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote againſt this ſlaunder in defence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
In the time of the glorious martyr Saint <hi>Ciprian,</hi> who
many yeares liued before S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> there was a Proconſull
in Africa, called <hi>Demetrianus</hi> a great enemy of the Chriſtians:
he, and others ſuch like with him, ſaid: that all the wars, famine
and peſtilence, wherewith the world was then afflicted ought
to be imputed to the Chriſtians; becauſe they did not worſhip
the Gods. Againſt this <hi>Demetrianus,</hi> wrote S. <hi>Cipria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſaying, that
not the Chriſtians, but the Gentiles were the cauſe of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities:
becauſe vnwilling to worſhip the true God, they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
falſe Gods, and afflicted the Chriſtians with ſo great, and
ſo vniuſt perſecutions: not that they ſhould confeſſe God, but
that they ſhould denie him. The weakeneſſe of their Gods he
ſhewed them, ſeeing they could not defend themſelues, &amp;c. Al
this in our time fully paſſeth: For the ſelfe ſame cauſes are we at
this day ſlaundered, and vniuſtly, to the moſt cruell and ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
kind of death condemned: The ſame ſtate of the Church
is now, as it was in the time of Saint <hi>Ciprian,</hi> and of the other

Saintes by vs named: And as they were defended againſt
the Gentiles. So we, againſt the Antichriſtians doe now, make
our defence. We tell them, that God ſendeth in our dayes, ſo
many calamities of wars, famine, and peſtilence, becauſe they
haue profaned the diuine worſhip,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</note> and in the place of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
they honour the creatures: They worſhip not God (as he
hath commaunded) in ſpirit and truth, but after the doctrines
and commaundements of men, and God alone doe they not
worſhip: but alſo the Saints, their Images and pictures. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
not, will they tell me, the Images, but that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
albeit their ſecond Nicen Councell (not the firſt which
is holy and good) commaundeth Images with the ſame ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

it ruined aboue 400. of the moſt principal &amp; rich houſes of that

that it was taken for a thing myraculous: For the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
houſes, and neere adioyning to thoſe that burned, were
not onely burned: but the fire in a moment did leape from one
ſtreete to another farre of diſtant, and beginning at the top of
the houſe, brought the whole preſently with it, to the earth. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
marchandizes, much wheat, wine, and other thinges, which
by reaſon of the great furie and fierceneſſe of the fire could
not be put in ſafe keepeing were loſt. The whole Citie
was greatly troubled: becauſe none could know, how, or by
whom the fire was kindled. And all feared, that it was ſome

his ſermon, when a voyce of one that cried in the ſtreete Fire,
fire, was ſuddenly heard in the Church. The cauſe of the crie
was, for that one comming along the ſtreete, eſpied a chimnie
on fire, and after the Engliſh vſe in ſuch caſes, he cried through
the ſtrete Fire fire. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they within the Church, &amp; nere to the

with the great feare he conceiued, and marueyling what
it might be, began to lift vp his eyes, and behold on all ſides the
roofe and walles of the Church. His auditorie ſeeing him looke
vp, began with a loud voyce to crie, Fire, fire: ſome demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               </gap> Hardly had the other anſwered:
In the Church:<note place="margin">Imaginary fire in the Church.</note> when all in a moment began to crie out, The
Church burneth, the heretiques haue ſet the Church on fire.
And albeit no man ſawe any fire, all notwithſtanding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cryed Fire, fire, and each one ſuppoſed that was truth
which he heard. Then feared they indeede: ſuch was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and tumult in the Church, that cannot with wordes
be expreſſed: ſuch as haue found themſelues in the like caſes,
haue experience thereof. This ſtrong Imagination of fire
poſſeſſing their heades; all whatſoeuer they ſaw or heard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and increaſed in them the imagination conceiued. The
principall cauſe that augmented this ſuſpition, was to ſee him
with his faggot, whom they held for an heretique. This made
them beleue, that al the other heretiques had ioyntly conſpired
with him, to ſet fire on the Church. The great duſt which with
the vnquietnes, concourſe, &amp; tumult of the people was raiſed in
the Church, did augment in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo this ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This duſt then
ſeemed to be ſmoke of the fire which they had imagined. This
concourſe was alſo the cauſe that many came to their deathes:
for the ſmall ribs &amp; bones were broken, whereof many died.
The people flocked to the doores of the Church: but ſo great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was the throng &amp; preſſe; that none could go out of the Church
In the end ſeeing no remedie, they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to crie out againſt the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie of the heretikes, which had kindled the fire, to burne
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue. It was a world to ſee thoſe great rabbines, thoſe great
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19632:98"/>
doctors, with their long ſcarlet robes &amp; doctorall habits, runne
from one ſide to another, blowing, panting, and ſweating, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſome corners where to hide themſelues. In all this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany
was there none more quiet, then the poore penitent heretique
who, throwing from him the faggot, it fell vpon the head of a
Friar that was next him, &amp; ſo abode quiet, expecting what God
would doe with him. Among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al was there none more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
nor more cried out for feare; then <hi>Smith</hi> the preacher; who
with the firſt began to crie from the pulpit, ſaying. Theſe be the
webs &amp; crafts of the heretiques againſt me: Lord haue mercie

he called Lord, &amp; was hanged as we haue ſaid neere vnto him,
could not quiet him. Nought in this garboile more cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to feare, then when the lead was to begin to melt (for ye muſt
know, that many Churches in England are couered with lead)
&amp; many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began now to affirme, that the molten lead fell
vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then were they amaſed, &amp; many of them that had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, ſeeing that neither by force, regard of their
learning, nor authoritie they could ought preuaile, they cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged
their purpoſe &amp; began to vſe very gentle words; promiſing to
them they would pull them from that daunger (albeit by the
eares) a good reward. There was a man that gaue 20 pound
(euery pound is forty Spaniſh ryals) an other promiſed his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; others, other like thinges. They that might, placed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in the hollownes betweene pillar &amp; pillar, that the lead,
which they ſaid was molte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould not fal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A maiſter of
the Colledge ther was, which vnnailed a table, &amp; couered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
his head &amp; ſhoulders, that the lead ſhould worke him no
anoyance. There was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, albeit very groſſe, who ſeeing there
was no meanes to goe out of the Church, needs would be brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the glaſſe, to go out by the pane of a window, but half of
his body being forth, he ſtuck faſt in the grate; ſo that he was
not maiſter of himſelfe, nor could he go forward nor backward.
The poore paunched monke ſaw his danger doubled: for if the
fire, or moulten lead ſhould fal without, that part then that was
without the window, would be in danger, &amp; if it fell within the
Church, the part then within was in the ſame danger.</p>
            <p>To another monke, another chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hapned. And this it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A

certaine boy (ſeeing that by reaſon of the great preſſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of people, he could not goe forth clymed as he could,
vpon their ſhoulders and heades; and ſo came and placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
on the top of the Church dore, where he aboade, not able
to paſſe further: Thus reſting vpon the height of the dore, he
eſpied by chaunce (among thoſe that came crawling vpon the
heades of others) a monke comming towards him, who bare
at his backe, a great and large cowle: the boy ſeing good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
offered,<note place="margin">A boy put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the cowle of a Monke.</note> let it not ſlip: and ſo when the monke was neare
vnto him, he let fall himſelfe from the height of the dore, and
very wittily put himſelfe into the monkes cowle; ſuppoſing if
the monke eſcaped, that he alſo with him (as it hapned) ſhould
goe out of the Church. In concluſion the monke crawling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heades of others, at laſt eſcaped, carrying the boy at his
backe that was placed in the cowle, &amp; for ſome time perceiued
not any weight or burthen vpon him. In the end, within a while
the monke came ſomewhat to himſelfe; felt his cowle more
weightie, then wontedly it was, and hearing the voyce of one
that ſpake in his cowle, then began he afreſh to feare, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
before, when he was thronged among the people, ſuppoſing
(&amp; that verely) that the euill ſpirit, which had fired the Church,
was placed in his cowle: &amp; then preſently began he to coniure
the ſpirit, ſaying: In the name of God, and of all the Saintes I
commaund thee, to tell me whom thou arte, that hanges at my
backe? To whom the boy anſwered: I am <hi>Beltrams</hi> boy (for
ſo was his maiſter called) But I coniure thee (ſaid the monke)
in the name of the indiuiſible Trintie, that thou wicked ſpirit
tell me, who thou art; whence thou comeſt, and that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
hence. To whom the youth anſwered, I am <hi>Beltrams</hi> boy:
I beſeech you ſir let let me goe: and ſo ſpeaking, aſſayed to
goe out of the cowle, which, with the weight, and the boyes
endeuour to goe out, began to rend vpon the ſhoulders of
the monke. When the monke well vnderſtood the matter, he
drew the boy out of the cowle. The boy ſeeing himſelfe out of
daunger; tooke him to his heeles, and ranne with what ſpeede
he could. In the meane time whiles this paſſed, they that were
with out the Church, beholding on all ſides, and ſeeing there
was no cauſe of feare, marueyled to ſee them in ſuch a ſtraight,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19632:99"/>
and made ſignes &amp; ſhowes, to them in the Church, to be quiet,
and told them abroad, there was no cauſe of feare. But for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they that were in the Church, could not for the great
noyſe, and ruſhing within, heare that which was told them; the
ſignes which they made, they interprete to the worſt ſence,
as though all without the Church had with liuely flames bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and that for the diſtilling downe of the molten lead, and
for that it fell in many places, they ſhould abide within the
Church; and not aduenture to goe forth. So that ſignes, and
voyces much increaſed the feare. For the ſpace of ſome howers
indured this confuſion. The day following, and that whole
weeke alſo, were many billets fixed one the Church dore: one
ſaid. If any haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a payer of ſhooes, lately loſt in the Church
of Saint <hi>Mary:</hi> another ſaid, if any haue found a garment: In
another it was prayed that a hat ſhould be reſtored: In another,
a girdle, with a purſe, and mony which was loſt: In another was
demanded a little ring, &amp; other ſuch like thinges: for there was
no one perſon almoſt in the Church, which had not loſt or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
ſome thing. As touching the poore penitent, him they
commaunded, that for aſmuch as he had not by reaſon of this
tumult, done his pennance as was meete, he ſhould doe it
the day following, in the Church of Saint <hi>Frideſwid,</hi> and ſo he
did it. Theſe Hiſtories of the fire of Rome, of the fire of Vallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalid,
and the imaginarie fire of Oxford doe very wel confirme
that which wee haue ſaid: that the poore Chiſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue at all
times bene ſlaundered, and vniuſtly condemned. Therefore
are they called ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, who is
Iuſt, will not leaue without puniſhment, ſuch monſtrous lies,
ſuch falſe teſtimonies, and ſuch fierce cruelties: his day (albeit
he ſlacke) will come vpon the Inquiſitors. For the bloud of the
Iuſt, holy, faithfull, and catholique Chriſtians, by them ſhed,
cryeth vnto God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 10.</note> as did the bloud of <hi>Abell,</hi> ſaying. How long

that they ſhould reſt yet a while, vntill their fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes

God one day ſhew mercie to Seuil, that this monaſterie of Saint
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19632:100"/>
               <hi>Iſodor,</hi> be conuerted to an vniuerſitie, where diuinitie may be
chiefly profeſſed. The rents of this monaſterie, which be great,
ſuffiſe, with ouer plus to maintaine the ſaid vniuerſitie: and the
ruyned houſe of <hi>Iſabella de Vaena,</hi> may be conuerted to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church, where the word of God may be preached, and
the Sacraments without adding or diminiſhing, according to
the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, adminiſtred. So great and greater
things then theſe, hath the Lord in our time brought to paſſe. It
ſhall not be from our purpoſe to recite that which D. <hi>Illeſcas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
to haue happened in Spaine in the time of this <hi>Paule</hi> 4.
touching the great nomber of Spaniards, of the religion (which
he calleth <hi>Lutheranes)</hi> that was diſcouered. His words be theſe:
In the former yeares were <hi>Lutheran</hi> heretiques accuſtomed to
be taken &amp; burned whatſoeuer, in Spaine: but al thoſe that they
puniſhed, were ſtraungers, as Dutchmen, Fleminges, or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,
&amp;c. And of thoſe which came from theſe kingdomes.
And a little lower: vile people and of moſt wicked race a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
times did wontedly goe out to the Scaffoldes, and to
weare the Sarbenitos in the Churches: but in theſe latter
yeares, haue we ſeene the priſons, ſcaffolds, and fires alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with famous people. And (which is more to be moaned)
of illuſtrious perſons alſo and of ſuch, as to the eie of the world,
in learning and life were farre before others, &amp;c. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lower: The buſineſſe came to termes, that they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
now among themſelues, a moſt fearefull conſpiracie,
ſuch, as had it not happened ſo ſoone to be diſcouered (as it
was afterwardes vnderſtood) al Spaine had run in great hazard
to be loſt, &amp;c. And a lttle lower: In Valladolid D. <hi>Caçalla,</hi> his
fiue brothers and mother, with moſt great ſecrecie, &amp; ſingular
diligence, were taken. In Toro was taken <hi>Herrezuelus,</hi> &amp; many
other in Cemora, &amp; in Pedroſa, many men &amp; women, Nunnes,
maried women, and damſels, famous and of great qualitie, &amp;c.
Among thoſe that were burned, were alſo certaine Nunnes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
young, and beautifull: who not contented to be <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
were teachers of that curſed doctrin, &amp;c. And alittle after. Al the
priſoners were of Valladolid, Seuill, and Toledo, perſons ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
qualified, &amp;c. And ſo many &amp; ſuch they were, that it was
thought if they had two or three moneths more ſlacked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19632:100"/>
this miſchiefe: all Spaine would haue burned, and we
ſhould haue come to the moſt bitter miſchaunce that euer was
ſeene therein. Hitherto D. <hi>Illeſcas.</hi> Whereof we will conclude,
that God hath reuealed the light of his Goſpel in Spaine to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
people, and people of renowne, famous &amp; noble. He will
ſhew like mercy when he pleaſeth, to the vulgar and common
ſort. When they ſee in Spaine a man well lettered and learned
then ſay they, <hi>Que es tan docto, que eſtà en peligro de ſer Luthrano</hi>
he is ſo learned, that he is in danger to become a <hi>Lutheran:</hi> And
there is not almoſt any noble houſe in Spaine, that hath not
had in it ſome one or more of the reformed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His maieſtie
for his Chriſts ſake our redeemer increaſe the nomber, for his
glory, &amp; the confuſion of Antichriſt. But returning to <hi>Paul</hi> 4. In
Auguſt, and the 1559. yeare, after he had poped 4 yeres, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
three moneths,<note place="margin">Anno 1559.</note> he died. The ſeat was voyd 4 moneths, &amp; 7
dayes, <hi>Don Phillip</hi> 2. being king of Spaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pius</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Pius 4.</note> a Millaniſt was not much liked nor loued of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
<hi>Paul</hi> 4. which <hi>Paul</hi> in the conſiſtorie, did publiſh, &amp;

diſlike of <hi>Paule</hi> 4. againſt him, departed from Rome: &amp; thence
was abſent all the time that <hi>Paule</hi> the fourth Poped. But when
<hi>Paule</hi> was dead, and he choſen after great diſcord, and foure
moneths &amp; 7 dayes: that the ſea was vacant, he reuenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of him.<note place="margin">Pope againſt Pope.</note> For many things which <hi>Paul</hi> had commanded, did
<hi>Pius</hi> countermaund: &amp; ſo pronouncing <hi>Don Charles</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
&amp; <hi>Don Phillip</hi> his ſon, kings of Spaine innocent and fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
he abſouled them of all whatſoeuer <hi>Paule</hi> 4. had obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

made by <hi>Don Charles,</hi> to <hi>Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do</hi> his brother, which <hi>Paul</hi>
whiles he liued, neither would approue, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme. To maſter
<hi>Antonius Columna,</hi> he reſtored his patrimony, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> had
depriued him:<note place="margin">So did Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. 3. Pius 2.</note> many otherlike thinges he did, in deſpite of his
predeceſſor <hi>Paul</hi> 4. by <hi>Panuinus</hi> vpon his life recited. The ſame
<hi>Panuinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Martine 5. and Paul 4.</note> of <hi>Pius</hi> 4. ſaith: that when he was Biſhop, he became
another man; entertaining other cuſtomes, &amp; maners (not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but worſe) For he which till then was holden curteous, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
a well doer, gentle, and not couetous, ſuddaynely
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19632:101"/>
ſeemed to haue changed his nature. Such is the ſeat papall, that
he which once ſitteth therein; albeit before he were not euill,
becometh euill. And if he were euill, becometh worſe, and in
the end moſt euill: as to this <hi>Pius</hi> 4. it happened. The ſame
<hi>Panuinus</hi> ſaith: that <hi>Pius</hi> had no grauitie, either in countenance
gate, or geſtures: that more ſcoffing he was, then beſeemed
the maieſtie which he repreſented: of him (ſaith he) that whiles
he liued without charge he was of good life &amp; reputation, and
whiles alſo he had charge, vnder the high biſhops his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
When he was Pope, great ſhewes he gaue of a good
Biſhop, inſomuch that he held the Councell of Trent (note the
hypocriſie) whiles the Councell continewed,<note place="margin">The hypocriſie of Pope Pius 4.</note> he fayned to be
good, but the Councell once ended, <hi>Pius</hi> vſing great libertie,
did many thinges that pleaſed not all men. And a little lower,
<hi>Pius</hi> was a glutton, and ſwillar: but chiefly in eating, for at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
he exceeded. Giuen he was to delights and pleaſure: he was
openly collerique, enuious he was, but in ſecret: impatient to
heare. In his anſweres ſometime hard and bitter, ambitious, to
commaund, crafty, a fayner and diſtembler. When he ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of him: Albeit true it is, that as a Paraſite of the Popes, much
good he ſaith of him alſo. But what vertues could poſſeſſe a

2. ſaith. That hauing firſt receiued the holy ſacraments, he died.
Of the other Popes I doe not remember that he ſaith any ſuch
thing. The reaſon is (as ſaith <hi>Sanazaro</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Leo</hi> 10.)
that the Popes being great Simoniſts, haue ſould the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſo not kept them for themſelues. Or to ſpeake bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19632:101"/>
the cauſe is, that the Popes hold and ſay in their harts there
is no God: and ſo in the time of ſicknes, and at poynt to die,
they make no eſteeme of the ſacraments,<note place="margin">The Popes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme not the Sacraments be caſe they be Antichriſts.</note> or Chriſtian religion,
but die like ſwine. This Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 4. ordeyned a confeſſion of
faith, which all they ſhould make, that were to be Biſhops: the
which in his life <hi>Panuinus</hi> placeth. This confeſſion is a ſummary
of all the ignorances, ſuperſticions, and Idolatries of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme

or wrong, to get money: and whereof he had ſtore: which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his kindred, friends, &amp; buyldings, Whereunto he was much

ſix yeares, he dyed (as in Rome went the common voyce
and fame) in the armes of his minion (which is not much out of
ſquare, ſith <hi>Panuinus</hi> his friend of him ſaith, that he was giuen to
delightes and pleaſures) and (as ſaith the ſame <hi>Panuinus)</hi> he

happened in Seuill,<note place="margin">Confeſſion was almoſt the cauſe of the ruine of the Popedome.</note> the which, had it proceeded further, &amp; the

the whole papaſie to the ground: elſe ſhould it at the leaſt haue
receiued ſome notable damage. The matter is this. In Seuill
where ſome more curious, then was mete for the papaſie: which
of the prieſts and Friars complained bitterly to the Inquiſitors,

obſcure, and none in particular but generally were accuſed;
they made an edict, &amp; publiſhed it throughout al the Churches
of the Archbiſhoprick of Seuil, commanding al &amp; euery perſon

of women, which from Seuill only went to accuſe their filthie

honeſt matrons, and many Ladies of qualitie, held great
warres within themſelues: The ſcruple of conſcience, on the
one ſide, to incurre the ſentence of excommunication impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Inquiſitors vppon ſuch as ſhould conceale it, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them to goe. And on the other ſide, they feared leſt their
husbandes holding them for ſuſpect, ſhould become iealous of
them. And ſo, neither durſt they, nor yet found oportunitie, to
goe and ſpeake with the Inquiſitors. But at laſt diſguiſed
and masked after the manner of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> as couert as they
could, they went to the Inquiſitors: yet how diſguiſed, and
ſecret ſoeuer they were, many husbands left not to follow
them, and watche them earely to knowe whither they
went: which was the cauſe of great iealouſie. On the other
ſide it was a ſport to ſee the prieſts and Friars fathers of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to goe ſad and ſorrowfull hanging downe their heades,
by reaſon of their guilty conſcience: euery hower and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
expecting, when the Familiar of the Inquiſition would
lay handes vpon them. Many of them ſuppoſed, that a great
perſecution was to come vppon them; yea and greater then
that which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> then ſuffered, yet was all their
feare but winde, and ſmoke which paſſeth away: For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
by experience foreſeeing the great damage that
would redound to all the Romane Church, if their eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
perſons ſhould be deſpiſed and pointed at: and the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of confeſſion ſhould not be ſo priſed nor eſteemed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
would no further proceed in the buſines; but interpoſing
their authoritie, huſhed all thinges, as though nothing had
euer happened. And ſo no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſor was chaſtiſed, no not thoſe,
whoſe villanies were ſufficiently proued: which thing freed
the eccleſiaſticall order from great anguiſh of mind, and all
their ſorrowe was turned into ioy. But his day will come
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19632:102"/>
vppon ſuch, and the Inquiſitors that ſmothered ſo great vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
and abhominations: Who pardoning their friendes,
and houſhold fathers of confeſſion: turned all their hate and
fury againſt their enemies the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> whom with fire
and bloud, they did not onely perſecute in Seuill and Valla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid:
but in many partes of Spaine alſo. And thus was Ieſus
Chriſt againe in his members condemned, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> let
looſe. About the 1550. yeare one <hi>Don Pedro de Cordoua</hi> prieſt
made confeſſion an Inſtrument to abuſe his deuout penitents.
About 1576 yeare for the like buſineſſe, were many Theati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,

the principall of whom was called Father <hi>Ternan daluares</hi> who

all theſe offices: Inquiſitor he was, Biſhop, Cardinall and
Pope. His name at the font was <hi>Anthony:</hi> becauſe he was borne
on S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> day: when he was fifteene yeares old, he placed

would then neither be called <hi>Anthony,</hi> which was his Chriſtian

a little bubble it was, which when is rayneth, is made vpon the

England, was caught; and as a traitor ſentenced to death: and

And ſeing he could not conuince them; he cauſed Prieſts and

much inclined to theſe Friars, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded he ſhould come in. The
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19632:106"/>
Friar being entered, kneeled on his knees befor the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
king, who was ſitting the better to heare him, ſomewhat dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his body: The curſed <hi>Sinon</hi> then drawing a poyſoned knife,
which he had brought for that purpoſe, thruſt it into the bowels
of the king. The king feeling himſelfe wounded, cried out: to
the crie ranne many, who ſtabbed and killed this vnmercifull
<hi>Clement,</hi> albeit the king commaunded they ſhould not kil him.
This wound of the king, cauſed ſadnes and ſorrow in the kings
campe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrariwiſe, great mirth amongſt the enemies: who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
demanded aloud, if the Friars knife were ſharp enough.
The king (after he had appointed the king of Nauarre his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law, called <hi>Henry</hi> 4. who was the neereſt in bloud, for
his ſucceſſor) the night following died. When newes of the
kings death came to Rome, Pope <hi>Siſtus</hi> 5. made a ſolemne Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the conciſtorie of Cardinals, the 11. of September 1589.
where he not only compared the treaſon of this curſed Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,
with the act of <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudith 13. 10.</note> and of <hi>Iudith:</hi> but ſaid alſo it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
them. (Of <hi>Eleazar</hi> is made mention 1. <hi>Macha</hi> 6.) who
ſeing an Elephant more mighty then the reſt, armed with the
armes of the king ſuppoſing that king <hi>Antiochus</hi> was vpon him,
to deliuer his people, and purchace eternall glorie, he aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
himſelf, &amp; ran couragiouſly to the Eelepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, through the
middeſt of the ſquadron, killing on the right hand, and on the
left, and all ſides throwing downe, vntill he came vnder the
Elephant, and placing himſelfe vnder him, ſlew him: the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
fell to the ground vppon him, and there he dyed. <hi>Iudith</hi>
cutte of the head of <hi>Holophernes.</hi> The warre that <hi>Antiochus</hi>
and <hi>Holophernes</hi> made againſt the people of God was vniuſt:
but the warre which <hi>Henry</hi> the third made againſt the league,
which had conſpired againſt him, to kill him, and take from
him his kingdome; was moſt iuſt: So that herein was hee
no tyrant. Beſides this, both liuing and dying, hee was of
the ſame religion of the league: as at his end appeared. For
in that ſmall time that he liued, after he was wounded, hee
confeſſed, communicated, and was anoynted. But leauing
theſe humane reaſons, come we to the holy ſcripture. It
appeareth by the ſcripture, that <hi>Saule</hi> was a wicked king,
an hypocrite, a tyrant, forſaken of God: and ſo hath God
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19632:106"/>
to <hi>Samuel. How long doeſt thou morne for Saul, ſeeing I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
him, and that he ſhall not reigne ouer Iſraell?</hi> And comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

which was <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in the ſame chap. verſe 14. it is ſaid. <hi>The
ſpirit of the Lord, departed from Saul, and the euill ſpirit of the
Lord did torment him.</hi> Albeit ſuch a one was <hi>Saul,</hi> yet did not
God commaund <hi>Samuel</hi> or any other to kill him. And ſo <hi>Dauid</hi>
(although God had choſen him, and <hi>Samuell</hi> annointed him for
king) when manifeſt occaſion and meanes were twiſe offered
him, to kill <hi>Saul;</hi> yet killed he him not. Alſo when <hi>Dauid</hi> and
his followers were hid in a caue for feare of <hi>Saul</hi> (as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.)
appeareth <hi>Saul</hi> entred the ſame caue to doe his needs: then did
<hi>Dauids</hi> men aduiſe him not to let ſlippe occaſion, but to kill
<hi>Saule.</hi> But <hi>Dauid</hi> inſtructed in a better ſchoole then were
they, anſwered: <hi>The Lord keepe me from doeing ſuch a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my maiſter, and the annointed of the Lord, that I ſtretch not
out my hand againſt him: for he is the Lordes annointed:</hi> And not
only did not kil him, but grieued to haue cut of the lap of his gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
as if herein he had done ſome great diſgrace. And in the
26. chap. of the ſame booke, it is reported; that <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiſai</hi>
came by night to the camp of Saule, &amp; found him ſleeping, &amp;c.
Then <hi>Abiſai</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dauid, God hath cloſed thine enemy into thine
hands this day: now therfore I pray thee let me ſmite him once with
a ſpeare vnto the earth, and I will not ſmite him agayne.</hi> And Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
ſaid to <hi>Abiſai: Deſtroy him not: for who can lay his hand on
the Lords Annoynted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1</note> 
               <hi>and be guiltleſſe. Moreouer, Dauid ſaid:
As the Lord liueth, either the Lord ſhall ſimite him, or his day
ſhall come to dye; or he ſhall deſcend into battayle, and periſh. The
Lord keepe me from laying myne handes vpon the Lordes annoynted,
&amp;c.</hi> And when one brought newes of the death of <hi>Saule,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that hee had ſlaine him: what gaue <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto him for
his good tidings? He ſaid vnto him, <hi>How waſt thou not affraid
to put forth thy hand to deſtroy the Annointed of the Lord? Then
Dauid commanded one to kill him: who wounded him, and ſo he died.
And Dauid ſaid vnto him. Thy bloud be vpon thine owne head: for
thine owne mouth hath teſtified againſt thee, ſaying, I haue ſlaine the
Lords annointed. And Dauid mourned for Saule, &amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we will conclude, that wickedly did this Friar, and thoſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19632:107"/>
of his counſell, in murthering their king: and that wickedly did
the Pope, in praiſing and cannoniſing this fact. What reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had <hi>Siſtus</hi> 5. that God had wholly caſt off <hi>Henrie</hi> the third,
that he ſhould forbid any obſequies and honours, accuſtomed
to be made for the dead, ſhould be made for him, &amp; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alſo, that they ſhould not pray for him? <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi>
had moſt ſure reuelation that <hi>Saule</hi> was forſaken of God, and
that (as ſuch a one) was he fallen into a reprobate ſence: yet
notwithſtanding did they let him liue, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired not his death.
If a Prince in our time, be he heretike (as they call him) or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
ſhall not fully obey whatſoeuer the Pope commandeth
him, albeit it be to the depriuing him of his kingdome, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
it to another, then ſhall he be curſed and excommunicate
both in bodie and ſoule, and the moſt vile perſon (if we beleeue
<hi>Siſtus</hi> 5.) with good conſcience may kill him. And ſuch a one
that ſhall murther him, ſhall haue done an act very meritorious
and holy, for the which he deſerueth to be cannonized. What
Chriſtian religion is this, that one ſhall be cannonized for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
that which by the word of God (as by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples we alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
haue proued) is expreſly forbidden? Oh times! oh cuſtomes!
But vpon ſuch will his day come: theſe ſwine ſhall not eſcape
(as they ſay) without their Saint <hi>Martin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With <hi>Siſtus</hi> 5. conclude we ſaying, that in the moneth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,
and 1590. yeare he died, whom <hi>Vrban</hi> 7. which poped
12 dayes ſucceeded. At the end of the yeare 1590. <hi>Gregorie</hi> 14.
ſucceeded him, and died in September 1591. <hi>Innocent</hi> 9. ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Gregorie</hi> 14. who a ſmall time poped. So that in the
ſpace of 14. moneths, foure Popes died: <hi>Siſtus, Vrban, Gregorie,</hi>
and <hi>Innocent:</hi> and it is to be thought, the moſt, or all of them died
of poyſon. For <hi>Brazuto</hi> is not dead that giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poyſon. This
<hi>Brazuto</hi> killed 6 Popes with poiſon (as vpon the life of <hi>Damaſus</hi>
2. we haue declared.) In the 1592. yeare <hi>Innocent</hi> 9. being dead
<hi>Clement</hi> 8.<note place="margin">A Capuchan fryar practiſed to kill the French king.</note> or 9. or 10. ſucceeded. This <hi>Clement</hi> poping, in the
1599. yeare, a Friar Capuchan, incited by the Ieſuits, attempted
to kill the French king <hi>Henry</hi> 4. but his treaſon was diſcouered,
and ſo was he caught. In the time of this Pope, &amp; in September
1598. died the king <hi>Don Philip</hi> 2. aged 70 yeares: &amp; <hi>Don Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
3. ſonne of the forenamed <hi>Don Philip</hi> 2. and of the daughter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19632:107"/>
of <hi>Maximillian</hi> the Emperour, and of the Empreſſe <hi>Dona Maria
de Auſtria,</hi> ſiſter of the king <hi>Don Philip</hi> 2. ſucceeded him. God
grant him grace, as the dutie &amp; office of a king requireth, night
and day to meditate in the law of the Lord,<note place="margin">God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the king to read the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture.</note> &amp; accompliſh that

kingdome, he ſhall cauſe to be written the booke of this law, &amp;c. And
it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall reade therein all the dayes of his life.</hi>
Note ye Spaniards, that God commandeth the king to reade
the holy Scriptures: and then (ſaith he) he is to reade them, <hi>that
he may learne to feare the Lord his God, that he may keepe all the
words of this Law, and theſe ordinances to do them: That he lift not
vp his heart aboue his brethren, nor turne f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rm the commandement,
to the right hand nor to the left: that he may prolong his dayes in his
kingdome, he and his ſonnes, &amp;c.</hi> And God not onely comaundeth
the king to reade the holy ſcripture, but his captaines alſo,
when they be in warres, to reade the ſame. So comaunded he
<hi>Ioſua</hi> the Generall, and moſt warlike captaine of the people of
God, ſaying vnto him: The booke of this lawe, ſhall neuer
departe from thy mouth: but daie and night ſhalt thou
meditate therein: that thou maiſt obſerue and do according to
all thinges, that are written therein. For then ſhalt thou make
thy way proſperous. And then ſhalt thou vnderſtande. God of
his infinite goodnes, giue to our king and Lord, his captaines
and gouernors, the grace, to reade the ſcripture (which god
hath comaunded them, and the Pope hath forbidden) that
ruled thereby, they may well gouerne his ſubiects.</p>
            <p>Albeit, by that we haue ſaid it clerely appeareth the popes,
I meane from <hi>Boniface.</hi> 3. which was in the yeare. 605. vnto
<hi>Clement</hi> the 8. or 10. which nowe tirannizeth) to be of euill
life, and of worſe doctrine, by reaſon whereof, they neither
are, nor in any wiſe can be ſucceſſors of Peter, nor vicars of
Chriſt, but truly Antichriſts: yet, for better confirmation, with
reaſons, and notable ſayinges of the doctors of the Church;
with Decrees of Ancient Councels; &amp; cheifly, with 3. paſſages
of holy ſcripture admirable for this purpoſe, we will confirme it
not with ſtanding. But before we do this, we wil ſet downe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ancient Spaniſh prouerbs, declaring what are the liues of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19632:108"/>
theſe eccleſiaſticall perſons, and how we ought to flye them.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh toung, is not only eloquent, and copious,
but ſententious alſo. Many prouerbes it hath, by vs called
Refranes: which be certen breife ſayinges, ſentencious, and
true; ſo by common conſent, and that of long time allowed.
To ſuch prouerbes, in all tongues, aſwell learned as vnlearned
geue great credit: becauſe they be ſome cheife principles,
which the latines call <hi>Perſe nota.</hi> Contrary whereunto; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
will ſpeak, ſhalbe holden for vnlearned, and ignorant.
That the Spaniſh toung is plenteous in prouerbes &amp; briefe
ſentences, the booke called <hi>Celeſtina</hi> (the firſt part I ſay, for the
reſt is falſified) a booke doubtleſſe, did it intreat of ſome other
matter, worthy to be read, doth very euidently declare. The
book of Prouerbs, which <hi>Hernan Nunes,</hi> the Come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dador, moſt
excellent profeſſor of Rhetho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icke and Greeke in Salamanca
collected, doth ſhew alſo the ſame. Whoſe purpoſe was not
only to collect ſo infinite a number of Spaniſh prouerbes, but
alſo would (had not death preuented him) haue gloſed and
commented vpon them, as did <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vpon the Latine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes.
Verily had the Comendador effected his purpoſe, our
Spaniſh tongue ſhould haue had a great treaſure. But to what
end, wilt thou ſay vnto me, intreating of the Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
ſayeſt thou this? To great purpoſe (I anſwere) haue I ſayd
this:<note place="margin">Prouerbes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> becauſe here I will alleage many Spaniſh prouerbes, which
very briefly, and moſt truly do naturally, &amp; with liuely colours,
paint out the life of the prieſts, and Fryers, and of all the other
eccleſiaſtical perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the little Nouice that helpeth to ſay

            <p>Two Roman Empires haue bene (the firſt will we call the
old, and the ſecond the new) Of verie mean beginnings, began

            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:19632:111"/>
The firſt tooke beginning in two ſhepheards, <hi>Romulus</hi> and
<hi>Remus,</hi> his brother: who made a receptacle of euill doers
and offendors, and a gate (as it were) whereby they retyred
and eſcaped: of that multitude was a citie buylded which they
called <hi>Rome. Romulus,</hi> not brooking a competitor in the
Empire, ſlew <hi>Remus</hi> his brother. From this citie, did they
great violence and outrage to their neighbour nations; not
only robbing them of their goodes, but of their young maidens
alſo. This was the firſt occaſion of the warres: This warre
ended, others much more great, had they: wherein they ſo
much increaſed and inriched themſelues, that not contented
with Italy, they made warres alſo vpon forreigne nations, and
leauing their owne limits,<note place="margin">The beginning of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> they inuaded Affrike and Aſia. Thus
were they dayly increaſing, vntill another Prince and Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
vp in Rome, thruſting himſelfe into the ſame ſeat of the
Empire, and at the ſide (as it were) of the Roman Emperour.
This new Prince at the firſt made no ſhew, that he purpoſed
ought to diminiſh the authority of the Emperor: but only took
care of the affaires of the Church: wherein, whiles he was ſo
employed the ſtrength of the Emperour, &amp; Empire flouriſhed.
But afterwards, he began to thinke, how to benefite himſelfe
of that opinion of religion, and holineſſe which he held: and to
attaine hereunto, he doubted not to intreat the Emperour, that
by his authority he might hold the ſouereignty ouer all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
The cauſe that this new Prince alleaged was, that Rome
was alwayes the Lady of the whole world: and therefore was it
meet that the Biſhop of that city ſhuld go before other Biſhops
in degree &amp; dignity. To obtaine this was a thing moſt difficult:
For albeit that the Emperour let it ſlip: yet did the Biſhops of
other nations confidently gaineſay him: alleaging lawfull cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
why they withſtood him: vnwilling to acknowledge the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome, otherwiſe then for a brother, companion, and in
power equall with them. Notwithſtanding all this he of Rome
forſlowed not, but continually vrged to attaine to his purpoſe,
vntill he obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour (who murthered
<hi>Mauricius</hi> his good Lord and Emperour) that which he would:<note place="margin">Boniface 3.</note>
and ſo called himſelfe vniuerſall Biſhop, and what beſides he
beſt pleaſed. Here may ye ſee, that olde Rome was founded
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19632:111"/>
vpon one murder,<note place="margin">The Popedom founded vpon murder.</note> and the new, which is the Popedome vppon
another. In this concerning the primacie, was the Pope merely
opoſit to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Marke 13. 41.</note> who ſharpely in his diſciples reproued the like
ſtrife and ambition,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 25.</note> But the Pope mounted to this height by
the benefit of the Emperours, did nowe further dare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to himſelfe greater matters: yet long time proceeding
with great diſſimulation. A hundred yeares almoſt after the
death of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, was the Empire much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
it loſt Fraunce, England, and Almaine, The Hunnes held
Italie, the Vandals, Africke. Such was the diſſipation, that
the Emperours leauing Rome, which is in the Weſt, went
to Conſtantinople,<note place="margin">The Pope ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Images denyeth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Emperour.</note> where they made their abode. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome, ſeeing the ſcattering of the Empire, minded
not to let ſlippe occaſion: but armed a queſtion for his parte
againſt the Emperour: The chiefe cauſe was; that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
commaunded all ſtatues and Images to be taken out of
the Churches: So greatly did the Pope withſtand this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
that hee dared to excommunicate the Emperour: ſo
much nowe was the horne increaſed. At this time in the Eaſt,
aroſe vp <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who tooke many landes form the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The Emperours notwithſtanding, would haue it vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
that all the dignitie, power and Maieſtie, which the
Pope did hold, depended vppon them. The Pope then to bee
freed from this ſubiection, and the warres which the king
of Lumbardie made in italie, deuiſed a notable policie; and
this it was. To aduaunce of himſelfe another, whom he liked,
and to name him Emperour of the Romans. Who accknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the benefit,<note place="margin">Charles the great made Emperour and why.</note> ſhould deeme himſelfe happie, to pleaſe
and ſerue him in all that he would: And ſo <hi>Charles</hi> the great
he elected, and declared Emperour, who had chaſed out of
Italie, the king of Lumbardy, and enemie to the Pope. This
cauſed great anger, and ſtrife betweene the Eaſterne and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne
Emperours: and not betweene them onely, but the
Churches alſo of both the one and other partie: of all which,
the couetouſnes, and ambition of the Pope of Rome were the
cauſe. Much contention was there afterwards, among the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
French and Almaynes, about the election of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
But in the end, when <hi>Otho</hi> the third Duke of Saxoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was Emperour, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> 5. an Almayne Pope, order was
giuen, that ſeuen electors ſhould chooſe the Emperour, (as in
the life of this <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fift we haue declared) And this
was done, to exclude ſtraunge nations, that none but an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
ſhould be Emperour. Great garboyles aroſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
betweene the Pope and the Emperour, who could
no longer endure, the vnmeaſurable arrogancie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the Pope. Reade the Hiſtories of <hi>Henry</hi> the third and
fourth, and of <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt &amp; ſecond, and to come neerer

priſoner. This <hi>Clement</hi> (as ſang the Spaniardes at the Popes
windowe, whiles hee was priſoner) would haue taken away
the cloke from the Emperour, as vppon the life of this <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
we haue before declared. So alſo ſought <hi>Paule</hi> the fourth
to take away the cloake from our king <hi>Don Philip</hi> the ſecond.
The kingdome of Naples would he haue taken from him: but
the hoſt of the king, whoſe captaine was the Duke <hi>Dalua</hi>
put the Pope into ſuch a ſtraight, that he was contented to
make peace, and chiefly hearing of the taking of Saint <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
which was in the 1557. yeare (as vppon the life of this
<hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, before we haue ſaid. So proud is the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
that he hath made the forme of an oath, the which he

booke of the marqueſſe of Peſcara. Here may yee ſee, how
the world goeth contrary. The Pope of a ſubiect to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
hath made himſelfe his Lord. This which I haue
ſayd, touching the originall and growing vp of the Pope, in an
information, preſented to the princes, and ſtates of the Empire
in the time of <hi>Don Charles</hi> the Emperour, our king and Lord,
is handled more at large. Hence will we conclude, that the
authoritie, which the Pope boaſteth to hold, is neither by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
nor humane right, but diabolicall: with ſubtilty he thruſt
himſelfe into it, with ſtraunge force (as ſaith <hi>Daniell)</hi> he doth
and ſhall maineteine the ſame, vntill God deſtroy him
with the force and power of his word. By which ſaying it
appeareth, that the Popedome built (as it is) vppon hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſie,
craft,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 16.</note> auarice, ambition and tyranny, is not builded
vppon the firme rocke which is Ieſus Chriſt, whom Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed ſaying: Thou art the Chriſt, the ſonne of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19632:113"/>
liuing God. And if the Popedome be not founded vpon Chriſt,
much leſſe is the Pope the head, or vniuerſall Biſhop of the
Church of God, but of the deuill. And that he is not vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Biſhop, I will confirme it prouing with ſhort and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
reaſons, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> whoſe ſucceſſor they ſay the Pope
to be,<note place="margin">The 1. Reaſon. Clemens ad Iacobum.</note> was not vniuerſall Biſhop of the Church. The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> Biſhop of Rome, writing (as ſay our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries)
to Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> called him the brother of the Lord,
Biſhop of Biſhops, Gouernour of the Church of Ieruſalem,
and of all others through the whole world. If this be true, it
followeth,<note place="margin">The 2. Reaſon. Actes 15.</note> that ſo was not Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> albeit he were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome. 2. Alſo in the firſt Chriſtian Councell, whereof
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in his Hiſtorie maketh mention, not S. <hi>Peter</hi> as vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
Biſhop but S. <hi>Iames</hi> gouerned. Who heard each one, and
among them S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and when all had ſpoken, Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> as
Preſident, concluded, in the 19. verſe, ſaying: wherefore my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is &amp;c. Read the chapter, and you ſhall ſee that which I ſay
to be truth. Notwithſtanding all this D. <hi>Illeſcas</hi> the Popes para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
in his part 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 20. ſaith: That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> as chiefe Biſhop

Saint <hi>Luke)</hi> hearing that <hi>Samaria</hi> had receiued the doctrin
of the Goſpell; to teach and more fully inſtruct them; ſent <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
&amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> thither. But who ſhall now, ſend the Pope to preach?
Suerely the Counſell wil not be ſo bould: and though the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
ſo ſhould, yet would not the Pope do it, ſaying: he is Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
from God. The Apoſtles ſent <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
member of the. Church,<note place="margin">The 4. Reaſon. Gal. 2. 11.</note> obeyed, went and preached. 4.
Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> reproued Saint <hi>Peter</hi> becauſe (faith Saint <hi>Paule)</hi>
he ſo deſerued, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> liſtened thereto and allowed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.
That he was imediate from God, that he was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
Biſhop, and therefore greater then he, anſwered he not
neither did he anſwere, that none ought, nor could reproue
him, nor yet demaund account of him, why he did ſo, or ſo:
as the Popes nowe, and many yeares alſo, to kings, Emperours,
yea and generall Councels, haue anſwered. So ſhameleſſe are
ſome of our aduerſaries, that notwithſtanding Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
ſaith, that beeing come to Antioche, I withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> to
his face, &amp;c. And verſe 14. hee ſaith: whom when I ſaw that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19632:113"/>
they walked not rightly, according to the truth of the Goſpell,
I ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> before all, &amp;c. yet ſay they, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued

Antioch, &amp;c. <hi>Illeſcas</hi> beleeueth not that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth
of this equalltie: and therefore; as one doubting, ſaith: They
ſay, what credit ſhall we giue to ſuch a one, that doubteth of
that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth?<note place="margin">The 5. Reaſon. 1. Theſ. 2. 3.</note> That Antichriſt, whoſoeuer he

the citie ſituate vpon 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mountaines. This citie as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> and
many others declare, is Rome: Only the Pope ſitteth in the
Temple of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, in the citie of ſeauen mountaines, which is
Rome.<note place="margin">The 6. Reaſon.</note> Therefore onely the Pope is that Antichriſt. 6. Alſo,
in the firſt Councell of Nice aſſembled by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that
good Emperour, to confound and deſtroy the hereſie of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
(who with this blaſpheamous mouth tooke away the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of Ieſus Chriſt) the Legats of the Biſhop of Rome, not in
the 1. 2. nor 3. but in the 4. place did ſitte: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Biſhop of
Rome, was not then head, nor vniuerſall Biſhop of the Church.
In this Nicen Councell, the Limits of the Patriarkes were
bounded, to whom the ſame authoritie, ouer their Churches,
was giuen, as held the Biſhop of Rome ouer his neighbour
Churches. The Papiſts (as they knowe, which haue read
Hiſtories) haue endeauoured, what they could, to falſifie
this decree. Reade for this purpoſe, the ſixt Councell of
Carthage, whereof we will afterwardes make mention. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Cuſanus</hi> alleaging the Nicen Councell, ſhewed the rial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the truth, ſaying as followeth. The Biſhop of Rome,
of the ancients,<note place="margin">Lib. 2 de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia Cathol, cap. 12.</note> is often called Patriarke, or Archbiſhop: and
like authoritie was giuen him in the Councell of Nice, as to
the other Patriarkes. Here wee ſee, what great authoritie
hath the Pope newly in our times vſurped, more then that
which the holy and ancient conſtitutions gaue him, and
all this by continuance, and cuſtome of ſlauiſh obedience.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19632:115"/>
O great ſubtiltie. This Councell of Carthage, albeit it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
called he prouincial. So alſo calleth it <hi>Panuinus,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that there were found there preſent
217 Biſhops, and three legates of the Pope: what letteth it then
to be generall? The Papiſts, what they may, wil forget this ſixt
Councell of Carthage: albeit, ſaith <hi>Panninus,</hi> it was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Trullo. <hi>Gracian</hi> alſo interpreting the words of the
Councell,<note place="margin">Curſed is the gloſe that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the text.</note> vſeth the ſame malice: That none appeale (ſaith he)
to partes beyond the ſea, except it be to the Biſhop of Rome.
The cauſe why it was commanded in this 6. Councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
that no appeale ſhould be beyond the ſea, was, for that
the ſiſmatikes of Affrike, condemned by the good Biſhops of
Affrike, appealed to Rome: Therfore commanded the councel
they ſhould not appeale, but that the buſineſſe, without ſeeking
further, ſhould be concluded in Affricke. And ſo was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of this Councell: That the Biſhop of Rome ſhould not
receiue thoſe, that were excommunicate by the Biſhops of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,
nor accept their appellations, which had in Affrike bene
condemned: and thoſe that appealed to him, ſhould be, for
the ſame matter, excommunicate. The reaſons whereuppon
this Councell was founded, ſent by it to <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Biſhop of
Rome, be theſe: That in no Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel was any ſuch thing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
But that the Nicen Councell contrariwiſe gaue the charge
of the Biſhops, and Eccleſiaſticall perſons to the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane.
The grace of the holy Spirit (ſaith it) will aſſiſt euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
to iudge controuerſies: that each one which felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
greeued, might appeale to a prouinciall Councell: For it
is more to bee beleeued, that God will rather inſpire manie
Prieſts in a Councell aſſembled then one only man, &amp;c. By that
which wee haue alleaged of the ſixt Councell of Carthage, it
clearely appeareth: how falſe is that, which the Pope ſaid, that
in the Nicen Councell the primacie was giuen him: and yet
want there not ſome in our times alſo, which renewe this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood.
And ſo D. <hi>Illeſcas</hi> vpon the life of <hi>Boniface</hi> 3 in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
note ſaith theſe words: <hi>Phocas</hi> de clared by the Law, that
the Roman Church is head of the Church vniuerſall. Alſo he
ſaith: This ſuperiority of the Roman Church hath euer ſithens

Councell of Carthage,<note place="margin">Anno 600.</note> the matter of the primacie was
alſo debated. The cauſe was this: That <hi>Iohn,</hi> Biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,

called himſelfe Biſhop of Biſhops, and vniuerſall biſhop.
And this becauſe he was Biſhop of the citie, where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
was reſident. <hi>Mauricius</hi> willing to aduaunce his citie, and
abaſe Rome, did ſupport, and maintaine him. A curſe then was
pronounced in this Councell, not againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

him aſſociates had bene needfull. But liſten a litle: <hi>Donatus</hi> was
condemned by them aboue named, who ſeeing himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
appealed to the Emperour: the Emperour remitted
the appeale to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Areletum,</hi> either to allow or
diſallow of the ſentence, which the Biſhop of Rome and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates,
had giuen. Where then was the Primacie of the Pope
his iuriſdiction: his ſentence without any appellation: his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp; hearing of all appeales, his fulneſſe of power, whereof
he ſo much glorieth? And the Emperor, wil they not ſay, was an
infidel, or tyrant: for it was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who (by their
owne reckoning) ſpoiled himſelf of a good part of the Empire,
to giue it vnto them. That <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great appointed <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades</hi>
iointly with the reſt, for Iudge, to heare the cauſe of <hi>Ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus.
Onuphrius Panuinus</hi> in his note vpon <hi>Platina,</hi> in rhe life of

Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> when they wrote to the Biſhop of Rome, they
gaue him not the glorious titles, which the flatterers of our

Biſhop, our Lord, &amp; God vpon earth: they called him brother,
fellow Biſhop, companion in office: &amp; other ſuch like titles,
which ſauored of loue &amp; Chriſtian ſimplicitie, &amp; not of flattery
&amp; pride, wherewith the miſerable Popes are puffed vp, &amp; reſt
much conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. And if it ſeemed to thoſe Fathers, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictor,</hi> for that through an impudent

and correct one another. If any difference there bee of
Maioritie, or Minoritie, by poſitiue lawe it commeth,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19632:119"/>
as the Cannoniſts themſelues, when the truth doth inforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
confeſſe, ſaying: <hi>Quod omnis maioritas &amp; minoritas, etiam Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
eſt de iure poſitiuo.</hi> That all maioritie and minoritie, yea the
verie Popedome it ſelfe, is by the poſitiue law: as much to ſay,
that men haue made it. And yet go I further. The maiority, ſay
I, which the Pope hath vſurped ouer all the Churches, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lambe of the Apocalyps, and againſt his Saints, is
not by diuine, nor yet humane law, I ſay it is <hi>de iure diabolico,</hi> of
the diuell: that it is, an infernall tyranny, againſt which, all the
world is to riſe vp, as againſt a fire and generall burning, which
toucheth euery particular perſon. Note here, that which in the
life of <hi>Iohn</hi> 24. we haue noted: where the Pope by a decree of
the Councell of Conſtance and Baſile is proued to be ſubiect
to the Councell: and that more ouer which there we haue ſaid.
Not bluntly and fooliſhly (as they ſay) but with good reaſon
me ſeemeth, do I ſay this: as by the ſayings of the Fathers, and
decrees of ancient Councels, we haue ſufficiently proued the
ſame. And had there bene none to haue ſaid it, yet their proper
life and doctrine, which we haue in the beginning mentioned,
are moſt euident teſtimonies to confirme our ſayings. By their
liues may each one ſee (if of wilfull ignorance he become not
blockiſh,<note place="margin">Anno. 605.</note> fooliſh, and blind) the Popes, which haue bin biſhops
of Rome, from <hi>Boniface</hi> the third (who was a creature of <hi>Phocas</hi>
the Emperour, an adulterer, murderer, and tyrant) vntil <hi>Clement</hi>
8. or 10. which now tyrannizeth) to haue almoſt bene al noted
(read their hiſtories) of terrible, enormious and wicked vices,
and ſinnes. Witches they haue bene, murtherers, ill beloued,
tumultuous troublers of common wealths and kingdomes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
reuengefull brothellers, ſimoniſts, ſodomites, periured,
inceſtuous, Nigromancers, ſacrilegious, wicked, without God,
without religion. They then being ſuch, we conclude them not
to be ſucceſſors of <hi>Peter,</hi> but of <hi>Iudas:</hi> not to be vicars of Chriſt,
but of the Diuell, and verie Antichriſt. But now for more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that which is ſaid, we will alleage certaine paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of holy Scripture, which the Papiſts themſelue vnderſtand
and interpret of Antichriſt: we will conſider if that which the
Scripture ſaith Antichriſt ſhall do and ſay, the Pope doth and
ſaith. And ſeeing that the doctrine and life of the Pope is the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19632:119"/>
very ſame, which the ſcripture doth ſay ſhalbe that of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:
by the Papiſts owne confeſſion, will we conclude, the
Pope to be Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt paſſage,<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 36.</note> is taken out of <hi>Daniel</hi> the 11. chapter: which
ſaith: And the king ſhall doe what he liſt: By king, aſwell in
this place, as chapter 8. 23. and 24. is ment Antiochus, a great
perſecutor of the people of God; This Antiochus was a figure
of Antichriſt, which is the Pope. Antiochus burned the Bible,
aduanced his God <hi>Mauzim,</hi> forbad marriage, made Idols
of gold and ſiluer, adorned them with rich ornaments, &amp;c. and
the ſame doth the Pope. <hi>Daniell</hi> proceedeth. He ſhall exalt, and
magnifie himſelfe againſt all that is God, and ſhall ſpeake mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous
thinges againſt the God of Gods: and ſhall proſper
till the wrath be accompliſhed: for the determination is made;
Neither ſhall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the deſires
of women, nor care for any God: for he ſhal magnifie himſelfe
againſt all,<note place="margin">Three markes wherewith An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhalbe marked.</note> &amp;c. Note here in <hi>Daniel.</hi> 3. notable markes which
(ſaith he) Antichriſt ſhall haue: In whomſoeuer then we ſhall
ſee them, hold we him for. Antichriſt. The 1. is that he ſhall
not acknowledge the God of his fathers: 2. is that he ſhall not
regard the loue of women,<note place="margin">The Pope is an Apoſtata in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> 3. nor care for any God. The cauſe
of all this (ſaith he) is the exceſſiue pride. The Pope being of the
race of Chriſtians, which haue worſhipped the true God, father
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hath brought into the Church of God,
where he holdeth his ſeat, Idolatrie and ſuperſtition, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
men, in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; calamitie, to inuocate another, &amp; others
then God:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> contrary to the expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God. Thou
ſhalt haue no other Gods before me: and contrary to that
which he commaundeth by his Prophet:<note place="margin">Pſal 50. 51.</note> Call vpon me in the
day of trouble. There is no commaundement of God, either in
the old or new Teſtament, that commaundeth vs to inuocate
any other but God alone. Neither is there any example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke,
Prophet,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> or Apoſtle, which hath called vpon any, ſaue
God alone. For how ſhall they call vpon him, in whom they
haue not beleeued? as ſaith Saint <hi>Paule.</hi> In one onely God we
beleeue, vpon him onely let vs call. This new Doctrine hath the
Pope brought into the Church, to call vpon others then God
alone: Therefore is he Antichriſt. Who hath forbidden Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19632:120"/>
to reade the law of the Lord, the bookes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts? The Pope. Who burneth
theſe holy bookes, and thoſe that for inſtruction of their
conſcience read them? The Pope. Who hath taken vppon
him authoritie to pardon ſinnes, and that for money, it being
God alone which doth graciouſly pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The Pope. Who
hath cauſed a little peece of white bread to be worſhipped ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
it is the true God, which created heauen and earth? The
Pope. Therefore is he Antichriſt, which neither honoreth nor a
doreth the God of his fathers,<note place="margin">The Pope ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horreth matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by God ordained.</note> who in the bookes, that the Pope
burneth, hath manifeſted himſelfe to his faithfull. The 2. marke
is, that he ſhall not regard the loue of women (to wit) that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of chaſtitie, holines, &amp; meritorious works, he ſhall
abhorre marriage. So greatly hath the Pope abhorred marriage
that a law he hath made, that no Pope, Cardinal, Patriarke,
Archbiſhop, Biſhop, Deane, Archeacon, Prieſt, nor Friar, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
nor ſubdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor any Nunne ſhal marry. And wherefore?
For pure hypocriſie; to be ſold to the ignorant people, for
holy; for Angels, which are not fleſhly, but wholly ſpirituall:
And the miſerable people, diſpiſing the meanes of marriage,
which God hath giuen them. Will rather burne then marry.
And ſo God deliuereth them vp to ſhamefull &amp; vile affections,
and in their luſts doe they burne (as ſaith S. <hi>Paule)</hi> Fornicators
they are,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> adulterers, Inceſtuous perſons, &amp; that moreouer which
the Apoſtle me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth. Theſe be the fruits of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie,
of his angelical, &amp; not fleſhly life, of his vowe of chaſtity,
vowed of ſo many, and kept of ſo fewe. Of ſuch like, the ſame S.
<hi>Paul</hi> fore warneth his diſciple <hi>Timothie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Timothy 4. 2.</note> ſaying: that they ſhall
ſpeake lies through hypocriſie, hauing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences ſeared;

bene ſo barbarous, ſo cruel, ſo tyrannous, &amp; Godleſſe that hath
forbidden marriage to ſo many thouſands of men and women
as are at this day of Prieſts, Fryars, and Nunnes? Onely ſuch
law maketh Antichriſt: Only the Pope maketh it, therefore is
the Pope Antichriſt: which regardeth not his owne lawful wife,
but his Ganimeds and ſtrumpets. Much paine hath the Pope of
long time taken, to cauſe this his tyrannicall lawe to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued:
Many people and nations, ſeeing it a law tyrannous,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19632:120"/>
and preiudiciall to the Common-wealth haue withſtood him:
becauſe that prieſts and Friars, not hauing proper wiues, and

hee giueth to vnderſtand, that Antichriſt ſhall neither bee
Turke, Moore, Iewe, nor Pagan, but a Chriſtian, and that
profeſſeth Chriſtian religion. The Pope ſitteth in Rome, a
City very ancient in Chriſtian Religion, where were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

ſealed with their bloud the Doctrine, which preached, and

which readeth, ſearcheth, and meditateth the holy ſcripture,
doth know, that all this which they ſay concerning Purgatorie,
is lies: albeit the Pope will haue it an Article of faith. Were
it an article of faith, it ſhould be founded vpon the ſcripture:
On the ſcripture it is not founded: therefore it is no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

it is not an Article of faith. But it is (as ſaith Doctour

to our ſelues: for of ignorance now ſhall we not ſinne, we are
forewarned. And as <hi>Daniel</hi> for our conſolation foretold vs of

him with the ſpirit of his mouth, and conſume him with the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19632:123"/>
brightneſſe of his comming: which we ſee dayly more and
more accompliſhed. How many kingdomes and prouinces do
now know the Pope to be Antichriſt? And how came they by

word of God.<note place="margin">Verie ſubtill was the Pope in forbidding the reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Very wiſe was the Pope in forbidding the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

ſaw a woman ſit vppon a beaſt: the woman and the beaſt
with their quallities and attire he depainteth. The woman
(ſaith hee) was the great whore, which ſitteth vpon manie
waters, with whom the kings of the earth haue committed
fornication: He ſaith, that ſhe was ſet vppon a beaſt: That

All theſe were men of ſingular life, which the Papiſtes

were in doctrine. All theſe in Seuill, and many others, men

O Seuill, Seuill, that killeſt and burneſt the prophetes which
God ſendeth vnto thee. Name me ſome eight of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of the Pope, at this day liuing in thee, which aſwell in
life as doctrine, may compare with or paragon thoſe eight
which I haue named, as thou then burnedſt. As the bloud of
Abell cried out to God:<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 10.</note> ſo now the bloud of theſe Martyrs do
likewiſe crie vnto God. Vnder the aſhes of theſe bleſſed men
hath God hidden many ſmall ſparkles, which when he ſhall
pleaſe, he will blowe away, and ſo kindle them, that a farre
greater fire ſhall they make, then that which is paſſed: and ſo
ſhall increaſe the number of the faithfull:<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> For the bloud of the
martyrs is the ſeed of the Goſpell. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> concludeth his
chapter,<note place="margin">The woman is he great citie.</note> ſaying: That this woman is the great Citie, which
reigneth ouer all the kings of the earth. Is not this a mainifeſt
deſcription of the Court of Rome? what other citie, but Rome,
reigned ouer all the kings of the earth? From all parts of the
world they went to Rome: The riches of the world they
caried to Rome: the Pope onely was king of kinges, and
Lord of Lordes. And woe to him that ſhould diſpleaſe him. Of
the beaſt, ſaith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he had 7 heads, and 10 horns: which
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf declareth, ſaying: that the ſeuen heads which the

Antichriſt with the ſpirit of his mouth: as in handling the ſecond
paſſage which we alleaged of the Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note>

ten hornes are ten kings (who perceiuing the inuincible power
of the impotent Lambe) ſhall forſake Antichriſt, diſgrace him,
make warre againſt him, and deſtroy him. Before 80 yeares
paſt, what king in Chriſtendome durſt whiſper againſt the
Pope? All were his vaſſals, all were his ſouldiers, and all hee

reſerued matters for the ſea Apoſtolique of <hi>Peter,</hi> which
neither <hi>Iohn</hi> nor <hi>Iames,</hi> nor <hi>Paule,</hi> nor any of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

the miniſters of the Goſpell, vntill couetouſneſſe and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
crept in, and confounded this good order, making one
greater, and another leſſe, becauſe one was more rich then
another, we (ſpeaking of the Primacy) confirme this, with
the ſayings of the ancient Doctours. If Chriſt by theſe words,
Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. had appointed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and head of the whole Church (as they ſay) to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

vpon this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Primacie, who ſhould be chiefe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
them. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> from the 1 verſe to the 5. of the 18 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

themſelues. 10. 15. beſought Chriſt that one might ſit at his

brethren. Saint <hi>Luke cap</hi> 22. 24. telleth: that there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

ambitious demand: He ſaid vnto them, ye know what yee aske
&amp;c. the tenne were angry with them for this ſuperioritie which
they pretended, Chriſt ſaid vnto them, that in a Politicall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
there it ſuperioritie: and ſo kings and princes holde au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

wherein there neither is, nor ought to bee ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it is not ſo. But it ſhall not bee ſo (ſaieth Chriſt) among
you, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Would our aduerſaries well examine this, they would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of their primacy, and principalitie that they ſeeke to

               </gap>ue to their Pope: which neither Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Apoſtles euer had. For had Chriſt giuen the
primacie to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee heard them contend, which
of them ſhould bee the greateſt, doubtleſſe hee would haue
ſaid vnto them: Wherefore ſtriue you? know yee not that I
haue giuen the Primacy to <hi>Peter?</hi> Doe yee not knowe that I
haue made <hi>Peter</hi> the chiefeſt of you all? Quiet then your

would Saint <hi>Peter</hi> haue ſaid, I am hee, whom Chriſt hath
appointed to bee the head of the whole Church, &amp;c. But
neither did Chriſt ſo ſay, but rather for their ambition, and
affectation of the primacie reproued them. Nor yet did Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> alleage, that Ieſus Chriſt had ſaid vnto him: <hi>Thou art
Peter, and vpon this rocke, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond place fundamental which our aduerſaries doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage,
to mainetaine the primacy of the Pope is, that Chriſt
ſaide to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Feede my ſheepe.</note> 
               <hi>Loueſt thou mee? &amp;c. Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>Yea,

doe they inferre,<note place="margin">Iohn 21. 16.</note> that ſeeing that Chriſt ſaid this to Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and ſayd it not to any other of the Apoſtles, that by the
ſame reaſon, hee made him Prince of the Apoſtles. The moſt
high wiſedome, and loue of Chriſt, in <hi>Peters</hi> confirmation
and comfort, they nothing conſider. There times had <hi>Peter</hi>
denyed Chriſt. And Chriſt three times demaunded if hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

Purgatorie: But the Pope of his great pietie and mercy, an
infinite number of Soules doth daily deliuer. And yet go they

ſame.</head>
               <p>Antichriſt is a Greeke word, and aſmuch to ſay as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to Chriſt. For as Antipapa is hee, who not beeing Pope,
attributeth to himſelfe, the whole authoritie and power of the
Pope. So is he Antichriſt that oppoſeth himſelfe to Chriſt;
attributing to himſelfe, that which is proper to Chriſt. The
holie ſcripture of Antichriſt, ſpeaketh two manner of waies:
For as this word Chriſt or anointed is ſometimes generally
taken, Pſalme 105. verſe 15. <hi>Touch not mine Annointed,</hi>
where, by annointed, all the faithfull that hold Communion
with Chriſt are vnderſtoode. And properly againe, when
Chriſt our Lord is mencioned. So by this word Antichriſt
is ſome time generally vnderſtoode, all ſuch as in Doctrine,
oppoſe themſelues to Chriſt. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 22. and <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 3. But
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19632:133"/>
then properly it mentioneth Antichriſt, when it noteth an
head of an abominable kingdome: which head lifteth vp it
ſelfe againſt Chriſt, as in 1. Ioh. 2. chap. 18. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, that Antichriſt ſhould come. It is to be noted, that
as many things in the ſcripture foretold of Chriſt, are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſome perſons, which were types and figures of Chriſt:
as <hi>Dauid, Salomon, Zerubbabel, &amp;c.</hi> Which properly, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are meant of Chriſt, and in him accompliſhed: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things alſo foretold of Antichriſt, Dan. 7. 8. 20. 21. 25.
chap. 8. 23. 24. 25. chap. 11. 36. and 1. Timoth. 4. 1. 2. 3. are
applyed to certaine tyrants and heretikes, as forerunners and

            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>3 Whether Antichriſt be come.</head>
               <p>The Papiſts ſay that Antichriſt is not yet come, but ſhal come
(teach they) of the race of the Iewes, of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> be
borne in Babylon, brought vp in Chorazain and Bethſaida,
and ſhall reigne in Ieruſalem, &amp;c. with ſundrie ſuch like
inuentions of man, not warranted by authoritie of holie
Scriptures. But wee ſay that Antichriſt is alreadie come, and
that will wee prooue by the teſtimonies of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For the ſame thing nowe is befallen the Papiſtes,
which in time paſt, when Chriſt Ieſus our redeemer did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
himſelfe in the world, happened to the Iewes. For as
the Iewes (with the Apoſtles) did beleeue and confeſſe, the
Prophetes to haue ſpoken manie things touching the Meſſias:
but not beleeued nor confeſſed that the promiſed Meſſias then
was come, nor that Ieſus borne of the Virgin Mary in Bethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
was that true Meſſiah. Euen ſo doe the Papiſtes at this
day, fully confeſſe with vs, that many thinges in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are foretolde concerning Antichriſt, yet beleeue they
not, nor confeſſe that he is come, but ſay he ſhall come, as
the Iewes did of the Meſſias. We ſay then, that Antichriſt is
already come. Let vs ſee now who he is, and by what marks he
may be knowne.</p>

This queſtion in former time was hard and obſcure: but now
Antichriſt being reuealed is Verie cleere and eaſie. For as this
is the true Meſſias, in whom, all things foretold by the holie
Ghoſt, concerning the Meſſias, are fulfilled: So is, and ought
this to be truly Antichriſt, in whom, all thinges foretold of
Antichriſt, by the Prophets and Apoſtles, do properly belong,
and are fulfilled. Let vs then conſider what the holie Ghoſt, in
holie ſcripture hath ſpoken of Antichriſt, which we will deuide
into three points.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Of the time of his reuelation.</item>

                  <item>3 Of his eſtate, life and Doctrine:</item>
               </list>
               <p>The time of Antichriſts reuelation is ſignified by Dan. cap. 7.
5. 8. when he ſaieth: <hi>A litle horne aroſe vp among the other
hornes in the heade of the fourth Beaſt.</hi> The Prophet declareth
that the kingdome of Antichriſt ſhould riſe vp in the Romane
Empire, which was the fourth Monarchie; ſignified by the
fourth Beaſt. The Apoſtle Saint Paule well noteth the time of
the reuelation and comming of Antichriſt; when he writeth. 2.
Theſtal. 2. 3. <hi>Let no man deceaue you by any meanes: for that day
ſhall not come, except there come a departing firſt, &amp; that that man
of ſinne bee diſcloſed, euen the ſonne of perdition.</hi> Cleerely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Apoſtle, that after an Apoſtaſie, Antichriſt ſhall
come. True it is, that from the Appoſtles time haue bene ſome
forerunners of Antichriſt, of whom we read Io. 1. 18. 22 &amp;c. And
that then the Myſterie of iniquitie did worke 2. Theſ. 2. 7.
yet could not the kingdome of Antichriſt increaſe whiles the
Roman Empire flouriſhed: But when the Roman Empire
ſhould be weakened, then ſhould Antichriſt be cheife: as
the ſame Apoſtle declareth, when he ſaieth 2. Theſ. 2. 7. 8.
Only he <hi>which now withholdeth ſhall let, till he be taken out of the

God of his Fathers, nor the loue of women: nor care for anie
God: for he ſhall magnifie himſelfe aboue all. <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. But in
his place ſhall he honour his God Mauzim. A God whom his

This ſhall hee doe in the ſtrong holds of Mauzim, vvith a ſtrange

               <p>Theſe propheſies doe teach vs, that Antichriſt muſt bee a

               <p>Examine we now theſe teſtimonies of holy ſcripture, which
wil appear to be moſt properly belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the Pope of Rome:
So as by theſe propheſies we are warned (as it were) with the
finger of God from heauen, that the Pope is Antichriſt. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of his reuelation conſidered, the Popes reigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the fourth monarchie, and want of the Romane Empire.
For about the yeare 606. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. receiued of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
the Emperour (who was a tyrant, and murthered <hi>Mauricius</hi>
his Lord, with his wife and children) the title of Vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and Head of the Church: which once being graunted,
the Popes whole endeuors were to lift vp themſeues with the
Empire of Rome, and the whole world beſides.</p>
               <p>For the ſeat of Antichriſt, it is cleare, and to all men knowne,
that the Pope ſitteth at Rome, which is a city ſcyted betweene
the two ſeas <hi>Thyrren</hi> and <hi>Adriartike,</hi> hath 7 mountains, &amp; reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ouer all the kings of the earth, which cannot be ſaid of any
other city in the world. And ſeeing <hi>Rome</hi> is in Europe, &amp; neither
in India, Aſia, nor Africa: it plainly appeareth, that Antichriſt
ſitteth in the temple of God (to wit) in Chriſtendome, as Saint
Paule 2. Theſ. 2. 4. declareth.</p>
               <p>Meane at the beginning was the eſtate and condition of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19632:135"/>
Pope, but it mightily, and with great ſucceſſe increaſed. So
that he holdeth not authoritie and one crowne as a king onely,
but three crownes, declaring thereby, his power to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then that of all kings and Emperours. As he attributeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to himſelfe: the two ſwords or powers, ſpirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
figured by the two hornes. Apoc. 13. 11.</p>
               <p>A Blaſphemer is the Pope, in ſaying he is Chriſts Vicar: head
of the Church: that he can pardon ſinnes: may not be iudged
of any: cannot erre: in concluſion, that he is God in the earth:
can change nature: holdeth an heauenly power, and the fulnes
of power, and of vnrighteouſneſſe can make righteouſneſſe.

As the name of Pope is not found in the holy ſcripture, as
little alſo is there found the name of Maſſe.<note place="margin">Maſſe.</note> And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
had it bene ſo neceſſarie for a Chriſtian to beleeue the
authoritie of the Pope and holineſſe of the Maſſe, without
which faith (ſay they) it is vnpoſſible for a man to bee ſaued:
It is, I ſay, to bee beleeued, that Ieſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles
would haue made ſome mention thereof.<note place="margin">There is no thing neceſſary for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declareth not.</note> For all whatſoeuer
is neceſſary for our ſaluation doth Chriſt and his Apoſtles
teach vs. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaking to the Epheſians, ſaith. <hi>Ye
knowe, that I keepe backe nothing that was profitable, but haue
ſhewed you, and haue taught you openly, and throughout euery

and faith in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Actes 20. 20.</note> But this holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
ſo diligent in teaching that which we ought to beleeue,
maketh no mention of the Pope, nor of the Maſſe. Hereuppon
it followeth, that to beleeue the authoritie of the Pope, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Maſſe, is no Article of faith. But true it is, will they
ſaie vnto me, that this word Maſſe, is not found in the ſcripture,
but its equiualent is found, the ſupper of the Lord: And if we
ought to admit the Lords ſupper, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt we admit this name
<hi>Miſſa.</hi> Whereunto we aunſwere: that moſt great Iniurie
and wrong doe they to the holie ſupper which the Lord
inſtituted, in ſaying it to be the ſame that is their Maſſe,
which they haue imagined, and forged. For how great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
there is betweene Truth, and Falſhood, Light, and
darkeneſſe, God and <hi>Belial:</hi> So great is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the holy ſupper, and the profane Maſſe. Had the
queſtion bene concerning the name; whether the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
were to be called <hi>Miſſa</hi> or no. It ſhould not be of great
importance. Agree wee in the ſubſtance of the things, and
call it as ye liſt: Albeit, it bee il done, when the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
calleth a thing by ſuch or ſuch name, that man dare call it by
another name. The Apoſtle calles it the ſupper of the Lord,
and not the Maſſe. Call wee it then, the ſupper of the
Lord,<note place="margin">It is not yet knowne where of the Maſſe is deriued.</note> and not the Maſſe. And chiefly, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the ſupper and the Maſſe beeing ſo great as wee
ſhal ſee.</p>
               <p>Concerning the name of Maſſe, yet is it not concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19632:137"/>
the Romiſts themſelues, whence it is deriued. Some
ſay: that it is deryued of this hebrew word Mas, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
trybute, or taxe: others ſayd, that it is Latine, and that
<hi>Miſſa</hi> is the ſame that <hi>Miſſio</hi> is, as <hi>Remiſſa</hi> (which word ſome
of the ancients, and chiefly Saint <hi>Ciprian</hi> vſed) is the ſame
that <hi>Remiſſion</hi> is:<note place="margin">what the Maſſe is.</note> and others ſayd other thinges. The Maſſe
as our aduerſaries define it, is a ſacrifice, whereby pardon
is obtained for the ſinnes of the quick, and dead. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
doe magnifie their Maſſe, and that (as they ſay) for
diuers reaſons. Eight of the chieffeſt whereof, I will here ſet
downe.<note place="margin">8 reaſons wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Maſſe</note> The firſt for that it is a ſacryfice expiatorie. The ſecond
in regard of him who inſtituted the ſame, which (as they ſay)
was Ieſus Chriſt. The third in regard of them that ſay it, which
were (as they ſay) Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> who was chaplaine
(ſay they) of the virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
The fourth, for the antiquitie of the Maſſe; ſeeing all the
Church from the death of Chriſt vntill now, hath celebrated it
with great reuerence. God would neuer permit (ſay they) that
his Church ſhould ſo long time be deceiued. The fift with
many myracles which the Maſſe and their conſecrate hoſt
haue done, they confirme it: which ſhew the holineſſe, and
diuinitie that remayneth in the Maſſe. The ſixt they maintaine
it, ſaying: that in the Maſſe, are many good thinges taken out
of holie ſcripture: as the Epiſtle, the Goſpell, the <hi>Hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
meum,</hi> the <hi>Pater noſter, &amp;c.</hi> The ſeauenth, that this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Maſſe (ſay they) was figured in Melchiſedech,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note> who
being a prieſt of the moſt high God, offered bread and wine
vnto him.<note place="margin">Malachy 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Malachie</hi> (they ſay) ſpake of the Maſſe, when he ſaid.
<hi>For from the riſing of ths ſunne, vnto the going downe of the ſame,
my name is great among the Gentiles, and in euery place, Incenſe ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
offered vnto my name, and a pure offring.</hi> 8. For the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
which thereby we receaue, doe they eſteeme it. Of all
this, they conclude that the maſſe is holy, good, bleſſed, and
diuine; And that we for ſo ſhameleſly ſpeaking againſt a thing
ſo excellent, which Ieſus Chriſt ordayned, his Apoſtles cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
and all the Church Catholique worſhippeth and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
are heretiques, dogges, &amp;c. In concluſion, their Maſſe
is their Helen, for whom they trouble the whole world.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19632:138"/>
Theſe be the principall reaſons, wherewith our aduerſaries
doe maintaine their Maſſe. Whereunto (inuocating the name
of the Lord, whoſe cauſe we deale in, and here mainetaine)
in like order as we haue propoſed them, will we anſwere. I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeech
thee Chriſtian reader, for the zeale thou holdeſt of the
glory of God, &amp; the deſire thou haſt of the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thine own
ſoule, attentiuely to read, &amp; with ripe Iudgment to waigh the
foreſaid reaſons, and the anſwers which we will giue, and that
moreouer which wee ſhall ſay to this purpoſe: See which of
theſe two Doctrines doe agree, and are more conformable
with the ſquier and rule of holy ſcripture, and that beleeue.
Bee not a beaſt, vnderſtanding and his law hath God giuen
thee. Conſider well if thou be an idolater or no, that nought
therein befall thee, but the ſaluation of thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, where the Maſſe, they ſay, is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to obtaine remiſion of ſinnes,<note place="margin">Our aduerſaries firſt reaſon and our anſwere.</note> &amp;c. I ſay, by their leaue, that
the Maſſe is no ſacrifice. For were it a ſacrifice, it ſhould not
(ſpeaking properly) be a ſacrament.<note place="margin">The Maſſe is no ſacrifice.</note> And they affirme the Maſſe
to be both a ſacrifice, and a Sacrament: which cannot be: For
ſo great is the difference betweene a ſacrifice; and a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as there is difference betweene giuing and taking.<note place="margin">The difference betwene a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> The
ſacrifice, is offered and preſented vnto God. The ſacrament
is taken and receiued of the hand of the Lord, by the miniſterie
of the miniſter of his word.</p>
               <p>The holie ſupper (ſpeaking properly) is no expiatorie
ſacrifice: for of this doe wee now ſpeake: but a ſacrament
of the precious bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt our redeemer.
But improperly ſpeaking, it may bee called a ſacrifice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
a memoriall it is of that euerlaſting and onely ſacrifice,
which Ieſus chriſt offered to his father vppon the alter of
the Croſſe: And ſo vnderſtand it the fathers, when they call
it a ſacrifice. Not that the ſupper is a ſacrifice, but a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of the ſacrifice, doe they vnderſtand according to that
which Chriſt ſpeaketh of his ſupper ſaying: Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the ſame purpoſe ſaith:
<hi>Ye ſhall ſhew the Lords death till his comming againe.</hi> And if the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
be no ſacrifice, much leſſe ſhall the Maſſe be, which they
celebrate in the place of the ſupper. Beſides this, were the Maſſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19632:138"/>
a ſacrifice, It ſhould be either propitiatory, which we alſo call
expiatory, or Euchariſticall, to wit either offered for remiſſion
of ſinnes: or in thankſgiuing. They will ſay vnto me, as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
thereof they ſaid, that it is a ſacrifice expiatory. I ſay
vnto them, it cannot ſo be: for no other expiatory ſacrifice is
there, but only the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatorie
ſacrifice is that; which is made to appeaſe the wrath
of God,<note place="margin">Chriſt alone the expiatory ſacrifice.</note> and to ſatiſfie his iuſtice, and in ſo doing, doth purge
and clenſe ſinnes, that the ſinner beeing clenſed from his
filthineſſe and ſinnes, and reſtored to the purity of righteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
may be reduced into the fauour of God. All this wholy
and perfectly did the Lord, by his death vppon the Croſſe,
and hee onely, and no other did ſacrifice ſuch kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
For the vertue and efficacy hereof, which Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
one only time offered, is eternall. And ſo ſaid he in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this ſacrifice, all is finiſhed all is fullfilled, aſmuch to ſay.
That whatſoeuer was neceſſarie to reconcile vs with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, righteouſneſſe, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
all this was ended and fulfilled, with that onely
ſacrifice, which Ieſus Chriſt offered: And ſo faulted hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
that no place might afterwardes remaine for any other
ſacrifice. Hereuppon will we then conclude: that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
diſgrace, and monſtrous blaſphemy againſt
Ieſus Chriſt and againſt his ſacrifice, if any offer any other
ſacrifice, beſides that already offered: or ſhall reitterate
that, which Chriſt before offered, ſuppoſing by ſuch ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to obtayne forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, reconciliation with
God, and righteouſneſſe. And what other thing is done in
the Maſſe, but that wee by the merit of a new ſacrifice, may
bee made partakers of the death and paſſion of Chriſt? Who
ſo will well vnderſtand this, which wee ſaie, concerning
the onely expiatory ſacrifice, one onely time offered, and
neuer more iterated. Let him read the Epiſtle which the
Apoſtle wrote to the Hebrewes: and chiefly the ſeuenth
chapter. Of this will wee intreat ſomewhat more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hereafter.</p>
               <p>The 2.<note place="margin">The ſacrifice Euchariſticall.</note> manner of ſacrifice, which wee call Euchariſticall,
comprehendeth all the exerciſes of charitie: which done to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19632:139"/>
our neighbours, in ſome ſort are they done vnto God; who is
thus honored in his members. Our prayers, praiſes, thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and all whatſoeuer we doe for the ſeruice and honor of
God, are alſo comprehended in this kind of ſacrifice, Al which
ſacrifices doe depend vppon that great ſacrifice, by which
we are conſecrated in body and ſoule, and dedicated for holy
Temples to God. This kind of ſacrifice nought ſerueth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the wrath of God, to obtaine forgiueneſſe of ſinne, or
to deſerue, or purchaſe righteouſneſſe: but is only to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and glorifie God. This Euchariſticall ſacrifice, can no way
pleaſe God; except it proceede from thoſe which (hauing by
the other kind of ſacrifice, which we call Expiatory obtained
forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, bee already reconcyled with him, and
iuſtified. This ſacrifice Euchariſticall is very neceſſarie in the
Church: And woe to that day which a Chriſtian paſſeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offering of this ſacrifice to God.<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 11.</note> This is the incenſe, and
oblation,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> cleane and pure which <hi>Malachie</hi> Propheſied, that
the Church of God ſhould offer. Of this ſacrifice ſpeaketh Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> when hee ſaith:<note place="margin">Hebr. 13. 6.</note> that we offer vp our bodies, a liuing
ſacrifice holie and acceptable vnto God, a reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God. For this cauſe the almes and other good works
of the faithfull, are called ſacrifices; wherewith God is well
pleaſed. The Prophet <hi>Hoſeas</hi> exhorteth the people to returne
vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">Hoſea 14. 3</note> and ſaie vnto him: <hi>Take away all iniquitie, and
receaue vs gratiouſly: So will wee render the Calues of our
lippes.</hi> What the Prophet vnderſtood by the calues of lippes,
the Appoſtle declareth,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13. 15.</note> when hee ſaith: <hi>Let vs therefore
by him, offer the ſacrifice of praiſe alwayes to God,</hi> that is the
fruite of the lippes;<note place="margin">Phillip. 4. 18.</note> which confeſſe (or prayſe) his name.
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> calleth the liberalitie wherewith the Phillippians
in his neceſſitie, had relieued him, A ſacrifice of ſweete
ſauour: and all the good workes which the faithfull doe,
are called ſpirituall ſacrifices. His Maieſtie giue vs grace
continually to offer ſuch ſacrifices vnto him, and that when
we offer them, we may without all hypocriſie confeſſe that
wee are vnprofitable ſeruauntes, &amp;c. For if hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Apoſtles ſo to ſay,<note place="margin">Luke. 17. 10.</note> and thinke, yea when they had done
what God had commanded them. Why, ſhal he not command
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19632:139"/>
the ſame vnto vs, which be in life and doctrine ſo farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to his Apoſtles, that we are vnworthie to loſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets
of their ſhooes? God giue vs grace to be humble in
heart. Of this kinde of ſacrifice will we alſo ſay more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>By that which is ſaid, is plainely ſeene, that the Maſſe is
neither an expiatorie, nor Euchariſticall ſacrifice: and ſo by
conſequence, no ſacrifice at all. That it is not expiatorie, we
already haue proued: and that it is not Euchariſticall: by that
which our aduerſaries ſay, that the Maſſe is an expiatorie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
is proued: If it be expiatorie, then is it not Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
The force of this Argument conſiſteth in a rule of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,
which ſaith: The members diuiding muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:
As touching the definition of the Maſſe, this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
Wee haue taken from it the kind, in prouing it no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
we haue taken from it the difference, in prouing that
it is not expiatorie: both the kind and difference taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
what ſhall be the definite? Nothing. Or if the Maſſe
bee anie thing, it is a priuation of the holy ſupper of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and redeemer Ieſus Chriſt: euen as ſinne is the priuation
of grace.</p>
               <p>Let not our aduerſaries thinke that we yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Maſſe
to be ſo ancient,<note place="margin">The ſecond &amp; third reaſons of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and our anſwer.</note> as they make it, ſaying: that the Lord 1565
yeares paſt did inſtitute it: for ſo long it is ſince he ſuffered. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we grant them that S. <hi>Peter.</hi> nor S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor any of the
Apoſtles euer ſaid that which our aduerſaries ſay to bee the
Maſſe.<note place="margin">Chriſt did not inſtitute the Maſſe, neither did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſay it.</note> Thoſe which they bring are falſe teſtimonies. If any
man beare falſe witneſſe againſt his neighbour, how vile or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
ſoeuer he be, he breaketh the 9. commandement, he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the law of God, and for the ſame is worthy of eternall
death. Howe much more ſhall he breake it, and be worthy of
death, that vpon cold bloud and deliberat purpoſe (of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
I ſpeake, and not of the vulgar ſort, which can neither read
nor vnderſtand) bringeth falſe witnes againſt Chriſt, his king,
prophet, and prieſt, ſaying that he did inſtitute the Maſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are ſo many ſuperſtitions and idolatries: ſaying that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
choſen veſſels of God to denounce the Goſpell, and to

poſſible that S. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſo diligent an Hiſtoriographer of the Acts
of the Apoſtles, hath left in the incke-horne this Article which
our aduerſaries hold ſo neceſſarie to ſaluation, as any other of
the twelue Articles of the faith contained in the Creed. And
ſeeing that this falſe teſtimony which they raiſe vp againſt <hi>Peter</hi>
auaileth little to the confirmation of their Maſſe. Another falſe
teſtimony raiſe they vp alſo of S. <hi>Iames:</hi> that S. <hi>Iames</hi> (ſay they)
was the firſt that ſaid the firſt Maſſe in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Yet are they
more ſhameleſſe, bring to light the ſaid Maſſe ſaid of S. <hi>Iames,</hi>
which 1500 years ſince at the leaſt was buried: &amp; cry out, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
a miracle. Now is there no further diſputing to be had: ſith
it is an Apoſtle which hath ſaid Maſſe: now neither can or ought
they to moue any more doubts touching the Maſſe: vpon paine
to be an heretike, &amp; blaſphemer, whoſoeuer ſhal moue it. In the
1560. yeare was this Maſſe of S. <hi>Iames</hi> (as they call it) printed in
Paris. In this Maſſe ther is a prayer, wherin are ſaid theſe words:
We pray for the gifts offred, ſanctified, precious, ſuperceleſtiall,
ineffable, immaculate, glorious, horrible, fearful &amp; diuine. What
maner of ſpeech is this? when vſed the Apoſtles any ſuch forme
of ſpeaking? Alſo that this falſhood may be clearely perceiued,
there is a prayer in the Maſſe for the Monkes &amp; Nunnes, which
liued in the Monaſteries. They which ſay that this Maſſe is of S.
<hi>Iames,</hi> ſhould read this and be ſilent. For in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
was there neither Monkes nor Nunnes, nor Monaſteries:
many yeares after were theſe things inuented. Moreouer, if this
be a Maſſe of S. <hi>Iames</hi> let them augment the Cannon: Let them
place them among the Canonicall bookes of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Let them beleeue &amp; do al that which is ſaid in the ſame. In
this Maſſe which they call of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> all the people did vnder
two kinds communicate: all the office was ſaid in the vulgar
tongue, the people ſang and anſwered to the prayers: in it was
neither the ſacrament of the bread nor wine adored. But in the
Maſſes of our aduerſaries are all things contrarie: wherein the
people do not but once in the yeare communicate, &amp; this once
that they do communicate, they take from them halfe by the
middle: they take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them the ſacrament of the bloud of Chriſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19632:140"/>
which Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that all ſhould drink: their Maſſes they
ſay in a ſtrange tongue, which the people vnderſtand not, and
oftentimes he himſelfe that ſaith it, neither knoweth nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
that which he ſaith: The people are ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as though they
ſhuld heare an Enterlude: The people adore the bread &amp; wine
as though it were Chriſt, and not the ſacrament of the body &amp;
bloud of Chriſt. That which Ieſus Chriſt inſtituted, was his holy
ſupper, &amp; he commanded his Apoſtles (who repreſented the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal
or catholike Church) that they ſhuld afterwards do the
ſame which they had ſeene him do. <hi>Do this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> (ſpeaking to the Corinthians, among
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Satan had already beſtirred himſelf, bringing ſome abuſes
into the Church,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 11. 23.</note> concerning the ſupper of the Lord) ſaith: For I
receiued of the Lord, that which alſo I deliuered vnto you. That
the Lord, the night, &amp;c. And what agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath the maſſe with
this which the Apoſtle ſaith? Nothing at all. Let our aduerſaries
then ceaſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d things togither: Let them ceaſe to change
their names: Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not call the ſupper of the Lord, the Maſſe,
nor the Maſſe the ſupper of the Lord: Becauſe it is not ſo. This
ſupper of the Lord a very ſmal time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in it being &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
For euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiles the Apoſtles yet liued, aroſe vp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions,
ſciſmes &amp; hereſies about the ſame: The which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
willing to reforme, reduced the ſupper to it firſt inſtitution, as
the Lord had inſtituted &amp; celebrated it, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that the
faithful ſhuld celebrate the ſame. After theſe times came others
&amp; the buſines went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> il to worſe: Men not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with the
ſimplicity, wherwith the Lord had celebrated his ſupper, ſought
to be famous, ſhewing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more wiſe, more prudent and
aduiſed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt himſelf. And ſo they began to ad &amp; diminiſh
in the ſupper of the Lord. But notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al this for a 1000.
yeares ſpace the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſupper was not touched. Albeit
as touching outward ſhew, they vſed many ceremonies, which
Chriſt Ieſus neuer vſed &amp; attired themſelues with other, then
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ornaments, the which Chriſt nor his Apoſtles neuer did.
The 1000. years paſſed, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dared to touch the to quick, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the holy ſupper. They bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay, that the bread was
not bread and that the wine was not wine: but that they were
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed, &amp; tranſſubſtantiated into the body and
bloud of Chriſt. And this gainſaying the holy Scripture and the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19632:141"/>
Fathers, as well of the Greeke as Latine Church: which
wee will afterwards very ſufficiently proue. The matter
thus going in the Councell of Vercele,<note place="margin">Goncilium Vercelenſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth being
Pope, Tranſubſtantiation was concluded. This Pope condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the doctrine of <hi>Berengarius:</hi> as ſpeaking of the fourth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
we will afterwards declare. <hi>Berengarius</hi> beleeued what
the holy ſcripture had taught him, and in the Fathers hee had
read: to wit, that the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper in two
things conſiſted: in matter (as they cal it) and in forme: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is that, which is ſeene, touched, &amp; taſted, which is the bread
and wine. The forme is that which is not ſeene, but beleeued,
the body and bloud of Chriſt. You ſee here the great herefie
of <hi>Berengarius</hi> which the Pope and the Councell (gouerned
by the Pope) condemned. Afterwards ſpeaking againſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
by manifeſt authorities of the Scripture, and by
the ſayings of ancient Doctors will we proue true bread and
true wine viſible and tangible to be in the Sacrament, and the
true body and bloud of Chriſt to be iuuiſible and beleeued by
faith. And albeit the Pope commanded that Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould be beleeued, and the Councell decreed it, yet were
there in thoſe times manie learned and godly men, who (giuing
credit to that which the holy Scripture and ancient Doctors
ſaid) nought eſteemed that which the Pope and his Councell
commanded. And yet as conſtantly paſſed they further: they
wrote againſt ſuch doctrine, as impugning the word of God,
and the Fathers. Afterwards in the yeare of our Lord 1200.
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. confirmed this decree: and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 4. in honor
of this ſacrament, at the requeſt of a recluſe (with whom in
times paſt he had bin ouermuch familiar) inuented the ſolemne
feaſt which they call <hi>Corpus Chriſts.</hi> Read the life which we haue
written of this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 4. And the diuel not contented to haue ſo
euilly intreated the moſt holy Sacrament of the body &amp; bloud
of Chriſt, nor to haue giuen it ſo mortal a wound, paſſed yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He cut off the ſacrament half in halfe: he took away (ſay I)
the ſacramentall wine, which repreſented, ſealed, and ioyntly
gaue (receiuing it by faith) the bloud of Chriſt: And ſo was it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where were three Popes
depoſed: that the Sacrament not <hi>ſub vtraque ſpecie,</hi> in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19632:141"/>
both kinds, but in one only ſhould be giuen. True it is, they
yeeld their excuſes, why they departe from the inſtitution of
Chriſt &amp; that which in the Church was vſed, but their excuſes
be very friuolous &amp; to be laughed at: As more hereafter we
ſhall ſee, intreating of the ſixt domage which the maſſe cauſeth.
And a faire thing it is that they condemne thoſe for heretiques,
which in both kinds receiue the Sacrament according to the
Inſtitution of Chriſt himſelfe. If they ſeeke antiquitie. This
manner of communicating <hi>ſub vtraque ſpecie,</hi> vnder both kinds
continued in the Church for the ſpace almoſt 400. yeares:
Their communion in one kinde is newe and hath not bene but
180 yeares, for ſo long is it ſince was held the Councell of
Conſtance. One thing had I forgotten that it is many yeares
ſithence they began to ſay their Maſſe without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating
of the People, for the prieſt alone eateth and drincketh it
vp all without giuing any parte thereof to any. How can this
be ſaid to be the ſupper of the Lord, a communion, a common
banquet ſet forth,<note place="margin">Priuate Maſſes forbidden.</note> and prepared for all the faithfull. Theſe
maner of Maſſes call they priuie Maſſes and with fauor ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king)
very priuie. True it is that many Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and decrees
haue bene made againſt theſe priuie Maſſes: but behold how
they are kept. The priuies haue ſo evilly ſmelled that each one
thought good to ſtoppe their noſes and paſſe by them. Priuate
be theſe Maſſes called, not for that they be priuately or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, which publiquely are in the Churches and hearing of
all men that will: But ſo they are called: Becauſe not the people,
but the Prieſt alone doth communicate. And yet haue they
gone further: The Pope giueth licenſe to ſay theſe priuie Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the corners of houſes: but then is the charge of them
double. For the Prieſt which ſaith Maſſe muſt haue mony. And
the Pope for the licenſe which he giueth to haue an altar por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
which is alſo called the Bull. All this is contrarie to the
inſtitution of the Lord. You ſee heere howe the holy ſupper
which Ieſus Chriſt did inſtitute, and his holy Apoſtles did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate,
hath bene by little and little disfigured, vntill from the
Supper of the Lord, it is conuerted into the Maſſe of the
Pope. Behold the inſtitution of the holy ſupper, and behold
that which is done and ſaid in the Maſſe: and it is to be ſeene
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19632:142"/>
if the Maſſe be the Supper, or the Supper the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>By an infallible argument and palpable demonſtration doe
we now proue,<note place="margin">A reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ſaid Maſſe.</note> that neither Ieſus Chriſt did inſtitute the Maſſe,

not inſtitute, nor yet his Apoſtles did it. The Maſſe which our
Aduerſaties ſay, many yeares after the death of Chriſt and
his Apoſtles, not of one, but of many, and in diuerſe times was
inuented. It followeth then, that ſuch a Maſſe was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Chriſt, neither did his Apoſtles ſay it. The firſt part of
this argument none, except he bee ſenceleſſe and fooliſh, will
denie. But the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part will our aduerſaries denie, which eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may be proued. For one Pope made the <hi>Confiteor:</hi> another

               <p>By this then may be ſeene, that Chriſt did not inſtitute the
Maſſe: that which we pretended haue we prooued, that Ieſus
Chriſt did not inſtitute the Maſſe, and that his Apoſtles neuer
ſayd it: but that the Popes in diuers times did make it, one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one peece, and another, another; vntill it was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the being and eſtate wherin it now is: which hath no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Supper of the Lord. Entring ſometimes into
conſideration of theſe patches, ragges, ſhreds and peeces,
whereof the Maſſe is made, a wonderfull ſimilitude or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
(me ſeemeth) came to minde, and the ſame I ſuppoſe
will alſo appeare to ſuch as well conſider it. To the Maſſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leſſe nor more hath it happened,<note place="margin">The Maſſe patched like a beggers cloak.</note> then to a pilgrims ſcrippe,
to an old cloake of a begger that beggeth from doore to doore:
vpon ſuch a cloake the elder it is, the more patches doe they
ſet vpon it: ſo that in time, nothing therein is ſeene but here a
little peece, and there a ſmal peece of the cloth whereof it was
firſt made. And this cloth is ſo vſed, ſo waſted, ſo diſcolloured,
&amp; ſo without being, that it no way appeareth to be that which
it was. In this cloake are not ſeene but patches of cloth, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
and rotten, and very ill placed, and worſe ſowed together:
ſo that it cauſeth loathing to thoſe which haue bene delicately
brought vp. Such another cloake, and neither more nor leſſe is
the Popiſh Maſſe. The cloth wherof it was made, was the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord: which men not celebrating according to the
inſtitution of Chriſt, waxed olde, and loſt it collour, it being,
and worth: Thus commeth one and caſteth a peece vnto it:
afterwards commeth another and caſteth vnto it, &amp;c. So that
now it is not the Supper of the Lord, but the Maſſe of the Pope:
now it is not the robe of an honourable man, but a cloake of a

the ſecond and third reaſons, wherewith our aduerſaries doe
confirme their Maſſe.</p>

The fourth reaſon with which our aduerſaries ſuppoſe to
mainetaine their Maſſe is:<note place="margin">The 4. Reaſon of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> That all the Church Catholique,
from the death of Chriſt, vntill this day, with moſt great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
hath celebrated the Maſſe. This their reaſon they
confirme. ſaying: that God who loueth his Church, as his
ſpouſe, would neuer ſuffer it ſo long time to be deceaued, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
with ſo great ſuperſtition, and idolatrie, as the Maſſe
(wee ſay) is. This fourth reaſon of our aduerſaries, in two
thinges conſiſteth. In antiquitie: And in that God who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his Church, as his ſpouſe, would not ſuffer, &amp;c. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the firſt, of the Antiquitie of the Maſſe. In anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the ſecond and third reaſons of our aduerſaries wee
ſhewed, that Ieſus Chriſt neuer inſtituted the maſſe: nor his
Apoſtles euer ſaid it: and that the Church Catholique for
the ſpace of a thouſand yeares neuer celebrated the Maſſe,
which our aduerſaries now celebrate. But the holy ſupper
was celebrated with ſome humaine traditions, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
inuented by man: Notwithſtanding all this, the holie
ſupper, as touching it ſubſtaunce was euer in it beeing
conferued, by the ſpace of a thouſand yeares. For fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares ſpace hitherto, the ſupper hath ceaſſed to bee
a ſupper, and hath euery day more and more bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
into the Maſſe: ſuch as nowe wee ſee, and chiefly
ſince tranſubſtantiation and the Communion in one kind
were commaunded to be beleeued, as an Article of faith:
Then fell wholy, the holy ſupper, not in name onely, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it the maſſe: but alſo in ſubſtaunce as before we haue
ſaid.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond part which they bring for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the firſt namely, That God, who loueth his
Church, would not permit that his Church ſo long time
ſhould liue deceaued: To this I anſwere praying them to
read the Hiſtories of the olde and newe Teſtament. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they ſhall finde (if they well conſider) that the Church
faulted and mainteined errours, and that no meane ones.
The people of Iſrael was the people of God, the Church
of God and the ſpouſe of God, and dearly beloued; but for all
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19632:144"/>
this, the ſame people fell into many errours ſuperſtitions,
hereſies and Idolatries and not once by chaunce but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and of deliberate purpoſe. Read that notable ſong,
which <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God made,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> written in Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
There I ſay, ſhall yee find that that people, and that
Church of God, fell into idolatrie verſe ninth, Hee ſaith:
For the Lordes portion is his people: <hi>Iaakob</hi> is the line
(or lot) of his Inheritaunce. And in the tenth verſe, hee
ſaith that God kept this people as the apple of his eye.
And in the eleuenth: God carried this people vppon his back
like the Eagle. &amp;c. But behould what hee ſaith in the
ſame chapter and verſe fifteene of this people ſo deare and
ſo beloued. Behould if they fell to idolatrie: And hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
(ſaith hee) God that made him and regarded not
the ſtrong God of his ſaluation. They prouoked him with
their ſtraunge Gods, and made him angry with their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations:
They ſacrified to diuels, and not to God. But
to Gods whom they knewe not: new Gods, newly come
vpp whome their fathers feared not, &amp;c. And in the two
and thirtith chapter of Exodus, it is ſaid: that the people
of Iſraell pluct of their golden Earnings &amp;c.<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 3. &amp; 4.</note> And that <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
tooke them and made of them a moulten calfe: And
when the calfe was ſeene, Iſrael ſayd: Theſe be thy Gods
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. And when
<hi>Aron</hi> ſawe that. Hee built an altar before it, &amp;c. As wee
haue ſayd in the beginning of the firſt Treatiſe. Here may
yee fee, How all the people of Iſrael, and <hi>Aaron</hi> their
chiefe Prieſt committed idolatrie. Let vs proceede fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her.
When the people of Iſrael were entred into the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
How behaued they themſelues? they alſo committed
Idolatrie. Read in the booke of Iudges, and chiefly the
ſecond chapter. and the eleuenth verſe. And the children of
Iſrael (ſaith hee) did wickedly in the ſight of the Lord, and
ſerued <hi>Baal.</hi> And verſe nineteenth. But when the Iudge
was dead, they turned and corrupted themſelues more then
their fathers following other Gods, ſeruing them and bowing
downe before them.</p>
               <p>They ceaſed not from their owne inuentions: Nor from
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19632:144"/>
their rebellious way. All this booke is full of examples hereof.
The Iudges ended, and this people of God gouerned by
kinges. How was it then? As ill, or worſe then before. Let
them read the Prophets (which they call) great and ſmall.
This people of God, their Prieſtes and Princes condemned
the good Doctrine, and perſecuted the holie Prophets that
preached the ſame. So obſtinate was this people in turning
away from God, That God in indignation commaunded
<hi>Eſaie</hi> to ſay theſe wordes vnto the people:<note place="margin">Eſaie 6. 9.</note> in hearing, heare
and not vnderſtand. In ſeeing, ſee, and not perceaue.
The heart of this people is waxed fatte and their hearing
dull, and their eyes are blinded, leaſt they ſhould ſee with
their eyes and heare with their eares, &amp;c. The prophet
<hi>Ieremy</hi> proteſteth to all the people of Iuda,<note place="margin">Ieremy 25.</note> and to all the
Inhabitantes of Ieruſalem: the diligent care which the
Lord had vſed to conuert them from Idolatrie to himſelfe
and the ſmall profect they receaued thereby. Hee had this
(ſaid hee) preached vnto them by the ſpace of twentie and
three yeares, and they heard him not. Note what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſaith: in the ſecond verſe that hee ſpake this to all the
people of Iuda, and to all the inhabitantes of Ieruſalem.
And note, that onely this Hebrewe people, and no other
in all the world, was then the Church of God: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould
if the Church erred, Who wounded and impriſoned
<hi>Ieremy</hi> for his ſermons? <hi>Paſhur</hi> the chiefe Prieſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God. What was the ſtate of the people of Iſrael, when
<hi>Elias</hi> ſuppoſed that there was none but hee that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the true God of Iſrael?<note place="margin">1. kings 19. 10.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> alleageth this place, Rom.
11. 13. Let this ſuffice concerning the Church of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.
Come wee nowe to the newe. When the diuine
word, taking fleſh came into the world, How found he his
ſpouſe the Church? All to be ſmeared with dirt, and ſootte.
The Scribes and Phariſies, prieſts and high prieſts with their
traditions had wholely corrupted her. As nowe doe the
Prieſtes and Fryars, Biſhoppes and Popes. So great then
was the corrupption in Doctrine among the people of God,
that there was their principall ſects of the Pharifies ſadduces &amp;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19632:145"/>
Eſſees. The Phariſes great hypochrits, corrupted the ſcripture
with their traditions. The Sadduces ſhameleſly denied the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and allowed neither Angel nor ſpirit. As by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
which they held with Chriſt about the woman that
had ſeauen husbands, appeareth. Matth. 22. 22. and in the Acts
23. 8. The Eſſees apart had their opinions. It was a people ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
like the Charterhouſe Monkes. They had no wiues, drunk
no wine, nor did they eat any fleſh, a people they were very
auſtere, and euery day faſted. Whiles the Church was deuided
into theſe ſects, when all was confuſed, came the ſonne of God
into the world. With ſuch he conuerſed: And of ſuch, for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the truth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was crucified. When the light of the
Goſpel was come, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached:
who allowed it not, but rather killed and crucified thoſe that
preached the ſame? The ſame people of God, the Church of
God, &amp; chiefly the Scribes &amp; Phariſies, prieſts and high prieſts.
Theſe came togither, &amp; held a Councell wherein they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that Chriſt ſhould die, and all thoſe that ſhould preach the
ſame Doctrine: They tooke him, &amp; becauſe they wanted autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie
to put any to death, with falſe witnes they accuſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Pilate, Deputy to the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and thisin the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ieruſalem. And ſo was he condemned for an euil doer, &amp;
for ſuch a one was crucified. O what a Church? O what a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
if the cheife Preiſt may erre, and erred in dede. The Lord
by diuine power eftſoones rayſed vpp, who ſuborned his
keepers to ſay that his diſciples had ſtollen him away? Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſembled

be put to death? Who made S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be taken, to cauſe him to
die, had not the Angel of the Lord deliuered him? The viſible
Church of God, the ſcribes and Phariſies and high Prieſts. Not
without cauſe faid the Lord, ſpeaking of Ieruſalem: Ieruſalem
Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> which killeſt the prophets and ſtoneſt thoſe that be
ſent vnto thee. Afterwards the very ſame hath hitherto happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
&amp; leauing former times ſpake we of theſe wherein we liue.
Who hath for the ſpace of 70, or 80. yeares hitherto, ſhed ſo
much bloud of Martyres? they that call themſelues the Church
of Ieſus Chriſt &amp; chiefly the peeuiſh Friars, Biſhops &amp; chiefe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19632:145"/>
Biſhops, and the ſame ſhal they doe, vntill the end of the word.
And ſo Chriſt ſpeaking of his ſecond comming, when he ſhall
come to the vniuerſall Iudgement, ſaith: <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8. The ſon
of man when he commeth, ſhall he find faith vpon the earth?
As if he ſhould ſay: no. And in the XXIIII. chapter of Saint
<hi>Matthewe,</hi> he maketh a diſcourſe hereof: verſe 12. And becauſe
(ſaith he) iniquitie ſhalbe increaſed, the loue of many ſhalbe
cold. And verſe 24. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts and
falſe prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, ſo
that if it were poſſible, they ſhould deceiue the very elect. And
thinke we not, theſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets ſhalbee
Turkes and Iewes: Chriſtians they ſhalbe, and for ſuch ſhall
they be holden: Biſhops and chiefe Biſhops ſhalbe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
as at this day they be.</p>
               <p>I haue ſufficiently proued (me thinketh) by many examples
and paſſages of the old and new. Teſtament, that the Church
of God may erre, and hath erred indeede: which to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
ſeemeth vnpoſſible. Now will we reſolue a doubt: and
this it is: If the Church bee ſuch, and ſubiect to fall into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
ſuperſtitions, hereſies, and idolatries (as before we haue
proued) How ſhall that be vnderſtood which the ſcripture
ſaith:<note place="margin">How the church being the pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lar of truth may erre.</note> That the Church is the body of Ieſus Chriſt; That the
Church is the ſpouſe of Chriſt: That the Church is the pillar
of truth founded vppon the ſure foundation. That the Churche
is without ſpot or wrincle, and wholy faire: That the gates of
hell ſhall not preuaile againſt her, and other like commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and prayſes thereof the word of God witneſſeth? To
this may we anſwere that both the one, and the other may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well ſtand. For God neuer ſuffered all his Church to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
into Error: But rather hath alwayes reſerued ſome good
and ſome times alſo ſeauen thouſand. As ſaid he ſpeaking of
<hi>Elias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. kings 19. 18.</note> albeit in corners which neuer bowed the knees to <hi>Baal.</hi>
Such as theſe, the common error, diſpatched: wherewith
all the Church was generally deceaued, Againſt this Error,
ſuch others of theſe ſpake, preached and wrote: and moſt
times it coſt them their liues: and had each one of them had a
thouſand liues: a thouſand liues would each one of them
haue loſt for the ſame cauſe. That Church wherein Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19632:146"/>
and vniuerſally raigned that Errour, or hereſie: ſhee
and her Biſhoppes, did perſecute condemned and kill them.
As by examples wee haue confirmed the ſame. So that when
the ſcripture ſaith: All Iſrael, all Iuda, all the inhabitants of
Ieruſalem turned away from God, committed Idolatrie, &amp;c.
Of ſuch a manner ingenerall muſt wee vnderſtand, which
hath it Exceptions: for in the middeſt of theſe Errours, and
idolatries ſo Catholique, fo vniuerſall had alwayes God ſome
particular men, whom he reſerued cleane and pure from that
common errour. So reſerued God <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and
ſome other particular perſons alſo which worſhipped not the
calfe, when all Iſrael ingenerall, and <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt him
ſelfe, worſhipped it. The ſame will wee ſay of the time of the
Iudges, that God neuer forſoke his Church. The ſame wee
ſay alſo of the times of the kings of Iſrael, and of Iuda. When
all committed Idolatrie God rayſed vp an <hi>Eſaias,</hi> a <hi>Miche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
a <hi>Ieremias,</hi> an <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> a <hi>Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> Who reproued vices
and falſe Doctrine, and declared the truth. But which of theſe
did not the Church, and her high prieſts perſecute and kill. So
alſo reſerued the Lord vnro himſelfe at his firſt comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde. A Simeon, an Anna widdowe, a Ioſeph, and
his ſpouſe, the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> mother of our ſauiour. An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her ſonne Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt: which were
Godly, very well thought of the true religion, and agreed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Phariſies nor Sadduces nor Eſſees. And ſo the
Lord in ſo vnhappy times, preſerued his Church. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
vntill now hath he preſerued the ſame. And now alſo, in
theſe leſt miſerable times, wherein neither faith <hi>Luk.</hi> 18, 8. nor
loue is found <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 12. God reſerueth ſome which oppoſe
themſelues to the tyranny of the Antichriſt of Rome, and to the
common errour and Idolatrie of all the Romane Church inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.
And ſo God hath not permitted that his Church hath
wholly bene deceiued: nor according to his promiſe, <hi>I am with
you vnto the end of the world.</hi> Wil he euer permit the ſame. Euer
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath God reſerued fome that haue not bene deceiued with
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon errour: &amp; many from time to time be enlightened:
As by experience we haue ſeene it. God of his infinit mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
them, that the number of his choſen may be fulfilled, &amp;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19632:146"/>
ſo ſinne may ceaſe: and only Chriſt, without any competency
of Antichriſt, may reigne. So be it. Amen.</p>
               <p>I haue long dwelled vpon this fourth anſwere: for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo required: conſidering that many ſimple people, which
not otherwiſe haue heard, nor are able to vnderſtand how God
who loueth his Church, would permit her ſo long time to be
deceiued, at the leaſt, with ſuch a deceit of idolatrie, are in this
deceiued. And ſo they and the reſt ſhall ſee that, not to be the
truth, which our aduerſaries hold for for an oracle, that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church cannot erre. God open their eyes, that ſeeing, they
may ſee, and hearing they may heare: and ſo conuert and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only God is he which cannot erre,<note place="margin">Eſay. 53. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 22.</note> but doth euer right. But
only his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus is he which ſinned not, which erred
not,<note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 8.</note> neither was there any guile found in his mouth. Onely the
word of God abideth for euer. And as often as the Church (be
ſhe neuer ſo populous &amp; apparant) ſhall depart from this word
of God, and ſhall not hold it for her ſquire, rule, and patterne,
ſhe ſhall erre. And the more ſhe turneth away, the more ſhall
ſhe erre. But alwayes, when ſhe will be gouerned thereby, ſhe
ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and ſhall neuer erre. For the word of God

horrible fact it had committed, as it could not before either
vnderſtand, or auoyd it. It happened that the mother brought
her through ignorance, when we were ſacrificing (as much to
ſay as celebrating the ſupper of the Lord, which in memorie
of the ſacrifice, by the Lord once offered, was celebrated) but
the infant mingled with the Saints, vnable to abide our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

with the tokens and ſhewes, that the ignorant ſoule of her
age and ſimplicitie might, ſhee confeſſed the conſcience of

of Chriſt: the villaine began to cheare him, and ſaid vnto him:
that he would ſell him the merite, which he had gotten by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Maſſe, if the other would buy it: and demaunded for
a price of the Gentleman his coat (for know this, that among
the Papiſts one ſelleth his merits to another: as if there were
ſome that had done more thereof then hee ought, wherewith
he might do what he pleaſed.) The ſale made and paſſed, the
knight notwithſtanding went vp into the mountaine, and
made his prayers in the Church. And as he returned, he found
the villaine hanged vpon a tree, and neuer afterwards was
troubled with wicked temptations. Hitherto Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
If this were truth, who ought not to worſhip the
Maſſe? But either it was a lie: or if it ſo happened, it was
one of Sathans miracles, the more to blind the people with
the idolatrie of the Maſſe. Of ſuch miracles the Lord and his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19632:148"/>
Apoſtles do aduiſe vs to beware that we bee not deceiued by
them.<note place="margin">Two ſorts of miracles.</note> Manie other miracles they recount, but in anſwering
to theſe aforeſaid, we ſhall haue anſwered to all that they can
recken.</p>
               <p>And the better to anſwere this fift obiection, knowe we
that there are two ſortes of miracles, the one true, and the
other falſe. Thoſe that are true, are done by the power of
God, for confirmation of the truth, and the confuſion of
falſhood. Such were the miracles which God wrought by
the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the other Prophetes: Such bee
thoſe which Chriſt and his Apoſtles did. Comming then to
our purpoſe: I ſay that the miracles which God hath done in
the moſt holy ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, to
make vs vnderſtand that he inſtituted this ſacrament, and that
it was not humane inuention, he did them: And this did the
Lord for one of theſe two endes: The firſt is to expell the
wicked, impious, and vnworthy perſons from this ſo high a
Sacrament: for this end ſerued the miracle, which Saint
<hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaw, and we haue declared: and others alſo which the
ſame author reporteth. For what actuall ſinne had a ſucking
infant, witout anie diſcretion committed, in eating a ſoppe
moyſtened in the wine ſacrificed vnto idols? But did the
Lord, to make vs vnderſtand howe much thoſe men, which
vnworthily, and without any conſideration, receiue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Supper, doe diſpleaſe him: and that to them is it all one,
to ſitte at the table of the Lord, and to receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his bodie, and of his bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to ſit at the table
of the Diuell, and receiue the Diuell himſelfe. If God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed
by his iuſt Iudgement, a ſucking Babe: as Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
reporteth, for hauing participated of the table of the
Diuell, and of that of the Lord: how thinke wee, will hee
puniſh thoſe, that of ripe age and deliberate purpoſe do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of both tables? This young childe could not drinke
the cuppe of the Lord, hauing firſt drunke that of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
it could not bee partaker of the table of the Lorde,
and of the table of diuels. For the cuppe of the Lord is the
communion of the bloud of Chriſt: and the bread which
wee breake (in the Supper) is the Communion of the bodie
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19632:148"/>
of Chriſt. And what agreement hath Chriſt with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell?
This is not mine owne inuention, they are the words of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking for this purpoſe to the Corinthians. 1. Cor.
chap. 10. 15. So that we confeſſe, that God hath miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
many times chaſtened thoſe, which vnworthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the moſt holy ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt.
And the Apoſtle in the eleuenth chapter doth witneſſe the
ſame, when he ſaith: For which cauſe (as much to ſay, as for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vnworthily eaten) many amongſt you are ſicke and
weake, and many are aſleepe, that is to ſay, are dead. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
end that God pretendeth in the miracles which he doth
in the Supper, is touching good men. In the celebration of
this ſacrament hath God willed ſometimes to do miracles, to
illuſtrate the ſame, and to ſhew forth the excellencie and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
thereof: and the more therewith to confirme the faith of
the godly, that (the Lord hauing blowne away their ſinnes)
doe worthily receiue it. And not onely for confirmation of
the faithfull hath the Lord in the Sacrament wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles:
but alſo hath he done them in the celebration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
And ſo S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> when Chriſt was baptized, ſawe
the heauens open, and the holy Ghoſt viſibly deſcending in
the ſhape of a Doue. And this was, that the Baptiſt, as an eye
witneſſe, might teſtifie of Chriſt, and ſay: Behold the Lambe
of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> which taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde. Such
miracles then admit wee, that for confirmation of our faith
are done hy the power of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſorte of miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are done by the arte of the
Diuell,<note place="margin">Falſe miracles.</note> to deciue men, and to cauſe them not to beleeue
the true, but the falſe doctrine: ſuch miracles call wee falſe
for one of theſe two cauſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, in regard of the Authour the Diuell, who is a
lyar, and the father of lyes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond becauſe ſuch miracles deceiue them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

<hi>Pharaoh</hi> worke wonders, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did. Of ſuch miracles
the Lord forewarneth vs: There ſhall ariſe vp (ſaith he) falſe
Chriſtes, and falſe prophetes, and ſhall ſhewe great ſignes

miracles of the Sorcerers of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Such bee the miracles
which <hi>Damaſcen</hi> reporteth of the dead mans ſcull, and of the
ſoule of <hi>Traian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sermone de defunctis.</note> and of the ſoule of <hi>Falconilla,</hi> that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and in hell, were ſaued. Of theſe miracles of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi>
we will ſpeake afterwards. Such may we thinke was
the miracle of the Maſſe by vs recited of <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond. In
concluſion all miracles which bee to confirme a thing that is
contrarie to the word of God, be falſe, and done by the arte
of the diuell. Againſt the word of God is it, that the ſoules by
the iuſt iudgement of God condemned and buried in hell,
ſhould go out thence and be ſaued. Againſt the word of God
is it, to beleeue there is any other Purgatorie then the bloud of
Chriſt. <hi>Ireneus,</hi> a moſt ancient Doctor, telleth that a certain man
called <hi>Marke,</hi> a great deceiuer, and heretike, with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Euchariſt did ſtrangely deceiue the ſimple. For
he ſo changed the colour of the wine, that nothing but bloud
appeared: and by his inchantments ſo greatly increaſed a
little of the wine, that it filled the cuppe, and alſo ranne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
And another cuppe greater and more capable being
brought: the ſelfe ſame, without adding more liquor, did fill
it vp to the top. Shall we beleeue his hereſie, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it with miracles? Surely no. A commandement haue
we, that if an Angell from heauen ſhall teach vs another Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
another doctrine, another faith then that which Ieſus
Chriſt and his Apoſtles haue taught vs, wbich they haue left
vs, written in the olde and new teſtament; that although hee
confirme it with many miracles, as did this <hi>Marke,</hi> and the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> we ſhould not beleeue him. Of this <hi>Marke</hi>
maketh Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> mention, and citeth <hi>Ireneus</hi> for his author.

If we reade the hiſtories of the Gentiles, we ſhall find that
they ſhew many and very ſtrange miracles: in them ſhall wee
find, that there ran riuers of bloud, that bloud flowed from the
thumbe of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> reporteth, that it rained fleſh in Rome. <hi>Quintus
Curtius</hi> ſaith, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> beſieged Tyre, the bread
commonly did ſweat bloud. And other infinit miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
their idol worſhip, may the Gentils alleage: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
theſe miracles, their idoll worſhip is wicked &amp; deteſtable.
And ſuch be the miracles which our aduerſaries recount to
confirme their Maſſe: their tranſubſtantiation, their idolatrie,
wrought by arte of the diuell to confirme falſe doctrin, deceiue
the ſimple, and if it were poſſible, the verie elect.</p>
               <p>The ſixt reaſon wherewith they confirme their Maſſe,<note place="margin">The ſixt reaſon and the anſwer</note> is: to
ſay that in the Maſſe are many good things, taken out of the
holy ſcripture: as are the Epiſtle, the Goſpell, the <hi>Hoc eſt corpus
meum, &amp;c.</hi> To this obiection we may anſwere: That ſuppoſe,
that in the Maſſe there bee ſome good things taken out of the
holy ſcripture: it followeth not therfore that the Maſſe is good:
for ſo ſhould ſorceries, witchcrafts, and inchantments be very
good. For in them the name of God, the name of the Father,
of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt is very often named. And
no ſorcerie, witcherie, or inchantment is there, wherin theſe
names with many epithites and properties are not named. And
the witches (that theſe names may haue the more efficacy) doe
name them in tongues, which they themſelues vnderſtand not:
in Hebrue, Greeke, and Latine. All goeth backward, wherein
our aduerſaries do imitate the witches. For all the Maſſe almoſt
they ſay in Latine, mingling with it ſome Greeke words, as <hi>Ky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie-eleyſon,
Chriſte-eleyſon:</hi> He brue do they alſo mingle with it,
as <hi>Sabaoth, Hoſanna, Alleluia.</hi> But Chriſt when hee celebrated
his ſupper, all whatſoeuer he ſpake, in the vulgar tongue did he
ſpeake it, that all the Apoſtles, ſimple men, might vnderſtand,
and ſpeake the ſame. From hence we conclude, that it ſufficeth
not that the Maſſe, becauſe it hath ſome good thinges in it,
ſhould therefore be holy and good, how much more good then
this there is in the Maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſo corrupted and endomaged with
ſuperſtition and idolatrie, that it can do no good, but much euil.

and chiefly that which our aduerſaries themſelues, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
to be moſt holy; and of the Maſſe, the holineſſe it ſelfe,
which is, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum.</hi> For now (ſay I) they apply it not
to the purpoſe, that Chriſt ſayd. So contrarie, ſay they it, to the
inſtitution of Chriſt, and in a ſtrange tongue, which the people
vnderſtand not, that it infecteth him that heareth it. And if
you beleeue their <hi>Hoc eſt corpus me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into a terrible hereſie ſhall yee fall: As a little beneath, when
we ſhall ſpeake of the fourth domage of the Maſſe we will
declare. That which our aduerſaries conclude, that the Maſſe
is good, becauſe many good things be in it, euidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by that we haue ſaid, to be falſe.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth reaſon wherewith they maintaine their maſſe
is,<note place="margin">The 7. reaſon &amp; the anſwer.</note> that the ſacrifice of the Maſſe was figured in the ſacrifice,
which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> made, who being Prieſt of the moſt
high God, offered vnto God bread and wine. They ſay alſo
that <hi>Malachy</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 11. ſpeaketh thereof, as wee haue
before alleaged. Concerning that which they ſay of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi>
it ſhall bee needfull that they reade and conſider the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie,
as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſetteth it downe. Whereof the Apoſtle maketh
mention, and applyeth it to Chriſt, whoſe figure (ſaith hee)
<hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was.<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth that <hi>Abraham</hi> returning
from that notable victorie,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 1. &amp;c.</note> which againſt foure kings, God
had giuen him. <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> king of Salem, brought forth
bread and wine: he ſaith that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was Prieſt of the
high God. Our Aduerſaries hearing that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a
prieſt, and that he offered bread and wine: from hence they
conclude, that this bread and wine he offered in ſacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and that this was a figure of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19632:150"/>
Whereunto we anſwere: that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> offered not bread
nor wine vnto God: but brought it forth, or to ſpeake better,
cauſed it to be brought forth: for this is the force of the word
which <hi>Moſes</hi> here vſeth: which very well agreeth with our
Spaniſh maner of ſpeaking: Hee brought forth, or cauſed to
be brought forth bread and wine. If you will aske me why
made he bread and wine to bee brought forth? I will tell you,
to refreſh <hi>Abraham</hi> and his people, that came wearied from
the ſlaughter, and hungry in the way which he made. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that which I ſay, I will content my ſelfe to alleage
Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and Saint <hi>Ierome.</hi> Thus then ſaith Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
vpon the ſeuenth chapter to the Hebrues. No new thing
ſhould it be, if <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> went out to meet <hi>Abraham</hi> the
Conqueror, &amp; brought him bread and wine for the refreſhing
as well of him, as his fellow ſouldiers. The ſame, word for word
ſaith Saint <hi>Ierome.</hi>

What agreement then hath the bread and wine of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi>
with the accidents I ſay, Becauſe they denie any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the bread and wine in the Maſſe.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle, was the figure of Chriſt: and ſheweth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
but hee maketh at all no mention of the ſacrifice of
bread, nor of wine: for in this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was not the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Melchiſedech in three things was the figure of Chriſt.</note> ſith neither the one nor the other offered the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acrifice of bread and wine. In three things (if we note well,
that which the Apoſtle ſaith,) ſhall wee finde that <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi>
was the figure of Chriſt: the firſt, in that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>
was a king,<note place="margin">Heb 7.</note> and not after a ſort, but King of Righteoufneſſe
and Peace: in this was he the figure of Chriſt, who onely is
the true King of righteouſneſſe and peace. The ſecond is,
that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a Prieſt, not as the Leuiticall prieſts,
which being mortall, one died, and another ſucceded him:
but <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was eternall: and therefore his ſacrifice was
eternall: as of him the Apoſtle thus ſpeaking, doth ſay:
Without father, without mother, without kindred, which
neither hath beginning of dayes nor end of life: But is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto the Sonne of God, and doth continue a prieſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19632:151"/>
for euer. You ſee here, how <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking with his Lord the
Meſſiah, which is Chriſt: ſaith vnto him, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 4.</note> Pſalm. 110. 4. As much to
ſay, as in that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was thy figure and likeneſſe. As
<hi>Mechiſedech</hi> (in that he was a figure of Chriſt) was an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Prieſt, ſo thou alſo the Meſſiah, art the ſame. That which
the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was without father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mother, is to be vnderſtood, inſomuch as he was the figure
of Chriſt: for otherwiſe had he father and mother: and ſo think
ſome that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was <hi>Sem.</hi> The Prieſts after the order
of <hi>Aaron</hi> were mortall, and none of them continued for euer:
but he of the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> is immortall and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Of the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> were there many: but of the order
of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was there but onely one, the ſame Meſſiah our
redeemer and Lord: who in that he is the eternall ſon of God,
hath no mother: &amp; in that he is man, borne in this world, when
the fulneſſe of time was come, hath no father: and as hee is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
ſo ſhall his prieſthood be eternall. Euery day ſing they
in their euenſongs,<note place="margin">psſalm. 110. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Iurauit Dominus, &amp; non poenitebit eum. Tu et
Sacerdos in aeternum ſecundum ordinem Melchiſedech.</hi> But I call
their owne conſciences to witneſſe that dayly ſing it, if they
vnderſtand that which euery day they ſing. Of this order of
<hi>Melchiſedech</hi> expect no other prieſts then Chriſt. But Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
is he that ſhall ſo terme himſelfe to be (as he ſaith) the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
of Chriſt. Hee, and all his ſhavelings and fatlings will ſay
themſelues to be Prieſtes after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> and
not after the order of <hi>Aaron.</hi> But ſo are they not after the order
of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſith there is no more but one, which is Chriſt:
as little are they after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſeeing with the death
of Chriſt ceaſed the Leuiticall prieſthood. What prieſts then be
the Papiſts? After the order of <hi>Baal:</hi> and ſo they be enemies of
God, and of his Prophets, which preach againſt idolatrie.</p>
               <p>The third thing that the Apoſtle noteth, wherein <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi>
was the figure of Chriſt, is: that <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his prieſthood, was much more excellent than <hi>Abraham:</hi>
and ſo, as the greater, bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf
acknowledging this maioritie and ſuperioritie, gaue vnto him
the tithes of the ſpoyles. Such a one truly is Chriſt, vpon whom
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19632:151"/>
the redemption, righteouſneſſe, &amp; ſanctification, not of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
only, but of all the faithful alſo, doe depend. Here ſee you
the things, wherin (may we beleeue the Apoſtle, a veſſell of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection)
<hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was the figure of Chriſt, No mention at
all maketh he, of the ſacrifice of bread nor of wine; which we
doubt the Apoſtle would haue done, had <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> in this
bene a figure of Chriſt. The place which they cite of <hi>Malachy,</hi>
ſaith thus: For from the riſing of the ſun, vntill the going downe
of the ſame, my name (is great among the Gentiles. And in
euery place ſhalbe offered to my name pure incenſe, and
<hi>Myrrach</hi> (which we tranſlate, preſent or guift) The common
edition, wherunto our aduerſaries giue more credit, then to the
Ebrew text, tranſlateth: <hi>Et in omni loco ſacrificatur &amp; offertur no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
meo oblatio munda.</hi> To wit: And in euery place is ſacrificed
and offered to my name, a cleane offering. Here hence they
conclude: that this cleane offering which in euery place, is
ſacrificed, and offered is the ſacrifice of the maſſe. But the
Maſſe, being a profanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy ſupper (as before we haue
proued) it cannot be a preſent, nor offering, which is offered to
God; nor acceptable to him: whereof it followeth, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
and preſent. Of which ſpeaketh <hi>Malachy</hi> is another thing
farre different from the Maſſe: It is (ſay I) the ſacrifice, not
expiatory, but Euchariſtical, of prayſe and thankſgiuing, which
the faithful euery day, and moment, doe offer to God As before
wee haue ſaid, in the one hundred forty one Pſal. and 2. verſe.
The Prophet vſeth theſe two very names which we tranſlate
Incence and offering. The which place, none vnderſtand of
the Maſſe: becauſe the Prophet ſaith. An euening ſacrifice; But
their Maſſe is ſaid in the morning.</p>
               <p>It is no new thing with God, when his people, his prieſts and
princes, prouoked him with their ſuperſtitions; and Idolatries,
to threaten them, that he would forſake them: that he would
nought eſteeme them: that he would take vnto himſelfe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The prophets when they will ſpeake of the calling of the

they exhort them, by the ceremonies of the lawe: And
in ſtead of ſaying, that all the people ſhould turne vnto God,
They ſay: That they ſhall goe vp to Ieruſalem. In ſtead of

Ieſus Chriſt hath made vppon the Croſſe, of his body and of
his blood for remiſſion of our ſinnes, to reconcile vs with God
and to obtayne for vs life eternall: hee hath ordayned the
Prieſtes, which be ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles: to conſecrate

and to obtaine all that is neceſſarie for vs, both in body &amp; ſoule.
And what greater good then this (ſay they) can be? This ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

as much worth is the maſſe, as is the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt.
Alſo that he which heareth it waxeth not old, whilſt he heareth

away, and not ſuffered them to be printed: in this yet doe
they ſhew their ignorance that for ſo many yeares, they haue

they ſuch things more, to be printed. We ſay then, that the

As after we ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p>Now that we haue anſwered to the reaſons wherewith our

prouoke laughter, then deuotion. Theſe ſeuen domages wee
proue by the ſame order, as we propounded them. And that the
maſſe derogateth from the paſſion of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The 1. domage.</note> is clerely ſene. For
the Maſſe which for this cauſe was ordayned, that a hundred

death of Chriſt, when he ſhall ſee a new redemption in the
Maſſe? Who will beleeue his ſins to be pardoned by the death
&amp; paſſion of Chriſt, when he ſhal ſee a new remiſſion of ſins in

due to God.<note place="margin">The 2. domage. Rom 10. 4.</note> For in him only we beleeue, how ſaith S. <hi>Paule

preſuppoſeth faith, &amp; ſuch a faith as is founded vpon the
word of God, the Nicen creed, they ſing in their Maſſe, which
beginneth <hi>Credo in vnum Deum.</hi> I beleeue in one only God. If
in one only God we ought to beleeue, one only God ought we
to inuocate: The which inuocation being done in faith, God
promiſeth that he will heare it. Whoſoeuer ſhall call vpon the
name of the Lord (ſaith <hi>Ioel</hi>) ſhall eſcape &amp;c,<note place="margin">Ioel 2. 23.</note> As S. <hi>Paule</hi> Rom.
10. 13. and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> Acts 2. 21. doe interpret it, ſhalbee
ſaued. Alſo that only God ought to be inuocated, is by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
proued. Sacrifice is only due to the true God (this our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
will not deny) inuocation is a ſacrifice. As ſaith the
Pſal, 50. 14. <hi>Sacrifice vnto me praiſe:</hi> or as ſaith the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>The ſacrifice of praiſe:</hi> The ſacrifice of praiſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Apoſtle Hebr. 13. 15. and <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 3, that we ſhal
offer to God. Therefore Inuocation, ſith it is a ſacrifice to God
onely, ought it to bee offered. But our aduerſaries forſaking
the fountaine of liuing waters, haue digged them broken ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes
which can holde no water.<note place="margin">Ieremy 2. 13.</note> They leaue to call vppon
God, and inuocate the Saints. And Saints ſometime alſo,
that it is not knowne who they bee; and ſome of them, it
may bee, that are burning in hell. An example haue we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in the prayer of S. <hi>Roccus,</hi> which togither with the Crowne
of our Lady in the 1581 yeare was printed in the houſe of <hi>Iohn
Gutierres</hi> in Siuell. The praier ſaith thus God which to the
bleſſed <hi>Roccus</hi> diddeſt promiſe a table which an Angel caried
that hee which ſhall pittiouſly inuocate him, may not bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with the affliction of the peſtilence, &amp;c. This prayer
of <hi>Roccus,</hi> I put for example, becauſe it came firſt to hand.
Many other examples may bee drawne from their Maſſes.
For what doe they in all their prayers, which they make to
the Saintes: but call vppon them, requeſting them to doe this
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:19632:154"/>
or that? There is no commandement either in the olde or newe
Teſtament, wherein God commandeth vs to call vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then himſelfe. <hi>Call vpon me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in the day of trouble,
and I will heare thee, and thou ſhalt honor me.</hi> He neuer ſaith, Call
vpon ſuch, or ſuch an Angel, vpon this or that other Saint, vpon
<hi>Abraham, Samuel, Dauid, Eſay, &amp;c.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, when his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
beſought him to teach them to pray, did not command
them to call vpon his mother, vpon ſuch or ſuch a Saint: but
he commaunded them to call vpon God: and of him ſhould
they demaund whatſoeuer they had need of, as well for the
body as the ſoule. All which is contained in the prayer that he
taught them, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> And as there is no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to call vpon any other, then vpon God: So is there no
example of any the faithfull, either in the old or newe teſtament
that hath called vpon any other then God alone. Secure wee
are of the infinite goodneſſe, loue, and power of God. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
we are, that whereſoeuer wee ſhall be, albeit in the belly
of the whale, or in the fierie furnace, and ſhall call vpon him,
he heareth vs. But of the Saints will we not ſay ſo much, whoſe
goodneſſe, charitie and power is limitted, and communicated
of that infinite. Only God is infinite, and ſo is in euerie place.
The Saints be finite, and therefore cannot be in euerie place, &amp;
ſo can neither heare nor ſee our miſeries and neceſſities. And
ſeeing we intreat of inuocation, reaſon would wee ſhould ſay
ſomething of prayer,<note place="margin">prayer.</note> becauſe inuocation is ſo commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Prayer is a certaine familiar conference &amp; diſcourſe, which
the faithfull ſoule hath with her God: wherein ſhe ſheweth all
her neceſſities: that he is as a Lord, may not only beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
alſo as a father may prouide for them, and beleeueth that his
Maieſtie will ſo do, and ſo he doth the ſame. Prayer is a lifting
vp of the ſoule vnto God. Prayer is a ladder, by the which, the
ſoule mounteth from this vale of teares, from this gulfe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
and pierceth all the heauens, and ſtayeth not vntill it
preſent it ſelfe before God, and propoſe vnto him all her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
beleeuing as a good father, that he will prouide for
them. This Ladder of Prayer hath foure ſtages.</p>

               <p>Man of his owne nature and condition is ſo euill of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſo haughty and proud, that did not neceſſitie conſtraine
him, hee would neuer ſubiect himſelfe to God, nor yet call
vppon him. For this cauſe ſayd <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 119. verſe 71. <hi>It
is good for me that thou haſt humbled</hi> (or caſt <hi>me</hi> downe) and a
little before hee had ſayd, <hi>Before I was humbled</hi> (or abaſed) <hi>I
went aſtray.</hi> The good which <hi>Dauid</hi> drewe of this de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ection,
and euery Chriſtian ought to drawe the ſame, is that hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himſefe before God, and called vpon him. The Saints
ſeeing themſelues oppreſſed with afflictions and ſorrowes, doe
acknowledge their offences, and call vpon God. So did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
when he ſaid,<note place="margin">pſal. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>When I was in trouble I called vpon the Lord,
and he heard me.</hi> But when the wicked be afflicted, they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
againſt God, and diſpaire. This is a marke by which
the children of God doe differ from thoſe which bee not his.
The ſecond ſtage is, that God commaundeth vs to call vpon
him, <hi>Call vpon me in the time of tribul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion,</hi> Pfal. 50. 15. The third
ſtage is, That the Promiſe doth make vs aſſured to bee heard.
And ſo when God commaundeth <hi>Dauid</hi> to call vpon him, hee
promiſeth that he will deliuer him: and addeth, that when the
afflicted calleth vpon God, hee doth him great ſeruice, <hi>And
thou ſhalt honour me</hi> ſaith he. Alſo Pſal. 91. verſ. 15. hee ſaith:
<hi>He ſhall call vpon me,</hi> and then promiſeth, <hi>and I vvill heare him:
I vvill be vvith him in trouble, I vvill deliuer him, and glorifie him.</hi>
In diuerſe places doth the holy Scripture promiſe,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 23.</note> that hee
which ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 21.</note> ſhall bee ſaued:
but in no place doth it promiſe ayde,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13.</note> ſuccour or ſaluation to
him that ſhall call vpon any other (be hee neuer ſo holy) then
God. The fourth ſtage is, Faith obtaineth that which is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for. Whatſoeuer ye deſire when yee pray (Chriſt ſayth,
Mark. 11. 24.) beleeue that ye ſhall haue it, and it ſhall bee
done vnto you. This faith had <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 4. 4. when hee ſayd,
<hi>The Lord will heare me when I call vpon him.</hi> The eleuenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues confirmeth this with many
examples. Reade this whole chapter, for therein is liuely ſet
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:19632:155"/>
forth the power and efficacie of fayth without the which (ſaith
he) it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. If the heart bee not ſincere,
ſimple,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 17.</note> and pure, albeit one crie vnto God, he will not heare
him: as he heard not <hi>Eſau,</hi> albeit he prayed with teares: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard he <hi>Saul,</hi> nor many others of a double heart: and to
make the heart perfect, only faith ſufficeth: Faith then is that
which obtaineth that which we pray for. The commandement
which commandeth vs to pray is of God, and not of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The promiſe which maketh vs aſſured to be heard, God,
&amp; not the creatures, maketh. The faith that obtaines that which
is prayed for, is faith in God, and not in the creatures. Hereupon
&amp; with great reaſon, will we conclude, that this ladder of prayer
which hath ſuch ſtages, bringeth vs not to the creatures, but to
the creator, to only God omnipotent. Him only let vs worſhip,
him only let vs call vpon, to him onely let vs pray: for ſo doing,
ſure we are we ſhall not be confounded. He grant vs the grace
that we may truly feele our neceſſitie and miſerie, and feeling
it, may call vpon him, being aſſured, that for his goodneſſe &amp;
promiſe ſake, and for the ſacrifice wherewith his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſonne reconciled vs to him, he will heare vs.</p>
               <p>There is no Maſſe which is not full of interceſſions of Saints,<note place="margin">The third Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</note>
and the Prieſt alſo which ſaith it, preſumeth to be a mediatour
and interceſſour with God, that he may pardon the ſinnes of
thoſe, for whom he ſaith his Maſſe, be they quicke or dead. And
not for men onely intreateth hee, but alſo for Chriſt himſelfe,
praying the Father to receiue and accept him, as hee accepted
the ſcacrifice of <hi>Abel, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Whereof
we will entreat in the fourth domage which the Maſſe worketh.
Yet is there no other mediator but Ieſus Chriſt alone. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is this: for he that is to be a Mediator, muſt be in hand with
both parties, between who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is made a mediator, for if he be in
hatred, or is not welbeloued with one of the parties, he ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
preuaile: for ſuſpected ſhal he euer be holden. For this cauſe
was it meere that man hauing offended God, and being to
be reconciled with God, it was needfull (I ſay) that the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilour,
Interceſſour, aduocate and mediator, ſhould bee verie
God and very man: for had hee bene onely man, hee ſhould
haue bene a ſinner; conceiued and borne in ſinne, and ſo
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:19632:155"/>
ſhould hue nought preuailed with God. And had hee bene
God, and not man, hee could not by dying haue ſatisfied the
iuſtice of God (as dyed our Mediatour and Interceſſour Chriſt,
and dying, ſatisfied and payd all whatſoeuer man ought to the
iuſtice of God) Like as ſinne for being committed againſt the
infinite God, was infinite: ſo was it meete, that the wages of
that ſinne, ſhould be infinite: and ſo the infinite God and man
Chriſt, perfourmed the ſame. No other interceſſour, nor medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
is there to obtaine of the Father pardon of ſinnes, but
Chriſt alone: for as there is but one God: ſo is there but one
Mediatour betweene God and man,<note place="margin">Tim. 2. 5.</note> the man Chriſt Ieſus: as
ſayth Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> He onely is the Mediatour of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
as in many places of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6. &amp; 9. 15 &amp; 12. 24.</note> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doth witneſſe. The ſame which we ſaid of inuocation, ſay
we alſo now: that there is no commandement of God, which
commandeth to put the dead Saints for interceſſours: neither
is there any example in the olde or newe Teſtament, that anie
of the faithfull hath put them for interceſſors. To ſeeke bread
beyond wheate may we not goe: for better bread then that of
wheate cannot be. Wee may not leaue a certaintie for a thing
vncertain. Aſſured we are by the word of God, that Ieſus Chriſt
is our Interceſſour: that the Saints are the ſame wee ſee not by
holy Scripture: and it not appearing vnto vs, yet (doubting
without faith) will we put them for interceſſours. And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
proceedeth not of faith is ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> as ſaith S. Paul to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
And writing to the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> he ſaith: <hi>Without faith it is
impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Whereupon we conclude then: that
Chriſt onely wee ought to put for our interceſſour: and that
the Maſſe doteth in putting for interceſſour another beſides
Chriſt, to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, and not Chriſt onely
in dying was our Mediatour. But now alſo is he the ſame: as
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his catholike Epiſtle, ſaith: <hi>Little children, theſe
thinges haue I written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that yee ſinne not: And if anie man ſin,
we haue an aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Saint Iohn ſaith not, we haue aduocates but an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> Had there bene more Aduocates then one, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
would doubtleſſe haue ſayd, <hi>We haue Aduocates,</hi> and would
haue named them. But as hee certainely knew, that there was
but onely one Aduocate, he ſayd, <hi>We haue an Aduocate,</hi> and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:19632:156"/>
nameth him, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and addeth, <hi>The righteous:</hi> By
which tytle all other men he excludeth: all which (none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
of their owne nature are the children of wrath; conceyued
and hardened in ſinne, in the belly of their mothers: as, that
holie Prophet king <hi>Dauid</hi> witneſſeth.<note place="margin">pſal. 51.</note> This doctrine ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and full of conſolation, that Ieſus Chriſt, now is, and

obſcured and for many yeares buried it in the church. Who
was he that ſeeing himſelfe in neceſſity and miſery would

with his father? Some ran to one he or ſhe Saint, others to other:
according to their zeale &amp; according to their fooliſh deuotion
and ſometimes put they thoſe for Interceſſors, whoſe ſoules
were burning in hell. With the Popes is it no new thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannonize
theſe whom other Popes haue canonized for Saints:
For example. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. that diſcannonized <hi>Hermanus
Ferrarienſis,</hi> comaunding him after he had 30 yeeres beene
buried, to be vntombed and burned; during all which time he
had bin holden for a Saint &amp; was inuocated of al, contrariwiſe a
Pope hath bin which cannonized him for a Saint, whom others
condemned for an heretike. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> and Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

in theſe latter times, to ſhew vs ſo great mercie, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new

of conſolation: the which in the time of darkeneſſe, of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and ſuperſtition was dead (as it were) and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
Here will I briefly recite a chaunce, that vpon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
happened. It is now thirty ſixe yeares paſt, that one confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with a graduate, with a maiſter in Iſraell: among other
things, ſayd vnto him: that Ieſus Chriſt was now alſo our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate.
The maiſter wondred at that which was ſaid, it ſeeming
to him to be new doctrine, for that neuer ſuch had he heard or
read. The other ſeeing him wonder, wondred at his wonder,
and for confirmation of that he had ſayd, alleaged vnto him
the place of S. <hi>Iohn, We haue an aduocate with the father Ieſus
Chriſt. &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth this doctrin, Rom. 8. 34. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Chriſt, he ſaith: <hi>Who is at the right hand of God, &amp; maketh
requeſt</hi> (or interceſſion) <hi>for vs.</hi> And Heb. 7. 25. <hi>Wherefore hee is
able alſo euerlaſtingly to ſaue them that come vnto God by him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he euer liueth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Well beleeued this
Maiſter that the Saints were Aduocates: but that Ieſus Chriſt
was the ſame, he neither beleeued, nor knewe. If he being a
Maiſter in Iſrael, was ignorant of this what ſhall wee wonder
if the ignorant people know it not? What ſhall we maruell if
ſilly old women do not knowe it? That which I ſay: that there
is no other interceſſour but Chriſt, I meane it as touching the
obtaining of remiſſion of ſinnes: for otherwiſe one may and
ought to pray to God for another. And ſo <hi>S. Paul</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelfe to the prayers of thoſe to whom hee wrote, that
they ſhould pray to God for him. And the ſame Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
God for them. Should the Prieſt ſay, that in ſaying his
Maſſe, he ſo prayed to God, as the Apoſtle prayed for them to
whom he wrote: ſuch a prayer (were it done in faith) ſhould be
good. But to preſume to be an interceſſour, and to ſell his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for as much vertue and efficacie, as the death and paſſion of
Chriſt it ſelfe. This is intollerable &amp; ouermuch pride. Let them
begin to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; to giue glory to God, who only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth
ſins, &amp; this doth he by the only interceſſion of Chriſt, &amp;
by the vertue of that only ſacrifice, which he once, &amp; no more
offred to his father.</p>
               <p>The fourth domage, which we ſay the Maſſe worketh, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:19632:157"/>
this paſſeth and ought no way to be ſupportted.<note place="margin">The prieſt which ſaith the Maſſe, and the people which heare it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatrie.</note> That is, the
Prieſt which ſayeth it, and the People that heare it commit
Idolatry. How great a ſinne is Idolatry and how much more
God abhorreth it then any other, we haue already declared
in our firſt Treatiſe. The Prieſt ordayned for the Maſſe (ſay
our Aduerſaries) hath authoritie and power from Chriſt and
his vicar the Pope,<note place="margin">The authority of the popiſh Prieſt.</note> that in ſaying the words of conſecration (as
they call them) <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum</hi> (ſo that hee ſay them
<hi>ſuper debitam materiam,</hi> ouer a competent matter, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to conſecrate) he changeth, conuerteth, transformeth
and tranſubſtantiateth (this laſt word is it that beſt pleaſeth
them) the bread into the body of Chriſt, and the wine into his
bloud. In ſuch ſort, that be the Prieſt what ye will, liue hee a
letcher in mortall ſinne (as the moſt part of them do) be he the
greateſt and moſt infamous villaine of the world, yet for al this,
ſay they, that this authoritie he hath, to bring Chriſt from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
in finiſhing the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and to put
him into the place where the bread and wine were: ſo that no
more bread, nor no more wine remaine (for the ſubſtance of
the bread and of the wine is vaniſhed and gone to nought)
but the body and bloud of Chriſt: the which is there trulie,
really, corporally, and carnally (theſe be their proper termes)
as bigge, and as great, as corpulent, and as large, as hee
was vpon the croſſe, when hee dyed for vs ſinners. This is
their doctrine. And becauſe we beleeue not theſe ſtraunge
things which be contrarie to the word of God, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to that which the ancient Doctors haue taught (as we will
prooue it) they condemne vs for heretikes, they perſecute vs
moſt cruelly with fire and bloud, worſe then were wee Iewes
or Turkes. But another more ſtrong then they, to their griefe,
hath defended, doth defend, and will defend vs from them.
Who liſteth to know more of the roote of this doctrine, let
him reade their new Councels, wherein the Popes by their
Legats tyrannically haue gouerned. Let him reade their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
Decretals, Sextos, Clementines, and Extrauagants,
there ſhall hee find it at fall. Let him not reade the Scripture
for in it ſhall hee finde nothing at all to confirme ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.<note place="margin">Scotus ſuper 4. ſent.</note>
                  <hi>Scotus,</hi> one of the chiefe and principall pillers of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:19632:157"/>
their Church ſayth; That albeyt the prieſt were not attyred to

ſhould ſaye the fiue wordes or the foure, leauing out <hi>(Enim)</hi>
ouer all the bread that is in the market or in the Pantry: and
ouer all the wyne that is in the Sellar; how much bread ſo euer
ſhould be in the pantrie or in the market, ſo that he had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

tranſubſtantiated into the body of Ieſus Chriſt: and all the wine
of the ſellar by the vertue of the wordes ſpoken and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Prieſt, ſhould be conuerted into the bloud of Chriſt.
Herehence it commeth that no bread, but the body of Chriſt
remayning in the ſacrament in their <hi>Sagrarios</hi> or pixes do they
keepe it, that when anie ſhall be ſicke, they may with torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
carie it in proceſſion, that the diſeaſed may adore and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it, for the ſaluation of his ſoule. Ieſus Chriſt (ſay they)
is in ſort as we haue ſaid, not onely in one Maſſe, but in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand more alſo, if ſo many could bee ſaid in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And whole Chriſt is not in all the Hoſt only: but alſo in
euery ſmall parcell, how little ſoeuer it be: ſo that Chriſt is in
the hoſt as the ſoule is in the body: all in all, and all in euery
part thereof.</p>
               <p>This their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation they confirme,<note place="margin">Three reaſons wherewith they confirm Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</note>
firſt with the omnipotencie of God: that ſeeing God of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could create ſomething, the heauen and the earth, and
whatſoeuer is therein contained, how much more can he cauſe
one thing to be conuerted and tranſubſtantiated into another.
2. They ſay: that ſeeing Ieſus Chriſt is the infallible truth, it
is meete that that which he ſaith muſt be in ſort as hee ſpake
it: and ſith he ſaith, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> This is my body: they
now inferre, that the bread is no bread, but the body of Chriſt.
3. For confirmation of their opinion, they alſo alleage the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Doctors. In anſwering to theſe three reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they confirme their Tranſubſtantiation, me ſeemeth wee
ſhall haue anſwered to all, whatſoeuer in this matter they can
obiect vnto vs.<note place="margin">The anſwere to the firſt reaſon wherwith they confirme tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That which they ſay of the omnipotency of God, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that we ſhould once denie: we confeſſe it: and it may be,
and alſo (without may be) much better then they. With all our
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:19632:158"/>
heart we do alſo confeſſe that which the Creed ſaith, <hi>I beleeue
in God the Father almightie</hi> (all ſufficient) that which we ſay, is,
that from the power to the deede, is no good maner of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
God in that he is omnipotent, may eftſoones drowne
the world, as he did drowne it in the time of <hi>Noah:</hi> and the
malice of our times is no leſſe, but much more then that of
that time. Notwithſtanding his omnipotencie, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
our extreme malice, we know that he will not drown
it, becauſe ſo promiſed he to <hi>Noah,</hi> when he ſayd, <hi>My couenant
will I eſtabliſh witb you, that from henceforth all fleſh ſhal not be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out by the waters of the floud, &amp;c.</hi> And to ſeale and confirme
this promiſe, God gaue him the Bow in the cloudes, for a
ſigne of this couenant, &amp;c. Reade the hiſtorie. To this ſame
purpoſe is it ſayd in the Pſalm. 140. 9. that God ſet a bound
for the waters, ouer which they ſhal not paſſe, nor turne againe
to couer the earth. And God ſpeaking to <hi>Iob</hi> concerning the
ſea, chap. 38. 10. ſaith, I eſtabliſhed my commaundement
vpon it, and ſet barres and doores: and ſaid: Hitherto ſhalt
thou come, but no further, and there ſhall it ſtay thy proud
waues. Here you ſee, that albeit God of his abſolute power
can drowne the whole world againe, yet will hee not drowne
it. So then ſay we now, that Chriſt could doe that which they
ſay, annihilate the ſubſtance of the bread, and be tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into it. But we ſay, that he will not do it: becauſe he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ſitting at the right hand of his father in heauen, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his humanitie, according to his fleſh which he tooke
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> according to the fleſh wherein he dyed,
wiil he neuer deſcend hither, vntill he come to iudge the quick
and the dead. And ſo to this end ſayd he to his diſciples: <hi>The
poore ye ſhall haue alwayes with you, but me ſhall ye not haue alwayes.</hi>
For fortie dayes paſſed after his reſurrection hee aſcended into
heauen, &amp; ſitteth at the right hand of the Father, &amp;c. Very well
did his Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> vnderſtand this, when in a ſermon
which he preached at Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note> hee ſayd: <hi>Whom</hi> (meaning
Chriſt) <hi>the heauens muſt containe vntill the time that all things bee
reſtored.</hi> And this is an Article of our faith, which in the
Creed we confeſſe. That Ieſus Chriſt is aſcended into heauen,
and ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father, from whence
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:19632:158"/>
ſhall come to iudge the quicke and the dead.<note place="margin">The hereſie of the Papiſts.</note> Then will he
not come to tranſubſtantiate the bread into his body. So our
aduerſaries be heretikes, denying in deed this article of faith,
which with their mouth they confeſſe in the Creed. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
let vs nowe conclude, that Chriſt can, but hee will not,
tranſubſtantiate himſelfe into the bread, but will ſit at the
right hand of the Father, vntill he come to iudge, &amp;c. As the
holy Scripture doth witneſſe it, and in the Creed wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon wherewith they confirme their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,<note place="margin">The ſecond confirmation of tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note>
is, That Ieſus Chriſt is infallible truth, and
therefore of neceſſitie that which hee ſayth muſt bee as hee
ſaith it: He ſaith, <hi>This is my body:</hi> Then it followeth, that that
is his bodie: and if it be the body of Chriſt, it is not Bread.
With <hi>Eſayas,</hi> chap. 53. verſe 9. and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> chap. 2. verſ.
22. confeſſe we, that Ieſus Chriſt neuer ſinned: we alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
that vntruth nor deceit was euer found in his mouth:
For he is that which of himſelfe he ſaith, Ioh. chap. 14. verſe
6. <hi>The way, the trueth, and the life.</hi> Wee alſo confeſſe, that
with his owne mouth he hath ſayd: <hi>This is my body:</hi> and ſo
beleeue we that it is. For ſhould wee denie that which our
King, Prophet, and Prieſt affirmeth, we ſhould not be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>Thus farre agree we with our aduerſaries. The difference
that is betweene them and vs, is as touching the maner. How
or in what manner, that which Ieſus Chriſt by the meane of
his miniſter, in the holy Supper doth giue vs, is truely and
really the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt. For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
hereof, it ſhall bee needfull to vſe the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Lord vſeth in the ſixth chapter of the Goſpell
of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> That there bee two maners of eating the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Chriſt, the one carnall, the other ſpirituall. Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the Scripture oppoſeth the fleſh to the Spirit, by the
fleſh it vnderſtandeth the parte of man that is not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,<note place="margin">Two maners of eating Chriſt. The one carnall &amp; the other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note>
nor ſubiect to the lawe of God. So call wee men
without the knowledge of God, carnall, naturall, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
men: But it is not heere ſo to bee taken. By the
fleſh is vnderſtood the ſame fleſh of Chriſt it ſelfe, ioyntly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:19632:159"/>
with his blood, bones and ſinewes, and which Ieſus Chriſt took
when he was borne, and liued in this world, when he dyed, and
roſe againe, &amp;c. The ſecond maner of eating which is called
ſpirituall, is: when the faithfull Chriſtian (his bodie being here
below) is lifted vp ſo high in ſpirit, that with the wings of faith
it flyeth, and with one flight doth pierce all the heauens, and
ſtayeth not, vntill it come before the throne of the maieſtie of
God the father, at whoſe right hand he findeth ſitting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
and ſatisfier Chriſt. And finding him, with great ioy
doth feede vpon him eateth his glorious bodie, and drinketh
his moſt precious bloud. And if the faithfull Chriſtian doth
freely eate him: much more freely doth the Lord giue himſelfe
to ſuſtaine the ſoules, which he with the death of his body, &amp;
with the ſhedding of his bloud redeemed. He that with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and bloud did redeeme them: with his body and with his
bloud wil he maintain them: yet not carnally, but ſpiritually by
faith, as before we haue ſayd. Our aduerſaries beleeue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt in the firſt manner to be in their Maſſe.<note place="margin">Read the reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which Nich. 2. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius to make, which we wil place a litle beneath, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the Councels.</note> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that the mouth taketh, the teeth chawe, the throate ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
and the ſtomacke receiueth the ſame carnall bodie,
which was borne, which dyed, which roſe againe, &amp;c. They wil
vnderſtand the words of Chriſt literally: be it as it will be: but
Chriſt himſelfe, ſpeaking of the neceſſity that wee haue to eate
his fleſh, and drinke his bloud, ſaith: <hi>The words which I ſpeake
vnto you are ſpirit and life:</hi> to wit, that which I haue ſayd vnto
you touching the eating of my fleſh, and drinking of my bloud,
vnderſtand you not after the letters as they carnally ſound:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 63.</note>
lift vp the mind, and vnderſtand it ſpiritually. The Capernaits
and many of the diſciples alſo (as ſaith S. <hi>Iohn)</hi> carnally vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the words of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 60.</note> And alſo they ſayd, that it was a hard
ſaying, and murmured at it. To whom Chriſt, vnfolding their
errour, told them, they ſhould vnderſtand his words ſpiritually.
You ſee here that our aduerſaries are worſe then the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naits:
for the Capernaits would not carnally eate the fleſh
of Chriſt, nor drinke his bloud: but they make no bones at it:
without any ſcruple, and without any loathing will they eate
the fleſh of Chriſt carnally: but it will nought auaile them. <hi>For
the Spirit it is that quickeneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>and the fleſh</hi> (as Chriſt himſelfe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:19632:159"/>
ſaith, ſpeaking to our purpoſe profitteth nothing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That the Lord, in his ſupper gaue carnally his body may
wee not vnderſtand. For ſhould wee ſo vnderſtand it, A moſt
great abſurditie world followe: that Ieſus Chriſt, when hee
celebrated his ſupper, had two carnall bodies, One by one;
The Bodie that celebrated the ſupper,<note place="margin">An obſnrditie of tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> that brake the bread
in his handes, bleſſed it, brake it and gaue it to his diſciples,
&amp;c. was the true carnall body of Chriſt, which was borne,
and dyed, &amp;c. If that which this carnall bodie tooke in his
handes and gaue to his diſciples was alſo the carnall body of
Chriſt, it followeth; that Ieſus Chriſt, when he had celebrated
his ſupper, had two carnall bodies: one which ſate and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his place: and the other, which ſitting body, gaue to his
diſciples. The which is a great abſurditie. But did they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this ſecond manner of body (which the Carnall body
of Chriſt gaue to his diſciples, and they tooke it, and did eat
it) not to bee his carnall body, nor carnally taken: They
ſhould fall into ſuch an abſurditie. Alſo leaſt wee ſhould fall
into this abſurditie, and others which wee will afterwards ſet
downe, in his ſupper may we not beleeue Ieſus Chriſt to be in
the firſt manner carnally: but in the ſecond, ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>This ſecond manner of eating, can no way be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith; Becauſe (as wee haue ſaid) it is not carnall, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall:
And it is to be noted, that this ſpirituall eating, is done
in two manners. The firſt, by the preaching of the Goſpell:
As Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith: Faithfull (ſaith hee) is God, By whom
yee are called, to the Communion of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt.
By the preaching of the Goſpell, are wee made fleſh, of the
fleſhly of Chriſt, and bones of bones: By the preaching of
the Goſpell, hee is to vs the bread of life, which came
downe from heauen to feede our ſoules: By the preaching
of the Goſpell are we made one thing with him. Euen as he is
one with the father.<note place="margin">The ſpirituall eating in two ſorts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond manner of ſpirituall eating, is done by the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and in the holy ſupper chiefly.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 9.</note> Theſe two kindes of
ſpirituall eating the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 30.</note> and of drinkeing his
blood:<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 36.</note> by the preaching of the Goſpell, and by the ſacraments,
doe the ancient Doctours confeſſe.<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 21. Origin.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen. Hom.</hi> 16. vppon
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:19632:160"/>
Nombers ſaith: wee are ſaid to drinke the blood of Chriſt,
not with the rite of the ſacraments onely: but alſo when
wee receaue his wordes. The ſame vppon Eccleſiaſtes
chap 3.<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> ſaith Saint <hi>Ierome.</hi> The faithfull in the holy ſupper,
receauing with the mouth of the outwarde bodie and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
the bread and wine (which be the moſt holy ſacramentes
of the body and blood of Chriſt) receaueth with the mouth
of the ſoule (which is faith) inwarde and ſpiritually the true
body and blood of Chriſt, without that carnall body of Chriſt
diſcendeth here belowe, or ceaſſeth to ſit at the right hand
of his father: As wee will afterwardes more largely declare.
So that wee confeſſe the faithfull, truly and really to receiue
in the holie ſupper, the bodie and blood of Chriſt: As
Chriſt himſelfe witneſſeth: This is my bodie this is my
blood, yet not carnally, but ſpiritually, doe wee vnderſtand
theſe wordes: as Chriſt himſelfe doth declare them. For
hee (as before we haue ſaid) ſpeaking of the eating of his
fleſh, and drinking of his blood, which is done in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
ſaith: that this ought to be ſpiritually vnderſtood and
not carnally (As did the Capernaits and ſome of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
alſo vnderſtand it) <hi>My wordes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Life.</hi> And therefore, that which hee ſaith of the
eating of the bodie, and drinkeing of the blood, ought ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
to bee vnderſtood. For the Spirit it is that quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and the fleſh profitteth nothing. Vnderſtanding
then (As wee haue ſayd) Chriſt to bee thus preſent in the
Sacrament, it ſhall not bee needefull to adnihilate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce
of the bread, nor of the wine, nor to tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
it, into the ſubſtaunce of the bodie and blood of Chriſt.
Wee confeſſe then, that in this moſt holie ſacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the hauing of the true bodie and blood of Chriſt, in
ſort as before wee haue ſayd, and the Lord himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth:
Wee confeſſe, I ſay, there is alſo true bread and
wine in their proper ſubſtaunce as beeing the bread and
wine (ſay I) haue loſt nothing as touching their ſubſtaunce:
but as touching their qualities, they haue much gayned: For
by the vertues, and efficacie of Chriſtes inſtitution, and of
his wordes, they ceaſſe to bee common bread and wine,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:19632:160"/>
and bee dedicated to ſignifie, figure, repreſent and giue
the true body and blood of Chriſt: and doe ſo ſignifie, figure
repreſent, ſeale and giue the ſame; that whoſoeuer taketh
this bread, and eateth it, taketh this wine and drinketh it
worthily, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, who ſaith:
<hi>Take and eate: Take and drinke yee all of this:</hi> taketh and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
truely and really, the bodie and blood of Chriſt. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that which the Lord there ſaith: <hi>This is my bodie:
This is my blood:</hi> Yet not carnally, but ſpiritually by faith.
And if the bread and wine ſhould not abide in their ſubſtaunce
and being, this ſacrament ſhould not bee a ſacrament: for
euery ſacrament (As our aduerſaries themſelues cannot deny
in two thinges conſiſteth:<note place="margin">The ſacrament Conſiſteth in 2. thinges the one earthly &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heauenly.</note> In a viſible and earthly thing,
which they call Materia, and an inuiſible and celeſtiall thing
which they call Forma. That the inuiſible and celeſtiall,
is the bodie and blood of Chriſt, doe wee all agree. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the viſible and earthly, betweene them and vs, is there
very great difference. For wee ſay: That the ſubſtaunce
of the bread and wine, togither with their accidents remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:
They ſay, that of the bread and wine, no ſubſtaunce
remaineth. But onely the accidents of the bread and of the
wine, the whiteneſſe, the roundneſſe, the ſmell, the ſauour,
and the coullor. As though the accidents of the bread doe
nouriſh: As though the accidents of the wine doe make chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and comforte, They bee not accidents of bread, that doe
nouriſh, but the ſubſtaunce of the bread. They bee not the
accidents of the wine, which glad the hart: but the ſubſtaunce
of the wine: The bread and wine conuerting themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſubſtaunce of man which eateth and drinketh the ſame.
To receaue ſpiritually in the ſupper, the true body and blood of
Chriſt, needful it is to receiue carnally &amp; materially true bread,
&amp; true wine: For otherwiſe ſhould therbe no <hi>Analogie</hi> or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
betweene the figure, which is bread, &amp; the wine, &amp; the
thing figured, which is the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This that we ſay, teach the ancient Doctours, that in two
thinges conſiſteth this ſacrament: in earthly, and heauenly.
So ſaith <hi>Ireneus,</hi> ſpeaking againſt the Valentinians. Alſo
<hi>Gelaſius</hi> a Biſhoppe of Rome, who diſputed of the coniunction
of the bread, with the body of Chriſt, both natures of the bread
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:19632:161"/>
&amp; of Chriſt remayning in their being: And by this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he proueth in Chriſt, the vnion of the humane nature, &amp;
diuine; both the one, and the other remayning in their whole
being and ſubſtaunce. Were there not in the ſacrament true
bread, and true wine, the argument of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ſhould bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth: But his argument is good, and proueth that (which
he pretendeth: Therfore is there true bread &amp; true wine, in the
ſacrament of the ſupper. As there is alſo true water in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of baptiſme. This ſelfeſame argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vſeth <hi>Theodorit,</hi> As a
little after we will declare.<note place="margin">Origin ſnpper. Matth. cap. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Origin</hi> ſaith theſe words. So that that
which is materiall in the bread of the Lord, goeth into the belly
&amp; is caſt out into the draught, But which that is by praier, &amp; the
word of the Lord, according to the proportion of faith, profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ſoule. They will not ſay vnto me, that <hi>Origin</hi> had ſome
errors &amp; that one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this: for had this bin an error the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Doctors. As S. <hi>Ierom</hi> &amp; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> which collected his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
would haue noted this for an error, had they taken it, for
an error. But none of them ſay, that <hi>Origin</hi> thought amiſſe of the
Euchariſt. Therfore that which <hi>Origin</hi> ſaith is no error, neither

we the pudles, &amp; let vs drinke of the cleare water of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
Leaue we apart the fathers, and let vs ſee, what the holy
ſcriptur ſaith. Many times doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> call it bread; yea, after it

the body of the Lord.<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Cor 10. 16. 23.</note> the bread (ſaith he) which we break

drinketh of that cup. In theſe there places, S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the cup
doth vnderſtand, that which in the cuppe is conteyned: which
is that, which his maiſter calleth the fruit of the vine, or wine.
Here yee ſee that the Lord his Apoſtle, and the auncient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
call that bread, &amp; wine which in the ſacrament is viſible
&amp; earthly and by the ſame reaſon admit no tranſubſtantiation:
As there is none in deede. This ſimple and ſound Doctrine, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

Would our aduerſaries vnderſtand this they ſhould not neede
the booke, which they cal <hi>De coutelas de la Miſſa</hi> which intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
what ought in ſuch former like caſes to be done. This,

of the conſciences which haue zeale:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> but as ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

are not founded vpon the firme foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the word
of God, but vpon the ſand, the traditions of men.</p>
               <p>Such as will not vnderſtand the words of the Lord, <hi>This is my
body &amp;c.</hi> Spiritually but carnally: doe fall into great hereſie &amp;
horrible Idolatrie. The Chriſtian religion (as witneſſeth <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
in his Symbol) beleeueth that in Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Athanaſius.</note> are 2 natures
diuine and humane. It beleeueth, that theſe two natures are ſo
vnited and conioyned in Chriſt, that they are not confounded
nor mingled one with another. The diuine hath his properties,
and the humane his. As the reaſonable ſoule and fleſhly bee
one man, So the diuinitie and humanitie bee one Chriſt. It
is the propertie of the diuinitie onely and of no other thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
to bee in euery place: for it is vnmeaſurable &amp; infinit
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19632:162"/>
and no other thing there is that is vnmeaſurable and infinite: It
is the propertie of the humanity to be in ſome one place and
not in euery place. So witneſſeth the Angell ſpeaking of the
humanitie of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He is riſen</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>he is not here.</hi> Beholde
here the place where they put him. And S. <hi>Peter, Whom</hi> (ſayth
he) <hi>the Heauens muſt contayne vntill the time of the reſtauration of
all things:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note> And ſo do wee hold it for an article of faith: that he
aſcended into Heauen and is ſet at the right hand of God the
father, from thence ſhall he come to iudge the quicke and the
dead. Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe ſayth: <hi>The poore ſhall you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with you: but me ſhall you not haue alwayes.</hi> All theſe places
doe proue Ieſus Chriſt according to his humanity and in as
much as he is man not to bee here below, but in heauen. This
Article of faith do our aduerſaries impugne when they beleeue
the body of Chriſt to be in euery Maſſe. And ſo many as day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through all the world are celebrated,<note place="margin">The heteſie of the papiſts.</note> and in all their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarios</hi>
or pixes, where they keepe it incloſed really, corporally,
carnally, ſo great and ſo big, as it was vpon the croſſe. If this be
not hereſie, what ſhall bee hereſie? Good Tranſubſtantiators
are our aduerſaries, when they haue tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated the bread
and the wine into the body and bloud of Chriſt: ſo that now is
it no bread, now it is no wine: but (as they ſay) the body and
bloud of Chriſt. So now they tranſubſtatiate the humanitie of
Chriſt, his fleſh and his bloud into the diuinitie: ſeeing they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
vbiquitie to the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, the which is
only proper to the diuinitie. Ieſus Chriſt is true God and true
man. But his Godhead is not his manhood: and his manhood is
not his Godhead. The one is the Creator, whoſe beginning is
from euerlaſting:<note place="margin">The heteſie of the papiſts.</note> the other is a creature, whoſe being had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
Notwithſtanding all this which our aduerſaries (of
the learned I ſpeake) may heare and reade, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
obſtinate and hardened, and God hath left them to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
mind, that they may beleeue the bread to be no bread,
but the bodie of Chriſt: the wine to be no wine but the bloud
of Chriſt. And ſo they worſhip that which a pariſh Clearke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
betweene two yrons, and the Prieſt giueth it a forme, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it his God: In the pixe do they keepe it: to the ſicke they
carie it: Vpon ſome feaſtes of the yeare, and chiefly the day
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19632:162"/>
which they call <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> with great pompe, triumph, and
maieſtie take they it forth to walke, and wo to that perſon that
will not kneele before it. I would aske them who commanded
them to doe this? If they know that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo done,
orcommaunded his Apoſtles ſo to doe? Neither example nor
commandement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will they giue. Chriſt neither did nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
any ſuch thing, nor his Apoſtles, nor the Catholike
Church did ſo by the ſpace of one thouſand yeares after the
death of Chriſt. A new inuention it is humane &amp; diueliſh, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the wicked foundation of tranſubſtatiation.</p>
               <p>Some things there be in the Maſſe, which manifeſtly declare
that there is no tranſubſtantiation: as when they ſay in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
<hi>Offerimus praeclarae maieſtati tuae de tuis donis ac datis, &amp;c.</hi> that
is to ſay, We offer to thy excellent Maieſtie of thy gifts, and of
that which thou haſt giuen,<note place="margin">Theſe croſſes with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts haue their myſterie.</note> &amp;c. a pure Ho<g ref="char:cross">✚</g>ſt, an holy Ho<g ref="char:cross">✚</g>ſt,

and the wine, without any tranſubſtantiation: or els ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated
into the body and bloud of Chriſt that now there
remaynneth neither bread nor wine. It apeareth by the prayer
that there which there they make, that by the gifts they ought
to vnderſtand the bread and wine without any tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which gifts the Prieſt prayeth God to accept, as he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

by the hands of thine holy Angel to the high Alter, before
the preſence of thy diuine Maieſty, &amp;c. And if by gifts the bread

the croſſe, wherewith he ſanctifieth vs for euer? But they will
ſay vnto me, that they vnderſtand by giftes, not the bread and
wine vntranſubſtantiated, but tranſubſtantiated into the body
and bloud of Chriſt. If ſo they vnderſtand it, worſe is it then it
was: for then the prayer which the Prieſt maketh is a moſt
blaſphemous blaſphemie againſt Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Blaſphemi of the Prieſt.</note> the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſonne of God, true God and man. What pride, what haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
and preſumption is it, that a miſerable ſinner, conceiued
and borue in ſinne and corruption, and that doth nothing in all
his life time but adde ſinnes vnto ſinnes, dare to preſent himſelf
before the maieſtie of God the Father, and pray him to receiue
and accept his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt? And how ſaith he that he
ſhould accept him? Euen as he accepted the giftes of <hi>Abel,
Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi> Is Chriſt no other thing then
<hi>Abel, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi> Is the ſacrifice of Chriſt,
his precious bodie and bloud which he offered, no other thing
then the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Melcbiſedech,</hi> and
then the ſacrifice of all how many ſoeuer iuſt perſons that haue
bene and ſhall be? Let them then be aſhamed ſo to ſpeake of
Ieſus Chriſt, and of his ſacrifice. On the one ſide they confeſſe
Ieſus Chriſt to be equall with the Father (as he is) in eſſence and
power: and on the other ſide, and ſtinking Prieſt put they for
interceſſor and mediator, that the Father ſhould accept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him with a mercifull and chearefull countenance. O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ſinner, pray thou vnto God, that he pardon thy ſinnes,
thy ſuperſtitions and idolatries: and pray not, nor intreat thou
for Chriſt, who is the Lambe without ſpot, which taketh away
the ſinnes of the world: he is he that committed no ſinne nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was anie guile found in his mouth. He needeth not thee
that thou ſhouldeſt pray to the Father for him: but thou haſt
need, that he pray for thee. The father himſelfe ſpeaking of
his ſonne, faith: <hi>This is my beloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed:
heare him.</hi> Ye ſee here a terrible blaſphemy vttred by the prieſt
in ſaying of the Maſſe. Of that which is ſayd doe wee conclude:
that all thoſe which heare Maſſe, ſeeing they beleeue this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
bee Idolaters: and that the prieſt which faith it,
(hold he intention of conſecration or not) is a double Idolater.
For he not only committeth idolatrie: but cauſeth alſo all that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:19632:163"/>
heare his Maſſe to commit Idolatry. Infinite thankes I giue to
my God, that although he permitted, that I with the reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Idolatrie for a time in hearing the Maſſe, yet hee neuer
ſuffered me to commit idolatrie by ſaying it to others.</p>

And then ſaith hee, This Euchariſt conſiſteth in two things,

it is that the bodie of Chriſt bee truly in the Sacrament, ſo

Not the matter of the bread, but the word ſpoken ouer it,

of manie graines, his body; and the wine preſſed out
of many cluſters and graines of grapes, calleth hee his bloud.
Alſo, interpreting the Lords prayer, he calleth the bread the
body of the Lord. Alſo, in the ſermon of the Supper of the
Lord, he ſayth: wee whet not the tooth to bite, but with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

our Tranſubſtantiators, no wine is there in the cup, therefore
it followeth, there is no bloud. For this is the argument of S.

The ſymbols o be changed into the bodie of Chriſt, but ſo
that they take a certiane likeneſſe of Chriſt himſelfe in whom
the humane nature was ſeene and the diuine remained hidden
by which likenes it appeareth that he wold ſay: that as in Chriſt
remain two natures, diuine and humane: So in the ſame maner
are the two natures preſerued in the Sacrament. That of the
bread which is ſeene and that of the body of Chriſt, which is
not ſeene. In the ſecond booke and third epiſtle he alſo ſayeth:
So that the body of Chriſt cannot be floure onely: Nor water

In the ſame place alſo he ſaith: We receiue the myſticall cup, in

but for all this, thoſe that receiue the Sacrament are not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated

and that hee in the poore, was in neceſſitie. Alſo in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
Homily vppon Matth. <hi>In opere imperfecto</hi> he ſaith: In the
holy veſſels is neither the bodie of Chriſt, nor his bloud, but
the myſtery of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt. Alſo vpon the
twelfth chapter of the ſecond epiſtle to the Corinthians, <hi>Hom.</hi>
27. he ſaih: So that Chriſt in the bread and wine ſayd, <hi>Doe
this in remembrance of me.</hi> In declaring alſo theſe wordes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the twentie third Pſalme, <hi>Thou haſt prepared a table before
me,</hi> ſaith; So that the bread and the wine in the Sacrament is
ſhewed vnto vs in the ſimilitude of the bodie and bloud of
Chriſt, &amp;c. Alſo, writing to <hi>Ceſarius</hi> againſt <hi>Apollinarius,</hi>
and others, which confounded the diuinitie and humanitie of
Chriſt (this Epiſtle is found in the Librarie of Florence) he
ſaith: For euen ſo the bread before it bee ſanctified wee call
bread: but the diuine grace ſignifying this: the bread by
meanes of the Prieſt is freed from the name of bread, and is
found worthy to be called the bodie of the Lord, albeit the
nature of bread remaine ſtil in it. In verie manie places is Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> wholly for vs,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> and roundly confirmeth our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
Vppon the foureſcore and ſecond Pſalme hee ſaith:
Thou art not to eate that which thou ſeeſt: nor art thou to
drinke this bloud, which they haue to poure out. That which
I ſay is a myſterie, which will quicken, being ſpiritually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
Alſo in the Treatiſe <hi>De Fide, ad Petrum,</hi> chap. 19.
hee calleth it the Sacrament of bread and wine. Alſo, againſt
<hi>Fauſtus,</hi> the twentith booke and twentie firſt chapter he ſayth:
In the old Teſtament, vnder the ſimilitude of the ſacrifices,
(to wit, of the beaſtes ſacrificed) the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt
was promiſed vnto vs: vpon the croſſe was it really giuen, but
in the Sacrament for a memoriall it is celebrated. Let vs
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:19632:166"/>
well conſider theſe three times noted by Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
and the great difference there is. After one ſort gaue Chriſt
himſelfe in the olde Teſtament: after another vpon the croſſe:
and after another in the Sacrament of the Supper. Alſo, <hi>De
Ciuitate Dei,</hi> the 21. booke, and the twentie fift chapter, he
clearelie affirmeth that the wicked eate not the matter
of the Sacrament, to wit, the bodie of Chriſt. And ſo (ſaith
he) It is not to be thought, that hee which is not in the bodie
of Chriſt, and in whom Chriſt is not, nor he in Chriſt, eateth
the body of Chriſt.<note place="margin">The wicked eat not the body of Chriſt.</note> Alſo in the twentith Treatiſe vppon Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> hee ſaith the ſame. Againſt <hi>Adimantus</hi> alſo a Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
chap. 12. he ſaith: The Lord doubted not to ſay, This

body. In this ſheweth Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the words of Chriſt,
<hi>This is my body:</hi> ought not to bee fully vnderſtood according
as they ſound, but by trope or figure; and ſo ſaith hee, that
this manner of ſpeech is like to that alleaged out of the twelfth
chapter of Deuteronomie, verſe 23. <hi>The bloud is the life.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<hi>De doctrina Chriſtiana, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 16. Hee ſheweth that
which Chriſt in the ſixt chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth, <hi>Except ye eat
the fleſh of the Sonne of man, &amp;c.</hi> to bee a figuratiue maner of
ſpeech: the reaſon which hee giueth is, becauſe it ſeemeth
to commaund a great wickedneſſe. For to eate the fleſh of
a man, is a greater crueltie then to kill him; and to drinke
his bloud then to ſhed it. And therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
that it is a figure which commaundeth vs, ſweetely
and profitably to remember that the fleſh of Chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and wounded for vs. Alſo in the Epiſtle to <hi>Boniface</hi>
ſayth: The Sacramentes take their names of thoſe thinges
whereof they are Sacraments. Theſe wordes (as wee haue
noted) tooke Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> from Saint <hi>Cyprian:</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
nameth the Sacrament of the bodie of Chriſt, in a
certaine manner to bee the bodie of Chriſt: and then ſayth:
The Sacrament of the bloud of Chriſt, is the bloud of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Vpon the eight Pſalme he alſo ſaith: Chriſt receiued <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>

                  <hi>Bertram</hi> in the booke which hee made of the bodie

ſayth: that according to the ſubſtance of creatures, the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
(which be the bread and wine) bee the ſame after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
that before they were. But why alleage I one place of

his doctrine: and confirming his doctrine, which is the ſame
with ours, it weakeneth and ouerthroweth that of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries:
which ſayth the bread and wine in the ſacrament to bee
the very ſame body and bloud of Chriſt, in fleſh, bones, and
ſinewes, which was borne, dyed, and roſe againe, &amp;c. But the
bodie of Chriſt (ſaith <hi>Bertram)</hi> is in two maners:<note place="margin">Two maners of the body of Chriſt.</note> one in fleſh
and in bones &amp;c. which was borne, and dyed, &amp;c. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpirituall; which is that which is giuen in the ſacrament:
and alſo he ſaith, that the ſpirituall body of Chriſt, and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
bloud, vnder the couerture of the corporall bread, and of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:19632:167"/>
the corporal wine remaine. At the requeſt of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great
wrote <hi>Bertram</hi> this booke: as he himſelf in the end of his book
ſpeaking of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, to whom he dedicated the ſame,
ſaith: The occaſion he had, ſo to didicate it, was, for that, As
<hi>Bertram</hi> ſaith in the beginning of the booke <hi>Charles</hi> the Great
had demanded of him whether the body and blood of Chriſt,
which in the Church is receiued with the mouth of the faithful,
be in miſtery or really in truth receiued. So that it is now aboue.

Chriſt, &amp; theſe 2 things be not confuſed, but each one holdeth
his proper being. So neither more nor leſſe, are there 2 natures
really in Chriſt: diuine &amp; humane, not confounded, nor the one
conuerted into the other. Were there not 2 things really in the

ſay, our aduerſaries that the bread and wine are conuerted
into the bodie and blood of Chriſt: So that there remaineth
no more bread, nor no more wine. The ſelfe ſame argument

as before we haue alleaged. Here ſeſt thou the victorie which
our aduerſaries haue gotten by aleaging the fathers, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme
their tranſubſtantiation. If many they haue alleaged for their
tranſubſtantiation, many more haue we alleaged againſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
as ancient, as learned, &amp; as godly, as thoſe whom
they haue cited: and the ſelfe ſame, alſo haue we alleaged often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that they haue alleaged. Our aduerſaries with ful mouth
ſtill crie out, ſaying: Fathers, fathers, as though the fathers were
for them, &amp; not for vs: But by this diſputation, which we haue
in hand ſhalbe ſeene, whether the fathers be before vs, whether
they approue and confirme our Doctrine, and condemne that
of our aduerſaries or no. But for as much (as ſay the Logitians)
to giue an inſtance is not to aſſoyle the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It ſhalbe good
to anſwere that which our aduerſaries haue alleaged againſt
our Doctrine. This will we doe, with all poſſible breuitie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we purpoſe not here to make long diſcourſe of this
mater. To ſhew then, that, that of the fathers which they haue
alleaged, maketh nothing againſt vs. Needful ſhall it be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that the holy Scripture it ſelfe doth wontedly giue the
names of Symbols, ſignes, or figures to the thinges which they
betoken, figure and repreſent: and contrarywiſe, the names of
the things ſignified and figured, they giue to the ſignes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
as the fathers doe obſerue it. Thus is Chriſt the paſcall
lambe, &amp; the paſcal lambe is Chriſt, Chriſt is bread, &amp; the bread
is Chriſt, &amp;c. For this cauſe the fathers, imitating the phraſe of
the ſcripture, ſpeaking of the things ſignified, they call them by
the names of thoſe things which they ſignifie: &amp; contrariwiſe,
ſpeaking of the figures, they giue vnto them the names of the
things which they figure.<note place="margin">Ciprian.</note> Which thing S. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> by vs before
alleaged, &amp; S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in an epiſtle which he wrote to <hi>Boniface</hi>

which a litle before, or a litle after in other places they haue ſaid
we ſhall ſee, that they haue vnderſtood, &amp; witneſſed, this meat
to be ſpirituall, not carnall for the mouth, teeth, nor the belly.
Wherefore (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as before of him we haue ſayd)
prepareſt thou the tooth, and the belly? Beleeue, and thou haſt
eaten. In which manner of ſpeaking, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth imitate
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19632:169"/>
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (As before we haue ſaid) It is alſo to be noted that the
fathers ſpeake one way of the bread, &amp; of the wine before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
and after conſecration otherwiſe. Before conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſay they, that the bread and wine are common and vulgar, as
the reſt. But of conſecration they deny it to be common bread;
they deny it to be common wine: there is a chaunging ſay they
in them which thing is moſt true. For the bread &amp; wine, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration

Such a chaunge as this, vnderſtood the fathers to be made in the
bread and wine: but not as touching the ſubſtaunce and being.
But as touching the qualities. The which chaunge wee doe
willingly allow, By ſuch a chaunge we confeſſe; that the bread
and wine are made Sacraments, which effectually by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the holie ſpirit, doe ſignifie: preſent, ſeale and giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

when the fathers ſay: there is now no more bread, nor wine,
in the Sacrament, this ought not to bee ſimply vnderſtood: As
touching the ſubſtaunce: but in a certaine manner, in reſpect
of him which receaueth the ſacrament, who ought not to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
his eyes vppon the bread, nor vppon the wine, which bee
viſible, earthly, and corruptible things: but ought to lift vp his
hart ſoule, and ſpirit, to receiue that, which by the bread &amp; the
wine is ſignified vnto vs, To wit, Ieſus Chriſt ſet at the right
hand of the father.</p>
               <p>Three cauſes can we ſhew:<note place="margin">Three cauſes why the fathers haue giuen the name of things figured to the figures.</note> why the fathers ſo loftily and ſo
hiperbolically haue ſpoken of the ſignes, The firſt is (which
before we haue touched) taking licenſe of the ſcripture which
doth alſo the ſame. The 2. the more to moue the harts of men,
and to lift them vp to contemplate heauenly things &amp; vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercies, which in this moſt holy ſacrament we receiue:
Seeing that our ſoules are ſpiritually fed and nouriſhed with
the precious bodie and blood of Chriſt. The 3. to ſhew this
repreſentation, which we ſay to be made in the ſacrament, not
to be theatricall, not belonging to commedians: but that the
Lord giueth really that, which for his part, he promiſeth, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:19632:170"/>
and his blood, for the ſpirituall nouriſhment of our ſoules:
And that we for our part, receiue it by faith. Chriſt being our
foode: were by good reaſon to be conuerted into vs, as are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meates conuerted into the ſubſtaunce of him that eateth
them: but in Chriſt is it not ſo. For we eating him, doe conuerte
our ſelues into him, and are by a ſecret and vnſpeakable vnion
made one thing with him. Oh admirable miſterie! Oh high
Sacrament! Oh ſweete and diuine banquet wherein; our bodie
receauing carnally with the teeth bread and wine! our ſoule
receaueth ſpiritually by faith, Ieſus Chriſt with all his treaſure
and riches, which dying and riſing againe he gained for vs. For
here is hee wholly giuen vnto vs. that which is ſayd (mee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
ſufficient to anſwere that which our aduerſaries out of
the fathers haue alleaged againſt vs. But ſetting a part this
generall anſweres.<note place="margin">Ireneus.</note> Let vs anſwere to each one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
As touching <hi>Ireneus</hi> which ſaith inuocation receaued the
earthly bread is nowe no more common bread, haue we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
anſwered to bee truth, when on our part we alleaged
him. As touching <hi>Tertullian</hi> wee ſay what he himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
ſaying:<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> The Lord not onely made the bread which
hee tooke his bodie, ſaying: This is my bodie, to wit the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of my bodie. Concerning that which <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith: that
the Lord affirmed the bread to bee this bodie, wee deny
it not: but the controuerſie is, how it ſo is, carnally or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:
and in the places, which of him, for vs we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged:
is it declared,<note place="margin">Origen. Cyprian.</note> how <hi>Origen</hi> himſelfe vnderſtood it. As
touching that which Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, the bread to bee
chaunged into fleſh and blood: The ſame alſo ſay we. But
we meane not a naturall change, that one ſubſtaunce is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
into another. The chaunge which wee vnderſtand,
and which vnderſtandeth Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> is ſacramentall and
ſo hee there ſaith, we are vnited (or made one ſelfe ſame thing)
with Chriſt, not ſo much by a naturall chaunge, as by a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
For he hath made himſelfe both bread &amp; fleſh, and bloud.
He himſelfe is meate ſubſtaunce, &amp; life for his Church, which
giuing her participation &amp;c. he calleth his body. Of theſe
words will we conclude, the ſacramentall bread and wine
to be the body and blood of Chriſt, neither more nor leſſe then
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19632:170"/>
the Church is the body of Chriſt, not corporally but ſpiritually
That which he ſaith, that the bread is changed, not in forme, but
in nature, ſeemeth to make much againſt vs. But by that which
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelfe wrote to <hi>Cecilius,</hi> that in the wine is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the bloud of God, it appeareth to be otherwiſe. Alſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
againſt the Aquarians, he ſaith: If the wine leaue his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the cuppe, the bloud of the Lord cannot appeare to
be in the cuppe. Alſo all that moreouer, which of him wee
haue on our part alleaged. Beſides this, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> being
a Latine Authour, hee tooke, it may be, the Latine word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi>
not in ſignification of ſubſtance, but in ſignification of
vertue, force, and proprietie, as the Latine Authours do many
times take it: and in the ſame ſignification in our Spaniſh
tongue is it taken. And ſo ſay wee the nature of this herbe, or
ſtone, &amp;c. is this, &amp;c. The nature of the loade-ſtone is to draw
the yron: As much as to ſay, as the vertue or propertie &amp;c. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it then in this ſignification, it wil very well agree with that
which Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith. That which ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of
bread is made the fleſh of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> ought to bee ſacramentally
vnderſtood, as before we haue ſayd. And that this was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by that which he himſelfe ſaith, in the places of him, for
vs, before alleaged appeareth. What thought <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> of
the figure,<note place="margin">Chriſoſtome.</note> and the thing figured in this Sacrament, in allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him for vs, we haue already declared. Now it reſteth to
anſwer that, which he ſaith of the waxe, which applyed to the
fire is conſumed: and applying this ſimilitude, he ſaith: So the
bread and the wine are conſumed, of the ſubſtance of Chriſt,
To this obiection we anſwer, that the word (thought) vſed by
<hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> declareth vnto vs, that which he ſayd, ought not to
be vnderſtood, but in reſpect of our faith and knowledge,
wherewith communicating the bread and wine, wee receiue
them, not as bread, nor as wine, but lifting vp the ſpirit on high,
we receiue them as the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, or whoſe
efficacie they are a figure. To the other two places of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
that Chriſt giueth himſelfe to vs that wee ſhould ſee
him touch him, and handle him, and in whoſe fleſh alſo wee
might faſten our teeth: What <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> thought of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
bread and wine, whether it bee true bread and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:19632:171"/>
wine or no, we haue very clearely ſhewed by the ſame words of
<hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> himſelfe. And it is not to be beleeued that ſo graue
an Authour would contradict himſelf. Let vs, now anſwer how
this ought to be vnderſtood which our aduerſaries alleage of
him againſt vs. I ſay then, that ſimply and properly ſpeaking:
Neither the body nor the blood of Chriſt in the ſacrament are
either ſeene, handled or touched: The bread and the wine are
ſeene, handled and touched. The ſame <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in the ſame
homily ſayth: He maketh vs (to ſay the ſame alſo one Maſſe
with him. And this not onely by faith, but he maketh vs really
his body. The ſame ſaieth he in the 60. and 62. homily to the
people of Antioch ſaying: We I ſay are not onely by faith and
loue but alſo really indeed made and mingled with the body
of Chriſt. And notwithſtanding this vnion, there is none will
ſay that wee are tranſubſtantiated into the body of Chriſt.
So ſay wee alſo that notwithſtanding this ſacramentall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which remaineth betweene the bread and wine and
the body and blood of Chriſt, the bread is not tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
into the body of Chriſt, nor the wine into his blood.
The ſame <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith: Thinke not that thou takeſt the
body of Chriſt of the handes of a man, but of a Seraphin, &amp;c.
Should wee ſimply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nderſtand this: the miniſter is not now a
man but tranſubſtantiated into a Seraphin. Alſo hee ſaieth: we
muſt not think the hand of the Prieſt to giue vs the Sacrament
but we muſt vnderſtand the ſtretched out hand of Chriſt to doe
this. By all this varietie of ſpeach what think we ſought <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
to doe, but to drawe the mindes of the Communicants
from the conſideration of the outward ſignes and figures viſible
and ſubiect to periſh, and to make them conſider the heauenly
and diuine things, which by them be figured? This glorious
Father then would, that in communicating, we ſhould ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the memorie of the death and paſſion of Chriſt, as if then
at the ſame inſtant that we communicate, his body were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
&amp; his bloud were ſhed for vs. Would God that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
when they communicate would haue this conſideration
&amp; meditation: other fruit ſhould they then receiue of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
The faithfull beleeuing the Euangelicall doctrine, and
celebrating the holy Supper, are preſent as it were at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19632:171"/>
and death of the Lord: &amp; this is the memorie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to doe: and ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
That before their eyes was Chriſt condemned,<note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> &amp; among
them crucified. As touching that of Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> which they
obiect vnto vs, that Chriſt bare himſelfe in his hands: We
denie it not: For what inconuenience is it, that Ieſus Chriſt with
his hands hath borne his owne body, if by the body we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Sacrament of his body. And that this was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hee himſelfe a little lower declareth, when hee ſaith:
<hi>Quodam modo,</hi> in a certaine maner, not ſimply. To the other
which they ſay of Saint <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> that the fleſh of Chriſt ought
to be adored in the Sacrament. We denie not the fleſh of Chriſt
in ſo much as it is conioyned with the Diuinitie, from the
which it neuer departeth, ought to be worſhipped. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
otherwiſe ſhall ſimply worſhip the fleſh of Chriſt, not
reſpecting the hypoſtaticall vnion which is betweene the
fleſh and the Diuinitie in Chriſt, ſhall commit idolatrie: for only
God, onely his Diuinitie ought to be worſhipped. <hi>Thou ſhalt
worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue.</hi> Deut.
chap. 6. verſ. 13. Who ſo liſteth to ſee how much Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
is for vs, and how much againſt the Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our aduerſaries: and this not in one place by chance, but
in manie,<note place="margin">Hillarie.</note> let him reade that which we haue alreadie alleaged. S.
<hi>Hillarie</hi> in the place cited againſt vs, groundeth his argument
vpon the truth of the Sacraments, the which doe really and
truly ſeale, giue, and preſent that which they repreſent vnto
vs. We receiue then in the Sacrament of the body and bloud
of Chriſt, the true body and bloud of Chriſt, and make our
ſelues one ſelfe ſame thing with him: and this ſpiritually by
faith, as ſo often we haue ſayd which vnion is not onely made
in the Euchariſt, but alſo in Baptiſme. And ſo the ſame <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
a little before he had ſayd thoſe wordes of the Euchariſt,
had ſayd the ſame of Baptiſme, ſaying: that by it we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
with Chriſt and amongſt our ſelues. And this not by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of conſent and will only, but alſo of nature: let them
alſo put Tranſubſtantiation in the water of Baptiſme, As
touching that which they ſay of <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, wee confeſſe the
ſame which he ſaith: that Chriſt is made our fleſh, and that

againſt vs alleaged. This Damaſcen by nation and profeſſion
was a Iew vntill hee came to Conſtantinople and was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and being conuerted, became a Monke: He liued in the

when the Moores a fewe yeares before hauing paſſed the
Straights of Gibraltar had by the chaſtiſement of God ſubdued
almoſt all our country of Spaine. Some things he wrote wherein
are found many wonders ſuperſtitions and erours: I will here
ſet downe ſome that the credite may be ſeene that to ſuch an
authour is due. A great defender hee was of Images: They
are not only to be made (ſaith he) but alſo to be honored and
reuerenced: The which is contrary to the ſecond comaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Thou ſhalt not make to they ſelf any grauen Image, Thou
ſhalt not worſhip nor honour them.</hi> The reliques of Saints he much
eſteemed and doubted not to call them fountaines of the giftes
of God. He dared to ſay: that wee ought with faith to honor
dead ſaints, the which is blaſphemy. For in one only God ought
we to beleeue: As we confeſſe in the beginning of the Nicene
Creed. Speaking of Purgatory, to confirme it he reporteth
great wonders:<note place="margin">Sermone de de functis.</note> hee telleth how <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour; who
was a pagan, an Idolaten, &amp; a great perſecuter of the Chriſtians
by the praiers of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> went out of the paines of hell, &amp;c.
Alſo that the ſoule of a woman called <hi>Falconilla</hi> a Pagan went

(ſayth hee) wontedly prayed for the dead: and deſired to

               <p>Alſo, another ſtraunge thing in the chapter of Virginitie
he ſaith: that had not <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, men for generation

hee ſaw the Text of Scripture to bee againſt him. God

How could his Church (which is the Pope and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals

that the body of Chriſt is handled (or ſenſnally felt)
with the hands of Prieſts, that it is broken, that it is chewed with

now is glorified, and therefore impoſſible, and no way ſubiect
to theſe humane miſeries ſuffer theſe things. Which the Pope
and his Councell do ſay? The Gloſſer of the Decrees himſelfe,
although not verie wiſe, could not but ſee ſo great an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
as this, and therefore ſayd, that this verie warily and aduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ought to be vnderſtood: for if thou doeſt not ſo (ſaith he)

of the body of Chriſt, but of the Symbols: which ſay they, be
the accidents. And ſo in that manner of ſpeaking admitteth a
trope or figure: according whereunto is attributed to the thing
that which is of the ſymbols. But ſhould we vſe this figure, they
would eat out our eyes.<note place="margin">In the end of the Treatiſe ſhal ye ſee how the Councel of Trent was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.</note> Now ſhalt thou vnderſtand the account

Pope, which commonly are three (for ſuch is his cauſe, that hee

Then doth the Pope either approue it, or blotting it out,
diſalow it. If he blot it out, there is then no more treaty of that
matter, how true ſoeuer it be, &amp; how profitable ſoeuer for the
Church. That which he approueth he writeth to his Legats. This

the Councels. This holy Spirit deſcendeth not from
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but commeth incloſed in a budget or wallet. Thus is the
Councell not free, but a ſeruant: and of whom? of the Pope.
Who (as before by many moſt ſufficient reaſons we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be Antichriſt. So neceſſarie an article to ſaluation is
Tranſubſtantiation among our aduerſaries, that they hold him
not a Chriſtian, but an heretike anathematized, accurſed, and
excommunicated that doth not beleeue it. Wherein, to the
Councell of Florence, held in the time of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth in
the yeare of our Lord 1439. do they great iniurie. In this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
were preſent the Emperour of Grecia, the Patriarke of
Conſtantinople, and many Eaſterne Biſhops. The Greekes and
Latines agreed in this Councell, in the difference which they
held touching the holy Spirit: and in ſome other things they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
agreed: but as touching Tranſubſtantiation, albeit the Pope
did labour them to allow of it: yet could they neuer effect it
with them. And great heed tooke the Greekes, that in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of vnitie no mention were made of Tranſubſtantiation: the
which was done to the good liking of the Greeks, as in the Bull

wherin he giueth for good to all Chriſtendome, that
the Greeke and Latine Church had once againe accorded.
And I ſurely know, had their Tranſubſtantiation bene an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:19632:174"/>

yeares ſpace beleeue it. Of all this which we haue ſpoken tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Tranſubſtantiation we conclude that which we ſay to be
truth, that he which heareth the Maſſe is a great Idolater, and
he which ſayth it is a greater.</p>
               <p>The fift Domage which the Maſſe cauſeth,<note place="margin">The 5. domage of the Maſſe. purgatory.</note> is: that beſides
the ſayd foure domages, it maintaineth many abuſes, as is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.
Concerning Purgatorie ſay we: there is no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie
but the bloud of Chriſt, which purgeth our ſinnes. By
which purgation wee are reconciled with the euerlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The other purgatorie ſay we which our aduerſaries haue
forged, without the word of God, is the head of a wolfe, as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> did call it, who for the cauſe of religion, of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
age, and hard impriſonment, among thoſe cruell Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
and eaters of mans fleſh, the defilers of the faith, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of Traiana died. Purgatorie is a common cutpurſe, that
without ſhame or correction ſtealeth, robbeth, and catcheth all
what it can, to fill the paunches of theſe idle bellies, prieſts and
friers, &amp; all the eccleſiaſticall order. For whence haue they ſo
enriched themſelues? whence is it that they haue builded ſo
many ſumptuous Monaſteries, which ſeeme rather Caſtles
and pallaces of moſt rich kings and Princes, then houſes of
begging Friers and poore Monkes, who in times paſt gained
their liuing with the labour of their hands? Whence haue they
founded ſo many Chappels, ſo manie Trentals, ſo many Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
prayed and ſung, which they called <hi>de requiem,</hi> but of the
fooliſh perſwaſion of Purgatorie? As the Maſſe entertayneth
Purgatorie, ſo alſo doth Purgatorie entertaine the Maſſe. The
Maſſe and Purgatorie are euen as two Mules, the one rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the other.</p>
               <p>The falſe prophets made an old &amp; ſimple woman beleeue,
that the ſoule of her father, mother, husband, daughter or other
perſon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe deerely loued was ſuffering moſt grieuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:19632:175"/>
and paines in Purgatory: and demanded ſome reliefe by
the Maſſe or Maſſes which ſhould be ſaid for it. Then the poore
old woman, taking it from their mouth, ioyned peece to peece,
68 <hi>Blancas</hi> which is a ryall,<note place="margin">Maſſes ſold for money, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerbe, No peny no Pater noſter</note> went to a Prieſt, and giuing him the
tyall (for Maſſes are ſold for money) beſought him to ſay a
Maſſe with great deuotion for the ſoule of her father, or ſome
other perſon whom ſhe loued. And were the old woman ſo
much more ſuperſtitions; then went ſhe to a monaſterie, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it for certaine, that the Fryers liued a more religious and
holy life then the Prieſtes, and being come to the monaſterie,
beſought the Sextan or potter to cauſe a Maſſe with all ſpeede
to be ſayd. The Sextan or porter ſayd, it ſhould preſently bee
done. Then went out a Father to ſay the Maſſe, and tooke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of her: to whom better had it beene to haue giuen, then
taken it from her: for God knoweth the pouertie that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the houſe of this old woman, and the riches and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
that was in the monaſterie. And a faire thing it was, that
they ſayd it not for her: for oftentimes it happeneth, that more
Maſſes are receiued for in one day, then all the Prieſtes of the
monaſtery can ſay in a moneth. And this is the cauſe why they
cannot ſay all the Maſſes they receiue for. But thou wilt ſay
vnto mee: Why do theſe reuerend men take of them more
money for Maſſes then they well can ſay? Me ſeemeth they rob
in doing this which thou ſayeſt. Hereunto I anſwer, that they
reckon not of this, nor make they any conſcience thus to rob
and deceiue. And that which is worſe, this their theft and robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
do they ſanctifie, ſaying: that is very well done, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
ſo requireth,<note place="margin">Thus doing, they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith: Euill is not to be done that good may come of it Rom. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ad the Pope for the cauſe aforeſayd a proueth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
good this theft: and commandeth them to ſay two Maſſes
at euery moneths end, one for the quicke, another for the dead:
which two Maſſes (ſaith he) are as auayleable as all thoſe (how
many ſoeuer) they haue omitted to ſay. Did the Magiſtrates
their dutie, they would ſeeke, and in the cheſts of their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
ſhould find ſuch Bulles, ſuch mockeries, and ſuch licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſteale. Purgatorie haue they made a new article of faith:
ſo that he which beleeueth it not, is therefore an heretike. If it
be hereſie not to beleeue that, which neither in the doctrine

               <p>The 6. domage is: that ſuppoſe the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, or
ſacrament of the altar (As they call it) had bene ſuch, As they
paint it out: Yet ſhould it not be wel adminiſtred, ſith the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
people are defrauded, and depriued of the one halfe of the
ſacrament. becauſe they giue them not the ſacramentall wine,
which is the ſacrament of the bloud of Chriſt, ſhed for vs vpon
the Croſſe, &amp; when the other halfe is receiued, they giue it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
once in the yeare, &amp; wickedly, with ſo many ſuperſtitions
and Idolatries (As we haue already proued). In bread and
wine did Ieſus Chriſt inſtitute this ſacrament, for the high
ſignification and alluſion which the bread and wine holde with
his bodie and with his bloud: and commaunded his Apoſtles, in
the ſelfe ſame maner, As they had ſeene him celebrate the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
in memoriall of his death to celebrate it. When he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the bread, he ſaid. <hi>Take eate, this is my bodie.</hi> And when he gaue
the wine, he ſaid. <hi>Drinke ye all of this. This is my blood.</hi> In giuing
the wine, he addeth, &amp; that not without great miſtery, this word
all, for with this word All, doth the Lord preuent, &amp; arme vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the heretikes, which were afterwardes to ariſe, ſaying:
Drinke not all of the wine. Our aduerſaries cannot deny the
Lord to haue ſaid. <hi>Drinke yee all of this.</hi> They cannot deny, that
all thoſe which haue receaued the bread, haue not drunke of
the wine.<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 23.</note> And ſo ſaith S. <hi>Marke.</hi> And they all dranke thereof.

to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, that all do not drinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
What ſhall we hereupon conclude? That they be heretikes,
Albeit,<note place="margin">The hereſie of the Papiſts.</note> they deny it becauſe they falſify and clip the moſt holy
ſacrament which Chriſt did inſtitute. If the lawes commaund,
that he which falſifieth or clippeth the coyne, bearing the figure
of the king, or the Lord of the land; ſhal die: What puniſhment
ſhal he deſerue, that falſifieth &amp; clippeth the ſacrament, which
hath not only the figure of Chriſt, but his proper body &amp; bloud
As in bread &amp; wine, Ieſus Chriſt did celebrate his ſupper: Euen
ſo did his Apoſtles celebrate it afterwards. Read the 11. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:19632:176"/>
of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthes, where S. <hi>Paule</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of the celebration of the holie ſupper; But the ſpace of one
thouſand yeares was the ſelfe ſame order touching the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the ſupper, obſerued in the Church: vntil falſe prophets aroſe
that brake this good order, which Chriſt did inſtitute and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:
&amp; the Church did long time after obſerue, Theſe would
ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe lues to be more wiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded they
that no Chriſtian, were he not a prieſt, ſhuld receiue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated wine. And their reaſons they yeeld
(but very friuolous &amp; ridiculous) why they ſo commaund.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, becauſe there is no difference betwene the prieſt,
and the people. Great pride &amp; arrogancy is this, euer haue they
pretended to keepe Chriſtian people in ſubiection: So are
they called the Clergie, for being, as they ſay. The Lot of the
Lord. As though the people, for whom Chriſt died, were the
lot of the diuell,</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe is, the danger of ſhedding the bloud, by
the beardes: if the people ſhould drink it, If this bee the cauſe
why giue they it not to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing they haue no beards? why
giue they it not to many, which either by nature, or ſhauing, or
cutting haue no beards? Why command they not, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhould be beard ſhauen?. Why permit they the Pope and
many Cardinals &amp; Biſhops in Italie to nouriſh their beards? and
ſo no danger ſhould be.</p>
               <p>The third ſay they: that receiuing the forme of the bread,
they receiue the body of Chriſt, and by conſequence (as they
call it) receaue they the bloud. And thus (ſay they) that vnder
one forme they receaue both thinges: the bodie and bloud of
Chriſt. Oh learned men! Oh great wits! The Lord commandeth
that all ſhuld drink. They counterma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſaying. That all ſhal not
drinke: that to receaue one kind is ſufficient. And a faire thing
is this, that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne thoſe for heretikes which receiue the
ſupper in both kinds: As Chriſt did celebrate, &amp; as the Apoſtles,
&amp; all the Church, for more then a thouſand, &amp; ſo many yeares
celebrated the ſame. They ſee not that in condemning vs, they
condemne Chriſt, his Apoſtles, &amp; all the Church for ſo many
yeares. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew me one Church, that comunicated in one
kind, for the ſpace of 1000. yeres after the death of Chriſt. Teh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reaſons &amp; all whatſoeuer they can imagine, and in their fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
forge, wil not ſuffice to diminiſh nor defeat the order which
Chriſt ordayned in his Church. In bread aud wine did Chriſt
inſtitute this ſacrament, &amp; ſo diſtributed it, to his Apoſtles, and
commanded them ſo to doe the ſame, S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a good diſciple
obedient to his maiſter,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20.</note> did ſo celebrate the holy ſupper: diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
the bread, which is the ſacrament of the body and the
wine which is the ſacrament of the bloud. Ye (ſaith he) cannot
drinke the cup of the Lord, &amp; the cup of diuels, &amp;c. And a little
before, by the cup, he had made mention of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of
the bloud, &amp; of the participation of his bodie by the bread. Alſo
as often as ye ſhal eate this bread, &amp; drinke this cup, &amp;c. So that,
whoſoeuer ſhall eate this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord
vnworthyly, &amp;c. Let euery one therefore proue himſelfe, &amp; ſo
eate of that bread and drinke of that cup. Alſo, for he that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and drinketh vnworthyly, &amp;c. Of all thoſe that did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
ſpake, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not of the prieſts alone. This ſelfe
ſame order of communicating in both kindes, was for many

the Doctrine which theſe foure Doctours with one common
conſent doe teach:<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> As they giue, to the Goſpell it ſelfe. Saint

of this Hiſtorie. The ſame S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in the funerall ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he made at the death of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his repentaunce. Were there many <hi>Ambroſes</hi>
There would bee many <hi>Theodoſies.</hi> The cauſe will I here
briefly tell, why Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> depriued him of the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
They of Theſſalonica murdred a Tribune in a popular
tumult: the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> hearing it was ſo highly
offended that hee cauſed ſeuen thouſand men to bee ſlayne.
<hi>Pero Mexia,</hi> writing the life of this <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> applyeth this
to his Maſſe, which is ſo much againſt it. Hee ſaith: that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius,</hi>
the day following would go to the Temple to pray,
and heare Maſſe, as he was (ſaith he) accuſtomed, &amp;c. And note
the affected malice of <hi>Pero Mexia:</hi> That he alleaged not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this his ſaying. That <hi>Theodoſius</hi> went to heare Maſſe:
which he would haue done, had any ſaid it, Maliciouſly he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealeth
the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> becauſe it made againſt his
Maſſe, which he ſo much adored. Two things may we note in
this ſaying of S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> Firſt, that he which did communicate
toke the ſacrament with his handes, and not with his mouth,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19632:177"/>
a childe, when they giue it pappe. This ſacrament is not for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
which cannot eate ſtrong meates, but it is for people, that
haue diſcretion, &amp; can eat a peece of bread, and drinke a boule
of wine, And ſo ſaith Chriſt vnto them, <hi>Take eate, Take drinke.</hi>
He ſaith not: Open thy mouth, receaue therewith the bread.
The ſecond thinge which we are to note in this ſaying of Saint
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> is: that the ſacrament to the faithful was giuen in both
kinds, in bread &amp; wine. For to eate without drinking, what doth
it profit the body? Both the one &amp; the other, haue we noted, in
the place of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> before aleaged. Alſo <hi>lib. 4. De ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,

                  <note place="margin">Ieorme.</note>

Where ſpeaking vppon the ſecond chapter of <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith:
The prieſt which conſecrateth the bread of the ſupper, and
diſtributeth the blood of the Lord to the people. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
is full of notable ſayings, confirming our Doctrine of
the communion in both kindes. Of which I will alleage one
or two,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> to auoyd tediouſneſſe. How (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine lib.</hi>

this not by hearing, but by drinking his bloud (to wit, as often
we haue ſaid, the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his bloud) is ſhed into the mouths
of the faithful. Here you ſee, al the foure Doctors of the Church
confirme our Doctrine. Why then doe our aduerſaries deny
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:19632:178"/>
it, And what ſay I of foure doctors? reade they all the ancient
Doctors as wel Greeks as Latins, all are found to be for vs. And
many years alſo after Saint Gregorie, when all things as it were

from the cuppe: who for as much as they ſinne of ſuperſtition,
muſt bee compelled to receiue entirely the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or to abſtaine from the whole. For the diuiſion of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
cannot be without great ſacrilege. Our aduerſaries then
in diuiding this myſterie, by the ſaying of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> be ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
&amp; Church-robbers.<note place="margin">The papiſts be Superſtitious &amp; Sacrilegious.</note> In the 3. Councell of Toledo, 2. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
And in the concluſion of the ſayd Councell, the ſymbol of
our faith is commaunded to be ſaid before the communion of
the body and bloud of Chriſt, according to the cuſtome of the
Eaſt: the reaſon which the Councell giueth is, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould confeſſe that which they beleeue, and ſo hauing
hearts, purified by faith, are ſaid to receiue the body and bloud
of Chriſt. In this Councell was preſent the Catholike king <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caredo:</hi>

               <p>The 7.<note place="margin">The 7. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</note> Domage that the Maſſe cauſeth is, that ſuppoſe the
Maſſe were good, &amp; celebrated as it ought to be celebrated, yet
in a ſtrange tongue is it ſayd, that the people vnderſtand it not,
&amp; ſometimes alſo be himſelf that faith it vnderſtandeth not that
which he ſaith: which is againſt the commandement of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
who commandeth that all be done with comelineſſe &amp; order.<note place="margin">1 Gor. 14. 40.</note>
And what comelines or order is there, where the people heare
a language which they vnderſtand not, and ſo know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prieſt doth bleſſe or curſe them? The ſame Apoſtle
ſaith, that the vſe of tongues not vnderſtood (albeit to the praiſe
of God) is vnprofitable in the Church. And therefore, without
interpretation of that which is ſaid, ought not to be vſed. Read
1.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> Cor. 14. 8. where he ſaith <hi>If the trumpet ſhall giue an vncertaine
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19632:178"/>
ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelfe to the battell? So likewiſe you by
the tongue, except ye vtter words that haue ſignification, how ſhall it
be vnder flood that which is ſpoken? For ye ſhall ſpeake in the aire, &amp;c.</hi>
And therefore in the 19. verſe he ſayth: <hi>I would rather ſpeake
fine words in the Church with vnderſtanding</hi> (that is to ſay, that
may be vnderſtood, thereby alſo to inſtruct others) <hi>then tenne
thouſand wordes in a tongue</hi> (to wit) <hi>that the people vnderſtand not.</hi>
The ſame Apoſtle in the 27. verſe commandeth, that if anie
ſhall ſpeake in a ſtraunge tongue, there be alſo an Interpreter.
And if there ſhall be no Interpreter, hee commandeth that hee
ſpeake not in the Church. And that if he ſpeake, hee ſpeake to
himſelfe and to God, and not to the people: for the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
no edification by a tongue that is not vnderſtood. And
therefore in the 26. verſe he commandeth that all be done to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification.
For this cauſe, when God ſpake with the Patriarks,
with the Prophets, and with his people of Iſrael, or they with
him, they ſpeake vnto him in their mother tongue that all did
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The ſame did Ieſus Chriſt, ſpeaking with the Scribes
and Phariſies, he ſpake vnto them in the vulgar tongue, the
ſame that was then vſed in Iudea. The Apoſtles when the Lord
ſent them through the world to preach, had firſt receiued the
gifts of tongues to preach the Goſpell, and celebrate the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to euerie nation in their proper language. Why then do
not our aduerſaries in this imitate the Apoſtles, they taught and
celebrated their Sacraments in the vulgar tongue, that al might
vnderſtand: that the people might be edified, &amp; God might be
glorified. The myſteries of Chriſtian religion, be not as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of the Gentiles (which were thoſe that they called <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterios
Eleuſimos,</hi> &amp; thoſe of the good goddeſſe) &amp; wo vnto him
that reuealed the ſame. Herehence it commeth that the Prieſt
pronounceth the words of conſecration, not onely in a ſtrange
tongue, but alſo in a verie low voice that none can heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;

auoyd tediouſneſſe. We ſayd (being ſo taught by the word of
God) that in the ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The faithful only receaue the body and bloud of Chriſt.</note> the
faithfull onely receiue ſpiritually and by faith, the true body &amp;
bloud of Chriſt. Our aduerſaries not herewith contented, ſay:
that not only the good, godly, and faithfull, but alſo the euill,
wicked and vnfaithfull,<note place="margin">The firſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</note> the Turkes, Iewes, and Pagans do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the true bodie and bloud of Chriſt: &amp; yet paſſe they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
they ſay, that beaſts, mice, and other vermine do eat it, that
the moiſture doth moiſten it, &amp; the mouldineſſe doth make it
mouldy, &amp;c. Their blacke Tranſubſtantiation hath made them
fall into ſo great an abſurditie &amp; ſtrange wonder:<note place="margin">Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is the cauſe that the papiſts beleeue the mouſe, &amp;c. to eate the body of Chriſt.</note> they beleeue
that there is no bread nor wine, but the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt
it the Sacrament: They vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that not the faithful only, but
alſo the infidel, Turke, Pagan, and Iew, the Mouſe, &amp;c. eateth
that which was in the Sacrament. Hereupon conclude they that
they eate and drinke the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt. He that will
deny them Tranſubſtantiation, will alſo deny this their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be good. But this ſet apart, the wicked, &amp;c. will we ſhew
by the month of Chriſt himſelfe, not to eat nor drinke the body
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:19632:179"/>
and bloud of Chriſt. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſheweth that the Lord ſaith: <hi>Except
ye eate the fleſh of the son of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life
in you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10. 6. 53.</note> Hereupon is concluded, that except wee eate his fleſh,
and drinke his bloud we ſhall not be ſaued. We eat and drinke
his fleſh &amp; his bloud when we not only reciue this Sacrament,
but alſo at all times, and as often as we beleeue in him. Beleeue
ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and thou haſt eaten. And therefore the ſame
Lord recounteth the fruites which this eating of his body and
drinking of his bloud do neceſſarily bring forth. <hi>He that eateth</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, and I wil
raiſe him vp, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my bloud
dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And, <hi>he that eateth me, ſhall liue alſo by
me.</hi> Preſuppoſe this, as moſt true and apparant it is, that wicked
men, Iewes, mice, &amp;c. haue not eternall life, nor ſhall bee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vp in the companie of the faithfull. It is ſeene they that dwel
not in Chriſt, nor Chriſt in them, it is alſo apparant that they
ſhall not liue by Chriſt. Hereupon we conclude, that they eat
not the fleſh of Chriſt, nor drinke his bloud. For had they eaten
it, and had they drunke it, heauen and earth ſhould rather faile,
then the word of Chriſt ſhould faile, the wicked Iewes, Turks,
mice, &amp;c. ſhould haue life eternall, and ſhould dwell in Chriſt,
and Chriſt in them, &amp;c. and to ſay this is a moſt great abſurdity.
Therefore it followeth, that ſuch eate not the fleſh, nor drink
his bloud. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conſidering this he ſayd: The other
Diſciples did eat <hi>Panem Dominum,</hi> the Lord which was bread,
but <hi>Iudas</hi> did eat <hi>Panem Domini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tractat. 59. in Iohannem.</note> the bread of the Lord: as if he
had ſayd: <hi>Iudas</hi> wanting faith, and receiuing the Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
did not eat the body, nor drinke the bloud of Chriſt,
which the other Apoſtles did, becauſe they had faith, and did
eate it worthily: but <hi>Iudas</hi> did only eat &amp; drinke the ſacrament
of the body and bloud of Chriſt. Alſo in the 21. booke <hi>de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate
Dei cap.</hi> 25. he ſayth: It is not to bee thought that he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the body of Chriſt, which is not in the body of Chriſt,
nor in whom Chriſt is not, nor hee in Chriſt. <hi>Origen</hi> vppon
thoſe wordes,<note place="margin">Origen ſuper Math. 15. 11,</note>

man, &amp;c.</hi> manifeſtly ſayth, that the wicked doe not eate the
body of Chriſt: and giueth the reaſon: becauſe the bodie of
Chriſt (ſayth he) is quickening, and he which eateth it, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

bee there in the Fathers, that proue our doctrine, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
&amp;c. not to eate nor drinke the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt.
But thoſe which wee haue alleaged, are now ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Another abſurditie there is,<note place="margin">The 2 abſurdity</note> and this it is, that the banquet
being to be common and generall to all: by which it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Communion: one onely at his pleaſure eateth it and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
all, without giuing part to others. Who taught them
thus to doe? Not Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, nor the primitiue
Church. In old time, all thoſe that were preſent when the
Supper of the Lord was celebrated did communicate, and
that in both kindes. And except they did communicate they
depriued them of the Supper, which our Aduerſaries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
denie. So confeſſeth <hi>George Caſſander</hi> in the Preface of
the booke intituled <hi>Ordo Romanus de officio Miſſae:</hi> for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
hereof hee alleadgeth the tenth Cannon of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
where it is commaunded, that all the faithfull which
were found preſent at the holy ſolemnities of the Church,
and continued not till the Maſſe were ended, nor receiued the
holie Communion, ſhould bee caſt from the Communion.
He citeth the Councell of Antioch, the ſecond chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is ordayned, that all they which enter into the Church
of God, and receiue not the holy Communion, ſhould bee
caſt out of the Church. Hee alleaged alſo the Cannon of
<hi>Calixtus</hi> (or as ſay others) <hi>Anacletus,</hi> which commandeth:
that the conſecration ended, all ſhould communicate. Hee
alleageth alſo <hi>Iohn Coclaeus,</hi> in the booke which hee intituled
<hi>De Sacrificio Miſſae, contra Muſculum.</hi> In old time ſaith <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus.</hi>
Aſwell the Prieſtes, as the Laitie, ſo manie as were
found preſent at the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, the offering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, did ioyntly with the Prieſt communicate, &amp;c.
And the ſame Cannon which they ſay in their Maſſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this to bee clearely vnderſtood: becauſe it maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people, ſtanding about, offering and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating.
For which cauſe ſome expounders of the Cannons
ſay: that the Cannon ought not to be ſayd in the Maſſe, but
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:19632:180"/>
onely when the people communicate. Many more Councels
and Fathers might be alleaged to confirme that which <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
ſayth: but the thing being ſo manifeſt, many witneſſes ſhal
be needleſſe. The Grecians vntill this day obſerue the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cuſtome: there is no priuate Maſſe among them. Vpon
the Lords dayes and feſtiuall dayes,<note place="margin">The papiſtes which heare the Maſſe &amp; Communicate not are ex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by their owne Cannons.</note> the Supper of the Lord
is onely celebrated, and the people in both kindes communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
Our aduerſaries may ſee what hath beene the cauſe of
leauing this ancient and laudable cuſtome, and that as many
alſo as heare the Maſſe, and communicate not, incurre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Excommunication. The Communion in our time, is but
once a yeare celebrated, and this with damage and great ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie:
and all the dayes in the yeare, is no other thing done,
but ſaying of Maſſes in euery corner of the Churches, and in
thoſe alſo of particular houſes, without any Communion: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be that ſome for deuotion will communicate: and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it happeneth, that none is found preſent at theſe Maſſes,
but the Nouice onely that anſwereth, <hi>Et cum Spiritu tuo,</hi> and
with thy ſpirit:<note place="margin">The Nouices commonly are little villaines.</note> when the Prieſt hath ſaid vnto him, <hi>Dominus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcum,</hi>

then hath this their priuate Maſſe with the holy Supper of the
Lord which is a common banquet, propoſed to the whole
Church. Reade the tenth and eleuenth chapters of the firſt epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the Corinthians, which before we haue alleaged. What
wickednes do they then that conuert the Maſſe into the ſupper
of the Lord: which they neuer celebrate, except the whole
Church, or the greateſt part of it do communicate, acording to
the inſtitution of Chriſt, &amp; according to that which his Apoſtles
did, and the Church many yeares after.</p>
               <p>The 3.<note place="margin">The 3. Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</note> abſurdity is that which before we haue ſaid, that were
there Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation, Chriſt ſhuld haue 2 carnal bodies, one
which ſate, &amp; the other which this ſitting body did eate, &amp; giue
to his Diſciples. The fourth Abſurditie is, that they put the
body of Ieſus Chriſt in diuerſe places at one inſtant,<note place="margin">The 4. Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</note> in all the
Maſſes which are ſayd through the world: Againſt the order

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:19632:181"/>
that is finite, can be at one ſelfe ſame time in diuerſe places.
The body of Ieſus Chriſt conſidered it ſelfe, is finite, and in
time created: therefore can it not bee in diuerſe places at one
inſtaut. In this do they alſo againſt the article of our faith, which
in the Creed we confeſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt ſitteth at the right
hand of God the Father. From whence ſhall he come (ſaith the
article of our faith) to iudge the quicke and the dead. Alſo they
do againſt common experience: for ſeeing bread and wine
with the eyes, taſting them with the mouth, and ſmelling them
with the noſe, yet for all this, ſay they, that no bread nor wine
remaineth. I demaund now, when they burne this their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the cauſes that they themſelues in the booke <hi>de Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telis</hi>
do command it to be burned: I demaund of them, what is
that which is burned and conuerted into aſhes? Not the bodie
of Chriſt, which now being glorified, is impaſſible, nor the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of the bread, nor of the wine: for the ſubſtance of the
aſhes, engendred of that which was burned, could not bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered
but of another ſubſtance: according to that which
commonly is ſaid: The generation of one thing is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another: It followeth then Albeit it grieue them &amp; that
they deny it) that the bread is burned. I demaund of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
when the Prieſt deuideth the Hoſt into three partes: what
is that which he deuideth? Some ſay they bee accidents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſubiect. To others this anſwere not ſeeming to be good,
becauſe not the accidents, but the ſubſtance, which hath quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
is parted: Therefore ſay they, that nothing is parted. This
people thinke vs to be blocks and fooles. They will make vs
(as they ſay) <hi>del cielo cebolla,</hi> to beleeue things impoſſible. Free
ſhould they be from all theſe abſurdities, would they with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, with his Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church confeſſe true bread and true wine to be in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
of which bread and of which wine being corrupted,
are engendred thoſe things before ſpoken. So that the wormes
and aſhes are engendred and made, not of the body of Chriſt,
which is glorious, and ſet at the right hand of the Father:
not of the accidentes, which haue not other being: but
doe remaine in ſome ſubiect, (and by a miracle ſay they,
the accidentes in the Sacrament, bee without ſubiect) but
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:19632:181"/>
are made of the bread and of the wine which is corrupted or
burned. Now for confirmation of that which we haue ſayd:
we will ſet downe an Appendix or addition,<note place="margin">The eſtimation wherein the pope holdeth his God the Sacrament.</note> which with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

Popes and their people, which the call eccleſiaſticall, hold

thine eyes ô Spaine, and be no more by the Pope deceiued.
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, which before was called <hi>Hildebrand,</hi>
was (as in his life we haue ſayd) a terrible and mortall enemie
of the good Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: &amp; ſo deſperately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by all wayes and meanes poſſible, now by force, now
by dececit, now by inchantments to pull him out of the world.
And for that purpoſe ſuborned with promiſe of reward, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

Cardinall <hi>Benon</hi> goeth further, he ſaith: that the Pope
with high voyce from the pulpit vpon the feaſt of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at Eaſter, had prophecied the death of the Emperour
<hi>Henrie,</hi> ſaying: Hold me not for Pope, but caſt me from the
Altar, if that which I ſay vnto you bee not fulfilled betweene
this and Pentecoſt: and ſo to proue a true prophet, in this which
he had ſpoken, he ſuborned certaine Traytors that ſecretly
ſhold kill the Emperor: As in dede they had killed him had not
God preſerued him. The ſayd Cardinall ſayeth further: that this
<hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. euer wontedly carried with him a
booke of Nigromancie, that was to him very familiar. He caſt
(ſaith hee) the conſecrated Hoſt into the fire and burned
it.<note place="margin">The pope caſt the Hoſte into the fire &amp; the cauſe.</note> Becauſe, demaunding of it a reuelation againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

of the ſaid <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth, alleageth Cardinall
<hi>Benon</hi> for confirmation of that which is ſayd. A ſtrange caſe it
is, to caſt the Sacrament into the fire, for that coniuring it, it
gaue him not anſwer againſt the Emperour. Our aduerſaries
cannot denie this Pope to haue erred in the faith,<note place="margin">The pope er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in faith.</note> and alſo to
haue bene an Athieſt, without God or religion: ſeeing that he
burned his Creator. If he beleeued it to be his Creator why did

doe not beleeue it why did he with fire and bloud, perſecute

would require another as great a time, as had the Inquiſitors
when they drew her into the Act, in the great Church of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua:
which Act was in the ſpring time, and laſted from ſixe of
the clocke in the morning, till foure in the euening. In all this
time was no other thing read but the abominations and falſe
miracles of this curſed woman.<note place="margin">The falſe miracles of magdalen de la Cruz.</note> Of her it was ſayd, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
in a ſtorme did pray vnto her, and ſhe being inuocated,
appeared vnto them, and ſo the ſtorme ceaſed. Of her alſo it is
ſayd, that ſhe burned in liuely flames, like the Seraphin (this
very well agreeth with her, ſhe being of the order of Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

wrapped vp in ſpirit, and heard wonders which mortall man
could not vtter. In this laſt was ſhe made another Saint <hi>Paul:</hi>
who was wrapped vp into the third heauen, where he hard, &amp;c.
Of her alſo is it ſayd, that when ſhe did communicate, ſhe lifted
vp an elle to meaſure the height of the ground, and ſo being lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

went out of the hands of the Prieſt that ſayd the Maſſe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

receiue the Sacrament: whoſe life we will declare in the

this by the arte of the diuell? The prieſt which ſaid the Maſſe
counted his fourmes, according to the nomber of the Nunnes,
that were to communicate: being counted did conſecrate
them. And conſecrated, found ſo many others, as before he
had counted: and none hee wanted, but that onely which he
ſaw go into the ayre, and entred into the mouth of <hi>Magdalene</hi>

ſhe was in the garden, and the ſacrament by chaunce, paſſed by
the ſtreete, the wall of the garden opened, and that then, ſhee
did worſhippe it. Of her it is alſo ſayd: that ſhee fayned not
to haue eaten in ſo many dayes togither, but that ſhee was
nouriſhed onely with the ſacrament which he receaued. So
great was the opinion of her holineſſe, that great Ladies of
Spaine ſeeing themſelues at point of childe birth, ſent to <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen

his abhominable life? I dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of him, if with praiers teares ſighes

at Gods hand for his offence? And if hauing reputed, he put
from him, his concubine, with intent neuer more to receiue her
He neuer had (ſayd he) any ſuch purpoſe. I ſayd vnto him:
How then ſaydeſt thou euerie day Maſſe? How maideſt thou
no ſcruple to eate the bread of the Lord, and to drinke of his
holie cuppe, thy conſcience accuſing thee, of ſo enormious
a ſinne? Dideſt thou not feare that the earth would open,
and ſwallowe thee vp quick? I ſtill inſiſting and conſtrayning
him; at laſt, he confeſſed, that not pronouncing the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
wordes wherewith is conſecrated the ſacrament, that hee
ſhould not vnworthilie receiue the bodie and bloud of the
Lord he had not conſecrated. What ſayeſt thou? Sayd I
I tell you that which paſſed, (anſwered hee) and the ſame
is truth. Alas, Alas, ſayd I, dareſt thou committe ſo
horrible, and neuer once heard of wickedneſſe? Is it poſſible
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:19632:185"/>
that thou gaueſt ſo great an occaſion, of ſo horrible Idolatry?
The people at your eleuation kneeled on their knees, caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the earth, lifted vp the handes, towards the altar,
ſtroke their breaſts, and worſhipped the vnconſecrate bread
and cuppe. What thing is this? I tremble to ſpeake it. But God
(ſayd I) if thou repent not, will doubtleſſe ſometimes giue
thee, the puniſhment, that for ſuch abhomination and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
thou deſerueſt. But what neede many words? When
I with wordes had earneſtly reprooued him, my gallant
(who not with wordes, but with priſon and irons deſerued
to bee puniſhed) began to excuſe his fault, ſaying: that it was
not ſo great, and that he was not alone, but many more, did
the ſame: which thought it not ſo abhominable an offence, as
I made it, &amp;c. This far the ſaid author.</p>
               <p>All they that heard the maſſe of thoſe men, &amp; adored the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
which they lifted vp: by their owne Cannons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted idolatry. For this is their Maxim that he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crateth
not, which hath no intention to conſecrate and as little
doth he conſecrate that pronounceth not the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration:<note place="margin">He conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not that hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate.</note>
miſerable is the religion of thoſe that depend vpon the
intention of another. And who knoweth the intent of man, but
God alone, which ſearcheth the harts? In the meane time ſhall
man doubt, whether that be God, which he worſhippeth, or no.

All they that heard their Maſſes, committed Idolatry. As little
did all they, that were ordayned in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> 1. and
of Pope <hi>Ione,</hi> conſecrate. For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being a laye man,
and without receiuing any orders was by force, which <hi>Deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

neither ſhee, nor they by her ordayned, nor they which by

loathed, I will recite here an hiſtorie, which in the 1526. yeare
in a Monaſtery of Dominican Fryars of the towne of Auſerra
in Fraunce and vppon the ſolemne feaſt day of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi>
happened. There was a Friar in the ſayd coue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who by reaſon
of his age, and chiefly for being eaten with the Bubos, had not
ſayd Maſſe now of many dayes before: This increaſing in him
deuotion, he tooke courage to ſay Maſſe, vppon ſo ſolemne a
day. So that, hee ſayd Maſſe, and finiſhed it. His Maſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and hee going through the cloiſter of the Monaſterie, his
ſtomack turned, and beeing not able to digeſt &amp; retaine God:
which hee had in bodie and bloud receiued, did vomit him vp
before the chapter gate, Which thing once knowne a great
rumour was preſently rayſed througout all the Couent. Some
ſayd this thing, others that thing ſhould bee done. But in
fine hauing ſome time diſputed vppon this matter, they
concluded that the Tabernacle or tombe which they vſe to
put on the graues, when they celebrate the Office of the dead,
ſhould be placed ouer that holy vomit. And ſo was it done,
And this, that none ſhould tread vppon, nor any dogges
ſhould eate that holie ſacramentall vomit. And the more to
honour it, foure light tapers they placed vpon the foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the tombe. This done, the Nouices were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ſing all that day, the verſe of the hymnes which is ſung
vppon that day of <hi>Corpus Chriſti:</hi> and beginneth: <hi>Tantum
ergo Sacramentum veneremur cerni, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:19632:186"/>
Better ſhould they haue ſayd. This vomit of a poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky
father, They ſang alſo, the Anthem, of the ſame day, <hi>O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum
conuiuium:</hi> O holy banquet. But how holie ſoeuer they
ſayd it was, there was none (albeit ſome thereto exhorted the
reſt) that would taſt it, nor put it into his bodie. For after the
booke of <hi>de cautelis,</hi> as they call them, the beſt remedy is this
that in ſuch caſe can bee taken, ſith among them all there was
none of them, that dared to eate it: needefull it was, another
ſhift ſhould bee vſed. And thus it was: In the beſt wiſe they
could gathered they vp that holie vomit, and very curiouſly
daubed the ground where it had fallen. The Subprior then for
that he Prior was from home) arraied himſelfe in holy orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and with light tapers carried the vomite to the Church
in proceſſion. Some ſang that which before we haue ſaid: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(and theſe were the moſt holy frantiques and greateſt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites)
ſighed and groned for the moeſtful ſpectacle that they
ſaw: which much marred the feaſt: the vomit thus carried to the
Church a new deliberation was needful what therewith ſhould
to be done: The opinion of the moſt ancient and moſt learned
was, that this vomit ſhould be caſt into the fire and burned to
aſhes:<note place="margin">The papiſts burne the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which they beleeued to be God.</note> &amp; ſuch aſhes ſhould be kept in <hi>el Sagrario,</hi> the Sanctuary:
all which was done, as in their booke <hi>de Cautelis,</hi> &amp;c. in ſuch caſe
it is commanded. So that the papiſts conclude themſelues their
God to be burned: their god I cal it, for this is their doctrin: that
all the time that any forme or ſhew of bread or of wine ſhall be
ſeen, al the time that it ſhal not be digeſted (as was not that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Pocky father vomited it vp with the reſt,) the bread is not
bread but the bodie of Chriſt; and the wine is not wine, but
the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We haue recited the ſorrowfull ſpectacle that happened to
the Friars Dominickes,<note place="margin">A Chough burned and the cauſe.</note> with their Sacrament vomited and
burned: Now will we declare another, which one which
was preſent and an eye-witneſſe tolde me, that happened to
the Franciſcan Friers, but not ſo lothſome as the other. In
the Couent <hi>De Alta vila,</hi> which was in the prouince of the
principalitie of the kingdome of Naples, was an ancient
Friar, called Frier <hi>Antonio de Contron,</hi> who for his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had nouriſhed vp a Chough, and had taught her to fly
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:19632:186"/>
vp vppon his ſhoulders, and to eate bread in his hand, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch like thinges. When the Friar one Sabboth of the
Aduent in the thouſand fiue hundred threeſcore ſeuenteene
yeare was ſaying the high Maſſe in the ſayd Couent, and lift
vp the Hoſte, that they (as they are woont) ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the ſame: The Chough which then hopped to and fro,
ſawe the Hoſte, and ſuppoſed that her maiſter ſhewed her
ſomething to giue her. The Frier in the meane time pulled
downe his Hoſte: and the Chough remained there, watching
if her maiſter ſhould mocke her with anie thing againe.
Whiles the Chough thus awayted: behold, when the Friar
the ſecond time ſhewed the Hoſte ouer his ſhoulders, the
Chough ſeeing it, immediately leaped vppon the ſhoulder
of her maiſter, and caught hold of the Sacrament, and by
flight pearched vppon a beame in the roofe of the Church.
When the Friars, and the reſt that heard the Maſſe, ſawe
this, they beganne to call vnto her, but ſhee would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anſwere, nor come downe, for ſhee was buſied with
her breakefaſt which (as ſhee thought her maiſter had giuen
her. When good wordes nought auayled, they beganne to
throwe ſtones and cudgels at her, vntill they brought her to
the ground. And now had ſhee eaten all the Hoſte, a fewe
crommes excepted, which had fallen downe from her (and
note, that according to the opinion of our aduerſaries, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſmall cromme is God,) they tooke the poore Chough,
and taken, did ſentence her to bee burned, till ſhee were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
into aſhes: which was perfourmed, and her aſhes were
kept in the Sanctuarie, as were the other of the vomite of the
pockie Father.</p>
               <p>Into ſo manie ſtrange thinges cauſeth Tranſubſtantiation
our aduerſaries to fall. They beleeue that the bread is no bread,
but the body of Chriſt. Hence it commeth that they beleeue
the mouſe, the worme, the chicken, the Chough, &amp;c. to eate
the body of Chriſt. But to manifeſt the deceit vnto them (if they
leaue to be deceiued) let them well note, what here we will
ſay: and this it is: Two kinds of creatures may eate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The one, which haue the vſe of reaſon: and the other
that haue not: thoſe which haue it not are beaſtes: Theſe
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:19632:187"/>
creatures without vſe of reaſon eate only bread and drinke
wine: the ſacrament of Chriſts body eate they not: neither doe
they drinke the ſacrament of his bloud:<note place="margin">Vnreaſonable creatures eat not Chriſt nor his Sacrament but only the bread.</note> much leſſe doe they
eate the body of Chriſt or drinke his bloud, and ſo to eate the
bread or not to eat, they neither reioice nor be ſad. Men which
haue the vſe of reaſon; are two folde: Some doe worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the ſacrament; and others vnworthily. They that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
receaue the ſacrament, are thoſe, which doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their conſciences, Nor proue themſelues, before they
receaue the ſacrament: &amp; to them it is all one, to ſit at the table
of the Lord,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. 21.</note> and to ſit at the table of the deuill: to receaue the

preſenteth vnto them:<note place="margin">The wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the body and bloud of Chriſt but not the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt. Tract. 54 in Iohannem.</note> or to receaue the Idoll, which the Pope
in his Maſſe putteth in his mouth. Such as theſe receaue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the bread and wine (if it be giuen them) But receaue alſo
the ſacrament of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt: And this for
their condemnation and not for their ſaluation. And ſo Sathan
entreth in and poſſeſſeth them: As after the taking of the
ſoppe hee entred into and poſſeſſeth <hi>Iudas.</hi> Such as theſe, doe
no way receaue Chriſt, for the cauſe which wee haue ſhewed
When wee proued the wicked, not to receaue Chriſt: not to
receaue the Lords bread, but the bread of the Lord. As ſaith
Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Iudas.</hi> They that worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the ſacrament, bee they which examine their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
how they ſtand towards their God, and towards their
neighbour. The which S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 11. calleth prouing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
And finding themſelues faulty &amp; imperfect doe humble
themſelues before God, repent, &amp; withall their hart craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
&amp; mercy. This done, not truſting in their owne worthines
but in the worthines of Chriſt, they are bold to receiue the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
not to their condemnation, but their ſaluation. For
Chriſt, doth poſſeſſe them &amp; incorporateth them into himſelfe,
and he incorporateth himſelfe into them. Theſe be they alone,
which receiue not only the bread &amp; wine: but alſo the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt; by the bread, &amp; by the wine ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified:
&amp; receauing the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt
they receiue truly &amp; really, the glorious body &amp; bloud of chriſt
yet not carnally, but ſpiritually by faith. As before we haue ſaid.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:19632:187"/>
would our aduerſaries admit this ſo true and cleare doctrine
that bringeth with it no abſurdities, but rather taketh away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
which the word of God doth teach vs, and the ancient
Doctors doe witneſſe, they would not beleeue that the mouſe,
the chicken, the poore Chough, &amp;c. doe eate the bodie of
Chriſt, but a peece of bread, and that but of ſmall ſubſtance,
and ſo would they not burne, nor being burned, preſerue their
aſhes.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit here to tell that which on the ſame day of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Chriſti,</hi> did an Inquiſitor in Bercelona. The tale is this: It
is 34. or 35. yeares, little more or leſſe ſince, that being to go in
ſolemne proceſſion, which with ſo great pompe and triumph is
vpon this day of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> accuſtomed to be done through
out all Spaine: and the Prieſt hauing now ſung the high Maſſe,
which wontedly is the laſt vpon that day (for all the Prieſts will
that day go in proceſſion) it then hapned, that the conſecrated
Hoſt, which was to be put in the boxe, was ſo great that it could
not be placed in the ſame. This ſeen, the preparation ſtaied: and
there was none in that famous companie, that could tel in ſuch a
caſe what ought to be done. But in the end, the wiſeſt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were of opinion, that another Maſſe ſhould be ſayd, and
an Hoſt conſecrated of the like bignes with the boxe: but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
it was vnto them to waite ſo long: &amp; it might be alſo, that
no Prieſt was found, which had not already ſaid his Maſſe, and
broken his faſt, the better to be able to go in proceſſion: which
as that day is very ſolemne, and is farre in going and comming.
In this famous companie was there an Inquiſitor much ſpoken
of, called <hi>Molon.</hi> This man impatient to ſuffer ſo much delay, &amp;
waite ſo long a time,<note place="margin">They wil not ſay that the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor clipped the body of Chriſt, ſeeing it is now glorified: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he clipped the bread or whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſubſtance.</note> preſuming vpon his Inquiſitory authority,
demanded a paire of ſheeres, wherewith he clipped the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
Hoſt: ſo that he made it fit for the boxe, and ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
went forward. It is to bee thought that ſome did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
the raſhneſſe of the Inquiſitor, and ſighed to ſee their
God and Creator (as they call the ſacrament) ſo handled by the
wicked hands of the Inquiſitor. Others would ſay otherwiſe.
This is moſt certain, that had any other but the Inquiſitor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſuch an offence, and chiefly had he bene of any race of
a new Chriſtian, he ſhould not (I ſuppoſe) haue eſcaped with
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:19632:188"/>
life: one by one, al that he had he ſhould haue loſt. The chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherewith <hi>Signor Molon</hi> was puniſhed for ſo enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a fault, was; that they depriued him of his inquiſitors Office
in Barcelona but becauſe ſo notable an Inquiſitor ſhould not
be idle, they prouided for him the office of the inquiſitor at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:
where hee better might vſe his handes in the time of the
great perſecution, which a few yeares before was raiſed: as in
the life of <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. and the 1557. yeare we haue declared:
This was the great puniſhment which they gaue to better
him withall.</p>
               <p>We will then conclude this Treatiſe with a notable hiſtory
reported by <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who ended
his hiſtory (as himſelfe at the end thereof witneſſeth) in the
yeare of the Lord 1243. and in the 26. yeare of king <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
and in the time of the great vacation of <hi>Gregorie</hi> 9. So
that it is now three hundred fifty fiue yeares ſince he wrote it.
The ſaid Archbiſhop, in his ſixt booke and twentie fiue
chapter, That the Office which they call <hi>Toledano</hi> by <hi>Iſidorus</hi>
and <hi>Leander</hi> ordayned, was throughout all Spaine celebrated,
vntill king <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> the ſixt, which wanne <hi>Toledo,</hi> at the
inſtance of his wife Queene <hi>Conſtance,</hi> Frenchwoman, ſent to
Rome to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. requeſting him that the <hi>Toledan</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
being taken away, the Roman Office throughout all
Spaine might be vſed, &amp;c. And in the 26. chap. he ſaith, that
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. at the petition of king <hi>Don Alonſo,</hi> ſent one
<hi>Ricardus,</hi> Abbot of Saint Victor, to ſet in good order the
Churches of Spaine. This Legate ſent by the Pope (as the
ſame Archbiſhop reporteth) did wickedly gouerne: ſo that he
was depriued from his office. Before he was depriued he much
diſturbed the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall and common wealth of
Spaine, For the Legate and the King cauſed them to take the
French Office, and to leaue the Toledan, wherein they and
their Anceſtors had beene brought vp by the ſpace almoſt of
fiue hundred yeares: which was from Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt,
in whoſe time liued Saint <hi>Leander</hi> and his brother Saint <hi>Iſidor,</hi>
Archbiſhops of Seuil, vntill this <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth, in whoſe
time reigned <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> the ſixt and ſo vppon a certaine day
for his pleaſure, was this matter very truly debated in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:19632:188"/>
of the king, the Primate, the Legate, and the people.
The Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, Nobilitie (which the Archbiſhop
calleth <hi>Militia)</hi> and people did purpoſely much withſtand it,
endeuouring what they could, that their ſeruice ſhould not
be changed. But the king perſwaded by his wife, a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
inſiſted with threates vnleſſe it were chaunged.</p>
               <p>The concluſion was thus: Two knights were named to fight,
the one for the king, which ſhould defend the French Office:
the other for the Nobilitie and Communaltie of Spaine, which
ſhould maintaine the office of Toledo. Hee that tooke part
with the king was vanquiſhed: &amp; the people ſeeing the knight
of the Toledan Office was victor, reioyced. But ſo greatly was
the king pricked forward by the Queene, that hee would not
chaunge his purpoſe 'ſaying: That the ſingle fight or (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of two) was not law. The knight which ſought for the Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
Office, was of the linage of the <hi>Matienças,</hi> whoſe race as
yet liueth. And when for this cauſe aroſe great tumult (for the
Nobilitie and people did greatly mutine) it was determined,
that the booke of the Toledan Office, and the booke of the
French Office ſhould bee caſt into a great fire: all being firſt
commanded to aſſemble and pray together. Then after they
had deuoutly ioyned together and prayed, both the one booke
and the other were caſt into the fire. And the booke of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledan
Office aroſe vp ſafe and ſound without dammage aboue
all the flames of the great fire.<note place="margin">The Romane office was caſt into the fire, &amp; burned but not the Goti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

preſent, &amp; gaue thanks vnto God. But the king being of an high
ſtomacke, and bold executor of his will, neither feared by the
miracle, nor moued by requeſt, perſeuered rather in his
purpoſe, threatening the loſſe of goods and life to thoſe
that ſhould reſiſt him: and ſo commaunded that the
French Office (which was now the ſame with the Roman)
ſhould bee celebrated through all his kingdome. And then
all weeping and ſwearing,<note place="margin">From whence commeth this ſaying. As the King wil, ſo go the Lawes.</note> the old Spaniſh Prouerbe began
to be ſaid:
<q>
                     <l>Alla van leyes, do quieren Reyes.</l>
                     <l>As the king will, ſo go the lawes.</l>
                  </q>
And from that time was the French Office kept in Spaine, as
well in the Pſalter, as in the reſt, which neuer before that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:19632:189"/>
time had bin receiued nor vſed in Spaine: yet in ſome monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
it was afterwards vſed for a time: And the tranſlation of the

day is alſo vſed. Thus farre the Archbiſhop. In this hiſtorie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Archbiſhop, is there much to be noted. Firſt,
that now 500 yeares paſt (for ſo long time is it ſince <hi>Gregorie</hi>
the ſeuenth died, in whoſe time reigned <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> the
ſixt) the diuine Office celebrated in all our countrie of Spaine
was not the Roman, but the Gothiſh, which they called the
Toledane office. This office was changed through the deſire
of a French woman, who ſo greatly pricked forward the king
her husband, that he chaunged the ancient Office, maugre the
ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, Nobilitie, and all the Communaltie of
Spaine. The Pope alſo that commanded the Office ſhould be
chaunged, was one of the moſt abominable that did eate bread
in his time. Many wrote his life: A great inchanter he was: by
force of Armes without any election he made himſelfe Pope:
A tyrant he was, an heretike: he burned the Sacrament of the
Altar, his God. And the moreouer, which in his abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life we haue declared. For which enormious ſinnes, in
his abſence (for he would not appeare) hee was condemned
and depriued, in the Councell of Brixa. And <hi>Clement</hi> the
third was made Pope in his place. The Legate of the Pope,
which dealt in this buſineſſe, of the chaunge of the Office,
was aſo another ſuch like as his maiſter that ſent him, and
ſo abode in the ſame with his maiſter and Lord. For his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
(as the Archbiſhop reporteth) was he depriued. In
theſe two, Pope and Legate, is the old Spaniſh Prouerbe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:
<hi>Qual Abad, tal Monazillo:</hi> Such Abbot, ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>Hereby ſhall our Spaniards perceiue, that the diuine Office
and Tranſlation of the Pſalter, which our forefathers vſed in
Spaine, vntill the yeare 1080, or little leſſe, was not the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
office: much leſſe was it the Maſſe, which now in Spaine
is ſo greatly eſteemed. For the Roman Office, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fiue hundred yeares was celebrated, was defiled with
the ſuperſtition and idolatry, which we now ſee in the Maſſe, as
be Tranſubſtantiation, the taking from the faithful the one half
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:19632:189"/>
of the Sacrament, Interceſſion and Inuocation of Saintes Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
&amp;c. Long time after, about the 1215. yeare, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
3. being Pope was Transubſtantiation admitted and made
an article of the faith. Albeit true it is, that this Gregory 7.
was the firſt that drawing it out of hell began to exalt it. And
notwithſtanding that the Romane Office then vſed was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo euill nor ought agreed in Idolatry with that which is
now yet is it to be thought there was great difference between
the Toledane and the Romane office, ſeeing that all Spaine ſo
purpoſely and truly oppoſed it ſelf to the king, the Queene, the
Pope, and his legate, and receiued not the Romane Office but
with great diſlike and forced by threats of life &amp; goods. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is to be noted which the Archbiſhop ſpeaketh concerning
the combat of the 2 Knights and of the friar, which (the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſh
Office remaining ſafe) then burned the Roman Office.
If they will haue miracles, this of the fire is ſtrange. D. <hi>Illeſcas

tooke it, but that of affected malice he changed ſome things:
whoſe words I will here ſet downe: When hee that defended

that the booke of the Toledan Office, and the booke of
the French Office ſhould bee caſt into a great fire. He ſaith not
Maſſe bookes) the Roman leaped out of the fire. and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſh
was not burned in it. The Archbiſhop ſaith, the booke of
the French Office was conſumed of the fire, and the booke of
the Toledan Office aroſe vp without receiuing any domage.
Here ſeeſt thou the maner of our aduerſaries dealings. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce

Miſſae,</hi> ſaith theſe words: But the Spaniards (As they be moſt
reſolute in the inſtitution which they haue once receiued) held
conſtantly for manie yeares the rites of their countrey. Their
rite was called the Rite of the Moſarabes: and ſo was it called,
becauſe the Chriſtians mingled with the Alarabes, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
the beſt part of Spaine, vſed the ſame, from the time of
Saint <hi>Llefonſo</hi> Archbiſhop of Toledo, and Saint <hi>Iſidor</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

in the time of King <hi>Don Rodrigo.</hi> The Chriſtians (ſaith this

no Chriſtian to liue in the Chriſtian religion. Theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
which liued among the Moores, were called Moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabes,
to wit, mingled with the Alarabes, and their diuine
Office compoſed by Saint <hi>Leander</hi> and Saint <hi>Iſidor,</hi> was called
the Moſarabiſh Office. He ſaith alſo: This Office at this day is
called Moſarabe, and is vſed in ſixe pariſhes in Toledo, and in
the Cathedrall Church, in the Chappell of Cardinall <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co

<hi>Vaſſeus</hi> what maaner of Office is this Moſorabe, and
how it is celebrated: But I much feare me, that the Office Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorabe,
now in the foreſayd places celebrated, either by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or diminiſhing, is much different from that, which Saint
<hi>Leander</hi> and Saint <hi>Iſidor</hi> made a thouſand yeares paſt. Of this
I feare me, becauſe the Popes haue bene verie diligent in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away that which hath bene contrarie to their doctrine,
and in adding that which made for them. And ſo ſuſpect I
many of the ceremonies and garments, that now (as ſaith <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus)</hi>
are vſed in the Office Moſorabe. In this opinion doe I
ſtrengthen my ſelfe, ſeeing that among other names of Saints
in the Office Moſorabe named, are named <hi>Ambroſe, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,
Fulgentius, Leander, Iſidor.</hi> And it is not to bee thought
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:19632:191"/>
that Saint <hi>Leander</hi> and Saint <hi>Iſidore,</hi> which compoſed this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſh
Office, would put their owne names among the names of
the Saints: and ſo thinke I, that they haue much added and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away to and from the Office <hi>Moſorabe,</hi> to make it hold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
with the Maſſe which now they ſay: and ſo to declare it
almoſt all to be one. But be it as it will be, either that they haue
added vnto it, or taken from it or not, I hold for a more ſure
thing the ſimplicitie and maner which Ieſus Chriſt, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Martyrs vſed in celebration of the holy ſupper, in the
primitiue Church. Imbrace we then the firſt inſtitution which
the Euangeliſts and Saint Paul, 1. Cor. 11. recite: and ſo ſhall
we not erre.</p>
               <p>By that we haue ſaid in this Appe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dix, thou ſhalt ſee moſt deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloued Spaine (God for his mercy open thineeies,) the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which the Pope &amp; his cleargy make of the Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
they affirme it to be God, &amp; not bread nor wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It they vſe
to reuenge their wrongs, hatreds and malice: and ſo in <hi>Florence</hi>
was the eleuation the ſigne to begin the murder. With it they
poiſon, as a little before we haue ſaid: They vſe it for an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benger
ſending it one or modaies iornies before, atended with
the baſeſt ſort of people: as in the beginning of this booke
we haue declared: For coniuration they vſe it: as did <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the ſeuenth, and becauſe the ſacrament did not anſwer him,
he caſt it into the fire, and burned it. The Dominicans of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerra
did alſo burne it: and the Franciſcans <hi>de Alta villa</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Chough, and in burning the Chough, they burned the
Sacrament which ſhe had eaten, &amp;c. And the booke which they
call <hi>de Cautelis,</hi> commanded in ſuch caſes, that they ſhould ſo
do. And when the Sacrament for want of renewing in time,
is become mouldy, it commandeth it to be burned, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
to be kept. <hi>Molon</hi> the Inquiſitor clipped it alſo. The book of
the Roman Office alſo was burned, the Gothiſh remaining mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
ſafe and ſound, as reporteth <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> Archbiſhop
of Toledo, before alleaged. Alſo ſeeing the diuell vſeth it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
as he deceiued the Pope, when he told him hee ſhould
not die vntill he had ſaid Maſſe in Ieruſalem, before by vs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

but not being prieſts, as before we haue ſaid, did not conſecrate
What ſhall we hereupon conclude? Two things, the firſt, that
the Popes and their eccleſiaſticall rable, which doe ſuch things
be Atheiſtes, without any God; or religion. The 2. That their
Maſſall ſacrament, albeit they ſay (though many of themſelues
beleeue it not) the ſame to be Gods is no God, but an Idoll ſet
in the place of God, and as God worſhipped. And if this be ſo;
why then do they perſecute them with fire &amp; bloud which (ſo
taught by the holy ſcripture) do well know the Maſſe, &amp; it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
ſacrament, to be a prophanation of the holie ſupper of the
Lord; to be a terrible abhomination and Idolatrie? The Maſſe
hath no agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the holy ſupper which the Lord inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; which his diſciples did celebrate: Compare the one with
the other (the which we wil do at the end of this Treatiſe) aſwel
touching the ſubſtaunce of that which is giuen; as alſo the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
with which it is giuen. And it is euidently to be ſeene,
that there is no more agreement betweene the holy ſupper, &amp;
the diueliſh Maſſe: then there is betweene light and darkneſſe:
betweene good &amp; euill, betweene truth &amp; falſhood betweene
Chriſt and <hi>Beliall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue paſſed by the Lordes aſſiſtaunce (whom with my
whole hart I beſeech to direct my ſteppes) two terrible laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes
of filthineſſe, and Idolatrie: which are the Pope aud his
Maſſe.<note place="margin">Of the true prieſthood and Sacrifice.</note> Now by the ſame aſſiſtaunce wee will enter into the
moſt pleaſant garden, into the moſt ſweete and moſt holie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
and garden full of all conſolation and comfort. Which
is the Treatiſe of the true prieſt, and of the true Sacrifice,
which this our high prieſt offered: with which, wee being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and ſonnes of wrath, he reconciled vs to God. Oh good
newes! Heare them then, O Spaine, and beleeue them. In
this Treatiſe I wilbe ſhort, for many things which were here to
be ſayd, haue we formerly ſayd in the confutation of the falſe
prieſtes, which is the Pope: and of the falſe ſacrifice which is
the Maſſe. And there haue we ſayd it, for confutation of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood:
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:19632:192"/>
For how can falſhood be confuted, but with the truth?
walke we then hence forth, as Children of truth and light.</p>
               <p>He that liſteth to knowe, who is this high prieſt, and what is
this his onely and eternall ſacrifice: Let him read the Epiſtle
which the Apoſtle wrote to the Hebrewes, &amp; there clerely ſhal
hee find both the one &amp; the other. And no booke there is in all
the holie ſcripture, which more to the purpoſe, and more axcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
handleth this argument, then this Epiſtle. An Epiſtle
truely, worthie for each faithfull Chriſtian to reade, and reade
againe, and to retaine in memorie: Seeing there in is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a matter ſo neceſſary, without the vnderſtanding &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereof, it is impoſſible for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſaued. For what thing
is more neceſſary, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to know, who my redeemer is: &amp; how he
hath redeemed me; &amp; ſo to beleeue in him, &amp; beleeuing in him,
to be thankful vnto him, by liuing in holines and righteouſneſſe
all the daies of my life? His maieſty pardon our imperfections, &amp;
ſupply that much which is wanting. But before we enter into this
matter.<note place="margin">That which we beleeue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and office of Chriſt.</note> Let vs declare that, which we beleue of Chriſt: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that Ieſus Chriſt is truely God, and truely man, &amp; that in as
much as he is God, he is equall with the father &amp; with the holy
Ghoſt, &amp; in nothing inferior. We confeſſe that in as much as he
is man, he is leſſe then the father, and leſſe then the holy Ghoſt,
and in nothing equal. We confeſſe theſe two, ſo far different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
diuine, &amp; humaine, not to haue bin vnited nor conioyned
for euer,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> but in time: as ſaith S. <hi>Paule</hi> when (ſaith he) the fulnes

vnder the lawe,<note place="margin">Io. 114.</note> &amp;c. The ſame ſaith S. <hi>Iohn. And the word was
made fleſh, and dwelled among vs.</hi> So that from thenceforth is hee
called, and is true God and true man: and ſo according to this
coniunction, Chriſt is leſſe then the father. For the father hath
made him, and giuen him vnto vs. For our king, Prophets and
prieſt.<note place="margin">The office of Chriſt is to be our King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and preſt.</note> Which three offices, the name of Chriſt ſignifieth,

becauſe theſe three kindes of men,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 1.</note> were in olde time annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

which he performeth: Offering a ſacrifice pleaſing, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto him. This did Ieſus Chriſt, offering vp himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Croſſe. Which ſacrifice one only time offered, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more reiteratetd (For reiteration ſhould ſhewe imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

vnto God, that he was pleaſed: and being pleaſed, was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled

to the Hebrewes. In the 1 chapter, it ſheweth the excellencie
and maieſtie of Chriſt aboue the Angels, and conſequently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all Creatures. In which it deuoteth his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. In the third
chapter, the Apoſtle calleth him the teacher of the will of God.
Which thing did the Prophets. chapter 13. 20. he calleth him
Great Paſtor. By Paſtor, he vnderſtandeth a teacher. And ſo in
the 7. verſe he ſaid. Remember your Paſtors which ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

offered to the father for vs, all this Epiſtle is full thereof.
Of which I will here make a ſhort Summarie concerning that
which toucheth his Prieſthood and ſacrifice. This then is that,
which we now promiſed to ſhewe. So neceſſary for a Chriſtian,
is this Doctrine of the Prieſthood and ſacrifice of Chriſt. That
without it,<note place="margin">Acts. 4. 12.</note> it is impoſſible to be ſaued. For (as ſaith Saint <hi>Peter)</hi>
there is no ſaluation in any other: and no other name there is

we then to the Summary: in the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle, the
Apoſtle ſheweth the excellencie of Chriſt aboue the Angels
The which he confirmeth with paſſages of the ſcripture. In the

Chriſt with <hi>Moſes:</hi> proueth Chriſt to be his ſuperior: wherefore
he exhorteth the Hebrewes to obey him; And that they ſhould

ſpeaking of Tranſubtantiation. In the 6. chap. he calleth Chriſt

occaſion of the laſt words of the chapter going before:
<hi>Thou art a prieſt for euer, after the order of Melchizedech,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
very fitly to intreate, who <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was, and wherein
he was like to Chriſt, without father (ſaith verſ. 3.) without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp;c. This done, the Apoſtle ſheweth the prieſthood of
Chriſt, which is after the order of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> to be much
more excellent, then the leuitical prieſthood. The cauſes which
he ſheweth, are that the prieſthood of Chriſt being come, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
&amp; aboliſhed the leuiticall prieſthood: that alſo of Chriſt
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:19632:194"/>
was inſtituted with another: The Lord ſweare (ſaith he) &amp; will
not repent, &amp;c. Pſal. 110. But the Leuitical prieſthood was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
without an oath, the prieſthood alſo of Chriſt is eternal, &amp;
euer holdeth his being &amp; vertue: the Leuiticallnot. Alſo Chriſt,
who exerciſeth this euerlaſting prieſthood, is much more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Aaron:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt is our continuell In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor.</note> which exerciſeth the Leuitical prieſthood: Of ſo great
vertue is the ſacrifice of Chriſt. That hauing one only time offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he left no place for any other expiatory ſacrifice. For he eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſaueth thoſe that come vnto God by him: euer liuing to
make interceſſion for them.<note place="margin">Heb 17. 25.</note> They need not then any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
but the only death &amp; paſſion of Chriſt. And as little haue
they need of any other Interceſſor, or mediator but only Chriſt.
Who ſo will not be contented with this only ſacrifice, nor with
this only interceſſor,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 13.</note> let him ſeeke for others better. To ſuch a
one, it wil happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that leauing the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of liuing water, he ſhal
dig ceſterns, which will hold no water. Alſo, of ſo vnmeaſurable
vertue is this ſacrifice which Chriſt one only time offered that it
neither ought, nor can be reiterated. For reiteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a moſt ſure
argument of imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And this is the cauſe why the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
facrifices were ſo, &amp; ſo often reiterated, becauſe the bloud of
calues, and of Goates, could not perfectly ſanctifie either thoſe
that offered them, or thoſe for whom they were offered. He that
will attentiuely read, &amp; meditate vpon this 7. chap. ſhall not
deſire any other ſacrifice but that only which Ieſus Chriſt one
onely time offered. Which was himſelfe: As verſe 27 is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The memory whereof the Lord commandeth vs to renewe
ſo often as we celebrate his holie ſupper.</p>
               <p>And this word (once) which the Apoſtle. chap. 9. verſe. 12.
25.<note place="margin">This worde once is much to be noted.</note> 26. 28. and chap. 10. 10. 12. 14. vſeth, is very much to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For vpon the word (once) groundeth the Apoſtle his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to proue the prieſthood of Chriſt to be much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
then the Leuitical prieſthood. For the Leuitical prieſts, rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
their ſacrifice which they offered: Firſt for their owne
ſinnes, and then for the ſinnes of the people: But Chriſt offered
not ſacrifices but one only ſacifice (to wit) himſelf: and not for
himſelfe (for he had no ſinne:<note place="margin">Eſay 53. 9. 1 peter. 2. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> neither was there any guile found
in his mouth) but for others. And this ſacrifice did he not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
offer, nor commanded it ſhould be oftentimes offered:
one only time did he offer it. In the 8. chap. the Apoſtle repeates
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:19632:194"/>
that which he had ſaid in the chap going before concerning the
heauenly &amp; euerlaſting prieſthood of Chriſt. In the 9. chap. he
three or foure times repeateth the word <hi>once.</hi> In the 10. chap.
verſ. 10. he repeateth the word <hi>once.</hi> In the 5. and 12. <hi>One ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
and verſ. 14. <hi>One only offering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto treateth the Apoſtle of the Prieſthood &amp; ſacrifice of
Chriſt:<note place="margin">After the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</note> and as in the word, <hi>after the order of Melchiſedech,</hi> there
remaineth great myſtery: for by it the Apoſtle proueth the
Prieſthood of Chriſt to be eternal, repeating the ſame as (wee
haue ſeen) for a word of ſo great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. So alſo in the word
<hi>Once,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſo often repeateth is there great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
for therby two things are proued. The firſt is, that there is no
other ſacrifice to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, but onely that
which Ieſus Chriſt offered. The ſecond is, that this ſacrifice is, &amp;
euer ſhall be of ſo great vertue and efficacie,<note place="margin">Once.</note> as it was the day,
houre and moment when Chriſt offered it: for which cauſe it
neither ought, nor may be reiterated, without doing moſt great
iniurie to Chriſt: as though his ſacrifice which he once offered,
were not fufficient to obtain pardon for all ſins: &amp; that therefore
another new ſacrifice were needful, or at the leaſt to reiterat the
old. All, as many as were, or ſhalbe ſaued, not onely ſince the
death of Chriſt, but before his death alſo, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt iuſt <hi>Abel,</hi>

ſacrifice once offered. Otherwiſe muſt he often haue ſuffered
ſince the foundation of the world. But now in the end of the
world hath he appeared once to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of
himſelfe:<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 26.</note> Theſe be the words of the Apoſtle: againſt which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

profit thoſe that in the time of Chriſt, or ſithence liued: but
all thoſe alſo, which were long time before fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning
of the world. For all before the death of Chriſt, which beleeued
that the ſeed of the woman (which is Chriſt) ſhould breake the
head of the ſerpent (which is the diuel) were neither more nor
leſſe ſaued, then theſe which ſithence the death of Chriſt,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:19632:195"/>
beleeue that he is come and that by dying he hath ouercome
the deuill.<note place="margin">All one faith haue Wee aud the faithfull of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> In the ſame God whom we beleeue, beleued they:
the ſame faith which wee hold held they: and by the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Ieſus Chriſt one only time &amp; no more offred they &amp;
we are ſaued: The ſame Sacraments as touching the ſubſtance
that we haue, had they. So wittneſſeth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<hi>Moreouer, Brethren I would not that yee ſhould be ignorant,
That all our fathers were vnder the cloud and all paſſed through the
Sea:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and were all baptiſed vnto Moſes in the cloud and in the ſea,
and did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meate and did all drinke the ſame
ſpirituall drinke: for they dranke of the ſpirituall Rocke that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
them which Rock was Chriſt.</hi> This is the difference between
them and vs, that they beleeued Chriſt the Meſſias, ſhuld come
and we beleeue that he is already come, and hath fulfilled all
whatſoeuer was written of him. We then here conclude; that
with one only ſacrifice, which Ieſus Chriſt offred, and this one
only time, and no more he ſanctified for euer all thoſe that from
the beginning of the world haue bene, are, and ſhall be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
The Lord God, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were the children of wrath
and his enemies, hath ſhewed vs ſuch mercie, giue vs grace
firmely and conſtantly to perſeuer in this faith, &amp; perſeuering,
may liue in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture (as we haue ſeen) mentioneth two kinds
of Prieſts which offer ſacrifice for ſinnes:<note place="margin">Two kinds of preiſts.</note> the one after the order
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the other after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Many there
were after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe being mortall, they died,
and being dead one ſucceded another. After the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi>
no other Prieſt there is but only Chriſt: who being an
euerlaſting Prieſt, and his ſacrifice being of euerlaſting vertue,
admitteth no companion: for he only is ſufficient. This prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
ſhall ſhall endure for euer, and it is proper to the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein there is not, nor can be more then one onely
Prieſt, which neither hath, nor can haue companion nor ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
in his office. For he is an euerlaſting prieſt: and therefore his
offering one only time offered, is of euerlaſting vertue. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we then conclude, that if the Maſſe-prieſts (which ſay
they offer Chriſt in Sacrifice for the ſins of men) be Prieſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by God, either they ſo be after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or after
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:19632:195"/>
the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> (for of theſe two only orders the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
maketh mention.) But Prieſts they be not after the order
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which already ceaſed with the death of Chriſt. As lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
are they of the order of <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> for after this order
there is but one only Prieſt,<note place="margin">The Maſſe prieſts be not after the order of Aron, nor after the order of Melchiſedec but of Baal.</note> which is Chriſt. Hereuppon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that if they be Prieſts, not by God, but by the diuell be
they inſtituted: and ſo be they the Prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> May it pleaſe
our God and Lord to conuert them: Or if they bee veſſels of
wrath, to breake them with his rod of yron, that they doe not
more miſchiefe to the Catholique Church, the Spouſe of Ieſus
Chriſt, and with his precious bloud redeemed. I truſt in mine
omnipotent God that one day he will haue mercie vppon our
country of Spaine: and ſend the true <hi>Elias,</hi> which with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Gods word ſhal kill theſe falſe prophets &amp; filthy prieſts.</p>
               <p>Beſides the expiatory ſacrifice,<note place="margin">The Sacrifice Euchariſticall.</note> wherof we haue ſpoken, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
there is called Euchariſticall, of thankſgiuing: This ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
offereth and ought to offer euery faithfull and Catholique
Chriſtian: and for ſuch a one, he that offereth it not, neither is,
nor ought to be holden. What maner of ſacrifice this is, in the
beginning of this Treatiſe of the Maſſe we haue before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And if euery Chriſtian offer vnto God this kind of ſacrifice;
it followeth hereupon that euery Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Exod 19. 6.</note> ſeeing he offreth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
is a prieſt. And for this cauſe God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi>
to ſay theſe words to all the people of Iſrael,<note place="margin">peter. 2. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye ſhall be vnto me a
kingdom of Prieſts, and a holy nation.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking to all
the faithfull, ſaith: <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royall prieſthood, an
holy nation,, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the vertues
of him that hath called you out of darkneſſe into his maruellous light,
&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Reuelation, ſpeaking of the Lambe, ſaith:
<hi>Thou haſt made vs vnto our God kings &amp; prieſts.</hi> Of this which we
haue ſaid we conclude, Chriſt only to be the Preiſt, who offring
vp himſelfe &amp; this onely once, obtained for vs remiſſion of ſins:
&amp; that all faithful chriſtians are prieſts &amp; that not once, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
times, euery day, euery houre, &amp; euery moment (ſo ought it
to be done) do offer ſacrifices of praiſes vnto God. And why
ought we to praiſe God, &amp; to giue him thanks? For al the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which we receiue ech mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him touching both body &amp;
ſoule. But for this benefit chiefly that paſſeth all others which is
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:19632:196"/>
the ineſtimable benefit that we receiue by the death &amp; paſſion
of Chriſt. By the ſin of the firſt Adam we were all made ſinners
and ſeruants of ſinne, ſonnes of wrath, enemies of God and to
two ſorts of death, temporall and eternall of body &amp; ſoule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Strangers we were from the common wealth of Iſrael
which is the houſe of God: And ſo all the goodnes which was
in vs, was either wholly loſt and baniſhed from vs, or els cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and endamaged through ſinne: So that we cannot think
well, much leſſe can we doe well. The cauſe of all this is ſin:
which (as ſaith Saint Paul) entred into the world by <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> &amp;
by ſin, death: And ſo death went ouer all men: for as much as
all men haue ſinned. But contrary wiſe, by the righteouſnes of
the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt, by his obedience, by his death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(for of no leſſe power to ſaue was his obedience, then the
diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to condemne all) are we made
iuſt, free from ſin, ſonnes &amp; friends of God, heires of life eternal,
citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem, deſirous to do wel, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
vnto euil: and whatſouer wickednes is in vs, it is conuerted
into goodnes: For by Chriſt grace entred into the world, and
by grace, life,: and ſo went grace vnto all men in him, in whom
all men were ſaued. O my God, how vnſpeakeable is thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and goodneſſe, that thou ſo much louedſt the ſinfull world,
<hi>that thou gaueſt thine only begotten ſon, that euery one that beleeueth
in him ſhould not periſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>but haue euerlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> And if God
ſo loued the world, that he ſpared not his onely begotten ſon,
but gaue him vp for vs how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal he not giue vs al things with
him? Who ſhall lay anie thing to the charge of Gods elect? And
that moreouer which S. <hi>Paul</hi> to this purpoſe ſaith, Rom. 8. 32.
But God ſetteth out his loue or charitie towards vs: ſeeing, that
whiles wee were yet ſinners,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> Chriſt died for vs. Much more
then being now iuſtified by his bloud, ſhall wee be ſaued from
wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
vnto God by the death of his ſonne: much more now
being reconciled vnto God, ſhall wee be ſaued by his life, &amp;c.
Who ſo liſteth to know and meditate vppon that which Chriſt
did, and ſuffered to obtaine for him remiſſion of ſinnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
him with God: let him reade the hiſtorie which the
Euangeliſts ſet downe concerning the life and death of Chriſt:

he died, no other thing he was but a verie example of croſſes
afflictions, miſeries and calamities. And what greater miſerie
then to be born in a manger amongſt beaſts? And that when he
was borne, it behoued him to fly to a ſtrange land, for feare of
<hi>Herod,</hi> who ſought to ſlay him? This miſerie can none vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
but he that with aduerſitie, hath bene a ſtranger. And to
what land did he fly? To a land of a barbarous language, and
ſtrange religion.<note place="margin">The vnion of Religon is greater then that of the nation.</note> It is great comfort for a ſtranger to find peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his owne nation: but much more is it to find people of

life of Chriſt: to the Euangeliſts I referre me. And if miſerable
was his life to the eyes of men: much more miſerable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
was his death. Sith as a tranſgreſſion of the diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

which kind of death was not giuen but to abominable perſons,
which had committed enormious offences and ſinnes. And ſo
pronounced the holy ſcripture ſuch ſentence,<note place="margin">Deut: 21 23.</note> when it ſaid, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> And ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of

the death of the croſſe.</hi> And all this which he out wardly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
was nothing in compariſon of that which his moſt holy
ſoule inwardly felt: this was, the inſupportable burthen of
ſinnes, not his, but of all men, which God layd vpon him: for
which, hee onely was to ſatisfie. This ſo great a weight felt
Chriſt, when praying in the garden he ſayd, <hi>Father if thou wilt,
let this cuppe paſſe from me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 22. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>yet not mine, but thy willbe done.</hi> And
ſo great was his ſorrow, that an Angell from heauen appeared
vnto him, and comforted him: and notwithſtanding being in
an agonie,<note place="margin">Math. 27. 46.</note> hee prayed more earneſtly: and his ſweate was (as
witneſſeth the ſame Euangeliſt) like droppes of bloud trickling
downe to the ground:<note place="margin">Chriſt in ſaying my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, felt truly the paine which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuffer in hell.</note> &amp; ſo as abhorred and forſaken of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

ſeemeth not to bee a prophet which foretelleth that which
ſhould happen to Chriſt, but an Euangeliſt, which recounteth
that which already had befallen him. In the 4. verſe he ſaith:
Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our ſorrowes:
yet we did iudge him as plagued and ſmitten of God and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.

alſo is this chapter to proue the Diuinitie of the Son of
God, of the Meſſiah, of our Chriſt. For who can by faith in
him (which the prophet calleth with his knowledge) iuſtifie
men? Who can giue righteouſneſſe, and take away the ſinnes
of men but God alone? This doth Chriſt: therefore is he God.
The ſame Chriſt, Matth. 9. 6. ſaith, that he hath power to pardon
ſinnes: and ſo ſaid he to the ſicke of the palſie, <hi>Sonne, be of good
comfort, thy ſinnes be forgiuen thee.</hi> For which cauſe ſaid the
Scribes that he blaſphemed. And ſo ſaid he to the ſinful woman
Luk, 7. 4. S. <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> The Scripture in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

we are the friends, ſonnes and heires of God, and brothers
and coheires with Ieſus Chriſt: let vs highly eſteeme our ſelues

ioyfull to haue ſuch ſonnes; nor Chriſt aſhamed but rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:19632:198"/>
to call vs brethren friendes and companions. In the
ſacred Scriptures are there very many places, wherein the holy
Spirit doth exhort vs to liue godly and holily: but of all haue I
choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, which maketh much to the purpoſe, becauſe in it are
mentioned, both kindes of ſacrifices (to wit) the propitiatory
which only Chriſt one only time offered: and the Euchariſtcall
which euery moment we offer, or to (ſpeake better) ought to
offer: the Spirit of God by the mouth of S. Paul, doth thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
vs:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 1.</note> Be ye therefore followers of God, as deare children, &amp;
walke in loue, euen as Chriſt hath loued vs, and hath giuen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for vs, to be an offring and ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
to God: But fornication and all vncleanneſſe, let it not once
be named among you, as it be commeth Saints: neither filthines
neither fooliſh talking, nor ieſtings, which are things not come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but rather giuing of thanks, &amp;c. For all the che chapter is an
exhortation to well liuing. Let not man thinke, for being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Chriſtian, for being baptiſed, for ſaying that he beleeueth
in God, for being trayned vp in the Church, where he frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſermons, and celebrateth with the reſt, the holy ſupper: Let
him not thinke for all this (ſay I) that hee ſhall be ſaued: if hee
keepe not together with this the commaundements of God.
<hi>If thou wilt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>enter into life, keepe the commandements:
thou ſhalt not kil, thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adultery, &amp;c.</hi> That hypocrits
may doe, and doe the ſame: but not this. For without a true and
liuely faith, which hypocrites and wicked Chriſtians, haue not,
this cannot be done. The outward ſhew, the dead faith, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
and idle, is not the faith which iuſtifieth: but the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
true, and diligent faith which bringeth forth in time
fruits of charitie. For as true fire, cannot be without heate, and
the greater that the fire is, the greater heat it giueth: So true
faith cannot be without good works: and the more the faith is,
ſo much the more it worketh. And contrariwiſe: as the painted
fire warmeth not, as little alſo the dead faith worketh: for being
dead, how ſhall it worke. Such a perfection doth the holy Spirit
require in vs, that we do not onely good, and commit no euill,
but willeth alſo that we be not familiar nor conuerſant with
the wicked. Whereas ſuch calling themſelues brothers, bee
hypocrites, vniuſt and impious. So commaundeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:19632:198"/>
1. Cor. chap. 5. 1. If any man (ſaith hee) calling himſelfe
a brother, ſhall be a fornicator, a couetous perſon, an idolater,
an euill ſpeaker, a drunkard, a theefe, with ſuch a one eate not.
The cauſe why we ought not to bee familiar with ſuch, in the
ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſal. chap. 3. 14. he ſheweth. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
not with him (ſaith he) that hee may bee aſhamed. And
Rom. 16. 17. he commandeth vs to depart from them which
make diſſentions. And 2. Ioh. verſ. 10. it is commanded we
ſhould not ſalute them. To receiue then and enioy the benefit
of Chriſts ſacrifice, ſuch ought (as we haue mentioned) to be
the life of a Chriſtian. Hee that ſhall not be ſo perfect, (for
who ſhall hee bee? ſeeing there is no man but finneth, and
ſith the iuſt man falleth ſeuen times, I would ſay many times a
day: if he fall ſeuen times a day, what will hee doe all his life
long? fall and riſe againe.) He that ſhall not then be ſo perfect,
let him deſire ſo to be: let him ſigh and bewayle his imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
before the Lord: let him beſeech him of grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
perfect. Let him beleeue the Lord to be ſo good, that
he will accept this good deſire, proceeding from ſo contrite
and humble heart: and ſo will he ſupply the faults of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
and not impute them vnto vs. And thus ſhall we
enioy the benefite of the ſacrifice which Chriſt our high and
onely Prieſt once offered to his Father.</p>
               <p>We haue proued Chriſt onely to be our Prieſt, and onelie his
body &amp; bloud which he once offered vpon the croſſe to be the
only and vnreiterable ſacrifice expiatorie, whereby our ſinnes
are pardoned, and we for euer ſanctified. Let vs now (as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed)
treat of the inſtitution of the holy ſupper, and ſo wil we
conclude this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The Lord knowing our careleſneſſe,<note place="margin">The inſtitution of the Supper.</note> negligence &amp; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of the things which concern our ſaluation, that we ſhuld
not forget the benefit of his death &amp; paſſion, did inſtitute the

                  <hi>One only time was Chriſt offered, and by this</hi> (only offering)
<hi>he obtained for vs a generall pardon of all our ſinnes. But hee
would we ſhould alwayes remember this benefit: And to help
our memorie did he inſtitute this ſacrament, and willeth wee
not once but many times in our life receiue it. The inſtitution
of this Sacrament, the Euangeliſts</hi> Matthew, Marke, <hi>and</hi> Luke
<hi>do declare: but moſt largely Saint</hi> Paul <hi>in 1. Cor. chap. 11. and
in the tenth chap. he beginneth alſo to intreate thereof. He are

and of his bloud.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor 11. 23</note> I receiued of the Lord <hi>(ſaith Saint Paul)</hi>
that which I alſo deliuered vnto you, to wit, that the Lord Ieſus the

is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of mee. Likewiſe alſo
after ſupper, he tooke the cup, ſaying: This is the new teſtament in
my bloud: Do this as often as you ſhall drinke it in remembrance of
me. For as often as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke of this cup, ye
ſhall ſhew forth the Lords death vntill his comming. Whoſoeuer
therefore ſhall eate this bread, and drinke of this cup vnworthily,
ſhall be guiltie of the body and bloud of the Lord. Let then a man
proue himſelfe, and ſo eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup. For
who ſo eateth and drinketh the ſame vnworthily, eateth and drinketh
his owne damnation, not conſidering the Lords body.</p>
               <p>We haue heard how the Lord did celebrate his holy ſupper
and inſtituted therein the moſt holy ſacrament of his body and
bloud. The ſame order that Ieſus Chriſt vſed in celebrating of
it, held his Apoſtles, as often as they celebrated the ſame. This
ſelfe ſame order (as we haue before ſhewed) was for a thouſand
yeares ſpace obſerued in the Church. Albeit true it is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the thouſand yeares were accompliſhed, Sathan (enuying
the great benefite and comfort which we receiue with this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament)
began to alter it, adding thereto many thinges tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
rites and ceremonies. But the thouſand yeares paſſed, the
whole ſacrament with furie hee caſt to the earth: and in place
thereof aduaunced an idoll made of dough made betweene
two irons, which they adore and ſacrifice vnto, neither
more nor leſſe, then if it were God himſelfe that created hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

and earth. But in all this time of ſo great ignoraunce, and
Idolatrie. The Lord (as we haue ſaid) did neuer vtterly forſake
his Church: For euer he raiſed vp ſome true prophet, ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, or men, that with zeale of the Lordes houſe, and nor
accompting of the daunger whereunto they thruſt their liues
reproued the world. Becauſe through the Church of God, was
ſold this ſo horrible idolatry. But particularly in theſe our times
hath the Lord ſhewed mercy, rayſing vp very many learned &amp;
godly men. Which being ſimple poore men, haue with great
zeale, oppoſed them ſelues to the tyranny of Antichriſt, and to
all the power of the world. which was inchanted &amp; bewitched
with the falſe Doctrine of Antichriſt. And ſo hath God bleſſed
the labour of theſe men (As he bleſſed in times paſt, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

harts his Goſpel, to reſiſt all incredulity: and hath giuen vs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and affection to renounce our owne inclinations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
deſires, to follow his righteouſneſſe, and obey his holie
commandements: Sure we are, that the vices and imperfections
remaine in vs cannot let, but that he receiue vs &amp; make vs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be partakers of his good things in this ſpirituall banquet.
For wee come not to him, to proteſt, that in our ſelues wee
are perfect or iuſt: But contrarywiſe in ſeeking with great
deſire our life in Chriſt: wee confeſſe, that we abide in death.
This ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnderſtand we to be a medecine for thoſe which
are needy in ſpirtuall infirmities, &amp; that all the dignitie, which
Chriſt our redeemer requireth at our hands, is to know vs to
haue ſorrow and hartie griefe for our offences: and to ſettle all
our delight ioy &amp; contentment only in him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt doe we beleeue theſe promiſes which Ieſus Chriſt (who
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:19632:201"/>
is the infallible and eternall truth) pronounced with his mouth.
To wit: that he will truly make vs partakers of his body, &amp; bloud
To the end, we may wholy poſſeſſe him, that he may liue in vs
&amp; we in him. And although we ſee not the thing giuen, but only
bread &amp; wine: yet are we ſure, he wil ſpiritually fulfil in our harts
all that which he out wardly ſheweth by theſe viſible ſignes. He
is (I would ſay) the heauenly bread to feede vs, &amp; nouriſh vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life eternal. Let vs not then be vngrateful to the infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour, who ſetteth before vs vpon this
holy table, all his riches to diſtribute the ſame vnto vs. For in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
himſelf vnto vs, he doth witnes, that all his good things, are
wholy ours. Let vs therfore receiue this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
pledge: wherby the vertue of his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is imputed
vnto vs, for righteouſnes: As if we our ſelues in our own perſons
had ſuffered. Let vs not be ſo peruerſe of vnderſtanding, &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to refuſe, to reioyce, &amp; enioy this diuine banquet, wherunto
Ieſus Chriſt, by his word, doth ſo gently inuite vs. But with great
eſteeme of the dignitie of this moſt precious guift, wherewith
he graceth vs to preſent we our ſelues vnto him with a burning
zeale and faithful hart, that he make vs capable to receiue him.</p>
                  <p>For this end, lift we vp our minds &amp; harts vnto him: there where
Ieſus Chriſt is, in the glorie of his father: from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we expect
him for our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And let vs not be occupied, nor dwel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
theſe earthly &amp; corruptible elements: which we ſee with the
eyes, &amp; touch with the hands, to ſeeke him in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as though hee
were incloſed in the bread &amp; wine. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall our ſoules (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

quickened with his ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to come vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; enter into
the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of God, where he remayneth. Content we then our

We giue thee euerlaſting thanks &amp; praiſe, eternall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

in communicating vnto vs, ſo great a benefit: being as we are,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. commanded that at the time of the eleuation, the-murder

                  <p>A certaine Inquiſitor at Barcelona, called <hi>Molon,</hi> clipped the

Maſſe without any intention of conſecration. The ſame haue
many other Prieſts done alſo: and ſo by their owne Cannons
haue cauſed all that heard their Maſſe to commit idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>That being (as it is) true which we haue ſaid and proued of
the Maſſe: with very iuſt title, and good and ſound conſcience
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:19632:206"/>
do we deteſt it as a prophanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy ſupper of the Lord:
There is then no cauſe why any ſhuld condemne vs, for ſedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heretikes or ſchiſmatikes, if abhorring the Maſſe, &amp; flying
the ſame, we follow and imbrace the holy ſupper which Ieſus
Chriſt iuſtituted, his Apoſtles and our forefathers for the ſpace
of a thouſand yeares celebrated. Would God for that onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
ſake, which his ſonne our high and onely Prieſt offered
vnto him) that all our Spaniards would know (as other nations
do already know) what the Pope is, what things are his Buls,
which be nought els but mockeries, which he maketh of vs:
what is his authoritie which is nought els but vanitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he hath many yeares deceiued vs, that they would know
that when the Pope curſeth vs, then God doth bleſſe vs: would
God they would know the holineſſe of the maſſe to be diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe,
ſeeing it is a prophanation of the holy Supper of the
Lord. Very hard will it be for them (I know well) to do this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue bene borne, brought vp, &amp; growne old in the
contrary. But if the holy ſpirit giue them grace to reade, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
conferre, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>front that which we haue ſayd in theſe two
Treatiſes, with the holy Scripture, which is the word of God,
very eaſie it ſhall be vnto them: wherby euery faithfull and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Chriſtian in particular, and the whole Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ought to be ruled &amp; gouerned. Our Spaniards in this ſhould
imitate thoſe of Berea:<note place="margin">Chapt. 17. 11.</note> who (as ſaith S. <hi>Luke</hi> in his hiſtory of the
Acts of the Apoſtles) ſearched the Scriptures to know if that
which <hi>Paul</hi> preached were the word of God or no. If that wee
haue ſaid be the word of God, no time, no cuſtome, how anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſoeuer, ought to preuaile againſt it. And if for our ſins, lies,
falſhood and error haue for a little or long time oppreſſed and
darkened the truth, the errour ought to giue place, as maugre
the ſame it ſhall giue: and ſo truth, <hi>iure Poſtliminij</hi> (as ſay the
lawes) ſhall reenter his poſſeſſion. And albeit an olde cuſtome
is very hardly left, yet none ought to preferre ſuch cuſtome to
reaſon and truth, do euer exclude and expell cuſtome. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when with reaſon and truth, for reaſon and truth we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
and conuince our aduerſaries. In vaine do they oppoſe
ancient cuſtome vnto vs, ſaying: in this were our forefathers
brought vp: in this did they die: In this were wee borne and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:19632:206"/>
brought vp, &amp; in this then will we die. As if cuſtome were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the truth. This is euen like the ſaying of another: A
Moore was my father, a Moore alſo will I be, hauing no other
reaſon to giue but cuſtome. Cuſtome without truth is an olde
errour: and errour the elder, the more dangerous it is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leauing (as ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his epiſtle <hi>ad Pompeium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cuſtome with out truth is as old error, and therfore more dangerous. 3. Eſdt. 3. 38.</note>)
errour, let vs follow the truth. knowing (as ſaith <hi>Eſdras) Truth
ouercommeth:</hi> as it is written: Truth doth &amp; ſhall euer preuaile,
and liue and raigne eternally. And then ſaith the ſame S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi>
Bleſſed be the God of truth, The which truth Chriſt ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
in his Goſpell vnto vs, ſaith: I am the Truth: wherefore,
if we be in Chriſt, and haue Chriſt in vs, if we abide in the truth
and the truth abide in vs. Let vs hold that which is the truth.
And a little lower: If the truth in any thing ſhall ſtagger or
ſeeme doubtfull, meete it is, that we runne backe to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
which the Lord ordained, and to the Euangelicall and
Apoſtolicall inſtruction: and thence ariſeth the reaſon of
that which wee doe: from whence the order and originall
was raiſed. And as he himſelfe in another place ſaith: What
men haue formerly done ought wee not to looke: but to that
which Chriſt, who is the firſt of all, hath done. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the moſt certaine and infallible rule and ſquire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all our actions ought to be ruled and ſquired: as witneſſe
theſe places which we will alleage, and manie others, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

and ſayth: that they which do not ſo, it is becauſe there is no

they are blind, and as blind men, goe groping. Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the word or doctrine of the Prophets, ſaith:
Whereunto, yee ſhall doe well to giue eare, as to a candle,
burning in an obſcure place. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The holy Scripitures doe teach vs, that Ieſus Chriſt is our
high and onelie Prieſt. It teacheth vs that hee once offered
vp himſelfe, with which ſacrifice, being of infinite vertue, he
ſanctifieth vs for euer.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:19632:207"/>
And teacheth vs that there is no other ſacrifice, nor was, nor
ſhalbe, but this alone, by which remiſſion of ſinnes is obtained,
it teacheth vs, that whoſoeuer ſhall offer another ſacrifice be
ſides this, or reiterate this, doth moſt great iniurie to Chriſt:
As though his ſacrifice (which was Chriſt himſelfe) were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient.
It teacheth vs, that Ieſus Chriſt ordained his holy
ſupper, which he commandeth vs to celebrat, in remembrance
of that ſacrifice, which he one only time offered to the father:
all this in generall, and euery thing in particuler by the grace of
God, (to him be the glory) haue we ſufficiently proued. This is
the trueth: for it is the word of God. This then we beleeue, his
Maieſtie graunt vs grace, not onely with the heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
this, which he in his holy Goſpell he hath reuealed vnto
vs: but alſo ſtrength and conſtancie with the mouth to confeſſe
it: and to ſuffer alſo, for this faith and confeſſion, whenſoeuer he
pleaſeth with perſecution to proue vs. Concerning that which
men haue of their owne heades haue inuented (That the Pope
is our chiefe Biſhop) the ſucceſſour of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the vicar
of Chriſt God vppon earth, and that as ſuch a one he pardoneth
ſinnes,<note place="margin">That which the papiſts beleeue of their pope &amp; their Maſſe.</note> draweth out of hell and purgatorie what ſoules he will
and what ſoules hee will hee placeth in heauen. And that the
Maſſe ſuch as now they ſay, is a ſacrifice, as ſatisfactorie, as was
the death and paſſion of Chriſt. None of theſe things doth the
holy ſcripture teach vs: it is humane inuention, and diueliſh
lies, wherwith Sathan hath long time deceiued vs. The Apoſtle
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willing to correct the vices brought into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſupper of the Lord in the Church of Corinth found no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
remedy but to reduce it,<note place="margin">The beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce things to Chriſts firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</note> to the originall and firſt inſtitution.
And ſo 1. Cor. 11 he ſaith: I receiued of the Lord that which I
haue giuen you, &amp;c. ſo now do we alſo the ſame. We reſtore the
ſupper of the Lord, and celebrate it according to it firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:

And if ſo we do, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue they no cauſe to hold vs for heretikes

we hold our ſelues, and ſuch we are, albeit is the many imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:

which we call the holy ſcripture: Let ſuch a one be accurſed,
and execrable, Let him be (as ſaith Saint <hi>Paule)</hi> Anathema.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt hard (Chriſtian Reader) the Enormious charges,
wherewith we charge the Pope, as touching life &amp; Doctrine:
But chiefly, touching the ſuperſtition and Idolatrie of the Maſſe
which the ſayd Pope of himſelfe without the word of God, hath
inuented and brought into the Church. Thou haſt alſo heard,
the Enormious charges where with the Pope chargeth vs. Hee
accuſeth vs for proud, contentious and arrogant, that we will
know more then all the whole Church. He accuſeth vs for diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to Magiſtrates, diſturbers of common-wealthes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
and kingdomes. he accuſeth vs for ſchiſmatiques, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.
For the which, as an accuſer, witnes and Iudge he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that we are not worthy to liue in the world. But it is not
ſufficient to accuſe. Of neceſſity muſt he proue that which hee
ſaith:<note place="margin">We demand a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, lawfully called &amp; free, which may heare both parts.</note> and ſo conuince the accuſed. Come we then to the proofe,
let a generall Councell be aſſembled, which may heare both

alleaged and proued, without reſpect of any perſon, poore or

                  <p>This is the onely remedie to take away the diſſentions and
differences which are at this day in the Church, as touching life
and Doctrine. This remedy in times paſt, vſed the Church in

hartes of the Emperour, Chriſtian kinges and Princes that
they may take in hand ſuch an Enterpriſe for the glorie of God,

vice and falſe Doctrine, ſuperſtitition, here ſie and Idolatrie

for want of appearence in the Councel. And ſo in the 8 Seſſion
was nothing done, but that the Italians tranſported the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
to Bologna, aland of the popes in Italy. Where was held
the ninth Seſſion: Where in as little then did they: For the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards

confirmed by the Pope. For knowe this, that all is nought
woorth, whatſoeuer the Councell decreeth if it bee not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Pope: Knowe alſo, that ſo ſubiect was this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

ordayned, that all whatſoeuer was in the Councell ordayned

whatſoeuer decree, or decrees of this Councell, ſo that he knew
the cauſe &amp; commoditie ſo required. This decree was it which
gaue moſt content to the Eccleſiaſticall perſons. For by vertue
of this decree, each thing remayneth polluted as before, and ſo
nothing reformed. So that the eccleſiaſticall Lordes take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

haue diſpenſation of the Biſhop, or of the Pope: Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
will make them, ſo tender and ſo as a peece of ſoft

not admitted of the kings of England, and Denmarke, nor of the
Proteſtant princes: nor of the common wealthes of Germany.
All theſe be one good part of Chriſtendome, inhabiting in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.

the Doctors and auncient Councels gouerned by Gods word,

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:19632:209"/>
of the king came ſodainely vnto Trent, &amp; preſented to
the Councell a letter from his king. The ſuperſcription where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſayd: To the aſſembly of Trent. Aſmuch to ſay, As to the
meeting at Trent: This ſuperſcription being read, the Spaniſh
Biſhops ſpake, ſaying: that ſuch a letter was in contempt of the
Councell, and that it ought not to be read nor yet opened. But
notwithſtanding the reſt of the Councel, after they had well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
the buiſines concluded, that the letter ought be opened
and read, preſuppoſing that moſt Chriſtian king, had not vſed,
ſuch a ſuperſcription, either for contempt of the Councel, nor
to derogate from it authority: and ſo was it read. The ſome of
this letter was:<note place="margin">The French king holdeth not for general nor lawfull the Councel of Trent.</note> that he proteſted, as before he had proteſted in
Rome, that he could not ſend to Trent by reaſon of the warres,
the Biſhops of his kingdome. He ſaid alſo: that he held not this
Councel for general, or lawful, but for a particular meeting cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
for the publique good of Chriſtendome (the which ought
led togither for the profit &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of ſome particular perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; to be the principal cauſe of the calling togither of a Councel)
That he thought neither himſelfe, nor his ſubiects bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the decrees, that there in ſhould be made: But that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſame he will vſe (if need ſhould be) the remedies,
which his progenitors had in the like caſes vſed, &amp;c. And the
king of Fraunce not contented to haue made this proteſtation
in Rome, and in the Councell, but paſſed yet further, and ſent
an Embaſſadour called Marlot, and of his Councell, to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
which the Cantons of the Swizers held at Bade, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
them not to take this of Trent, for a Councel, nor to make
any reckoning thereof: Whereunto he perſuaded alſo the ſame
Cantons, which were papiſts. The Griſons alſo, which had ſent
<hi>Thomas Planta</hi> their Biſhop to the Councell (nor approuing
the Councell) cauſed him to returne home. They will not ſay
<hi>Frauncis,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his ſonne, kings of Fraunce to be Lutherans
but moſt Chriſten (as our aduerſaries the papiſts themſelues cal
them) which hold not for a Councell, the Councell of Trent,
but an aſſembly of particular perſons, for their particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
The ſame account then that ſo many Nations, kings migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
princes, and great States of Europe, not of the proteſtants
onely: but alſo of the papiſts (without paſſing to the Chriſtians
of Affrique and Aſia, none of whom doe I know, or haue read
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:19632:210"/>
to be found in this Councell) made of this Councell, make wee
alſo: &amp; ſo demand we a Councel general, lawfull, &amp; free, where
each one may freely ſpeake his opinion. Let the Councell, and
not the Biſhops onely (who only with a deliberate voice haue
tyrannically lift vp themſelues) examine &amp; iudge what euerie
one ſhall ſay, according to the word of God. Were there ſuch a
Councell, God we truſt would giue vs ſpeech and wiſdome to
maintaine &amp; defend our cauſe, which is his: becauſe it is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiueable
truth, which his maieſty in his holy Scripture, hath
reuealed. Concerning the lies &amp; falſe doctrine of the authority
of the Pope, &amp; the holines of the Maſſe, which our aduerſaries
maintaine perſecuting with fire &amp; bloud, all thoſe that beleeue
it not, nor worſhip it, &amp; therefore trouble they the world (as at
this day, we ſee it troubled) We aſſuredly know, that it ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
According to that, which the Lord ſaith: <hi>Euery plant which
my heauenly father hath not planted, ſhal be plucked vp by the roote.</hi>
And we haue the axe, which is the word of God, put to the root
of the two trees, the Pope &amp; the maſſe to cut them downe.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech the Lord our God (Chriſtian reader, which hath
giuen thee a deſire and will to be informed &amp; to know the
cauſes why we ſubiect not our ſelues to the Pope, nor wil heare
his Maſſe, but rather deteſt and abhor the one &amp; the other) that
he would pleaſe to lighten thine vnderſtanding, that thou maiſt
comprehend what in theſe two Treatiſes haue bin ſaid &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
not with the ſayings of men, but of God himſelfe, of his
holy Scripture, &amp; giue thee ſuch a mind and ſtrength, that thou
maiſt wholly depart out from this wicked Babylon (which is
Rome) &amp; deliuer thee from all the enormities, abominations,
horrible ſuperſtitions, and deteſtable idolatries which Rome
hath inuented, among which the principal is the Maſſe. Theſe
idolatries without doubt be the chiefe cauſe original, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all miſeries, calamities, and warres where with they that
are called Chriſtians, be at this day afflicted. For if God in the

the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> yet liuing, which he reporteth in his

to obtaine pardon for theſe ſuperſtitions, &amp; paſſed idolatries, &amp;
to get and keepe the grace of God, of whom thou oughteſt not
only to expect all proſperity &amp; goodneſſe, but to endeuour by
all poſſible meanes to ſerue him &amp; honour him: applying thy
ſelfe with all thine heart to all that; which pleaſeth him: which
is that which his Maieſtie hath ordained and inſtituted in his
holy word: flying contrariwiſe all whatſoeuer may diſpleaſe &amp;
offend him: and eſpecially all kinds of idolatrie, which he more
deteſteth &amp; abhorreth then all other ſinnes &amp; abhominations:

&amp; Plazencia, &amp; afterwards tranſlated into French. All this ſaith
<hi>Luſignan.</hi> Come we now to the letter which was to be ſhewed
to the Pope. Pag. 8. it ſaith. Mother <hi>Mary de la Viſitacion</hi> at 11,
yeares of age entred into the Monaſterie <hi>de la Anunciada,</hi> &amp; at
16. years made profeſſion. In which time, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
appeared to this Religious, to recompence her merits, &amp; tooke
her to his wiſe, ſaying to her the words of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,
I haue loued thee with an euerlaſting loue: therfore with mercy haue
I drawne thee.</hi> And from that time forward he ſtill appeared to
her, granting her very many particular graces, &amp; fauours ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
&amp; conuerſing familiarly with her: as one friend doth with
another, in ſuch ſort as God talked &amp; diſcourſed with <hi>Moſes:</hi> &amp;
oftentimes appeared he to her, accompanied with he and ſhee
Saints, as with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> (for much deuoted was this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
to <hi>Magdalen</hi> and wontedly called her her faire) and
acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with our father S <hi>Dominicke,</hi> &amp; with S. <hi>Tho. of Aquin</hi>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:19632:213"/>
Saint <hi>Katherin</hi> of Sene and other times appeared he alone and
very familiar, helping her to ſay the Cannonicall houres: and
at the End of euery Pſalme would ſhe ſay: <hi>Gloria Patriet tibi
&amp; Spiritui Sancto;</hi> Or, as ſaith friar <hi>Lewys de Granada, &amp; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifilio</hi>
(To wit) <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to thee his Sonne, and
to the holy ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 9. Page he ſaith: To communicate and receiue her
Creator was her ordinary cuſtome: during which time the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nunnes ſaw her in a trance for a long ſpace rapt vp in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
vntill her Gouernour commaunded her to go to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the other Religious. And then returning to her
ſelfe, ſhee went moſt obediently forthwith to accompliſh this
holy myſterie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the 10. pag. (ſpeaking of her great charitie) he recounteth a
miracle, &amp; this it is. In the Monaſtery there was a Nun that was
very weake, &amp; withall had this fanſie, that ſhe would in no wiſe
eate any meat, ſuppoſing that all ſorts of meats were poiſoned:
and in this franticke humour ſhe kept her teeth ſhut, by reaſon
whereof her lips and iawes were couered with filth &amp; matter.
This religious <hi>Marie,</hi> hauing compaſſion of the poore frantick
Nunne, and moued with a feruent charitie to her, went to ſee
her: and praying her to eat a peece of bread, which ſhe offered
her, aſſured her it had no poiſon in it. The diſeaſed anſwered: If
you will eate of the ſame bread, and bite in the ſide that I with
my teeth and iawes (which were cankered) will bite, then will
I beleeue that the bread hath no poiſon, &amp; that it is good bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Marie</hi> full of charitie, enforced her ſelfe, and with a ſtrong hart,
leaſt ſhe ſhould vomite, promiſed to do ſo. Then tooke ſhe the
bread and bit therof in the ſame place that the frantike Nunne
had bitten. And this ſhe did with incredible cheerefulneſſe:
hardly had ſhe thus done, when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his charitie) appeared to the ſayd <hi>Mary</hi> &amp; ſayd vnto her:
For this thy ſo charitable an act, I will giue health to this diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And ſo was the ſicke healed of her infirmitie.</p>
            <p>The 11. pag. ſaith: That (as often, as being in the Monaſtery,
ſhe heard the litle bel, which accompanied the moſt holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of our Lord, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they carried it to the diſeaſed through the
citie) ſhe kneeled downe on the ground with teares, &amp; was rapt
vp in a trance, as witneſſe the religious of the ſaid Monaſterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:19632:213"/>
deſirous is ſhe of this moſt holy ſacrament, &amp;c. ſo hunger after
it that Ieſus Chriſt appeareth very often viſibly vnto her, &amp; he
himſelfe giueth himſelfe to this religious. The wedneſday in
the holy week, ſhe went into the low quire, where the Nunnes
through a window do wontedly receiue the holy communion,
at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the prieſt, who is on the other ſide without: where
ſeeing that all the Nunnes had communnicated, and that there
was neuer a conſecrat hoſt left for her: ſhe betooke her ſelfe to
praier, intreating with teares the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
that ſhe might haue means to comunicate, &amp;c. And a little after:
Then the holy place (where ſo rich a treaſure as is the body of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was kept) opened of his owne accord, &amp;
one of the conſecrate formes went forth without any viſible
helpe, and offred it ſelfe to the mouth of this Religious woman
which with moſt great deuotion and humility ſhe receiued.
Another time on Innocents day another like miracle hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto her, who euer increaſing in perfecttion &amp; vertue is
now come to ſo high an eſtate. That about foure or fiue yeres
ſince, Ieſus Chriſt crucified appeared vnto her all ſhining,
from whoſe right ſide iſſued a beame of fire which ſtroke vpon
the left ſide of this Religious, who ſtood right againſt the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe
made and left in her fleſh a red marke as bigge as the
ſtroke of Launce, and this wound on certaine daies, namely at
euery Friday openeth: from whence iſſue certaine droppes
of bloud: and ſhe feeleth (ſhe ſaith) great griefe of the ſaide
wound. The di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ine Maieſtie hath ſhewed theſe wonders
ſince ſhe was made Prioreſſe; which was in the yeare 1583. in
the beginning of Iulie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Pag. 12. When ſhe is in her Cell at prayer the religious ſee
her enuironed with brightneſſe, and lifted vp into the aire with
a great light, which iſſues from her breaſt and face, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the great and feruent charitie and loue of God that is in her.
Laſtly vpon the day of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> the 7. of March
1584. ſhe (being before aduiſed thereto by our Lord Ieſus,
and by the ſayd Saint <hi>Thomas)</hi> communicated this viſion to
her Prouinciall: And being by him exhorted therunto for nine
dayes together euery day firſt confeſt her ſelf, ſhe receiued the
moſt holy communion. In theſe dayes God ſhewed many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,

with much brightneſſe by night. As ſhe was praying in
the Quire on the ſaid feaſt of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> after Mattens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the houres of foure &amp; fiue in the morning, Ieſus Chriſt
crucified, gloriouſly ſhining, appeared vnto her, as before he
had appeared, with his fiue moſt holy wounds. From his feete,
hands and ſide iſſued out beames of fire, which wounded the
hands, feete and ſide of this Religious. The wounds and marks
of bloudy colour moſt faire remaine in her, aſwell within the
palmes of the hands &amp; the feet, as without: the one in a round
figure like to a naile, anſwering the other: &amp; the ſame ſide was
marked in the ſame place, wherein ſhe had before bene woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
but with a ſigne or marke far more apparant. She confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that ſhe feels extreme griefe of the ſaid wounds, &amp;c. At the
end of the letter the Prouinciall hath theſe words: Some of my
Religious bring I with me, to giue good teſtimonie of that
which I haue ſaid: &amp; he nameth theſe: Friar <hi>Antonio de la Cerda,</hi>
Prouincial of Portugal (who wrote this letter) F. <hi>Gaſper Leiton,</hi>
Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Colledge of Lisbon, &amp; preacher to the king: Friar

<hi>D. Henrie Cardinall,</hi> that afterwards was K. of Portugal</p>
            <p>The ſecond Letter is from Friar <hi>Lewys de Granada,</hi> ſent to
the Patriarke of Valencia, The date is from Lisbon the 18. of
March 1584. the principall pointes are theſe. In the 16. page of
the book it ſaith: that S. <hi>Thomas</hi> appeared vnto her 10 dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his feaſt, &amp; told her, ſhe ſhould prepare her ſelfe: for vpon
his feaſt day the Lord would come to viſit her, &amp; ſhew vnto her
grace and particular fauour, namely, that of the impreſſion of
the fiue wounds: as was ſaid in the firſt letter, &amp;c. Alſo he ſaith:
fiue or ſixe dayes the paine endured: during which time, when
ſhe ſtepped to walke, the ſoales of her feet (ſhee thought trod
vpon nayles &amp;c. And pag. 18. it ſaith: On Tenable Wedneſday,
ſhe was in the Quire with great deſire to communicate in a
window by which the Religious did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, right againſt
whereunto was an altar, where the little casket of the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament ſtood: for the great altar was occupied with the
Sepulchre, or monument that was made vpon it. In the meane
while he ſaw the litle casket open and a conſecrate hoſt to iſſue
thereout, which moſt deuoutly ſhe receiued, &amp;c. And Pag. 19.
She told me that for 7. yeares euery Thurſday at the <hi>Auc Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:19632:215"/>
houre ſhe hath felt in her head all the paines of the crowne
of thornes: inſomuch that the bloud iſſueth forth: and ſhe hath
in her head ſome ſmall prickes and holes of the ſayd thornes: &amp;
the paines endure vntill Fryday at the ſame houre. She had at a
certaine time a great deſire (as very often ſhe hath) to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate:
at which time ſhee ſaw in ſpirit S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Euangeliſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate.
The Maſſe being ended, a conſecrate hoſt came from
the Altar. She then returning to her ſelfe (for ſhe was rapt or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed
in ſpirit) ſhee found that ſhee had the ſaid hoſt in her
mouth, &amp;c. All this which I haue written (ſaith Friar <hi>Lewes de
Granada)</hi> ſhe her ſelfe told me: and I ſhould write much more,
if I would recken all the maruellous thinges which our Lord
worketh in this bleſſed ſoule, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third Letter is from the ſame Prouinciall, Friar <hi>Antonio
de la Cerda,</hi> ſent to Friar <hi>Ferdiando de Caſtro,</hi> Proctor in Rome,
for the prouince of Portugall. The date is at Lisbon, the 30. of
March 1585. Thus it ſayth: Since your departure from this city,
it hath pleaſed our Lord from day to day more manifeſtly to
declare how highly he eſteemeth <hi>la Anunciada.</hi> For infinit be
the miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well corporall as ſpirituall, which by her means
he hath wrought in theſe parts: which hath bene the cauſe that
very many Gentlemen haue bene moued to become Fryars, to
whom with my hands I haue giuen the habite. The fame of
which miracles hath ſo far ſtreched, that it is come to the Mores
dwelling in Alualady, which is a caſtle three leagues from Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:
Three wherof, becauſe the houre for them to turne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
it ſhould ſeeme drew neare, maruellouſly deſired to ſee
the Prioreſſe: for beleeue they could not ſo great miracles, as
were reported of her. And from thenceforth the holy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
moued &amp; prouoked them, more and more kindling in
their hearts the deſire to ſee the ſaid ſeruant of God. And ſo
much dayly increaſed this deſire in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that one day very early
not acquainting one another with th their purpoſes, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
all 3 fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alualady for this city of Lisbon, &amp; came to ſeek
me in this couent, ſaying, that they knew not what it was, which
ſo inwardly had moued &amp; burned them with ſo ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a deſire
to ſee the Prioreſſe. And whiles one of the told me theſe things
behold, there commeth the other &amp; afterwards the third. And
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they met all three together, they vnderſtood that they all
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:19632:216"/>
demanded one ſelfe ſame thing: they ſeeing themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with one ſelfe ſame deſire, were greatly aſtoniſhed: &amp;
perceiuing that this proceeded of one ſelfe mouing of the
holy Spirit, and not of curioſitie, as ſome would preſume, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them to the monaſtery <hi>de la Anunciada,</hi> and went into the
parlor, and thence ſent word to the Prioreſſe, that I would
ſpeake with her, without letting her vnderſtand why ſhee was
called. She preſently came: and the 3 Moores were faſt by me
when we ſpake together. She lift vp her vayle to talke with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſcarcely had the three Moores ſeene her when they fell
groueling to the earth. And in ſuch maner, that needfull it was,
ſome which were preſent ſhould helpe them vp. When they
aroſe beholding her eftſoons, they kneeled on their knees with
out a word ſpeaking. But that they lamented without ceaſſing
hauing their eyes for a long time fixed vpon the Prioreſſe. And
when I asked them why they ſpake not to the Prioreſſe? They
anſwered, that they ſaw in her ſo great and admirable things
that they knew not what to ſpeake. Hauing thus ſayd, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
the Prioreſſe, that he which was by her might giue them
baptiſme. She anſwered, if they would be baptiſed, that I was
there preſent who would cauſe them to be baptiſed. Adding
moreouer, that this to her Spouſe ſhould bee greatly pleaſing.
This done, I returned, leading with me the Moores (albeit to
their great ſorrow for they would not haue parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe)
home to my Couent. Of all this I aduertiſed the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
who ſent forthwith for the Moores, and I (accompanied
with ſome Fathers) brought them. Brought (as they were) they
confeſſed to the Archbiſhop in our preſence, that they had ſeen
neere vnto the Prioreſſe, Ieſus Chriſt in humane ſhape, put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the croſſe. Which miracle was ſo admirable, that the ſame
thereof ſtretched through all the kingdom: &amp; great multitudes
of people are come to this citie to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptiſed. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
ſent for the Prioreſſe, to giue them their names. The
which at my commaund ſhe gaue vnto them. <hi>Manuel</hi> ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the firſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond and the third <hi>Thomas:</hi> who were in
this houſe baptiſed and with vs continue.</p>
            <p>The ſecond miracle which the Prouinciall telleth is this: A
Lady of qualitie there was which had a cancker in one of her
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:19632:216"/>
Lippes. This lady talking with <hi>Dona Vincencia</hi> told her, that
the day following they were to cut the canker: The Lady <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencia</hi>
moued with compaſſion, gaue vnto her a ſmall peece of
fine linnen cloth: which the Prioreſſe was wont to drawe ouer
her ſyde, ſaying: that ſhe ſhould put it vppon her canker: for
ſhe truſted in God that when they ſhould cut it, ſhe ſhould feele
no griefe at all, &amp;c. The Ladie ſo did. And with great deuotion
promiſed, that if ſhe found ſo much good hereby, that in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of her canker, ſhe ſhould feele no paine, ſhe would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
to her power, that God, through the merits of the Prioreſſe
his ſeruant, had graunted her this ſo ſingular &amp; admirable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
This ſimplicitie diſpleaſed not God, But he graunted the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what ſhe had demanded: for riſing vp early the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhee found her ſelfe whole, and without any ſigne where
the canker, nor any euill had bene, &amp;c. And a little lower. Of
all this were inſtruments made by arte of a notary publique, at
command of the Cardinals moſt illuſtrious worſhip.</p>
            <p>The 3. Miracle which the prouincall, telleth is, <hi>Anna Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
del Crucifixo,</hi> of the third order of <hi>Frauncis,</hi> brought with
her two ſmall peeces of a wodden Croſſe, which the prioreſſe
had giuen her. And going to viſit one that was diſeaſed deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a little water to drinke. <hi>Anna</hi> tooke a porcelan, and piſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into it. And after in the preſence of them all, tooke a peece
of the Croſſe, which the Prioreſſe had giuen her, and making a
ſigne of the Croſſe, caſt it into the Porcelan. The peece went to
the bottome. And eftſoones (like a candle on a candleſticke) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
vp right on end. Of this water gaue ſhe the pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to drink:
Who then began to find himſelfe better, and demaunded, what
was that, they had giuen him, which had done him much good.
After they had cold him, what had paſſed, he prayed them to
giue him more water then before, to drinke. Then caſt they
more water into the Porcelane, where in alſo was the peece of
the Croſſe. <hi>Anna Rodrigues,</hi> ſuppoſing that the diſeaſed in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had ſwallowed the ſame peece, caſt in the other, the which
went alſo to the bottome And commning to the other which
ſtood in end in the porcelane, cleaued vnto, and was ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with it. So that of thoſe two, was made a farre little Croſſe
which moued all that ſawe it, to very great deuotion. Scarcely
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:19632:217"/>
the ſecond time, had the ſickman taſted of the water, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
whole and ſound, &amp; the third day alſo aroſe from his bed,
and went to walke through the citie. Of this alſo was informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the moſt illuſtrious Legat. I
could (ſaith the prouincial) recount alſo many other like things.

¶3. affirmeth for an approued thing; that their <hi>Saint Frauncis</hi>
had the woundes of Ieſus Chriſt: as a little lower yee ſhall
perceiue. Concerning thoſe which had the fiue woundes I will
recount to this purpoſe, an admirable hiſtory whereof make
mention many of our aduerſaries who as wel in Dutch as in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
both in verſe and proſe haue written that the Dominick
Friars haue alwaies holden a certaine emulation, enuie &amp; hatred
toward the Franciſcans, for both being beggers, they could not
well agree togither. It happened tin Berne one of the 3 Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
of the Swizers in the a thouſand 5 hundred &amp; ninth yeare
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:19632:218"/>
that the Franciſcans were much more eſteemed and fauoured
then the Dominicks which the Dominicks: perceauing, much
ſtomacked: and ſo they conſulted to find remedy for ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.
Foure of the chiefe of their order, came to vnderſtand the
cauſes, why the Franciſcans were before them preferred. Theſe
two, beſides others which I will declare, they found to bee the
principall cauſes: firſt, that Saint <hi>Frauncis</hi> had the woundes of
Chriſt. The other, the brawling Queſtion which was betweene
them, and the Franciſcans, whether the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in ſinne or no. The Domincans did affirme it: the Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
denyed it. For this cauſe, the common people moued with
fooliſh deuotion, and with a zeale without knowledge, much
loued the Franciſcans, &amp; made no reckoning of the Dominicks.
The Dominicks then vnderſtanding the cauſe of their ſo great
euill, the remedy which they put, was this. A ſimple Friar they
tooke, which they had in their couent, a young frantique, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hypocrite, &amp; ſo deceiued him with many perſwaſions &amp; gaue
him certaine inchaunted drinks, that the ſmall vnderſtanding
which he had, they tooke quite from him. They marke, as they
could, the fiue wounds vpon him. They made him to beleeue
(and he fooliſh alſo beleeued it) that hee had then truly as S.
<hi>Frauncis</hi> had them. And here ſtayed they not: They made
him beleeue, that the moſt holy virgin Saint <hi>Barbara,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Catalina de Sena,</hi> appeared, and reuealed great things vnto him,
they made him beleeue, that S. <hi>Mary</hi> gaue him the red conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
hoſt, aud that ſhe preſented him with the bloud of Chriſt
and that ſhe commaunded him to go the Cabildo or Senate,
and ſay, that which ſhe had commaunded, giuen him in. And
among other things, this was one: that the holy virgin was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in ſin, &amp; that for this cauſe, they ought in no wiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Franciſcans, to dwell in their City, for that (beſides that
they are certayne loſt perſons, and without reformation) they
taught a groſſe error, which ought in no wiſe to be ſuffered.
That the holy virgin was conceiued without ſin. He told them
alſo, that they ſhould highly houour an Image of the holy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
(which their Fryars had made by a certaine Arte) that
diſtilled teares by the eyes as though it had wept. All this at
firſt was beleeued, that red bloud was adored. As the verie
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:19632:218"/>
bloud of Chriſt, and was ſent to great Lordes, as an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Treaſure. Great concourſe there was to the weeping
Image. So well knew the Dominickes to draw water to their
mill, that they onely were holden for holie, and ſo caried they
all the Almes and deuotions of the people. And the poore
Franciſcans were caſt aſide, and no man made reckoning of
them. The Franciſcans then ſeeing themſelues ſo deſpiſed,
and perceiuing (like people as well exerciſed in falſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)
as were the Dominickes, and the reſt of the popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie)
the craft and deceit of the Dominickes: vſed great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to diſcouer the villany. So much did they, that at laſt
it was diſcouered. The foure principal Authors of this Tragedy
in the one thouſand fiue hundred &amp; ninth yeare, were burned,
and the reſt were pardoned. Thoſe deceauers that ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,
make a mockery of religion (beſides theſe aforeſaid) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
in their torments great abhominations. (As the papiſts
themſelues that wrote this Hiſtorie doe witneſſe wherein the
Pope ſending His Legate for this purpoſe, put all, to ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
For he feared to looſe his eccleſiaſticall perſons, which
ſo great ſeruice with their falſe miracles haue done and doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and Idolatries (whereof their religion is full) to haue bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
or at the leaſt confirmed with like deceipts of fayned
apparitions, reuelations and falſe miracles. Into this reprobate
ſence, God leaueth them to fall, for not reading of the holie
Scripture: which is the onely rule of the well liuing and ſeruing
of God. As his maieſtie will be ſerued. But returne we now to

And ſo at the end of the admirable yeare 1588. was ſhe
condemned: as a certaine booke, which at the beginning of the
yeare following, being the 1589. was printed at Seuil, doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
from whence word for word haue I drawne that I will ſay
againſt other. The title thereof is this.</p>
            <p>A Relation of the holineſſe and woundes of Mother Mary de
la <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitation, which was Prioreſſe de la Annuntiada of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
and that which was declared, in the Sentence which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>All the booke will I not ſet downe, but the principall points
thereof will I take for my purpoſe. Thus then it beginneth. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
committed the verification of the woundes and holineſſe
of <hi>Marie Prioreſſe de la Annunciada</hi> of the order of Saint <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick,</hi>
to the moſt reuerend and illuſtrious Archbiſhoppes
of Lisbon and Braga, the Biſhop <hi>de la Guardia,</hi> the Prouincial
of Saint <hi>Dominiks</hi> order, the Inquiſitors of this Citie of Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
and Doctor <hi>Paulo Alfonſo</hi> of his maieſties Councell. The
ſayd Lordes went to the Monaſtery, vppon the ſaid verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and examination, by the teſtimony of many Nunnes of the
ſayd Monaſtery which conſentingly, declared, that the holineſſe
of the Prioreſſe was fayned, and the woundes painted. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ended, the ſayd Prioreſſe was brought before them
whom they commaunded to ſweare vppon the Maſſe booke
and Chriſt crucified, that ſhee ſhould ſay the truth, of that
ſhould be demaunded of her. And if ſhee ſo ſayd: that God
ſhould helpe her: And if not, that the diuell ſhould carry her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Frſt how ſayd ſhe that ſhe had oft times ſeene the mother
of God? And how had ſhe the woundes: By the oath ſhe had
made, ſhe anſwered: That at nine or tenne yeares of age, ſhee
entred into the Monaſtery. And after ſhe had made profeſſion,
being ſeuenteene yeares olde, one day, as ſhe was praying, to
her was it reuealed, that God would cheriſh her: And that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
like day, when ſhee was at prayer, came the Angels
and put a Crowne of thornes vppon her head: which woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her. And many dayes after being in prayer, Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crufied
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:19632:219"/>
apeared vnto her and of the beams that iſſued from his
woundes, were thoſe which ſhe had, imprinted: And Chriſt
(whom ſhe called husband) oftentimes appeared to her) and
talked with her, and holpe her to ſay ouer the praiers, and that
ſhe confeſſed to this confeſſor that ſhe ſaid: <hi>Gloria Patri, &amp; tibi
&amp; Spiritui ſancto.</hi> The Confeſſor told her ſhe ſhould no more
ſay ſo: but <hi>Gloria Patri, &amp; Filio, &amp; Spiritui ſancto:</hi> as ſaith the
holy mother the Church. And in a conference which ſhee
had with her husband, ſhe told him that which her Confeſſor
had ſayd vnto her. And the husband anſwered: ſhe ſhould doe
what her Confeſſor had commanded her. The foreſayd Fathers
ſeeing ſhe ſought each way to make her ſelfe holy, and yet all
was fayned, as the other Nunnes declared vnto them; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
her to ſay the truth of that which had paſſed, ſeeing all
was fictions, and ſo to them it appeared, by information which
they had taken: and that ſhee ſhould craue mercie: and ſo
would they haue compaſſion vpon her. But (ſhe perſiſting that
no other truth there was, but that which ſhee had ſayd, as her
husband well knew) they left her. Another day in the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which they had with her, they tooke hard ſope and hot
water, and well waſhed her hands and wounds. And when
they began to do it, ſhe fained to haue great paine. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while that they had waſhed them, the ſayd wounds were
taken from her. And when ſhe ſaw they were taken away,
ſhe fell to the earth, and began to weepe, ſigh, and craue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and caſt her ſelfe at the feete of the ſayd Lords: who
willing her to confeſſe the truth: ſhee was wearied and dead
(ſaid ſhe) and that they ſhould leaue her till another day, and
ſhe would confeſſe the truth: and ſo they left her in guard of
the Nunnes, charging them on paine of excommunication,
they ſhould for no cauſe leaue her alone. Another day the
foreſaid Lordes returned to the Monaſterie, and cauſed the
ſaid Prioreſſe to be brought before them. And demaunding
of her how that buſineſſe paſſed: ſhe ſaid: that the truth was,
becauſe men ſhould eſteeme her holie, ſhee had painted the
woundes on her handes, and that ordinarily ſhee ſo did:
And that, that of the ſide ſhee had onely done thriſe with
a knife which ſhee had in her combe boxe. Once when
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:19632:220"/>
ſhe publiſhed, that the ſayd wounds were made: Another time
at a viſitation, made by the Prouinciall of their order the laſt, this
which now is done: being like vnto the ſcratch of a pen. And
that the Crowne of thornes vppon her head ſhe made, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelfe with a knife, and making the bloud to iſſue forth:
and that this ſhe had done ſixe or ſeuen times, Being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
how ſhee imprinted in the clothes, the fiue droppes of
bloud which were (ſayd ſhee) of the wound in the ſyde: She
anſwered, that ſhe carefully tooke certaine holland clothes,
and painted them with bloud, and when they gaue her ſome,
to touch the wound which ſhe fayned in her ſyde: ſhee cutte
them before thoſe which gaue them in ſuch ſort, that they
were like vnto thoſe which ſhee had, and put them vppon her
breaſt, and drawe fourth, and gaue them thoſe, which ſhee
had painted. Being demaunded, when the Moore captaine,
of them, reſident in this Citie of Lisbon, and had bene vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roye
of Biquinos came to ſee her how printed ſhee the wounds
in the little cloth, which ſhe gaue him: She anſwered. Becauſe
ſhe ſaw that the Moore did mark her, ſhee drewe a little, the
curtaine of the lettife window, faining, that for ſhame hee
ſhould not ſee her putting the cloth vppon her breaſt, ſhee
tooke out of her combe boxe a knife, and ſo pticked her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that it bled, and painted therewith the ſame cloth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
put it vppon the breaſt and beganne to ſtraine the
ſame before them all: and drewe it out imprinted with bloud
and all beleeued, it was the bloud of her ſide, being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
how ſhee had put thoſe droppes of bloud vppon the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on her hand ſhee tooke it away in ſuch ſort, that the bloud iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
and therewith rubbed ſhe her hand in the rotchet, and it
remayned died with bloud. Being demaunded how ſhee lift
vp her ſelfe: And how the Nunnes ſawe her many times, to
ſhine in her Cell: Shee anſwered: that ſhee kindled in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
diſh a fire with ſmall light, and put before it a lookeing
glaſſe, and that the light ſtroke vppon the glaſſe, and the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the glaſſe glimpſed in her face: And that ſhee ſhould
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:19632:220"/>
ſeeme to haue beene lifted vp, ſhe put her feete vpon Chapins
or womens ſhoes: other times vpon timber, which ſhe had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
prouided: whereupon ſhe ſo ſate, that ſhee ſeemed to
be lifted vp into the aire: demaunded, that being in mortall
ſinne, how ſhe dared euery day to communicate: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
She euer truſted that our Lord would draw her in time
to repentance: and hereof ſhee craued mercie of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd
Lordes. This notwithſtanding, they proceeded to take
further information: wherein the Nunnes declared, that ſhe
being one day in the Chapter, was lifted vp, and a place made
by her ſide, as though ſome man ſhould ſit there: Demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of her for what purpoſe ſhe did that ſhe ſayd: See ye not
that our father Saint <hi>Dominicke</hi> came thither, and there ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
And many other things, which to auoyd tediouſneſſe,

            <p>The foreſaid proceſſe ſeene by the foreſaid Lords, and the
offences which thereof redounded againſt the Prioreſſe: the
ſixt of the inſtant moneth of December in the 1588 yeare,
they pronounced ſentence againſt her, in the Monaſtery of
the mother of God, of the order of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> in this citie:
from whence they commaunded to carrie her, and in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was publiſhed and read the ſentence which we will now
declare. And afterwards, the 8. of the ſayd moneth in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
of the great Church of this citie, at the time of the great
Maſſe with an high and audible voyce was publiſhed. Wherby
they declared that through only zeale, that men ſhould deeme
her holy, all that to be and haue bene fained. And for that ſhee
had not dealt with, nor inuocated the diuell, they adiudged her
to perpetuall impriſonment. And that in fiue yeares ſhe might
not be confeſſed, nor communicate, except in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and three feaſts in the yeare, and in the Iubilee: and that
ſhe ſhould neither beare vaile nor habit, nor haue any actiue or
paſſiue voyce in the Chapter, nor bee elected to any office:
And that for fiue yeares ſhe ſhould eate vpon the ground, and
that the fragments remaining might not to any (no not to the
poore) be giuen, but burned: and that when they were to go
forth of the dyning place, ſhe ſhould lie proſtrate on the earth,
that all the Nunnes might paſſe ouer her: and that on wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes

and frydayes they ſhould giue her diſcipline whiles

no Nunne (one excepted) which the Prioreſſe of that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie

the faith. And that her picture vpon the wall of the <hi>Annunciada</hi>

            <p>Now to aduiſe all thoſe that truely deſire to ſerue Chriſt,
of whoſe name they are called Chriſtians, and will liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his holy Goſpell and law, and not according to
that which men haue inuented to liue in pleaſure. Some notes
and conſiderations will I here make of that which hath bene
ſayd vpon the life and ſentence of this holy Nunne. Firſt, as
touching the ten inſtructions drawne by <hi>Luſignan,</hi> out of the
Letters miſſiue, It were good to ſhew how falſe they be all in
general, and euery one in particular. For not vpon the word of
God, but vpon dreames, falſe miracles, illuſions of the diuell, &amp;
imaginations of a curſed hypocrite (which fained her ſelfe to
be no leſſe then Chriſt) haue they any foundation. But ſeeing
our aduerſaries by publike ſentence haue condemned all that
contained in the Letters, concerning the holineſſe and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of this Nunne, to be falſe, fained, and hypocritically done.
I will not paine my ſelfe to proue their falſhood. Onely I will
tell them: that when they will proue their new articles of faith,
they ſeeke better proofes. For dreames and falſe miracles are
now nothing worth. The time through the mercie of God, is
not now as wontedly it was, when the Clergie eaſilie decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the people, and made them to beleeue all whatſoeuer
they liſted. Bleſſed bee the Lord for the light which in our
times he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. His Maieſtie giue vs grace to draw neere
vnto it: For the ſeruant that knoweth his maiſters will, &amp; doth
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:19632:221"/>
it not, ſhall be more puniſhed then he that knoweth it not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, there is nothing in theſe his ten inſtructions, which
hath not already in the two precedent Treatiſes, of the Pope,
and of the Maſſe, bene ſufficiently confuted. To them I referre
my ſelfe. Our redeemer Ieſus Chriſt, when hee beganne to
preach his Goſpell, confirmed the ſame with true miracles:
and departing from this world (as Saint <hi>Marke</hi> in the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Goſpell declareth) for the ſame effect to confirme the
Euangelicall doctrine, he left to his Church the gift of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
miracles. This gift in the Church (I would ſay in ſome of
the faithfull, for all had it not, as witneſſeth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor.
12. where reckoning vp the giftes of the holy Spirit, and how
he diſtrributeth them amongſt other, hee ſaith <hi>And to another
are giuen the gifts of holineſſe by the ſame Spirit. To another wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of miracles, &amp;c.)</hi> for ſome time continued, vntill the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was confirmed, and then afterwards ceaſſed. Albeit
God, vſing his omnipotency, leaueth not ſometimes to do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
But this is extraordinary, and not common as then it
was. The Antichriſtians willing to be ſold for Chriſtians, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and doe confirme their new and falſe doctrine with
new and falſe miracles, of which their bookes bee full. For
this is the chiefe proofe wherewith they confirme their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Concerning that of the fiue wounds, there is no word in
all the new Teſtament, nor in any of the ancient Doctours,
which for the ſpace of one thouſand and two hundred yeares
liued in the Church of God, that any of the Apoſtles, no not
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the dearely beloued Diſciple, nor yet the holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our redeemer her ſelfe hath had them; nor euer was

               <hi>Francis</hi> himſelfe to haue reuealed

<hi>Vbertino</hi> and the Maiſter <hi>Piſano,</hi> who is the Author of that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
booke of Conformities. They ſay the ſame. Of no
great credit be theſe two Authors: as eaſily as they ſpeake it,
with the ſame facility will we condemne it.</p>
            <p>It is ſayd of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> that he couered the wounds of S.
<hi>Katherine</hi> of Sene, ſaith <hi>Antonius,</hi> that ſhe beſought God they
ſhould not be ſhewed vpon her body: Of S. <hi>Lyduuina</hi> ſaith <hi>Iohn
Brugmano,</hi> that to auoyd the applauſe of the world, ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
the ſame at God his hands. Of S. <hi>Gertrude</hi> ſaith <hi>Surius,</hi>
that for manie dayes ran bloud from them 7. times euery day.
But of our holy Nunne of <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſay the Prouinciall, and Friar
<hi>Lewes de Granada,</hi> and it was the publike voyce and fame, that
ſhe had them and ſhewed them, &amp; that they yeelded alwayes
freſh bloud, wherewith ſhee painted the ſmall clothes which
they gaue her. The Prouinciall ſaith, that the wound of the ſide
on certaine dayes, namely the fridayes, opened; &amp; that certaine
drops of bloud iſſued from the ſame. &amp;c. Surely this was much
more ſhameleſſe than all the others. Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and the reſt
ſayd to haue the wounds, liued in the times of great ignorance,
aſwell of good letters, as of true and pure Chriſtian religion,
when the Roman Antichriſt was abſolute Lord of all, &amp; ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both ſwords, ſpirituall and temporall. Then was there none
that durſt whiſper againſt him, nor that was ſo bold to ſay vnto
him, thou doſt wickedly: but it ſhould coſt him his life, or litle
leſſe. An eaſie thing was it then, with ſuch like fictions of
wounds and other miracles to deceiue the ſimple poore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people. But now that the Lord hath giuen ſo great light
of his Goſpell, a verie hard thing ſhall it bee to be long time
manitained with like opinion of holineſſe: by and by flyeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
hypocriſie: by and by God raiſeth vp ſome to ſpeake and
write againſt it. Vnhappy therefore was this Nunne, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the word, that in our time and not in their dayes, ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Had thoſe, ſayd to haue the wounds, bene well examined,
and with hot water and hard ſope waſhed, their hypocriſie no
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:19632:223"/>
no doubt had bene diſcouered, as well as that of our <hi>Marie de

vnhappy then ſhe: ſeeing they died in their hypocriſie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they deceiued many, and vntill this day do deceiue with
it. But our <hi>Mary</hi> liuing of her hypocriſie conuinced, in time (it
may be) will ſhe employ her great wit to better purpoſe, and
craue mercie at the hands of God, whom ſo wickedly ſhe hath
offended. And ſo his Maieſtie giue her grace truly to conuert
to the true Chriſtian religion: which not with dreams, nor falſe
miracles, but with the word of God it ſelfe is confirmed. His
Maieſtie ſhewe her this grace and mercie. Had this miſerable
creature (as did the others) died before her hypocriſie had bin
diſcouered, cannonized had ſhe bene, as they were, and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with this falſe miracle of the croſſe pretended, to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to commit Idolatrie) of this alſo was information taken by
commandement of the Legat. Of many other ſuch like things
that the Prouinciall faith, he could declare, what will they ſay
vnto me? How could theſe things and the reſt bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the art of the diuell, without his help, and inuocation vpon
him? I demaund of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what was that, which the three Moores
ſaw in the Prioreſſe, which were things ſo great &amp; maruellous,
that the Moores were not able to ſpeake. To the Archbiſhop
of Lisbon in the preſence of the Prouinciall and many others,
they confeſſed, that they ſaw neere to the Prioreſſe, Ieſus
Chriſt in humane ſhape, put vpon the croſſe: throughout all
Portugall was this miracle publiſhed. Will they ſay vnto mee
that it was the true Ieſus Chriſt, or that it was the illuſion of the
diuell: that it was Ieſus Chriſt will they not ſay: For in their
Sentence they ſay: All whatſoeuer this Nunne hath done to
haue bene fained. It followeth then, that it was the diuell in
humane ſhape, that appeared vnto her. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth aduiſe
vs, 2. Cor. chap. 14. that Satan is wont (the better to deceiue) to
transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light. But here in the
buſineſſe of theſe three Moores, much more bold was Satha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
transforming himſelfe into Chriſt crucified, and taking his
forme vpon him. O the great patience of God. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall
addeth. So famous, and ſo admirable was this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that the fame thereof hath ſtretched throughout all the
kingdome, &amp;c. Then was it a true miracle. But of thoſe, which
Sathan worketh, to deceiue men, and not a fiction of the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe.
Why make their Lordſhips no mention in their ſentence
how the Prioreſſe had made Sathan to appeare in the figure of
Chriſt crucified? And how that litle ſo deuout a croſſe was
made? and how the ſicke perſons were healed? The principall
paſſed they ouer, leaſt they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuperſtitions

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:19632:224"/>
ſhe, that ſhe had oftentimes ſeene the mother of God? wherof
in the Letters were made little mention? O great ſubtiltie:
herewith they haue ſtopped the mouth of the people. All theſe
things was the iuſt iudgment and puniſhment of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he puniſheth thoſe, that beeleue not the word of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
in the holy Scripture: but beleeue lies confirmed with
falſe miracles &amp; illuſions of the diuel. The principall reſteth for
me yet to demaund. What was, I demaund of them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
forme, as ſaith the Prouinciall, or hoſte conſecrated?
as ſaith Friar <hi>Lewes de Granada,</hi> which the wedneſday in the

holy ſacrament lay: which casket, of it ſelfe opened, and out of
it iſſued the ſaid hoſt without any viſible miniſtery, &amp; was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the mouth of the Religious, and ſhe receiued it with
moſt great deuotion &amp;c. The Prouinciall addeth: that another
time vpon Innocents day another ſuch like miracle happened.
Friar <hi>Lewes de Granada</hi> ſaith: That the Maſſe being ended,

(meaning Chriſt) the heauens muſt containe vntill the day of

of faith, and confeſſe the ſame in the Creed: Were there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofe to proue their conſecrated hoſtes, their ſacrament
of the aultar, not to be the body of Chriſt: this in good reaſon,
ſhould ſuffice, that the diuell vſeth his conſecrated hoſtes: he
carrieth them into the aire and putteth them into the mouth of
his he and ſhe deuoted, that men may holde them for holy. As
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:19632:225"/>
theſe two domeſtical exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the Franciſcan <hi>Magdalen de la
Cruz,</hi> and of the Dominican <hi>Mary de la viſitation,</hi> doe confirme
the ſame. But for as much as many other proofes they are taken
out of the holy ſcripture &amp; out of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctors, which we
haue noted in the Treatiſe of the Maſſe, there maiſt thou read
the ſame. This opening of the caſket, this iſſuing out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
hoſt, and viſible comming through the aire, without
any viſible myſtery, and putting it in to the mouth of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
of <hi>Mary,</hi> and other ſuch like was by the arte of the deuill, he
came betweene and was inuocated. Open then thy eies, O
Spaine, and vnderſtand: Suffer not thy ſelfe to be deceiued in
the firſt article of chriſtian religion. Remember it is the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
which our great God (whoſe name is Iehona) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
vs to keep. Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods before me.
How can that be God, how can that be a creator, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
vſeth to cauſe the people to commit idolatry, to entertaine
the fained holineſſe &amp; hypocriſy of <hi>Magdalen</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary,</hi> and of
other ſuch both hee and ſhee? Holy and bleſſed is our God: he
abhorreth wickednes, hipocriſy, ſuperſtition &amp; idolatry, Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude, that he which entertaineth theſe abhominations
is not the true, but a falſe God, made by the inuention of men,
and Sathan their father, which gouerneth them. And this is the
iuſt iudgment and puniſhment of God, that they which neither
read, nor heare, nor yet giue credit to the word of God, regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
