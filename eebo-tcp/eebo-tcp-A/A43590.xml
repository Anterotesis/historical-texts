            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you it is, when all is done, and to you alone, to whom we muſt make our applications and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, if we deſire to obtain an equal hearing. And to that purpoſe, though we know not your character and diſpoſition, yet do we preſume that you are good and courteous; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that you are ſound in the faith, able and well qualifyed, and not onely able, but which is more, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo to give righteous judgement. Hence it is that we ſtill appeal to you, and bring our matters controverted before your bar, and while we differ in other things, ſometimes more perhaps then need is, yet we never fail to agree in this, to refer all to your final ſentence, ſaying, <hi>Let the Reader judge.</hi> And becauſe it muſt be thus, and cannot poſsibly be otherwiſe, I pray you be well pleaſed with all if I now briefly put you in mind, and tell you, for your own ſake as well as mine, what that is that you are to judge and paſs your cenſure upon: It is not whether party of the two goes beyond the other in artifice and ſubtilitic, or is of the better parts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or the more ready and expert in wielding the braſen ſhield: if this be it that is contended for, I yield it now, and give it gone, not having ſo much art
<pb facs="tcp:96772:4"/>
and learning as ſome men have, to deliver things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly untrue, corrupt and irrational, and when they are found to be ſuch, preſently to caſt about for miſts and muffles, wherein to involve my ſelf, and paſs away undiſcerned; ſo that my admirers, if any I had, ſhould nevertheleſs admire and follow me ſtill. And becauſe I think I durſt not do it, and am ſure I ought not, I am very well content that I cannot do it. But the Queſtion that you are to look after is, on which ſide the Truth is, and ſuch truth as much concerns you, for moſt of thoſe things we ſtrive about, it is needfull for you rightly to underſtand and know, leſt you be drawn aſide into a wrong way, upon pretence of taking a nearer, or a better way. Yea, the main Controverſie is, concerning the meaning of certain clauſes in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will and Teſtament; and theſe too, touching your heavenly inheritance, what your claim and title is to life eternal, and how you hold it: Whether God or man, Grace or Nature, doth begin and finiſh Faith and Salvation. So that it concerneth you, as much as it concerneth either of the parties litigant, that you be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and judge aright: and I pray you remember, what you know already, that the beſt cauſe doth not always fall to the fierceſt pleader, nor to him that uſeth moſt words. My Adverſary <hi>Mr. Horn,</hi> ſeemeth to be of this minde, That any argument though never ſo ſlender, or anſwer though never ſo ſleighty, any evaſion, albeit moſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, will ſerve the turn, and do well enough, ſo they be well ſet on, namely with clapping hands and houting. And many of the weaker ſort, when they perceive him
<pb facs="tcp:96772:4"/>
not onely to be earneſt and importunate, but to wax hot and moody; are reſolved to beleeve there is ſomething in that which he ſaith, though they know not what it is: And rather than they will put themſelves to the trouble of weighing with due attention what is ſaid on each ſide; they chooſe to think, whatſoever is ſaid by way of Anſwer, though it be meerly deluſory, to be Anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: and ſuppoſing no good man will complain for nought, they judge it rightfull to aſsiſt and favour the wronged party. And becauſe at all times they finde it a more eaſie and pleaſing work, to be moved and warmed in their affections, then to be informed in underſtanding and knowledge; you can hardly perſwade them to the contrary, but that faithfulneſs and the beſt Religion, are lodged under that which they call Zeal, though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it be little elſe, but noiſe and clamour.</p>
            <p>He that hath peruſed the Anſwer, that this Reply of mine is directed to, cannot but obſerve one cuſtome or manner of the Authour, not proper indeed to him, yet wherein he doth exceed and out-go others his like: when he ſhould anſwer an objection, and make good his own Doctrine againſt my Exceptions, he is wont to omit the chief ſtrength of the proof, reaſon or authority, and catching hold of ſome word or clauſe, ſome expreſsion or other, upon that to ſpend his time, and ſometime his anger, though that word or expreſsion be ſo far imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nent, as it might have been left out, and the charge or exception have been valid nevertheleſs, even as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid without it. This dealing of his ſo frequent, hath called to minde that which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſomewhere relateth
<pb facs="tcp:96772:5"/>
of a certain wealthy citizen, who having promiſed to a German Doctour a good ſum of money in reward of his diligent attendance and fidelity in the cure of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe; being recovered and grown ſound again, was nothing ſo forward to perform, as he was free to promiſe; but having paſſed the danger, bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he might mock the Saint. The firſt time that he ſaw him, he put him off with fair words; the next, with foul: for meeting him in the ſtreet, after many words and ſharp conteſt ariſing about the Non-payment, at laſt not knowing how better to come rid of him, he took ſore offence at his putting THOU upon him, which yet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not alike in all languages, <hi>Vah homo Germanus, Tuiſſas me?</hi> ſo ſhaking his head, and uſing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpeeches, away he flung in a great fume, and thus the matter ended. Though <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H.</hi> my adverſary doth ſomewhat reſemble this wealthy citizen, and be of their number who hold chiding to be the cheapeſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; I hope, you my Reader, have ſo much skill in difference of coin, as to joyn with me, while I cannot acknowledge cavilling and exclaiming to be currant pay. To accuſe in generals, is thought not to be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, and I muſt not now make any ſtay upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; yet this I will ſay, I was much diſcouraged, and ſomewhat provoked with his trifling allegations, and picking holes in ſtead of hitting blots, ſo vainly and looſely for the moſt part, that I hope you do not expect I ſhould inſiſt upon every particular that he hath put upon me, becauſe I think there is no man, yea though he had nothing elſe in the world to do, but muſt needs
<pb facs="tcp:96772:5"/>
be unwilling to go thorow with ſo tedious an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And yet when I paſs by his objections and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, ſuch as they are, taking no notice of them; I am afraid thoſe Lay-men that he ſpeaketh of pag. 102. that <hi>cannot read Latine, and yet could ſee the faults of my arguings,</hi> when they ſhall come and here eſpie moreover the want of my anſwerings, will verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that I am quite put to ſilence in the reſpective particulars, and can finde cut nothing to ſay in behalf of my ſelf, but am at <hi>Dulcarnon, right at my wits end;</hi> I muſt therefore deſire you to remember, that if I have omitted any thing, it is not becauſe I thought it could not anſwered; but becauſe I thought it needed no anſwer, or elſe deſerved none, truſting that you, my Reader, will compare what is ſaid on each ſide, and ſatisfie your ſelf. So will I here take my leave of you, rather than I will ſeem either to miſdoubt, or any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent your obſervation.</p>

and any other: And I think there is no compariſon to be made, betwixt ſo great a number of men ſo well qualifyed (whatſoever their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was) pretending to walk in the beaten path of the reformed Churches, And your ſelf, being but one ſingular perſon, without any colour of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, profeſsing to forſake the common road. And he that readeth the Title-page of your Catechiſme, and obſerveth what points you there promiſe to lay open; would think that you ought in fair dealing to have made the nine and thirty Articles your Standard, and rule of compariſon: for <hi>They</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the Church of England touching thoſe controverted points: but in the childrens Catechiſme, nothing is laid down purpoſely concerning them, becauſe it was not thought, although you think ſo, that they did ſute the capacitie of children. Yet becauſe you ſeem to appeal to the Engliſh Catechiſme, as making much for you, I am willing to deal with you there, and thither we will go: Although I expect you ſhould evade and ſhift off all that can be brought againſt you out of it: or elſe flie off from it, as not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging you in all things, but onely in ſome things that you approve: And theſe two, I reckon to be much alike.

and eluding their manifeſt meaning. Out of the Church-Catechiſme I propound to you two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in brief, againſt your common Doctrine.

            <p>Your diſcourſe tending to accord the words of <hi>Luke</hi> with <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, becauſe it was ſomewhat tedious and vain, as I thought it, and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it belonged to another place, I did onely note by the way in brief. But that you did in ſeeming-ſatisfaction to your ſelf at leaſt, make them agree well together, I did not omit to give notice in theſe words [<hi>though he thinketh he can reconcile them.</hi>] And when I ſaid thus much, it is moſt evident, that I did not fraudulently ſuppreſs, what you did; though I did not needleſly expreſs how you did it. But when you ſaid, <hi>It is ſafer to ſtick to Paul than to Luke,</hi> it was ſcandalouſly ſpoken of you, and an odious compariſon: if you do indeed beleeve all holy Scripture to be divinely inſpired, why ſhould you prefer one writer of it before another?</p>
            <p>You appeal to me, Whether in caſe <hi>Luke</hi> doth diſagree with <hi>Paul</hi> [<q rend="margQuotes">if it be not ſafer to ſtick to <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays, <hi>If we, or an angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel than we have preached, let him be accurſed</hi>]</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle doth not make compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf and any other Apoſtle or pen-man of holy Scripture, for he joyns himſelf with them [<hi>if we</hi>] he ſets not himſelf above others, but names himſelf together with others, the better to eſtabliſh
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96772:16"/>
that Goſpel, which he together with others had taught. Here is nothing of ſticking to <hi>Paul</hi> more than to <hi>Luke,</hi> but of ſticking to the doctrine once delivered, againſt any other doctrine that ſhould be taught by any whoſoever, upon what pretence ſoever imaginable.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But when you anſwer the arguments brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you out of ſuch chapters, by ſaying, thoſe chapters are hard to be underſtood; then you do <hi>not ſtick to his ſayings</hi> ſo, as by them to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or to ſuffer an end to be put to the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. That which is urged out of thoſe places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Univerſaliſts, is eaſie and evident: you make uſe of the difficultie of them, for an anſwer to put off and elude that which is plain and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure or difficult. The matters of doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> may be hard to be underſtood, that is hard to be received, digeſted, and entertained, by looſe unſettled perſons: many difficulties and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies there may be, not eaſily cleared; ſhall this render the proof invalid, that ſuch doctrines there are? If you ſhould out of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles defend Juſtification by Faith againſt a Papiſt, you would not accept it for an anſwer, if he ſhould ſay thus,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96772:16"/>
That is one of thoſe things the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of, hard to be underſtood, which ſome hereticks have wreſted towards libertie and profaneneſs, as if therefore there were no neceſſity of godlineſs or good works. The rejection of the Jews and calling of the Gentiles, The abolition of the Law of Moſes, were matters hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Jews, and in which were many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities; yet were plainly delivered by the Apoſtle: The impoſsibility of Apoſtates repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation was plainly taught, yet attended with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and wreſted by the <hi>Novatians:</hi> So is the final period of the world foretold in holy Scripture; yet are there many obſcurities about it, and many errours. The Reſurrection of the dead is fully and manifeſtly declared and confirmed; yet becauſe it was hard to be underſtood and beleeved, it was wreſted to this ſenſe, as if it were already paſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpreted of riſing from the death of ſin, or any other way. Theſe particular doctrines now by me named, are by divers diverſly conjectured to be intended by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> as well as that doctrine to which you apply his words. Gods gracious and free Election, likewiſe final Perſeverance, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. ch. 1. ver. 2, and 5. as well as by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.29, 30. and in the chief part of the ninth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. And becauſe theſe things are hard to be yeelded to, and hard to be received; and becauſe there be many things belonging thereto that are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96772:17"/>
ſecret and unfathomable; let not therefore that which is plainly taught, be either denied, or in ſuch a manner interpreted and perverted, that it amounts to a denial. You and yours have ſo gone to work, that to an ordinarie capacitie the chapter ſpoken of is made ſcarce intelligible. You ſay, God decreed not to chooſe particular perſons, but to chooſe all ſuch as beleeve the promiſes of the Goſpel, and to refuſe all ſuch as ſeek juſtification by works; whereas cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had there ever been any ſuch decree made, then <hi>Paul</hi> had never been choſen, who was a law-worker, as you call it. So were many of the Jews and Phariſees, who yet were brought to life eternal. And whereas the Apoſtle teacheth Election and Salvation to be, <hi>Not of man that worketh, willeth, er runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> you have ſo wreſted it, that now it is, Not of man that willeth or worketh, but of man that beleeveth, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in Faith and Repentance to his lives end. And indeed, if Election be of ſuch, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> who perſevere in Faith and Repentance, then is Election of workers, in reſpect of their works, namely, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and Repenting, and Perſevering, which are works, all of them belonging to Gods law.

needed alteration; who ſoon after returned him again his copie, in ſundry places blotted, but no way bettered, having put out divers words, here one and there another, placing ſuch in their ſtead as were no way ſo fit and proper: and when the Secretarie asked him the reaſon, and what he miſliked in thoſe words that he thus corrected: <hi>Atqui,</hi> ſaid the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, <hi>non vidiſſe me ſcripta tua ſuſpectare poteras, ſi nihil immutatum reperiſſes:</hi> you would have thought I never read or peruſed your writing, had you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it again juſt ſuch as you ſent it to me.

Chriſtian Churches forbid not to read <hi>Eccles</hi> 12.1. in Hebrew, but they are againſt rendring every word, juſt as it is in that language, as their practice doth plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

And though you teach your ſcholars at your fourth Queſtion, to anſwer, <hi>There is but one God:</hi> yet if they be wonted to read or hear that word in the plural, and be uſed ſo to ſpeak, will they not go near to forget your Anſwer in your Catechiſme, and to think that there are more than one? <hi>Bara Elohim</hi> is the ſacred Text, good Hebrew and ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: But <hi>Creavit Dii,</hi> is ſcandalous, no true La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, nor good Divinitie.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you think good to joyn with thoſe that hold it not to be a bare Hebraiſm, but an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Sacred Trinitie, I pray you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on the other ſide, 1. that the plural number im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth two or four, as wel as three: ſo wholly it is but a matter of uncertaintie: 2. becauſe you ſay here, it is a ſcandal for Chriſtians to <hi>Judaize,</hi> for ſo you are pleaſed to <hi>Lutheranize,</hi> if indeed you beleeve that God is called <hi>Elohim,</hi> becauſe of the pluralitie of perſons; then whereſoever that word be found, though aſcribed to one ſeveral perſon, it muſt ſignifie the whole Trinitie, and then in ſtead or <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> you are in peril to fall into <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> or the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the <hi>Patropaſſians.</hi> And for the common people, I hope they will be warie how they walk; and how they ſpeak in ſuch points of Faith, as this is.

But if you have ſo much leaſure as to trouble your ſelf about others, and what it is that they think, and that you would not be afraid there where no fear is; I pray let all your fear in this matter be for them that call it [<hi>A groſſ ſoleciſm</hi> to imagine that there ſhould be one cauſe of the act, and another of the obliquitie or ſinfulneſs of the act; and that think it is as impoſsible to ſeparate the wickedneſs of the act, from the act that is wicked, as it is to diſtinguiſh the roundneſs of the globe, from the globe that is round; So that he which is the Authour of the one, muſt be the Authour of the other alſo: yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live and move:</hi> Let it be for them who tell you it muſt be a <hi>Metaphyſical head</hi> that can determine how God ſhould work by evil inſtruments, and not be guiltie of the evil: and yet the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.18. <hi>He hath So fulfilled.</hi> Let it be for them that think, he who withholdeth a thing which being preſent would hinder an event, is the cauſe of that event: and in whoſe power it is that a thing be not done, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96772:23"/>
him it is imputed when it is done; and he that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth the light, is the cauſe of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth for want of the light.] And yet no man that hath his reaſon left entire to him, can imagine that the ſun which is all light, having no darkneſs in it, can be the cauſe when it ſetteth, of the ſhadow of the night.</p>
            <p>It is an eaſie matter to make any opinions ſeem odious to thoſe men that are full gorged with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt them. Every thing feeds according to the kinde and conſtitution: <hi>Torva leaena alupum ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur.</hi> I can tell of ſome, who in the doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein they have been educated, have been verie much confirmed by the matter and the manner of ſome mens writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe men that take ſuch pains to make the opinions you ſpeak of to be <hi>odious:</hi> I do wiſh, and if it might be, I would adviſe them, that they would at laſt forbear, and not pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo odious a practiſe: whether theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be true or falſe, is uncertain; it is at leaſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they are the Truth, and upon theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> it becauſe very many of theſe men, by their own confeſsion, were of the verie ſame minde in theſe points of doctrine, and held that end of the controverſie to be the ſureſt, which now they load with unworthy mockings and reproaches: And if <hi>They</hi> were ſo, then were their Teachers ſo likewiſe, becauſe it was for want of better companie that they changed no ſooner.</p>

               <hi>Secondly</hi> becauſe a verie great proportion of the Churches Chriſtian, heretofore and lately, hath in the main and leading parts of the controverſie, gone that way which theſe now forſake, and would perſwade the world to follow them. For the days of old let <hi>Ger. Voſsius</hi> ſpeak, never ſuſpected for a partiarie while he wrote his Hiſtorie, unlelſs it were for their ſide.

            <p>The learned <hi>Dr. J.</hi> by his Publiſher was entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Divine,</hi> with theſe two reſtrictions, of his Rank, and of his Age: I may add a third, of his partie, and then his teſtimonie is without exception, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3712. <hi>If as good a ſcholar as Bellarmine would take the pains to examine his opinion, as ſtrictly as he hath done Calvins</hi> (touching reprobation) <hi>it would quickly appear to be for qualitic the very ſame, if not worſe.</hi>] And the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth the Doctrine of Predeſtination, yet knew it to be <hi>A dangerous downfall to carnal minds,</hi> Artic. 17.</p>
            <p>I am not ſpeaking now of the Truth, or of the certaintie of theſe matters; nor at this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading any man to be of this judgement touching theſe opinions. whether they be certain or no, or whether they be true or no; this is certain, they are probable to be true: and that may be enougn to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96772:25"/>
perſwade men not to reproach them, though they beleeve them not. <hi>Prudentibus</hi> (faith <hi>Sidonius</hi>) <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicitùs inſitum eſt vitare fortuita:</hi> Wiſemen uſe to be deeply rooted in this principle, not to run a great hazzard or capital adventure upon any thing that is dubious and uncertain.

            <p>The opinions furthermore (which your Reader muſt be directed, where he ſhall finde them made ſo odious) beſides the Authority of a moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of Chriſtians, receive ſome probability from Gods dealing in this preſent world: his ways being not like ours, nor his thoughts like our thoughts: therefore are his works rightly counted wonderfull. Was there ever found any man who was well ſatisfied and contented with what God hath done and doeth upon earth, unleſs it were by laying to heart that it was his doing?

neſs that ought to be in man? And if there be ſo much left in this world to our admiration; it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yea it is likely there is much more in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Hic eſt fidei ſummus gradus,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther, de ſervo arbitrio) credere illum eſſe clementem, qui tam paucos ſalvat, tam multos damnat:</hi> This is the higheſt degree of faith; to beleeve that God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull who yet condemneth ſo many, and ſaveth ſo few. And if we give allowance to our reaſon to come up ſo far as to keep even pace with our faith, we may perhaps a little ſatisfie our reaſon, and a while gratifie our affections, and likewiſe retain ſome kinde of religion. But let us remember that the Chriſtian Religion hath always been accounted by the beſt Chriſtians, to be as well againſt our will, as above our underſtanding.</p>
            <p>In caſe of vile and ſcandalous words againſt ſome great Prince or Potentate, it hath been ſometimes the manner for the Judges, not to hear the words publickly uttered or rehearſed; but as it were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and apart to read and conſider them: Even then and there where ſuch words were to beaggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the height, and deeply cenſured. It were to be wiſhed that the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> and all that joyn with them, were half ſo moral and reſpectfull toward the God of heaven. For they ſeem to take delight to heap up terms moſt horrid, odious, and deteſtable, and charge them upon their adverſaries how? as ſpoken by them? no: diſclaimed by them, but following upon their opinions by conſequences
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96772:26"/>
framed or forged rather by their own ſelves, But if you and yours will not be otherwiſe minded than you are, nor take heed to your way, leſt you offend with your tongue, in reproaching the living God; but that you will take pleaſure to ſharpen and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the arrows of your reproaches with taunts and mockings, whereby to render Chriſtianitie hatefull to the common people, who for the moſt part do ſo far contemn Gods manifeſt judgements of this life, that they are little buſied with his ſecret decrees touching the world to come, ſaving that you would fain fill their heads with your venomous ſlanders: Then I will give this counſel to all Chriſtians whomſoever, who think not much to take good counſel from whomſoever, that they beware how they give a willing ear to ſuch offenſive and diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches: and that they take heed of being converſant, and eſpecially in taking pleaſure and diſport in ſuch ſcurrilous writings, as <hi>The Thief Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate,</hi> and <hi>Tilenus Examinate,</hi> with the like, leſt they be given over to hardneſs of heart and a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde, as a juſt recompence of the delight they take in ſuch wickedneſs. Religion is the moſt ſacred and the moſt ſerious thing in the world: All ſerious perſons think it ſo; and all idle ones will finde it ſo, when they ſhall come ſooner or later to abominate and hold accurſed that froth and ſome of wit, that preſumeth profanely and ſacril egiouſly to make any article of Faith, any part of Chriſtian profeſsion, or the holy Scripture, the ſubject or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mirth and mockery.</p>

In ſtead of asking pardon for what I have now ſaid, I will crave leave upon the ſame occaſion to ſay a little more, before I paſs from your fourth chapter.</p>
            <p>To render <hi>opinions</hi> odious, although it may be bad enough, is yet pertinent. But it hath been always accounted moral, to ſpare the <hi>perſons.</hi> Now that you may ſee how little heed is to be given to your Authours deſigne, while he would make his Adverſaries <hi>opinions</hi> to be odious, I will here, being ſo fairly invited by you, give an inſtance of his haſte and miſtake while he endeavoured to make their <hi>perſons</hi> odious. One inſtance, but a pregnant one, containing no leſs than four miſtakes of his in leſs than twice ſo many lines. So I direct you to his 120 page of <hi>Heautontimorumenos,</hi> where thus he aſperſeth ſeveral perſons: and firſt M.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Strictly, the offering of the ſacrifice was that which you have omitted, namely, the killing of it in relation to God. That which you call the oblation of the ſacrifice, was a thing conſequent upon the oblation; or at moſt, the compleating of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that is, the burning of part of it, and the aſcending of the fire and ſmoke. For this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſacrificing, which I ſhall now tell you. The The Prieſt is the officer or Mediatour betwixt God and Man: Man offereth his gift to God, when he wholly reſigneth up his gift to him: this is done partly and preparatively by himſelf in the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: principally and fully by the Prieſt in the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96772:29"/>
or ſlaying of it. The Prieſt killing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at the foot of the altar, doth then mans part, in offering to God mans gift. Now hath man done offering. In the next place God doth by his Prieſt diſpoſe of the gift being thus made his: How? his altar devoureth one part, the Prieſt and the people the other. If therefore you would rightly know the true nature of ſacrifices among the Jews, you muſt conſider them not onely as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of obedience and divine worſhip in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; or as acknowledgements that death was the ſtipend of ſin; or as ſhadows and types that Chriſt ſhould die for the ſins of the world; though all theſe they were: But further they are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Federal rites or ſignes of a Covenant, Friendſhip, or Agreement betwixt God and man: As always feaſting or eating together was a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of familiarity, amitie, and mutual conſent. Pſal. 41. <hi>My familiar friend that did eat my bread:</hi> and 1 Cor. 5.11. by thoſe words, <hi>With ſuch an one, no not to eat,</hi> familiaritie is forbidden. 1 Cor. 10. <hi>We are one body,</hi> becauſe we are partakers of one bread. Thus the Altar is called <hi>Gods Table,</hi> Ezek. 41.22. and in the firſt of <hi>Malachi,</hi> The Table of the Lord is contemptible, and the ſacrifices are called <hi>Bread</hi> there, they offered polluted <hi>Bread</hi> upon the altar, when they offered the blinde and the lame for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Levit. 21.6. The offerings of the Lord made by fire, and <hi>the Bread of their God</hi> they do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. <hi>Bread,</hi> it is well known in phraſe of Scripture,

God is brought in, in figure and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or analogically, as eating what is burnt upon the altar. <hi>Calvins</hi> words upon the place laſt named are theſe; <hi>Notatur familiaris Dei cum populo ſuo communicatio, ac ſi communem cum illis haberet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam— ſe cultoribus ſuis convivam facere dignatus eſt;</hi> that is, When the part of the ſacrifice which was burnt upon the altar, is ſaid to be Gods Meat or Food, it noteth, that God is pleaſed familiarly to converſe with his people, and as it were, to feaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the ſame feaſt with them.

And it would never have been denied, had there been no colour for it, no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of it, had there been no likeneſs of it, more or leſs. The altar, and the fire of the altar do take Gods portion; the reſt the Prieſt and people eat, 1 Cor. 9.13. They which wait on the altar, are <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:96772:30"/>
of the altar. The altar taketh part, and they take part: as ſervants uſually wait on their maſter, make ready the meat, &amp; ſerve him til he hath eaten, and afterwards they eat: Thus did the Levites make the dinner ready, the Prieſts attended upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is Gods altar, where he is ſuppoſed as it were to eat, and afterward they did take their ſhare, and feed upon the reverſion, <hi>Praecerptos cibos,</hi> as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucius Felix</hi> calleth the meats that were left of the heathen ſacrifices. So that the act of offering was paſt before the fire came to be kindled, although the gift that was offered, did remain there readie to be burned. They who rendred <hi>Idolothyta, things offered to idols,</hi> did not think that the offering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the burning; for then the aſhes muſt be eaten, there being nothing elſe left. Incenſe was offered ſtrictly when it was burnt: but ſtrictly, Beaſts were offered when they were ſlain, though they might be ſaid to be offered too, in ſome fort, when they were conſumed by fire. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which you ſeem to give out of the Texts in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> chap. 1. and 3. is as weak as water. It is called a <hi>Burnt-offering made by fire:</hi> doth the offering therefore conſiſt in the burning? No: but that which was before offered, is now burnt, and there is the <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> or the offering made by fire, or the offering fired. And you know well enough that other languages give not the leaſt colour for this your new conceit, whatſoever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with ſome that are ignorant may do. And if the <hi>whole

            <p>And whereas you make application of this your fanſie, that Chriſts Prieſtly oblation ſhould ſtrictly be, when he went unto God, and was carryed up to heaven, you do after your wonted manner, confound Chriſts <hi>oblation</hi> with his <hi>Aſcenſion:</hi> and his ſtate of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> with his ſtate of <hi>Exaltation. Hebr.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, for then muſt he often have ſuffered.</hi> Doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſay plainly here to your underſtanding, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> did offer himſelf then when he ſuffered, and in his ſuffering? And although you ſay, "It is one thing to offer himſelf in heaven (which you meant not) "and another to offer himſelf in his aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into heaven (which was your meaning) yet in your page 22. you declare yourſelf plainly for the <hi>Socinians,</hi> teaching that the purgation was made in heaven: ſo you contradict one falſhood with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96772:32"/>
that where there is a ſacrifice, there is an altar alſo; whether we make the altar to be the croſs, or the Divine nature, as you call it, the fierie love of it, or whatſoever it be that beareth moſt proportion to other altars; ſtill we ſhall finde there will be ſome diſſimilitude betwixt this altar, and that upon which the ſacrifices were wont to be burnt. And whereas you compare the <hi>aſcending of the ſmoke of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which God is ſaid to ſmell as a ſweet ſavour, unto Chriſts aſcending into heaven;</hi> It is Chriſts <hi>Paſſion,</hi> not his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> in which God was well pleaſed, as with the ſmoke of the burnt-offerings: Eph. 5.2. <hi>Chriſt loved and gave himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> He gave himſelf for us, when he was crucifyed, and then was his love ſhewed to us, when he laid down his life for us: And accordingly is our juſtification aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to his bloud or death: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin.

The queſtion with you is about this latter. Hebr. 13. V. 11, 12. <hi>The bodies of thoſe beaſts whoſe bloud is brought into the Sanctuary by the high Prieſt for ſin, are burnt without the camp: wherefore Jeſus alſo, that he might ſanctifie the people with his own bloud, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96772:32"/>
without the gate.</hi>] Hence is proved invincibly, that the crucifying of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was typifyed and prefigured by the burning of the beaſt: and that it did perfect and compleat the ſacrifice of him, as much as the ſacrificing of the beaſt was finiſhed and completed, then when it was burnt and conſumed to aſhes.</p>

            <p>To praiſe, and to flatter; to reprove, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile; theſe do well or ill, have good or bad effect, according as the party is diſpoſed upon whom they are beſtowed. Rebuke a wiſe man and he will love you; but if you reprove a ſcorner, he will hate you: if you praiſe a good man more than there is cauſe, that is, if you flatter him, he will ſtudie to deſerve your good word, and will be (as it were) aſhamed to come ſhort of your commendation: and it will in effect amount to an admonition or reproof. It is a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96772:34"/>
very good caution to Princes and great perſons, to take heed of flatterers, who do in all things ſeek to ſooth and pleaſe them, from whom oftentimes they receive damage, and ſo they do ſometimes from thoſe that out of quite contrary carriage do contradict, and croſs, and provoke them.</p>
            <p>If it be granted that a flatterer is in ſome fort worſe than a ruſtical reprover, yet he is not better than a reviler, the exceſs always having more of vertue in it, or at leaſt inclining more to it, than the defect; and eſpecially in our demeanour towards our Superiours. And if a flatterer be the worſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that deal in words; yet is he not ſo ill as thoſe that wrong in hoſtile attempts: and therefore you kept no <hi>decorum,</hi> when you made flatterers worſe than open Rebels, yea though growing frightfull. And there is a larger difference between a flatterer, and a traytour. The example of <hi>Dalilah</hi> had done well enough, to prove that a ſecret traytour is worſe than an open Rebel; but to your preſent purpoſe it no way appertains.</p>
            <p>For this particular kinde of flattery, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in aſcribing too much power, greatneſs, or prerogative to Princes, as it is true, ſo it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſay they may be flattered: for ſo may the people too, to the prejudice of them both. Out of doubt, it is ill done to aſcribe to either of them more than belongs to them. But here is the right queſtion, To whom the ſupreme power of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belongs, whether to the King, to take care
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96772:34"/>
what Faith it is the ſubjects make profeſſion of; or to the ſubjects to be of what profeſſion they will. And I think it is not well done to call that flattery, when no more is aſcribed to any one than is due to him by the law of nature: by the Law of God, and by the law of the land reſpectively.</p>
            <p>Towards the cenſurableneſs of Kings (which was wont to be accounted amongſt <hi>dangerous poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>) you bring three inſtances; <hi>Saul, Uzziah,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> As for <hi>Saul, Samuel</hi> refuſed to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with him, and to joyn with him in ſacrificing what was forbidden to be ſacrificed: but he did not refuſe to turn with him, when he was to ſhew him honour before the people, in attending on him while he worſhipped God, And inaſmuch as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reproved <hi>Samuel,</hi> for ſhewing more regard and tenderneſs to <hi>Saul</hi> than he ought to have done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peremptorily rejected; we may well imagine how <hi>Samuel</hi> ſtood affected to <hi>Saul:</hi> how reſpectfull and how ſtedfaſt he would have been to him, had the caſe been ordinary. And <hi>Uzziah</hi> was not put out of that place that did belong to him: The Prieſts ſaid, You ſhall not come into <hi>our</hi> place in the Temple: they ſaid not, You ſhall not keep your own. If a Miniſter ſhould not ſuffer one of his Communicants to conſecrate and diſtribute the bread and wine in the Lords Supper, but forbid him: this would not come near ſo much as to abſtention, and therefore this example comes not near the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And laſtly, as to <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> I anſwer, If
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96772:35"/>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great be reckoned the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperour; then <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the elder is the firſt Chriſtian Emperour that is found among the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, or under Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline; and the laſt too, for the ſpace of ſeven hundred years, till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and <hi>Heldebrand,</hi> when Hell, that is, Satan broke looſe. Next, it is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned whether it was well done of theſe two great perſons, what they did. As ſome highly commend, ſo others much miſlike the Emperours ſubmiſsion, and the Biſhops auſterity, as drawing danger and diſgrace upon the Ruler of the people, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity God provided for, by making a law that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad all ſuch ſpeeches as ſavoured of detraction and contempt of him. Thirdly, I regard not much what S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did.

                  <hi>Falſe oaths or ſinfull</hi>]</q> The Magiſtrate may give an oath: if it be a falſe oath, it is his fault that takes it, not his that gives it. For never yet was any man put to ſwear that ſuch a thing, or ſuch an opinion is true: and therefore he could not be put upon it to ſwear that which is falſe. He that ſome years now paſt, wrote a Diſcourſe of conforming in <hi>Revolutions of Government,</hi> pag. 54. complains of the <hi>dangerouſneſs of thoſe Aſſertory oaths, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to ſwear that ſuch or ſuch a thing or opinion is true, which may ſeem clearly ſo to the learned contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of thoſe oaths, but not ſo to others.</hi>] What you mean by falſe oaths I know not: but I think this Authour aimed at the oath of <hi>Supremacie;</hi> but he was very much miſtaken in ſuppoſing that oath to be aſſertory of the Kings <hi>Supremacie:</hi> If that be it that is ſworn, it is not a falſe oath, but it is a very vain one to ſwear that which the Court knows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and is firmly perſwaded of. An oath is an end of doubt and controverſie. What is the doubt? It is not whether the King be <hi>Supreme</hi> or no: but whether the partie ſworn beleevs it or no: So that it is a kinde of <hi>Purgatory</hi> oath, whereby the party clears himſelf from the ſuſpicion of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> by denying a chief point of <hi>Poperie.</hi>

            <p>But, firſt, when you asked the childe the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Oughteſt thou not to walk in the obſervation of the ten Commandments?</hi> why did you not teach him to anſwer plainly and poſitively, Yes? whereas the Anſwer that you framed for him, amounts to a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative: <hi>In acting forth Faith and Love I do obſerve alſo thoſe Commandments</hi>] which is as much as if you had told him, that he ſhall not need to obſerve the ten Commandments, otherwiſe than by acting forth Faith and Love.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, for your ſimilitude from Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-learning, I anſwer, He that hath attained <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes</hi> or <hi>Quintilians</hi> ſtyle, may well lay aſide and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect all Grammar-rules, and rules of Rhetorick, and needeth them no more than an ordinary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man, that hath by cuſtome learned to ſpeak true Engliſh, doth ſtand in need of an Engliſh Grammar, which he never yet looked into, it may

be never heard of. As he that can ſwim well, throws away his bladders, and the lame man that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his legs at the Bath, leavs his crutches there that helped him thither. And will you ſay, or dare any man ſay, that he who hath attained the higheſt degree of Faith and Love that is attained in this world, may neglect, forget, or not give heed to the ten Commandments? Where is our obedience to Gods Law, if our eye be not upon his Law? or what is obedience, but as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>To have reſpect to all Gods Commandments?</hi> So you have mended the matter well with your ſimilitude; you teach children, even children at their firſt, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ten Commandments as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerved the rules of Rhetorick, who was himſelf a rule to Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>Section</hi> is full of heavy complaints and charges. I ſhewed how you, as well as ſome others, did miſtake the Apoſtles words of, <hi>The Law being a Schoolmaſter to chriſt,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaketh not comparatively of a beleever with an unbeleever, but of the ſtate of the Goſpel with the ſtate of the Old Teſtament.

               <q rend="margQuotes">That Chriſt in the inſtituting of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or deſigned Miniſters onely to do it, or makes any mention of them, I finde not.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>To what purpoſe is this ſaid, but to ſhew that others not ordained may give the Euchariſt? But you can finde that every man muſt abide in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and that none muſt walk diſorderly, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade anothers place or work. But what think you of the conſtant practiſe of the Church? Hath not Cuſtome, if there be no more, the force of a ſecond law, as well as of a ſecond nature? But-you finde our Saviour limiting the Sacrament, as well as the word, ſaying, <hi>Go teach all nations baptizing them.</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96772:47"/>
But you finde the miniſtration of the word limited to certain perſons; <hi>How ſhall they preach unleſs they be ſent? No man taketh this honour to himſelf. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> muſt be <hi>ſeparated to the work.</hi> If preaching the word be proper to perſons ſet apart, then adminiſtration of the Sacraments alſo: The reaſon is, becauſe the Sacraments are but the word or Goſpel made viſible, and do contain, after their manner, what is in the word, and ſomewhat more; namely, a plainer repreſentation to our ſenſes, a nearer application, and a mutual ſtipulation and agreement: The word may be preached to infidels, and propounded to them by way of parley: The Sacraments contain the ſolemn confirmation of the agreement between the parties. It is the <hi>Sealing</hi> of a Will, Writing, or Covenant, that is the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and formal act for making up the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My argument then is this: The Euchariſt containeth in a Sacramental manner, that which is in the word, and ſomewhat more too. If a perſon ordained, and none elſe muſt adminiſter the word, then he and none elſe is to adminiſter the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>

who is not a converted Chriſtian may not be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it; another would maintain, that He who is but a profeſſed Chriſtian, and no more, may be the miniſter of it. Both which opinions are as unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, as the reaſon taken from the Name is weak and groundleſs. For in words and names, we muſt not regard what their original is, and their etymologie, or whence they came; but what they are brought to by uſe and cuſtome: if Euchariſt doth ſignifie Thankſgiving in the Greek; yet in the Church of God, it is appropriate to the Lords Supper in common acception. But ſecondly, take the word in that ſenſe, whence it is taken to denote the Lords Supper, and it doth not ſignifie <hi>Thankſ-giving,</hi> but <hi>Benediction</hi> or <hi>Bleſsing,</hi> and, as may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appear by conferring the Evangeliſts, To give thanks is to bleſs: as when many ſit down to meat at table, we will ſuppoſe that all of them give thanks <hi>morally;</hi> yet <hi>formally,</hi> one doth give thanks; or which is the ſame, <hi>bleſſeth</hi> the table. and when <hi>Juſtin Martyr Apolog.</hi> pag. 76. maketh mention of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſpeaking of the Lords Supper, it is plain that he took <hi>Euchariſt</hi> for Conſecration, or Sacerdotal benediction, and not for giving of thanks. From the conſecrating of the bread and wine, or bleſſing of them, which is but one act, the whole ſervice is called the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> So that this word being rightly underſtood, affordeth a ſolid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt lay-mens adminiſtring the Lords Supper.

            <p>They had need be Scriptures of clear evidence, or proof, that ſhould be brought to call in queſtion ſo many principles of Divinitie plainly delivered in holy writ, quite contrary to this millenarian fancie, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come from heaven, and raiſe the Saints and reign with them a thouſand years; and after that ſpace, the wicked ſhould riſe and receive ſentence at the day of judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens muſt contain <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> till the times of the reſtitution of all things: and in our Creed, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Chriſt <hi>from thence</hi> that is, from heaven, ſhall come to judge the quick and dead. But by this opinion, he ſhould continue on earth ſo many years, and then judge the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The day of judgement is ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; ſhall be hid from the world, and come like a ſnare when men ſhall not think of it: but by this opinion all men ſhall know certainly when it ſhall be, namely at the term of a thouſand years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It makes two Reſurrections of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, one a great diſtance of time after the other. We beleeve but one Reſurrection of the juſt, and unjuſt: the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed (<hi>at whoſe coming all men ſhall ariſe with their bodies, they that have done good and they that have done evil.</hi>) The words are moſt clearly grounded upon what our Saviour ſaith,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96772:51"/>
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28. The hour is coming in which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the Reſurrection of Damnation. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. Many, or the multitude of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt. And thoſe that are <hi>chriſts,</hi> and whom the Father hath given him, he will raiſe up <hi>at the laſt day,</hi> not at the firſt day of the Reſurrection, as you imagine, <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſts at his coming, and the reſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi> but beleevers ſhall be raiſed <hi>at the laſt day. Joh.</hi> 6. four ſeveral times there it is ſo ſaid, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 39, 40, 44, 54 verſes, I will raiſe him up <hi>at the laſt day.</hi> It is not the laſt day, if a thouſand years follow.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.3. I will come again and receive you unto my ſelf. Chriſt ſhall come back to take his diſciples with him, not to abide with them upon earth, but to place them in the manſions of his fathers houſe, which he went to prepare for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This opinion makes the kingdom of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96772:51"/>
God to be of this world, contrary to what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith: and to conſiſt in meat and drink, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Apoſtle ſaith: whereas the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Reſurrection ſhall be equal to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36. and the bodie raiſed ſhall be, not a natural but a ſpiritual bodie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. and therefore ſhall not need natural but ſpiritual refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Whereas the Church of God is either militant or triumphant: either ſubject to temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and exerciſed with croſſes on earth, or elſe crowned with victory and glory in heaven: By this opinion the Church for ſo many years ſhall be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or betwixt both: out of heaven, but reigning on earth without ſin, without ordinances. And whereas the Church of God upon earth is a mixt ſocietie of good and bad, and is to continue ſuch till the laſt, the tares muſt grow with the wheat till the harveſt, which is the end of the world: by this opinion, the wheat ſhall grow alone without the tares, the juſt reign without the unjuſt, long before final conſummation.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> According to the <hi>Millenarians</hi> new Creed, the joy of the Saints in Gods preſence, and the pleaſures at his right hand ſhall not be for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, or perpetually continued; but be broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder &amp; intermitted, not with abſolute miſery, but with happineſs ſo far inferiour to that of heaven, in degree, and in kinde, that it may well be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and taken for a degree of unhappineſs. When

               <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw but a figure or glimpſe of the celeſtial light, he forgat all things, &amp; would never by his good will, have come down from the mount.

            <p>Now becauſe you give this regard to ancient writers, and the ages foregoing, I will produce one argument of this kinde againſt your <hi>Millenarian</hi> belief, and then conclude this chapter: and it is this. That opinion which was generally condemned by the Church of Chriſt, and was afterwards upheld by none for above the ſpace of a thouſand years, is

no Catholick doctrine, nor ſound belief: But this opinion that Chriſt Jeſus ſhould raiſe his Saints, and reign with them upon earth for the ſpace of a thouſand years, being condemned, was not held by any for above the ſpace of a thouſand years: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no Catholick doctrine.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96772:58"/>
               <hi>He can do it, therefore he hath done it;</hi> which I ſaid is not ſafe.

Hereupon in this Chapter, although you are angrie with me for collecting any ſuch thing, ſo much as by way of intimation from your words. And although ſecondly, you charge the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe partie with thinking ſo; yet in the third place, you own and acknowledge it to be true, what I ſaid might be darkly gathered from your Anſwer, and you think it muſt poſe me, and all men elſe to tell, <hi>What he could have done more;</hi> as if you cared not what you ſay, ſo you may revile and contradict. It muſt be left to the Reader to compare the firſt of theſe with the third, and to judge whether there be wrong offered to you, or to your companion, who would not beleeve but that God releeved the whole world, when he had means and opportunity, you needed not to except againſt me for ſaying, That in things of this world we walk by ſight: and to ſay, that it ſeems <hi>I walk ſo, rather then by faith.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did walk by Faith, and gives this the reaſon why he did ſo, becauſe he was abſent from the Lord, and ſaw him not; but in things of this life he did walk by fight.

In things of this preſent world,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96772:58"/>
we walk by ſight, not by faith: not by faith ſtrictly taken, yet by faith largely taken, we may walk in this life, and yet walk by ſight too, like as <hi>Thomas</hi> both ſaw and beleeved. <hi>Augnſt.

            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe you have of your courteſie found out a parallel for our partie, the ſect of the <hi>stoiks,</hi> and have in this your piece minded us of it thrice already; we do accept it, and we do own it, ſo far as we may; and where we may not, we refuſe it, and return it to you again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is well done of you, that you compare us with thoſe Philoſophers that were <hi>Dogmatici,</hi> that did admit and retain peremptorily ſome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and as reſolutely refuſe ſome other: and that you do not liken us to thoſe fects, whoſe profeſsion conſiſted either in arguing about the truth on both ſides: or in perpetual ſeeking after it: or in doubting of it: or in contemning of it, as not worth the ſeeking. Your partie hath for a long time been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be too much diſtant from the <hi>Stoicks</hi> in this: and to incline too far to thoſe that were called <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticks:</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:96772:60"/>
while they have pleaded, that there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible judgement upon earth: and that as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others, ſo others condemn us, with ſuch like goodly reaſons as theſe, in behalf of indifferencie in Religion. When <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaid, he was not for his part much delighted in poſitive aſſertions; <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> told him it was not ſpoken like a Chriſtian. <hi>Non eſt hoc chriſtiani pectoris non delectari aſſertioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus: Abſint à nobis Sceptici &amp; Academici. Adſint velipſis Stoicis his pertinaciores aſſertores. Tolle aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones &amp; Chriſtianiſmum tuliſti.</hi> Of all the ſects the Scepticks and the Epicureans were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Caſtellio</hi> that great Chriſtian, at leaſt as ſome have lately called him, howbeit he was ſo violent and fierce againſt his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie, as if he had felt the ground he ſtood on; yet telleth plainly his own minde, <hi>Nondum nota veritas eſt:</hi> The Truth is not yet known; <hi>de Qu. Imped. p.</hi> 22. So it might be the Truth he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ought he knew. But <hi>Socinus,</hi> who taking another name put forth thoſe works, ſaith <hi>cloppen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> would aſſure us, that though we attain not to know the truth thereby, we ſhall clearly perceive what is not the truth. So that the power he had, was onely for the demonſtration of Errour, not for edification in the Truth, as great a Chriſtian as he was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> were the moſt <hi>ſerious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi> of all the Philoſophers, the moſt religious and devout, the moſt patient, juſt, and ſober that were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96772:61"/>
to be found among the heathens. Let <hi>Seneca, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus,</hi> and <hi>M. Antoninus,</hi> in what they have left upon record, be witneſſes for themſelves and ſome what alſo for the reſt. The which I alledge now, not intending to make any compariſon between one partie and another: but to this end onely, to note that their opinion of Deſtinie and Fatalitie, was no manner of hindrance to pietie and vertue; and to prove that it is a wicked ſlander to teach or imply, that the Doctrine of Gods Predeſtination is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple breeding profaneneſs and a vicious life. But to ſay that it cauſeth <hi>Epicurean Atheiſm,</hi> is a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſlander: for <hi>Epicurus</hi> quite contrarie to <hi>Zeno's fate,</hi> ſet up Fortune to be a governeſs of the world, and held that the gods took no heed to what men did upon earth, but ſuffered all things to run at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And ſhall that opinion that aſcribeth too much to Gods Providence, as if he did all things whatſoever, and neceſſitated men to ſin, as you blaſphemouſly infer; breed in men an opinion, that he doeth nothing at all, and not ſo much as regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what men do? Shall Chriſtian <hi>Stoiciſm</hi> breed <hi>Epicurean Atheiſm?</hi> here you did ſtrike and lay about you blindfold. They who were moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and oppoſite in the extreme, were moſt ſwiniſh and brutiſh in their lives. Away there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with this your ſlander, I know not whether more ſhameleſs or ſenſleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> were moſt conſtant aſſertours and moſt ſtrenuous defenders of that which we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96772:61"/>
call <hi>Free-will,</hi> and they called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, meaning thereby that power which every man hath over his own minde, and over his own actions. It is therefore another ſlander, to teach that the doctrine of the divine Decrees doth deprive men of their libertie, and maketh them rather to be ſtocks then volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie agents. Mans <hi>will</hi> may be and always is free, as to that root of libertie which is eſſential to man, though his <hi>Perſon</hi> in the mean time, be in ſlaverie or bondage to ſin and vice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as they taught fate, ſo they taught withall <hi>confatalia,</hi> divers other things attending upon fate: which we call <hi>means.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that which is fatal or decreed to come to paſs, ſhall indeed, when due time is, be brought to paſs. <hi>seneca Natur.

If it be any mans fate to be a learned man; it is in his fate alſo that he apply himſelf to his ſtudie: and therefore he ſhall do ſo:</hi> and herein they accorded with our Religion. A good Chriſtian never ſaid nor thought; if I be choſen to heaven I ſhall be ſaved, whether I live well or ill; becauſe he is taught that God did from the beginning, chooſe to ſalvation through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſpirit and belief of the truth, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. So when the time cometh, he giveth thoſe things that pertain to Godlineſs as well as life, and calleth to vertue as well as glory, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And a rational Chriſtian will never object and cavil, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96772:62"/>
If men did know that they be ordained to life eternal, it is the next way to make them neglect godlineſs and holy converſation: for he that ſpeaks thus, probably ſpeaks againſt his own conſcience which I prove thus: if this man were infallibly and undoubtedly aſſured by a divine propheſie, that his ſon being now but young, ſhould hereafter when he ſhall attain to full ripeneſs of age, be advanced to ſome chief place of judicature in the State, or ſome chief preferment in the Church; he would not thereupon grow negligent in beſtowing that coſt and culture which is requiſite upon that his ſon: but I am certain he would the more diligently and more vigorouſly and chearfully take care for his liberal education, that he may be fitted and qualified for ſuch promotion. And give what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you will, you ſhall without fail finde it true, that the aſſurance or confidence that any man hath of accompliſhing any purpoſe, end, or deſign; doth ſharpen his endeavour, and encourage him, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting thoſe means, by which ſuch a deſign is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally brought to paſs.</p>
            <p>This being the doctrine of your pretended or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and this the nature and conſequence of it, I pray you what may we think of <hi>Tilenus</hi> and his favourable ſummarie of the Synod in the late <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the five Articles,</hi> 1. pag. 41. giving in for the reſult of the firſt Article of the five, that God elected to ſalvation a very ſmall number of men (<hi>without any regard to their faith or obedience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96772:62"/>
whereas the Canons, which ſurely are the <hi>Reſult,</hi> ſpeak quite contrary, by name the eight Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the firſt Article. <hi>Scriptur a unicum praedicat beneplacitum, propoſitum, &amp; conſilium voluntatis Dei, quo nos ab aeterno elegit, &amp; ad gratiam, &amp; ad gloriam, &amp; ad ſalutem &amp; ad viam ſalutis:</hi> there is not a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold election, purpoſe, or counſel of God, but One; even that whereby he chooſeth both to Grace and Glory, to Salvation, and the way that leadeth to Salvation.] Such dealing may be left off, out of honeſty, by them who think it is any credit to their cauſe to uſe it.</p>
            <p>Thus far we are not, neither need we to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of being, <hi>Stoical:</hi> if therefore you think good at any time to repreſent us as Stoicks, let not them, let not us be miſreported: for both acknowledge libertie of will: and both acknowledge a neceſſary connexion of the Decree, and the intervening means: and if you ſay otherwiſe, you wrong them and us, and all thoſe that take things on your word.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe particulars now named, the <hi>stoicks</hi> had a high conceit of the freedome of their will, determinately to good. They imagined that they had power to frame and faſhion themſelves anew, as it were to the higheſt degree of vertue, that mans nature is capable of. <hi>Seneca</hi> Epiſt. 41. <hi>stultum eſt optare cùm poſsis à te impetrare. non ſunt ad caelum elevandae manus.</hi> It is a fooliſh part for a

            <p>But I would gladly ask you, whether you know any man, that hath ſo much impudence, as to ſay, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was a <hi>Manichean:</hi> if he were, how comes it to paſs, that he was ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie to that ſect: if he were not, how come thoſe men to be <hi>Manicheans</hi> whoſe Doctrine is the ſame that his was, as I hope you have ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie as to acknowledge, what danger they are in to fall into <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi> or ſomething that is worſe;

while you ſpeak as if he could do no more than he hath done for mans ſalvation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is able to do for other things; This leave to others to judge, who are more able to judge and whom it better becometh to give their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

            <p>The means to life eternal, are of two ſorts. The friſt called <hi>Media immediata,</hi> or <hi>Media interna:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and immediate means, by which a Chriſtian is placed and ſet in the ſtate of regeneration, and life ſpiritual, as Faith, Repentance, Sanctification, and juſtification, theſe are proper to the Church inviſible, or myſtical bodie of Chriſt. The ſecond, <hi>media mediorum,</hi> Or <hi>Media externa,</hi> outward means tending to produce the former ſort of means; as not onely Preaching of the Goſpel, ſending of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, Adminiſtration of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are common to the Church viſible; but moreover, the Incarnation of Chriſt, his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reſurrection, which are in ſome ſort, and in a ſenſe formerly explained, common to all the world.

            <p>It is a Cuſtom, with you, and with other men of your minde, to deface and obſcure Gods Grace, by diſcourſe tending to ſet forth his Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Love to all mankinde. But ſuch Mercy

it is, by which none are ſaved: no man is brought to heaven by univerſal Grace, or that ſufficient Help, that is given to all men, You may, for that matter, beleeve your Dutchman in his Diatriba, pag. 17. <hi>Divitias illas bonitatis divinae omnes faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirent, niſi abundans miſericordia Dei quoſdam ſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the Text in <hi>Iſai</hi> 5. is often alledged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, and by you twice in this chapter; <hi>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done?</hi> Where <hi>Firſt,</hi> you are to note, that it is an encloſure, it is a vineyard that is ſpoken of, there fore no Univerſaliſt muſt draw this beyond the bounds of the Church, or make uſe of it to prove, that all men have ſufficient help to ſalvation. The vineyard of the Lord of hoſts, is the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and he dealeth not ſo with every nation as he did with that nation.</p>
            <p>

But is there nothing more to be done or could there nothing more be done towards the bringing forth fruit to life eternal? <hi>Paul</hi> may plant <hi>Apollos</hi> may water, but God giveth the encreaſe If it pleaſed God, whoſe will is always juſt, though
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96772:66"/>
it may be ſecret to us, at that time by the miniſterie of his ſervants, and mercies of divers kinds, to plant and to water the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and not to give encreaſe, muſt it needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed becauſe he could not do it? yes, at leaſt ſo we are told. He may be allowed to be able to force an ordinarie natural vineyard to bring forth good grapes, but to a <hi>Rational vineyard</hi> he could not do it. So that the Queſtion is not now, what God <hi>doeth,</hi> or <hi>hath done</hi> for his Church, or loſt mankinde; that is a modeſt inquiry: but it is affirmed broadly, He <hi>could not</hi> do more than he hath done. I think we may boldly ſay, <hi>A few ſuch propoſitions as this is, are competent to blaſt and dcfame any cauſe that ſtands in need of ſuch ſupporters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have often heard it affirmed to this purpoſe, That God could not create <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate free from danger and poſſibilitie of falling into ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this had been to make him unchangeable, which God onely is. Whereas there is nothing can be imagined but God can do it, if it pleaſe him to do it, both in heaven and earth, unleſs ſuch things as do import either impotence in the Creatour, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the creature: but what had there been of the one or the other if by his Grace and Power he had kept the underſtanding of <hi>Adam</hi> from being overclouded with errour, his will and affections in perfect and entire obedience? no more than there was in the Angels that fell not, or than there ſhall be in preſerving the elect for ever in heaven, God

I will refer you, who would be thought not to ſwerve the leaſt from what you finde in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to Joh. 8.47. and Joh. 6.36. <hi>Ye have ſeen me and beleeve not: All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me.</hi> To come, is to beleeve: and they come whom God doth give, and none elſe; and they whom God giveth were his.

            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">He giveth Faith to all that hear the word, as well to them that beleeve not, as to theem that beleeve; as he gave the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites Manna lying before them upon the ground: they might take it if they would; if they would not take it, they might leave it. Mans not having doth not argue Gods not giving. The ſluggard cannot ſay, God gave him not proviſion, when he might have had it, would he have laboured for it.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>And where is now that malicious and ſtanderous Adverſary that dareth to accuſe you, as if you taught that Faith is not Gods gift? God gave Faith to <hi>Judas,</hi> but he would not take it, as he giveth the ſlothfull man bread that ſtarveth for want of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not ſtretch forth his hand to labour. He likewiſe gave Faith to <hi>Peter,</hi> as he giveth to the diligent hand that maketh rich. With you, or in your doctrine, To give, is no more than to offer: but in good, common, and ordinary ſenſe, That which is offered may be rejected: but that which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96772:69"/>
is not received, cannot be ſaid to be given. And ſtill you preſuppoſe that man hath always ſpiritual life, and can come when he is called, and can take what is tendred to him, and can eat what is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: Whereas if you did not <hi>innovate from Scripture,</hi> you might learn and teach others, How Faith which is ſaid to be Gods gift, is the chief part of that ſpiritual life by which a Chriſtian liveth: and that very hand by which he receiveth and layeth hold of Gods promiſes: and that appetite of the ſoul, by which it longeth after the heavenly bread. And untill this be obtained, all that is ſaid or done, or propounded by way of Object to mans heart, is no other than <hi>appoſitiones epularum circumpoſitae ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchro,</hi> as meſſes of meat ſet upon a grave, or a banquet that is offered to an idol, that can neither eat nor ſmell. I am ſure you innovate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Apoſtles words, who ſaith thus; <hi>It is not of him that willeth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> But you ſay to this effect, That this man is ſaved, and not another, it is not of God that ſheweth mercie, for he ſheweth mercie to all: but it is of man that willeth and accepteth his mercie. It is not of God that giveth, but of man that taketh: for God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to all that will take. And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith thus to <hi>Timothy,</hi> [<hi>if God peradventure will give them repentance</hi>] his meaning muſt be but this: If it pleaſeth God to propound to their minds ſuch reaſons and arguments, that would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with thoſe that are diſpoſed as they ought to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96772:70"/>
be. A thing which <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf might do well enough. But when he ſaith, <hi>Sifortè if peadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he intendeth ſome ſingular and rare matter, and of great difficulty, ſcarce to be hoped for; not a common gift, vouchſafed to all that hear and are outwardly called.</p>

his Son; Nevertheleſs, by the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of this his Death and Sacrifice, and by occaſion of this his goodneſs made known to men, all their actual ſins become new debts, becauſe they are done againſt Gods Grace and Truth ſhining upon all men. In defence and explication of this deteſtable Doctrine. You afford us a twofold diſtinction: the firſt is this, ſuch <q rend="margQuotes">ſinning as doth ariſe from force of natural corruption, is not charged upon men, but onely ſinning voluntarily and unneceſſitatedly againſt the Truth ſtriving to reclaim them, pag. 63.</q> The ſecond diſtinction is ſo fine, and of ſo great ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it flies quite away from all good ſenſe. You diſtinguiſh of ſins conſidered before, or without <q rend="margQuotes">Chriſts coming, from ſins conſidered <hi>as</hi> before, or without his coming, and you ask pag. 68. if I cannot ſo abſtract, as to conſider them, as in the root, and according to what they had onely by virtue of that from what they are as againſt Grace vouchſafed.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſay you in the mean time to thoſe ſins, that are both natural, or in ſome ſort neceſsitated by corruption of nature, and voluntarie too, as many ſins, if not the greateſt part of them, are? Shall they be forgiven as natural, and puniſhed as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary? Conſider ſins, as before, or without Chriſts coming: they would yet have been againſt light, the light of nature: and ſhould not they have been charged upon any man, becauſe they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of grace, or the Goſpel?

know you not, that to love darkneſs more than light, reſiſting of the truth, and hatred to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and offending againſt mercy and goodneſs, are all of them as neceſſarily derived from the root you ſpeak of, and are as truly parts and products of our hereditary pravitie, as any ſins are whatſoever you can name?</p>
            <p>The chief place of Scripture you alledge, is <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22, 24. <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>If I had not come, they had not had ſin,</hi> it had not been charged upon them.]</q> You make a twofold coming of Chriſt, of this ſort: One as he came ſpiritually in his light and truth into the world in all ages, upon the account of his death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, pag. 65. the ſecond, when he came in mans nature to ſuffer that death. It is to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that you ſhould mean the firſt. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant, becauſe it is ſaid, If I had not come and ſpoken: and, If I had not come and done the works that none ever did: of his ſecond coming therefore it muſt be meant. Now let me ask, Had Chriſts capital enemies no ſins to be charged upon them before Chriſt came, or unleſs he had come? You have had ſome dealing with the people called the <hi>Quakers:</hi> Did ever any of them take a text of Scripture more crudely than you do this? Was there no guilt of ſin laid to the Nation, upon killing of the Prophets or meſſengers ſent beforehand, till the Son himſelf came?

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96772:73"/>
meaſure. It is wonder you would not compare this with other places, which might ſoon have ſhewed you how ſoul your errour was. Or why would you not view the context, or that which went before? v. 20. If they have perſecuted me; and v. 24. You have both ſeen and hated me. It was the kinde of ſin; Perſecution and hatred: and it was the degree of the ſin, it was hatred without a cauſe: it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt cauſe to the contrary; againſt ſo many good deeds, convincing and obliging.

            <p>You bring another text, <hi>Sect.</hi> the laſt, out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. where you ſay the Apoſtle implies a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction anſwerable to what you make. Some ſins are after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſsion, namely, <q rend="margQuotes">againſt light, knowledge, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or with free unneceſsitated conſent: Other ſins are not ſo. Now man being fallen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again, ſinneth as <hi>Adam</hi> did upon a new engagement by Chriſts death againſt Gods goodneſs, and ſome libertie brought into their wills.]</q> 
               <hi>Anſw. Adams</hi> ſin was againſt a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and expreſs law: others, till <hi>Moſes</hi> came, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the law of nature written in their hearts. The Apoſtle ſpeaks nothing of light, nor of libertie, nor engagement; and dare you ſet on ſoot ſuch a peſtiferous opinion as you do, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>implies ſomething anſwerable,</hi> which yet he doth not? Where doth he ſo much as obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96772:74"/>
or implicitely teach, that all men from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were brought to a new engagement, new light, and new libertie in their wills? Or where doth he ſay, that ſome ſins are forgiven of due debt, and ſome not but upon Repentance?</p>
            <p>Your diſcourſe in the other <hi>Sections</hi> is ſo frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that I muſt not beſtow much time upon it. I will conſider that place which you bring in your 10. <hi>Section,</hi> the which (as it ſeemeth) you eſteem alone ſufficient to uphold the Univerſaliſts cauſe, and to prove the neceſsitie of teaching their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as without which there is no hope of any good to be done upon any man in the world by preaching of the Goſpel. The words are, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not live unto themſelves, but unto him.</hi> But I ſuppoſe you would not have ſpent ſo great a part of the fourth chapter of your Eſſayes, in your boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncharitable deductions from that place, if you had beſtowed a little time rightly to underſtand it. Be pleaſed therefore calmly to take notice: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Redemption there ſpoken of, is not that univerſal Redemption which you ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, but that which is efficacious and actually applied, ſo that a Chriſtian thereby is regenerated, juſtifyed, and ſanctifyed; and, Thoſe for whom Chriſt is ſaid to have died, had been dead, and were now alive; and ought therefore in all good reaſon,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96772:74"/>
not to live to themſelves, but to him that died for them. The like exhortation and upon the ſame ground, we finde <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. Chriſt died that he might be the Lord of the living, and that they might live to him: and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. foraſmuch as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, let us ceaſe from ſin; and live the reſt of our time to the will of God. And if it be ſuch a Redemption as is actually ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferous, and bringeth with it a new life; and if it be ſuch a Redemption of which Sanctification is a conſequent, as clearly it is by the Apoſtles diſcourſe, and by parallel places, then it cannot be that which is called Univerſal. This is further confirmed, becauſe</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The love of Chriſt there ſpoken of, is not in probabilitie to be taken actively, for that love wherewithall Chriſt loveth us; but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, for that whereby we love Chriſt. To this ſenſe the ſcope of his words there do beſt ſute, as even they ſeem to acknowledge who interpret it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. He would not have them to imagine, that what he ſpake of the Dignitie of his Miniſterie, tended to his own commendation, or that ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal end or deſigne had any place in him: If we be beſides our ſelves, as you may think we are, it is for Gods ſake, whom we ſeek and ſerve: The love we bear to him compelleth us to do what we do, whom alone we deſire to know, and no man elſe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. And if it <hi>be</hi> the love active that is there ſpoken of (for I will not much contend with you
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96772:75"/>
about it) then we are to know there is a twofold love that God beareth to man (as well as a twofold Redemption) A general love ſpoken of <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>So God loved the world:</hi> and a particular or ſpecial love, moſt commonly underſtood where his love is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9. Love to the juſtified, and thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. Love that cauſeth us to love him again: we loved him becauſe he firſt loved us: &amp; ſuch muſt that love be that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth,</hi> and that cauſeth extaſie, that ſetteth us as it were beſides our ſelves: and is not likely to be that which is born towards all mankinde, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in right reaſon it ought to be.</p>
            <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> whereas you ſay that the Apoſtles were carried out to all their ſervice for Chriſt, becauſe of the love he bare to all men, as if they would not have been half ſo zealous in preaching the Goſpel to all men, if they had not thought all men had been alike choſen without difference, and no man had been denied the gift of Faith; it is a very weak phanſie of yours. What they did, was principally done for the elect people of God: for his Bodies ſake which is the Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.24. for the Elects ſake, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. As for the reſt, they knew and teſtified, and held themſelves contented, that they were unto God a ſweet ſavour even of death unto death, in them that periſh. The love they bare to Chriſt, did carrie them on to do the work appointed them, leaving unto God the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their work, and unto his ſecret counſels: and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96772:75"/>
though they might labour in vain, and ſpend their ſtrength for nought, yet were they well aſſured that their judgement was with the Lord, and their work with their God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſuppoſe that not onely Miniſters and Preachers of the word did beleeve it, but they could moreover make all their hearers beleeve it firmly, that Chriſt died for all without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and loved them all, not preferring one before another, would it work much upon the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? I think not. If you go about to waſh a raw brick, you do nought but turn it all to mire; tell an obſtinate and hardned ſinner of mercie that is in ſtore for him, and the Goſpel and bloud of Chriſt, he will but turn this grace into wantonneſs, and be ſo much the more diſſolute. You think all the world might be brought home to God by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his love to them, and telling men of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and kindneſs to ſinners. But have you never known many undutifull children, who have yet been tenderly beloved of their parents, and have known ſo much too? <hi>Abſolom</hi> was not ignorant how dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Father affected him, and deſired his good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any thing, yet ſtill he continued an ungracious rebell. And what if he had made him partaker, yea wholly poſſeſſour of his Kingdome &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his life time? The Chronicles of after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have recorded what have come to paſs in like caſe, and may teach us to conjecture, whether that would have brought him to any further ſenſe of his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96772:76"/>
dutie; who knows not how little good is done by doing good to ill natures? Kindneſs will never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kinde; nor will an ill-diſpoſed man be gained to the friendſhip of another, whom he hates through a natural antipathy, by courteſies, and entreaties, and ſignifications of good will towards him. Every mans experience can witneſs ſo much, and how little policie it is to heap benefits upon the ungratefull, out of hope to win them. <hi>Fit deterior qui accipit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero.</hi> Men are the worſe for endearments and obligations: Underſtand it of thoſe that are bad and ill-affected of themſelves, or to ſuch an one. But ſo are all men naturally to the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God: and it is not common kindneſs, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie knowledge of his love, that will reclaim them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It may reaſonably be demanded of you, how it comes to paſs that this general love ot God towards men, ſhould do ſo much with them, and prevail ſo far with them; and yet his ſpecial love ſhould do ſo littles; yea, ſhould rather be prejudicial to holineſs. So thoſe of your partie uſe to crie out, that abſolute election, ſpecial and eternal love, do cauſe men ro caſt off all care of their ſalvation, and of walking in the way that leadeth to life, and do ſerve onely to make men proud and haughtie. And in your <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> 1648. <q rend="margQuotes">The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> ſay you, thought he could not have been ſo good as he was, if God had not had ſpecial and eternal love and favour towards him.]</q> But
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96772:76"/>
will not a ſpecial love, and that conſidered compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely too, do as much as the general love? it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed <hi>Davids</hi> zeal, that he was choſen and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21. And arguments are often brought to move the Iſraelites to obedience, from the favour and good will that God did bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, more then towards any other nation. He that beleeveth the ſpecial love, beleeveth the general alſo, and receiveth as much benefit from the appearance of Gods love declared in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as any others do: for what is there that ſhould any way hinder them?</p>
            <p>Now becauſe you think that you muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſome ſins are forgiven abſolutely, <hi>as of due debt,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe univerſal Redemption, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth two payments of the ſame debt, one from the Saviour of the world, another from the perſon impenitent or unbeleeving, pag. 61. <q rend="margQuotes">It is unjuſt to require two payments of the ſame debt.]</q> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your attention to what I ſhall now ſay. The work of the Son of God in behalf of loſt mankinde is ſet forth to us diverſly; under the term and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reconciliation, or Atonement of parties that are at diſtance: of a Sacrifice offered to propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the Deitie: of Adoption, whereby not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon for malefactours, but further, the ſtate of ſons and heirs is procured: of Redemption, whereby captives are ranſomed by ſome price paid:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96772:77"/>
of one that is puniſhed in anothers ſtead, or for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others fault, or that doth ſatisfie or diſcharge the debt, which ſome other oweth. Theſe particulars, with divers others, being of a different nature one from another; cannot all of them, perfectly agree to the work of mans ſalvation, that Jeſus Chriſt wrought. With men ordinarily, there is a numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal puniſhment, applyed to a numerical or individual fault. But when Chriſt was ſmitten for our ſins, the puniſhment was one, but of infinite value, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the ſins of all men, were there more than there are, or ever will be. In this ſimilitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the reſpect of <hi>puniſhing the ſame fault twice,</hi> muſt be forborn: ſo muſt that alſo, touching <hi>a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble payment of the ſame debt.</hi> But take the other ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes; Reconciliation there may be, and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there may be, which may come to nothing for want of the condition: and a general ranſom may be many ways defective, as to ſome perſons: and a Sacrifice may be offered, and the God not appeaſed; according as the Latines make a difference betwixt <hi>Sacrificare</hi> and <hi>Litare:</hi> to your argument therefore I anſwer, when the payment or ſatisfaction is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, as to all effects, then there is no other ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to be expected.</p>
            <p>But when it is abſolute as to ſome effect, and conditional, as to ſome other; then it is neither againſt reaſon, nor juſtice, nor cuſtome, but that a payment, pardon or ſatisfaction may be twofold. The General ranſome is abſolute thus far, that Gods
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96772:77"/>
juſtice or wrath is appeaſable. All ſins are venial, and way made for pardon, the Covenant of works notwithſtanding. But thus far it is conditional, that it ſhall not be actually beneficial for any to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but according to the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, namely, upon Repentance and Belief in the Son of God. I gave you the ſimilitude of a general pardon granted from the King: to which you ſay not one word to the purpoſe, but moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently betake your ſelf to the point of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, in the fourth <hi>Section</hi> of your former chapter. And as for the injuſtice you ſpeak of, I anſwer, had we our ſelves of our own, paid theſe our debts: or had our Suretie and Redeemer paid them and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for them ſo, as that all men ſhould by vertue of his ſacrifice have been inſtantly diſcharged from all their ſins, and admitted to poſſeſſion of life, no condition whatſoever intervening: or had Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God made any ſuch promiſe or agreement, with his ſon our Saviour, to beſtow faith and repentance upon all thoſe, for whom he was to lay down his life: in any of theſe caſes, it had not been juſt to demand a ſecond payment. But inaſmuch as God himſelf did freely procure the ranſome and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſins; It was free for him to annex thereto, what conditions it pleaſed him. There is therefore no wrong done to ſuch perſons as are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their ſins, after the price of their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is accepted, becauſe they did neither pay that ranſome, nor perform the condition required.</p>

The evaſion is ſo common, to make Elect and Reprobate to be Adjectives and not Participles, and to denote a Qualitie in man, no Act in God; that it is much you have not taken notice of it. I will now name one of your Maſters, whom you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times have alledged here: <hi>Hemingius</hi> de Grat. univ. pag. 25. <hi>Primo hoc tenendum eſt quod Electus, non ſit Participium, ut quidam falsò putant, ſed nomen habitus ſeu formae haercntis in anima, hominis creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> But though I have helped you to the notion, yet that you may not think it worth your taking notice of, to your purpoſe, I pray obſerve that in all reaſon, <hi>Elegit nos,</hi> containeth <hi>nos electos,</hi> if he choſe us, we are choſen. and 1 Pet. 2.4. Diſallowed of men, <hi>à Deo autem electum,</hi> but choſen of God, it muſt needs have the force of a Participle; and though it be but an Adjective verbal, yet hath it the ſignification paſſive, as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which I hope they will give us leave, to render by a Participle, <hi>called,</hi> until they can tell us how we may render it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But were it but a Subſtantive, it were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make good the Doctrine, that you oppoſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Electio conſecuta eſt:</hi> the Election hath obtained.

Another of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Huberus,</hi> a down-right Univerſaliſt, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he ſeems to overlook all inferiour learning and cries out upon <hi>Grammaticuli</hi> &amp; <hi>Diſcipuli Libanii,</hi> &amp;

For their conſtant Doctrine is, That the Decree of Election to life doth include the means by which it is brought to paſs; the firſt and chief whereof, is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Redeemer.

And can you think that both theſe, his Incarnation and his Paſſion, with other parts of his mediation, were in nature or reaſon firſt thought upon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end why the Church was? If our Saviour Chriſt muſt have the preeminence in all things, as you mean, even of Gods purpoſe in ſending him,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96772:81"/>
then man was to be ſaved that Chriſt might come. The Son of God is rightly preferred before us and all creatures: yet is not every thing that he did, or ſuffered, ſo far to be preferred before mans benefit, but that mans ſalvation, may as the end be preferred in the reaſon or order of cauſalitie, before that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or paſsion of his. He was foreordained of God for our Redemption, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. And he is to be conſidered as the inſtrumental cauſe by which we are brought to life, as the choſen ſervant of God, by whom his will and pleaſure doth proſper and take effect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. v. 10, 11. You ſeem to fear, that inaſmuch as the end is more honourable and valuable than the means, if <hi>we</hi> be the end why <hi>Chriſt</hi> was choſen to be Gods ſervant, then we ſhould be more honourable than <hi>Chriſt</hi> is. But you are miſtaken; for that rule doth hold onely in thoſe means, which having no abſolute goodneſs or worth of their own, are onely valuable by that relation which they bear unto their ends: otherwiſe it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not: for the Angels are more worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then men, yet are ſent forth as miniſtring ſpirits for the good of men. The Angels are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to men, yet may mans benefit be above, and preferred before ſome actions miniſteriall of the Angels. The King may condeſcend to do ſome action for his meaneſt ſubject; yea to ſigne a pardon for a rebellious ſubject, or a traytour; in which caſe he valueth the life of his ſubject before the ſetting to his own hand or ſeal, otherwiſe he would not do

it: And yet, I hope, the King hath ſtill the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in all things.</p>
            <p>There is no juſt cauſe of your diſtaſt in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor of any mans diſſent, if it be well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how they who teach, that the end or fruit of Chriſts Incarnation, is the ſalvation of Gods elect, not onely in general but in particular; for whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and benefit it was that Chriſt was ſent; do withall readily acknowledge, that the end or fruit of mans ſalvation is, that Chriſt may have the honour of it, and that it may be as the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>To the praiſe of his glory.</hi> So that our Saviour is no way diſparaged or undervalued, but ſtill and ever, Of him, and To him are all things.</p>
            <p>Many of them who ſeem to honour Chriſt more than others do, in beginning with him, and making him the foundation of election, do indeed moſt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him; for they make him a foundation poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly without any building upon it: a head, poſsibly without any bodie: a King without any ſubjects. For while we ſuppoſe all means neceſſarie to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afforded to all men, it may be according to what they teach, that not one ſhall beleeve, or if he do, he may fall away.</p>
            <p>While you tell us, That Chriſt having the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in all things, is worthy to have it in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction too, page 71. I pray take heed leſt it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>you</hi> that would have the preeminence, and that while you ſeem to honour Chriſt, you do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed honour your ſelf, your own power and natural

abilities. If your Adverſaries doctrine prevail, then all the glorie redounds to God and his grace. But if God doth chooſe his Son Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; ſend him into the world, and then chooſeth all thoſe that beleeve in him, (if any there be that will beleeve in him, for all may if they will) then if you be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, it is becauſe you beleeve: you are worthy and fit to be choſen, becauſe you are in Chriſt, and then you may thank your ſelf, and not ſay with the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> one of the <hi>pretended Orthodox,</hi> God I thank thee, I am not as other men are.</p>

Thoſe <hi>Sectaries</hi> who would anull all duties, upon pretence to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie Chriſt and his grace, are wont to ſay, that the New Creature, and the New man, are to be meant of Chriſt: and by Love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and the armour

mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. Chriſt is meant: and good works, ſay they, are not as they are commonly thought to be, <hi>the way</hi> to glory, becauſe Chriſt is the way. And as you may remember, in one of your publiſhed diſcourſes, to that text of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> alledged to prove perfection in this life, you give this anſwer [Chriſt is the way: we grant ſome undefiled and complete in Chriſt] Thus your <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſpots do now and then break out, and appear, though you be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry to hear of it: and thus you may think to honour Chriſt, while you wreſt and abuſe his word, and may ſeem to be zealous for him, but your zeal is not according to knowledge. It is true that Chriſt is, and is called a foundation: yet is he not everie foundation that any where is ſpoken of. Chriſt is the Reſurrection, is there therefore no other reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? neither is it true that no other Scripture ſays it. There be divers other places that ſay in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that Gods election is a firm foundation againſt falling away, and being ſeduced: <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>If it were poſsible, they ſhall deceive the very elect. Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand. The election have obtained, but the reſt were hardened, Rom.</hi> 11.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96772:84"/>
thus, That your expoſition is moſt agreeable to the Apoſtles ſcope in that place: for his ſcope is clearly this, Though ſome eminent profeſſours be fallen away, and others be gone after them, yet let not this ſhake your confidence that are true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe your ſafetie and preſervation is laid upon a firm foundation, even Gods eternal purpoſe, which maketh the difference betwixt you and them. This I will evince to be the Apoſtles intent, 1, by that word <hi>Nevertheleſs:</hi> which word is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly exceptive, exempting ſome from falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, even thoſe that are his: 2, by a parallel place, which you cannot ſo eaſily ſhift off: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet forth the marvellous prevalence of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſeducers, and the fearfull eſtate of thoſe that were ſeduced; for the comfort of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he doth ground the difference of them from the Apoſtates, upon the foundation of Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, v. 13. But we are bound to give thanks to God alway for you brethren, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth. If God chooſeth, and calleth, and juſtifieth, and glorifieth, who can be againſt us? what ſhall ſeparate us from him? But when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhall be ſtruck with the fear of a ſpreading A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, and begin to think with themſelves thus: This defection thus encreaſing may go on, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up alſo; It is no manner of relief or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſay; Though we and all men fall away,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96772:85"/>
and be given over to be deceived, and to beleeve lies; yet Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God continueth the treaſurie of all his bleſſings: a ſure foundation to them that beleeve in him, he abideth firm as a rock, though we and all men that now cleave to him, come to ſuffer ſhipwrack one after another. Therefore that is no way likely to be the ſcope of the place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next</hi> is to be conſidered, whether our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt be choſen to ſalvation. In the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſermon upon which you wrote your exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; called them Eſſays, when you met with that ſaying, [That there ſhould be any one choſen, was the infinite free mercy of God in Chriſt] you would ſcarce admit it to paſs under your approbation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with this your interpretation [It was Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercie to chooſe and ſave one man even the man Chriſt Jeſus] which propoſition of yours, howſoever you may pleaſe your ſelf therein, hath little ſalt or ſavour in it. For then is God mercifull when he helpeth his creatures out of miſerie. To ſave, and mercie in ſaving, theſe terms, in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppoſe a loſt eſtate. It was infinite mercie in God to ſend a Saviour: but to ſave a Saviour, comes too near the ſcoff of the Jews. <hi>If thou be the king of Iſrael, ſave thy ſelf.</hi> There is little hope of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Saviour that ſtandeth in need himſelf to be ſaved. What they ſaid had thus much of truth in it, He who needed a Saviour, was not likely to ſave others. Howbeit that Death from which they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96772:85"/>
would have him ſave himſelf, was the means to ſave us.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Was not Chriſt choſen to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as man? could any part of the ſeed of David or Abraham, have eſcaped death, or been glorified in life, had it not been choſen of God thereto, and that by Chriſts dying?]</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you implie and teach plainly enough, that Chriſt by his own dying eſcaped death, and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the life of glory: and that he came to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as others. And this were not ſo ill as it is, if want of ſenſe were the worſt. For death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtipend of ſin, if Jeſus Chriſt had need, by reaſon of the common law and manner of men, to ſave himſelf from Death; then how could he be our high Prieſt, holy and undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners, and a ſpotleſs ſacrifice offered on our behalf?</p>
            <p>There is no Chriſtian that hath learned his Creed, and been well inſtructed in thoſe words of the third Article <hi>[conceived by the holy Ghoſt]</hi> but muſt needs take check at what you have here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh. The imputation, and the pollution of Adams ſin, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to all his poſteritie, by natural or carnal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as man, was conceived
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96772:86"/>
               <hi>ſupernaturally:</hi> and that ſtream or flux of original ſin, which univerſally and uninterruptedly deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon mankinde from the firſt Adam; was cut off and ſtopped by the miraculous work of the holy Ghoſt, ſo that Chriſts humane nature was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed thereby, but was preſerved free from all taint and touch of the fleſh, or ſinfull corruption. And becauſe as he was man, he had no father, therefore is he ſaid to be <hi>FACTUS Rom.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Gal,</hi> 4.4. not <hi>Genitus,</hi> not begotten but made, <hi>made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or, of the ſubſtance of his mother: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo, and that by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Ideo quod naſcetur, ſanctum: Luke</hi> 1.35. Therefore that which was born of her, was holy, perfectly exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſin, and the guilt of ſin, otherwiſe than as the took upon him the ſin and guilt of others.</p>
            <p>You quote two places for your purpoſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. Thy king cometh having ſalvation, or, ſaving himſelf: you chooſe to take it paſſively, with the <hi>Jews</hi> who take occaſion hence to calumniate; rather than actively, with the moſt and beſt interpreters. Chriſt was called Jeſus, becauſe he ſaved his people, not becauſe he was ſaved: or if it be ſaid, that he ſaved himſelf, it was that he might not be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of Death after his paſſion. The other text is <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.7. He offered prayers to him that was able to ſave him from Death and was heard: this is ſpoken of bodily Death, which our Saviour did in ſome ſort, for a time, ſhrink from, praying that the cup might paſs from him: and he was ſaved
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96772:86"/>
from Death, ſo as that he triumphed over Death: or if you underſtand it of his prayer upon the croſs, what is that to ſalvation from Death eternal, and the wrath of God in the world to come? which ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation we ſtood in need of, but he needed not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We are to conſider whether onely Chriſt, and none elſe, be perſonally choſen. Now although this be your Doctrine plainly, yet you will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to gather it out of the Anſwer in your <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm:</hi> which in effect, and in brief was this. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is that whereby God did chooſe Jeſus Chriſt to be united to the Godhead, and all that beleeve in him, to bleſsing.</hi> Here I obſerved thus. All in general, none in particular, not any determinately. Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you make anſwer. <q rend="margQuotes">I thought the general had included the particulars, not excluded them. I am ſure in ſtead of having new Doctrines, he hath new Logick. All in general, therefore none in particular.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt; A General doth include every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: but All <hi>in</hi> general, doth not include any one <hi>in</hi> particular. And ſecondly, the Generals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, include the particulars, but where the generals are onely upon ſuppoſition, it is poſſible the particulars may have no poſitive being. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth perfectly keep the law of God, ſhall be ſaved. This propoſition is true in the general: yet in particular no one perſon in the world ſhall be ſaved by keeping the law of God. So when it is ſaid <hi>whoſoever beleeveth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> this being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96772:87"/>
the Election which you teach; there may in the event be ſome particular perſon ſaved, but as to the <hi>choice,</hi> no one particular perſon is choſen before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe they are all without any difference beforehand. Neither ſaid I, All in general, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> none in particular. It ſhould be ſupplied thus, <hi>nevertheleſs</hi> none in particular, and I have told you, who of your own partie held, that though ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be intended to all, yet poſſibly to none particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar it may befall. And let me tell you now, what you heard not yet from me, that the ſecond part of the Definition that you give of Election, is a mock-anſwer as well as the firſt. For as the firſt part is, of the union of the two natures in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is, the <hi>Incarnation;</hi> So the ſecond is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but not at all, concerning Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For what is the Goſpel? <hi>He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Mark 16.16. The preaching of Chriſt crucified to ſave them that beleeve. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. And this is that very thing which you in words me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical, others of your partie in words more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, do call Election; both removing the old terms, bounds and words; faulting modern ſyſtemes, to make way for new-coined opinions.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel proffers life upon condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving: As the Law did upon condition of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Gods purpoſe of Election, 1. ordaineth life eternal abſolutely, not whether we beleeve, or no, as is conſtantly, and as I think unconſcionably by ſome objected; but without any ſuch conditional
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96772:87"/>
proviſo of beleeving, becauſe 2. it ordaineth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith and all other means infallibly conducing to eternal life. So there is difference enough between the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (though they be made all one by them that lay the grounds of the ſtudy in Divinitie in the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſyſtome</hi> of the <hi>Racovian Catechiſme,</hi> as may be ſeen there in pag. 231.) but in doing ſo, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to break open the ſeal which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and to publiſh all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and concealed under it, Even this, <hi>All men that beleeve, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But enough hath been ſaid of this chapter.</p>

            <p>In the fourth <hi>Section,</hi> he that is loth to read over all your book, may finde enough for a taſte, how to judge of your dealing. I did ſay that the meaning of thoſe words <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>He choſe us in him,</hi> was not that God choſe Chriſt firſt, and in chooſing him choſe us. I proved it out of the words in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verſe, and the like manner of ſpeech there, <hi>[in whom we have redemption, the forgiveneſs of ſins.]</hi> I asked, had Chriſt forgiveneſs firſt, and we in him? No. Now to have forgiveneſs is to be forgiven. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.29 <hi>He that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſs, Acts</hi> 10.43
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96772:90"/>
               <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhall receive remiſsion of ſins.</hi> Redemption and forgiveneſs are here taken paſſively: as they are taken actively, ſo they may be ſaid to be in Chriſt. I might have ſaid thus, for ſo I meant: Was Chriſt forgiven firſt, and then we in him? Was Chriſt redeemed firſt, and we in him? and then I had prevented that moſt abſurd and impertinent vagarie of yours, of partaking of a feaſt by coming into the houſe where it is, with a great deal the like, which when you wrote, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where your ſenſes were wandring. I call you back therefore, if I may, and I tell you, <hi>We were forgiven and redeemed in Chriſt;</hi> yet Chriſt was not forgiven and redeemed firſt. So were we choſen in Chriſt, and yet Chriſt was not choſen as we were choſen.</p>
            <p>For the clearer underſtanding of this matter, and of thoſe words <hi>[We were choſen in Chriſt]</hi> it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſtinguiſh. The word <hi>[Chriſt]</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two ways: Firſt, <hi>perſonally,</hi> for the Son of God made man, and ſuffering for us: Secondly, <hi>collectively,</hi> as it ſignifies a myſtical bodie, whereof Chriſt is the Head; a body congregated of Chriſt and all beleevers incorporate with him. You take it in this latter ſenſe, as if we were choſen becauſe we were united to him, or after we were made one with him. But I have ſhewed that it is to be taken in the former ſenſe; for the perſon of the Mediatour <hi>in whom,</hi> that is, <hi>by whom, by whoſe bloud,</hi> V. 7. we were ehoſen to ſalvation, or to be brought to life:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96772:91"/>
as he is taken not for a perſon, but for a collective bodie, ſo indeed, not otherwiſe, we may be ſaid to be choſen into him; but no way in him, as you me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n.</p>
            <p>You think, If election of the Church do in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or reaſon precede the choice of a Mediatour; then we cannot be choſen in Chriſt, becauſe we are choſen before the confideration of him.] It is more irkſome to ſpeak to him that will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, than to him that cannot. Let me uſe a few words to your layman, whoſoever he was that had the good hap to eſpie this contradiction: for this is likely to be that which you ſpeak of in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth chapter. My friend, you intend to build an houſe, this is your end and purpoſe, this you think of firſt; next, you think of hiring workmen, and providing materials, as means towards building the houſe: and yet you cannot for the leaſt moment of time, think to build an houſe not having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall; without workmen and materials. You intend to croſs the haven, this is your firſt purpoſe; next you think of taking boat; you think of one before the other, and yet you think of them both together. Likewiſe it is but one purpoſe, deſire, or reſolution of yours to make a voyage into <hi>France,</hi> and to go a ſhip-board; you intend theſe two both together, yet in reaſon the firſt of theſe is firſt, becauſe you deſire the other onely in order to that, If neither you nor your friend can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, you are more fit to meddle in other
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96772:91"/>
matters, than in finding out contradictions.</p>
            <p>Your Eſſay, that names written in heaven ſhould be the qualities of godly, meek, mercifull, written ever in heaven, but put upon men when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, came out of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s ſhop, as I told you ſome where before, though you have hammered it more then any other that I know of. <q rend="margQuotes">The names of beleevers are according to their frames, and you quote <hi>Solomons Proverbs,</hi> The wiſe in heart ſhall be <hi>called</hi> prudent.]</q> I told you that qualities are not names: Prudent is a qualitie: ſo is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, poor in ſpirit, mercifull. Here you anſwer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nicely <q>["<hi>Prudence</hi> is the qualitie, <hi>Prudent</hi> the name.]</q> You ſhall not need to tell me of my new <hi>Logick,</hi> I have enough left of my old to tell you, that Prudence is a qualitie in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is a qualitie, no leſs, in the <hi>Concrete;</hi> ſo they are both qualities, but neither of them any mans name. But you, as before you confounded qualities with names, now confound Grammar with Logick, as if thoſe things which differ in the one, muſt differ in the other alſo. I can diſcern nothing further in this Chapter, concerning which there is need of any notice to be taken, or to be given. I ſhall onely give you this my reaſon againſt this new <hi>Eſſay.</hi> When we read that there are in heaven names written in a book, it is borrowed from mens cuſtome, who are wont to ſet down in writing the names of certain perſons in a book, ſcrol, or catalogue, to the intent that their perſons may be for ſundry purpoſes, the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96772:92"/>
more certainly remembred in time to come. So that though there be no book, or writing with God, yet is there ſomewhat like it; and the thing it ſelf is found among men. But as for your kinde of book or writing, a book full, not of proper names, but <hi>Adjectives,</hi> or <hi>Qualities,</hi> it is no where found, that I can tell of, neither know I where to look for it. Therefore vnleſs you and yours can invent this, you have invented nothing.</p>

Repentance belongeth to the Law, which enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and commandeth it. The Rule that directs me to walk in the way, directs me alſo to return into it, when I am out of it. Before the Fall, Gods boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie led to Obedience and due ſervice. After the Fall, Gods bountie leadeth to Repentance, as a part of our Obedience and as neceſſarily prerequired to all future obedience in ſuch a caſe. It is true that God pardoneth all that do repent; but this is by vertue of the Goſpel, and is a Priviledge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. His long-ſuffering <hi>to us-ward,</hi> is that none ſhould periſh, but ſooner or later, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. But this is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether every inducement to repent, even among heathens and infidels, doth include and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it, a promiſe of mercie and pardon: this I denie, upon this reaſon, becauſe, then the Goſpel ſhould be contained in the Law, and the promiſe of forgiveneſs, in a dutie of obedience. But the Law &amp; the Goſpel being two ſeveral things, ought in our conſideration to be kept apart. He that invites to Repentance ſheweth plainly he would not have the offender or delinquent to go on, in doing wrong, but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96772:102"/>
would have him prevent <hi>heaping up wrath</hi> verſ. 5. and increaſing his condemnation: but he doth not always ſhew that he is readie to pardon what is paſt: that this is ſo, appeareth by this ſimilitude.

But what were they then? the ſame Apoſtle telleth you, in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the tenth chapter and the twentieth verſe, The things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God. You have raked fair, to finde out your univerſal Grace in the Idolatrous ſacrifices which Pagans offered. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> might have ſpared the rending of their clothes, and ſaved their out crie. Sirs, what do you mean to do theſe things? And the <hi>Lyſtrians</hi> might have anſwered thus: but
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96772:103"/>
that they wanted ſuch a Prieſt as your ſelf at their elbow to have prompted them: theſe are no ſuch vanities as you imagine, for by them we do teſtifie our hope in God, and in his Grace; and by them we do celebrate his propenſion to pardon our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings. We have always ſerved the living God that made heaven and earth, and redeemed all men. Neither hath he ſuffered us to walk in any wrong ways, but hath been propitious to us in his love and mercie, and hath trained us up in his ſchool. The Sun paſſeth over our heads every day we riſe, preaching Gods name and bringing tidings of his Goodneſs; and when the night cometh on, the Moon and the Stars ſucceed and take their courſe, uttering to us his ſaving knowledge: you may tell us more plainly what we knew before; but we have had ſufficient teaching long ere you ſet foot among us. This ſpeech is moulded in your Doctrine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in this Section; and becauſe it is very bad, falſe and blaſphemous, it better becometh the prieſt of Jupiter that was before the Citie, than <hi>A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, in the Goſpel of his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ask you where you finde Gods kindneſs to ſinners called the Goſpel. In the old Teſtament the preaching of the Goſpel contained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him that was to come: one of <hi>Adams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie; the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abraham:</hi> called the Meſſias in <hi>Daniel;</hi> and in <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is deſcribed that ſhould come and ſuffer, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſins of Gods people. In the new Teſtament
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96772:104"/>
the Contents or Sum of the Goſpel is, Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and God in Chriſt reconciling the world. When the Apoſtles preach the Goſpel they ſpeak of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and the man whom he hath appointed. But as for rain and food and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeaſons, which you call the contents of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, they ſpeak of theſe, as witneſſes indeed of Gods goodneſs, but as ſuch witneſſes, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the nations went their own ways. Yea, and God ſuffered them ſo to do. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16. He ſuffered all nations to walk in their own ways, <hi>Nevertheleſs,</hi> he did them good, and gave them rain from heaven. This utterly overthroweth the falſe Doctrine throughout this chapter, or whereſoever elſe by you delivered, manifeſtly ſhewing your ſelf a perverter of the Goſpel, while you make the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be preachers of it. Notwithſtanding his ordinary goodneſs, or common kindneſs, he ſuffered them to periſh. His temporal bleſſings therefore were not able to reclaim them, nor were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the converſion of their nations: if they had been ſo, then it could not be ſaid, God ſuffered them to go on in their own ways nevertheleſs. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. The times of this ignorance God winked at. That is to ſay, he overlooked them, he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed them. He hid himſelf and was wroth. They were times of <hi>ignorance,</hi> and during theſe times, God did hide himſelf, therefore he did not manifeſt himſelf, as in the Goſpel, or by way of any ſaving knowledge.</p>

than <hi>Amyrald</hi> doth. In the mean time, I will tell you a ſhort ſtorie out ot <hi>Athaneus</hi> of a <hi>Spartan:</hi> now you know that Countrey was known to be of a very hard breed. This man, ſitting down with others at a feaſt, and not obſerving what they did, made ſomewhat more haſt to eat of a certain ſort of fiſh, that was ſet before him, than he had good skill to ſever the meat from the ſhell that was hard, and withall full of ſharp pricks or briſtles: but having well broken and ſubdued the harder parts with his teeth, and taſting the meat what it was, being ſomewhat loth to loſe the pains he had taken, reſolved thus with himſelf. <hi>Thou art,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a very naughtie kinde of food: yet I will not leave thee now, but I will never meddle with thee more.</hi> I finde now that theſe Polemicks are but a harſh diet, very crabbed and thornie, the which who ſo loves, had need to have according to the <hi>Comicks</hi> bold metaphor, <hi>calceatos dentes,</hi> and muſt not ſtick at any thing that is tendred to him. And though I may ſeem too forward and raſh, in thus <hi>undertaking</hi> (as you call it) and falling on, I will not now go back, nor give you over: but I purpoſe therewithall not to be ſo haſtie in engaging with any other. Yet as <hi>Florus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> having gotten the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ground, and of the wind, <hi>vento &amp; pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere pugnabat;</hi> you do not trouble me much with your blows, or weapons. I fear not your armour, nor yet your arguments, no nor yet your uncivil and diſparaging language. But you drive me out of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96772:105"/>
the field with your duſt: you confound me with your confuſed ſignifications. I cannot plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your meaning, and when I think that I have it, you have another at hand, becauſe it concerns you not a little to deal in obſcurities and ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to have your reſerves readie, and places of retreat. And you either cannot or will not perceive my meaning: As here in the Section next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that which I thought had been plain enough to be underſtood, you have ſo taken, ſnatching one part from the other, as to wring out an impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from my words, that never came into my minde, that ſo you might have ſomething to buſie your ſelf about. <hi>Quintilian</hi> will have his Oratour ſo to ſpeak, not onely that he may be underſtood, but ſo clearly and in ſuch a manner, that he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly but be underſtood, even by thoſe that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in hearing, and are minding other matters. There he ſome, and you may be one of them, that through their wilfulneſs make this advice of his to be needfull, and a verie difficult task too: you are quick enough and ready to defend whatſoever it be you chance to ſay: and you ſeem as backward to apprehend what anothers meaning is. But I pray, if you finde no tolerable ſenſe in what you read, look it over again, and mark it better, leſt the fault be found to be in your ſelf.</p>
            <p>As for univerſal objective grace, by whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maintained, it ſeemeth to implicate in the terms: as doth the <hi>Catholick-Romane,</hi> that is an univerſal
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96772:106"/>
particular Church. To which purpoſe may briefly be conſidered, <hi>wherein</hi> grace, as it is grace, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Some will tell you that it is not grace, becauſe it is given to one and denied to another, but becauſe it is given to the <hi>unworthy.</hi> But the elect Angels were confirmed by grace, and yet were worthy ſo far as any creatures can be worthy: And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt was full of grace, and did partake of Gods favour in the higheſt degree; yet withall was moſt worthy. Others ſay, that if it be grace, it muſt be added to nature and natural parts or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Now this indeed is <hi>true</hi> of Gods grace ſhewed to man; but doth no way agree to grace in general, neither hath it any place in ſuch grace as one man ſheweth to another, or as a king ſheweth to one or more of his ſervants or ſubjects.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay to me thus: The ſubjects of a kingdome may be ſuppoſed, even every one of them, more or leſs obnoxious to the ſtrictneſs or rigour of law, for ſubmitting to a forreiner invading, or a domeſtick uſurping: if the king be pleaſed to pardon every one of them, not excepting any; this would be a great grace, and yet is univerſal: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there may be univerſal grace without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the terms. To this I anſwer, Although the grace of the king thus pardoning all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be univerſal in ſome reſpect, that is, in reſpect of the perſons, yet it is ſingular in reſpect of the caſe, or of the time, and in reſpect of the kings carriage to his ſubjects otherwhile. And if he ſhould
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96772:106"/>
in like manner paſs by all offences againſt him and his crown, during his whole reign; this <hi>ſemper-leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> were not grace, but an aberration in government, and a kinde of injuſtice through exceſs of clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and remiſſneſs. But Gods goodneſs in creating all things, and his providence in governing and diſpoſing all things; theſe two ſhining forth from the beginning of the world to the end, cannot be called grace, as being no way ſingular: For according to Scripture, and common cuſtome of ſpeaking, grace always implieth ſomething ſingular, or particular therein.</p>

            <p>I will endeavour to recollect your underſtanding and your thoughts, if you will give me leave. Mercie is one of Gods Attributes; Juſtice likewiſe is one of Gods Attributes: All mercie is a falſe conception of him: All juſtice likewiſe is a falſe conception of him: you, in ſtead of this latter, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Crueltie. Now though All juſtice and No Mercie be a falſe conception of him, and he be not ſuch; yet if he <hi>were</hi> ſuch, he were not cruel, becauſe crueltie is unjuſt ſeveritie. And if God were All juſtice, and did ſhew no mercie at all, nor free any man out of the miſerie into which he is fallen; he were not yet unjuſt. <hi>All juſtice</hi> is one thing, this God is not, becauſe he ſheweth mercie: <hi>unjuſt</hi> is another, this God ſhould not be, did he ſhew no mercie. It was therefore ill done of you, in that you would not ſet <hi>All juſtice,</hi> but <hi>crueltie,</hi> in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>all mercie;</hi> for in ſo doing you did oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſperſe good Chriſtians, as if they thought that God were ſo; and God himſelf, as if he ſhould be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96772:109"/>
ſo, did he ſhew no mercie. And though I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beleeve all things that may be beleeved, yet I can ſcarce beleeve but that this term proceeded from the ſame ſpirit that thoſe other horrid terms did, that I rehearſed out of your other work. And now I anſwer to your ſcornfull queſtion, and I ſay, I may be as fit to review your <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> as you are to review the Reviewer, who could not underſtand him, no, not ſo much as <hi>where the partialitie ſhould lie,</hi> unleſs it were in the different character. So much might ſerve for this drowſie chapter, ſave that you are here ſuddenly turned a great friend to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and to <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For the firſt, you ſay, <q>
                  <hi>"You ſpake generally without reſpect to perſons</hi>]</q> at that time by chance you were altogether Ideal, and dealt in Abſtracts onely, not ſtooping to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe your thoughts in groſs particulars: neither did you charge it on the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (to think God is like an old man) <q rend="margQuotes">there be many ignorant Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as guilty of it as they, I fear]</q> They are guiltie then, and ſo you think them, but you did not charge it on them, but on the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> I hope if I tax you now for partialitie, you will know wherefore it is.

You that can tell us that many godly perſons think, the time of Beaſt-worſhipping is not yet over; you that can finde Beaſtly doing, and the voice of the Dragon, in preſſing humane cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, are you ſo ignorant as not to know, that there be <hi>Relliquie Latii,</hi> certain Remains of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

though not by Law eſtabliſhed, yet kept alive, and warm in the breaſts of many half-baked <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants?</hi> You grant the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to be guiltie of it: and I ſaid not, they onely were: but whoſoever they be that are guiltie of it, they own and juſtifie the opinion and the practice, which is ſufficient for my purpoſe.</p>

            <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf about the compariſon, which is the better, or which is the worſe of theſe two.

And this is no hard matter to do. For firſt, you yeeld the Papiſts to be guiltie of this falſe conception: ſome Proteſtants alſo as you doubt: but Papiſts doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96772:110"/>
thus much your words import. And I trow you reckon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> among the Papiſts, and what is become now of <hi>Mentiris de Bellarmino?</hi> You that accuſe me, do alſo acquit me from belying <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> But ſecondly I alledged his words ſpeaking of <hi>picturing</hi> onely, but not of any <hi>likeneſs:</hi> yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie picture is a likeneſs, everie image is a ſimilitude, though everie likeneſs be not a picture or image, as one egg is like another, yet is not the image of it. If therefore the Cardinal held it lawfull to picture God like an old man, it muſt needs follow that he thought him like an old man: as thirdly, he might lawfully do in thoſe things wherein an old man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth another man. We may lawfully think God to be like ſome creature, though not in any thing that imports infirmitie or imperfection. God made man in his image, how can that be if God be not in ſome things like him? And he is like the Sun, why elſe ſhould he be called a <hi>Sun,</hi> in the Pſalm; and the Father of lights by S. <hi>James?</hi> who yet noteth his unlikeneſs to the Sun, in that he maketh no ſhadow by turning, the moſt dark bodie being to him as a globe of chryſtal: and he was like that ſhape or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance deſcribed in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9. otherwiſe he would not have appeared in it. <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> is of verie great extent and latitude, and a ſmall matter may denominate one thing like another. And fourthly, whereas you ſay, he knew God to be a Spirit; you know alſo the Angels to be ſpirits, yet they may, be pictured like young men, and the Cherubims
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96772:110"/>
were pictured like winged wights, by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. By this your reaſon, God cannot be pictured at all; and then he ſhould forbid that which cannot be done: whereas God doth not command any thing, nor forbid any thing, that is abſolutely impoſſible: we may poſſibly, repreſent God in a picture, but we muſt not. So that I have no way wronged, or falſified or belyed <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Now though I will not ſay to you, <hi>mentiris pro. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> and ſet you on work to compare this, with your other two above; yet any one may plainly ſee, how you have run your ſelf a ground, and are gravelled more ways than one, for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſake, who yet will con you no thank: and if you had done him any ſervice, he might thank me, becauſe for my ſake it was, that you became his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>

If you may have leave to interpret the words, of the Article, or Liturgie, according to your own meaning and Doctrine, and contrarie to the known meaning of the Church, it is as much as you need to deſire. But where doth the Church of England teach that all ſins proceeding from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> are forgiven of due debt to the impenitent without further and particular application of Chriſts Death? <hi>Windeck,</hi> a Papiſt, who wrote largely of the efficacie of Chriſts Death, and muſtered up 286 arguments to prove that he died for all men, yet called <hi>puccius, Execrabile monſtrum,</hi> who held that Chriſts Death was actually efficacious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure juſtification, and reſtore life to all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, until by new wickedneſs they rejected that life, and drew a ſecond deſtruction upon themſelves; and his opinion he calleth <hi>ſtultum &amp; paganicum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxon,</hi> a fooliſh and heatheniſh paradox, <hi>&amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiſsimum venenum,</hi> a poiſonous Doctrine that diſpatcheth preſently, and killeth outright thoſe that take it in. I pray you therefore learn to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between that Redemption which is univerſal; and that which is particular, belonging onely to ſuch whom God doth chooſe, and to whom he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth the gift of ſaving faith. Had you done ſo now, you would have contented your ſelf with thoſe places of Scripture that ſhew Chriſt died for all, and not confuſedly and dangerouſly have added thoſe places which ſpeak of the juſtification, vevification, and ſalvation of beleevers; as namely theſe two:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96772:111"/>
               <bibl>Rom. 3.23, 24.</bibl> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">All have ſinned. being juſtified freely by his Grace. All have ſinned, and all are juſtified by his Grace.]</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If all abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that have ſinned, be juſtified, why ſhould he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it v. 22. to them that beleeve? The ſcope of the Apoſtle is this, to prove that the Jews, who thought well of themſelves, in regard of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and priviledges above others, have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs no other way to be juſtified, and ſaved, but even as the Gentiles are ſaved: and that is, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. For becauſe they have ſinned as well as others, and have no righteouſneſs of their own, more than others have, they muſt be juſtified as others are, by the righteouſneſs of another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all have ſinned, therefore all that are juſtified, muſt be juſtified <hi>by Grace,</hi> and none can be juſtified otherwiſe. So alſo is the extent to be taken <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercie upon all, that is, each people, Jew as well as Gentile.</p>

It may be you regard the teſtimonie of <hi>Conradus Vorſtius,</hi> more than you do ſome others: hear his words in his Commentarie upon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> ch. 5. v. 18. <hi>Apparet eos gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter errare, qui ex hoc loco colligere conantur omnes omnino homines per Chriſti gratiam actu regenerari &amp; juſtificari; nec perinde quenquam perire poſſe, niſi qui acceptam gratiam malitiosè, ſuâque impaenitentiâ atque incredulitate, novam Dei indignationem ſibi at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahere velit. Quae ſententia haud dubie valde peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culoſa eſt.</hi> That is, It is evident that thoſe men are in a grievous errour, that from this place endeavour to gather, that all men whoſoever are by Chriſts grace, actually regenerate, and juſtified, and that none do periſh but ſuch as wilfully reject this grace, and through unbelief draw upon themſelves, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, Gods wrath and indignation; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, out of all doubt, is very pernicious.] Yet this opinion you contend for, with all your might, as if it were as true as the Goſpel, as if it were the very

            </head>
            <p>IN the ſecond ſection you explain your ſelf, and what your meaning is, when you uſually teach, that we ſhould not gather Gods love to us by faith, obedience, new frames and repentance; namely we may gather by theſe that the benefits of Chriſts paſſion are applied to us for our ſpiritual life, but we muſt not gather by them that the Remedie is provided for us. This will I beleeve to have ſome truth, or at leaſt ſome reaſon in it, when I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there was ever any Chriſtian, that did ſearch into his own heart, and ſeek there for good deſires and good affections, and inclinations, to the intent he might thence conclude and know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Jeſus Chriſt died for all men in the world: or when you can ſhew me, who he was, that ever yet taught any Chriſtian to do ſo. You made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in your fourth page above, <q rend="margQuotes">That you arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the children againſt the dangers and deceits of the pretended orthodox, as Antidotes are to be given againſt the preſent reigning diſeaſes.]</q> Now their doctrine is that a Chriſtian perſon from the fruits of ſanctification in his thoughts, words, and works, and eſpecially from the frame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96772:114"/>
poſition of his heart, may gather the love of God and the benefits of Chriſts death for his glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven. This was the reigning diſeaſe, this was the Doctrine againſt which you framed your Antidote: and not againſt this, that we ſhould take heed how we conclude from fruits of holineſs that the Son of God offered a ſacrifice for the ſins of all the world, or that he is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that beleeve. I cannot imagine you ſpake againſt that which never any man did, or was taught to do; but againſt that rather which all good Chriſtians do practiſe, except thoſe that are commonly called Antinomians. There is a ſeal of Gods ſpirit, which is in this life ſet upon thoſe that are his, and by which he will own them at the laſt: and is not ſet upon thoſe that are none of his. This difference you cannot endure ſhould be made or ſpoken of; He is a Phariſee that is not as other men are, but if he gives thanks to God that he is better than others, better than this Publican, or ſuppoſe then this malefactour, or this traytour, which he ſeeth, or heareth to be executed; This, this is the poiſon that needeth the Antidote, this is Phariſaiſme, that muſt be cried down, this is the ſpirit that muſt caſt out: this muſt be followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all opportunities and occaſions. I noted before how you plied this point in one of your funeral ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: and in another which you preached the year before upon <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. pag. 12. your words are. <q rend="margQuotes">But thou wouldeſt have ſome ſigne or token of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96772:114"/>
the truth of this as concerning thee from him in ſomething to be done by him to thy ſoul—then doeſt thou as that adulterous generation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39. which Chriſt reprooveth ſeeking ſignes and tokens:</q> and if thou ſhouldeſt perſiſt in that way, thou maiſt be given up to deluſion to believe a lie.]</p>
            <p>But when the Apoſtle in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians and the laſt chapter, biddeth them, Examine themſelves, whether they be in the faith, and prove their own ſelves; did he bid them do that for which our Saviour reprooved the Scribes and Phariſees? Thus you teach: but they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded that believe you. You co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain, <bibl>

               <q rend="margQuotes">That too many of the Teachers love to ſlumber, and content themſelves with Dreams in ſtead of ſearching out the Truth, and giving it forth to the people.]</q> Is this the truth you have ſearched for, and found it out at laſt to impart to the people? or what ſhall we call a ſick mans dream?</p>
            <p>I will ſuppoſe that moſt of your Auditors had ſormerly learned, and could then remember that part of the Church-Catechiſme, wherein they were taught to profeſſe and rehearſe after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: I believe in God the Father who hath made me and all the world: and in God the Son, who hath redeemed me and all mankind: and in God the holy Ghoſt who ſanctifieth me, and all the elect people of God. And I will ſuppoſe alſo that ſome
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96772:115"/>
good Chriſtian well weighing theſe words with himſelf, ſhould not reſt contented with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love of God, who created all things, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing that he hath made: nor with that generall love of Chriſt, whereby he redeemed all mankind; but ſhould endeavour further to finde that he is ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt, having heard that there is a ſeal of the Spirit: and every ſeal is more than a ſigne, but a ſigne it is, having heard alſo of the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. If now this perſon ſhould be perſwaded by you and your Sermon, that if he goeth on in this way, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of that wicked and adulterous generation of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that tempted God, and provoked our Saviour by calling for ſignes, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think you have done any good ſervice for his ſoule, but rather that he forſakes the right way, and gives over the truth, to be abuſed by you. When we look for fruits of Faith, this is not to enquire whether Chriſt died for us, or not, for he dyed for all; but whether the holy Ghoſt hath ſanctified us or not, becauſe he ſanctifieth only the elect people of God, and conſequently whether we have Chriſts death applyed to us according to his ſpeciall intention. If you had perceived any of your people ſo fond, as to apply that reproof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39. for confirmation of the doctrine you elſewhere teach; By the place and office you are in, and by your skill and learning in Logick and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, you ſhould have informed them, that a

Ask thee a <hi>ſigne,</hi> aske it in the depth, or in the height a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. And <hi>Mark</hi> 16. The Apoſtles confirmed the word with ſignes following; much leſs ought you to have put ſuch a conceit into their heads, as if when they examined their own hearts, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle biddeth them, they were as blame-worthy, as ſome Atheiſt or Epicurean, who after all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration which he daily ſeeth, ſhould demand ſome miracle, ſome ſigne or proof extraordinary, that God is, and that he guides this preſent world.</p>

               <q rend="margQuotes">The Analogie of Faith, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is rather that proportion of the Faith every man hath, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would have none to exceed in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, than any Syſteme to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by all.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>I was not interpreting the Apoſtles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. Nor did I ſay they are to be meant of a ſum of thoſe things that are to be held and believed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of the proportion of Faith, that every man hath, and yet I think there may as much be ſaid for that interpretation, as for this. But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of Faith in common acception is taken for a brief Summary of Chriſtian Belief, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed,</hi> whatſoever it may ſignifie in the place
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96772:116"/>
whence it was firſt taken. Therefore you might very well have let this paſs without trouble to the Reader about it: And ſo would I, but that your ſelfe uſed this word in the very ſame ſenſe, here, above at <bibl>pag. 121.</bibl> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">Who is there that doth not lay down ſome things fundamentall, contrary to which no difficult ſaying is to be interpreted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be againſt the Analogie of Faith]</q> And how comes it to paſs that you forgat your ſelf ſo ſoon? or what is the reaſon that you may ſpeak after the common manner, and I may not?</p>
            <p>You often bring up the Phariſee and his words, as making much againſt your Adverſaries, in that he thanked God, he was not as other men are.] Upon this I noted that a Saint may ſay, what the Phariſee ſaid, with another mind and to another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention than the Phariſee ſaid it.

thing, and to do, is another, yet here in this caſe they meet &amp; are all one, according to your opinion, and according to your words, in this place. To give thanks for being better than other men are, is <hi>ſaying</hi> and it is <hi>doing</hi> too, for it is deſpiſing of others. To trifle is one thing, to write is another: yet he who ſets down in writing meer trifles, to no purpoſe but that he may write ſomething or other, doth at the very ſame time, both write &amp; trifle. (3) One of your Engliſh Maſters, is nothing ſo nice, as you would ſeem to be, and yet I think you be both of a mind, for having taught that in the gifts of Tongues and Propheſying, with the like, given for the publick ſervice of the Church, <hi>God</hi> maketh the differece. But in gifts of Sanctification, as Faith &amp; obedience, <hi>Man</hi> maketh the difference and not God: he giveth this rule touching theſe graces, <hi>pag.</hi> 266. <hi>App. Evang. Take heed of the Phariſees form of Thanks for Graces with compariſon to other folks</hi>] I ſee nothing to the contrary but that he who thinketh good to follow this rule, muſt ſo underſtand it, not but that he may think himſelf better then others are, but he muſt be wary that he thank not God for it, as if <hi>He</hi> had made any ſuch difference betwixt man, and man: he muſt by all means take heed of that: And then it is eaſie to ſee, that upon pretence of being lowly, like the poor <hi>Publicane,</hi> he ſhall indeed be more proud then was the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who though he inſiſted more then was fit upon his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſuch as it was; yet ſticked not to give God
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96772:117"/>
thanks, that he was ſo righteous. (3) Why may not a well-diſpoſed Chriſtian give to God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Grace, and thank him with ſuch like words as the Phariſee uſed, that he is ſo good as he is, and no worſe; and yet withall, at the ſame time, with the Publicane, be caſt down in his minde, and crie to God for mercy and pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſo bad as he is, and no better? I pray think further of it, leſt you be too forward in your judgement, and condemn the righteous together with the wicked. And laſtly, I would deſire you, and all that abound in this ſenſe of yours, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as <hi>Pride,</hi> which conſiſteth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting too much upon the good we have, is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Let not your minde be always on the Phariſee deſpiſing the Publican, but think now and then of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was wroth becauſe his brothers ſacrifice was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſlew him becauſe his works were more righteous than his own: and of <hi>Eſau</hi> who hated <hi>Jacob</hi> becauſe of the bleſſing: and of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſons, who hated <hi>Ioſeph</hi> becauſe his Father loved him more than he loved them, and yet they hated him more becauſe of his great preferment that was

foretold, and becauſe of the bleſſings that were upon the crown of the head of him that was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his brethren.

            </p>
            <p>Hy pocriſie is a moral crime: An Hypocrite is a diſſembler, He that takes upon him and perſonates what he is not. But if you will extend the term ſo far as to comprehend ſuch as want ſaving Grace, and are not yet made partakers of ſpiritual life, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever otherwiſe morally qualified, and conforming in duties of Religion: or if you will put the caſe of one that is an Hypocrite indeed, in the common ſenſe: If he loſeth his faith, he doth not loſe that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96772:121"/>
which made him an Hypocrite, though he loſeth that, notwithſtanding which, he was ſuch. But as an Hypocrite is not ſo bad, as a vitious and openly profane and ungodly perſon, ſo an unſound faith is better than none, &amp; a faith hiſtorical or tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, better kept than loſt; Although you very raſhly, as I ſuppoſe, not deliberately, do here teach to the contrarie. For I pray obſerve well, <hi>firſt</hi> that Hiſtorical faith is a true faith in the kinde of it, hath a true being, and is of good uſe and benefit: and it is beſt for them that have it, to hold what they have, and not think of loſing it for a better; for though it be not juſtifying faith, nor a part of it, nor yet a degree of it; yet is it a ſtep towards it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods ordinarie way of proceeding in the converſion of ſinners; and as a ſtock whereupon is engrafted ſaving Faith, when God is pleaſed, to make that Chriſtian a member of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, who was before but a member of the Church viſible. And as in the viſion of the great tree, that figured the eſtate of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the ſtump of it was left in the ground, becauſe God intended to reſtore him; So there is more hope of good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards him, who preſerveth in himſelf found principles of Religion, though he be unſanctified, than another who goeth aſide in the by-ways of unbelief, or misbelief. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> as for faith temporarie, it is not ſo called, becauſe it <hi>never</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures but for a time, but becauſe it is apt in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſtitution of it, to abide but a while, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96772:121"/>
then to fail. For in two caſes a temporarie beleever doth not fall away. 1. When perſecution doth not ariſe, nor any temptation on either hand; for then he may perſevere in his faith, during his life. 2. When it pleaſeth God to make uſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace, as preparatorie to ſaving Grace, and to indue the temporarie beleever with true juſtifying faith, which is his meer gift, not produced by the utmoſt of natural and civil perſections, but beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely upon the heirs of life. In a viſible conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Church. God bringeth men home to himſelf ordinarily by Degrees, working in them firſt that which is natural, and that which is moral; and then that which is ſpiritual. And they which quench the ſpirit, even in the common gifts thereof, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their own mercies, and are no friends to their own ſalvation, though you ſeem to adviſe all men, that are not as they ought to be, to turn Atheiſts or Pagans, for ſo they muſt do, if they loſe all their faith.</p>

I deſire you would remember this rule, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you fetch any argument of this kinde from the manner of the Apoſtles writing to any ſocietie of Chriſtians: and if you had thought of it now, you would never have laid any great weight upon that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Ye are fallen from Grace;</hi> for in the third ch. v. 26. he ſaith ye are all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. Such warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and exhortations are uſefull to all: for as the ſecure are awakened: and the unſound may hereby be made better than they are; ſo are true beleevers held in that ſtate which they have attained. By fear of falling away, they are preſerved from falling away. Care and watchfulneſs are ſpiritual graces of God, whereby they continue ſtedfaſt. When many of Chriſts diſciples being offended left him, their departure endangered the reſt: the twelve therefore he kept by him, by asking them thus, will
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96772:124"/>
ye alſo go away? As for ſuch impoſſibilitie of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, as you ſpeak of, I know not any. That which certainly ſhall not in the event come to paſs; may yet be poſſible in it ſelf to come to paſs. For the Saints conſidered in themſelves to fall away, is a thing poſſible, yea, very probable, ſuch is their weakneſs, ſuch is their danger. But upon ſuppoſition of Gods Decree, and promiſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, it is impoſſible that it ſhould be. They are as frail as glaſſes, but they are held by a warie hand. God will not ſuffer them to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their ſtrength, but knoweth how to deliver them out of temptation. He will not ſuffer the rod of the wicked to reſt, to abide long upon the lot of the righteous, leſt the righteous put forth their hands to wickedneſs. He ſhortens the days of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Elect be not born down, nor ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden. And ſometimes ſpeedily takes them away, leſt malice ſhould alter their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or deceit beguile their ſoul.</p>
            <p>To prove that there is a difference betwixt true beleevers and Apoſtates beſore their fall, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſeveral places, to which you have anſwered ſeverally and largely. But you have ſaid nothing that hath made any of thoſe teſtimonies to that purpoſe, invalid. The two firſt did ſhew, not onely, that there is a difference, but that the ground of that difference, is in Gods ſecret counſel. To thoſe two, I ſhall onely add now ſome other the like, and then conclude this chapter. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. <hi>None of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96772:124"/>
them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition.</hi> And what that ſignifies, you cannot better underſtand, than by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with a parallel place of the ſame ſubject, namely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.18. <hi>I ſpeak not of you all, I know whom I have choſen:</hi> in each of theſe texts Judas is he that is excepted, and in the one he is called the ſon of perdition; in the other he is ſaid, not to be choſen: and thence it was, he fell away, and was loſt. And that Election to life is ſpoken of there, and not to Office, is certain and evident, for <hi>Judas was</hi> choſen to be an Apoſtle. When the Jews, in ſo great a part fell off from the true Church, it was a very great offence. How doth the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. Iſrael hath not obtained, that which he ſeeketh for, but the <hi>Election</hi> hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.

            <p>To underſtand, and to make out the two-fold will of God, manifeſtly delivered in holy Scripture, it concerneth you as well as others, and I think you cannot do it better than others have done: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.3, 4.

You that hold God willeth all men to be ſaved in your ſenſe, without any difference, till they themſelves make it, not conferring one place of Scripture with another, &amp; one principle of Faith with the reſt, muſt make two contrary wills, or elſe deny, whether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or by conſequence, Gods omnipotence.

But others ſay, conſonant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to other parts of Chriſtian Divinity, that Gods revealed will is not always properly a will, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figuratively, interpretatively, or by way of likeneſs. He is ſaid to will becauſe he ſeemeth to will, in declaring what he willeth ſhould be mans duty, and what he will accept and approve of, if performed. Now becauſe this is declared by the Law or Commandment, therefore it is called his revealed will. This is no way contrary to his will whereby he peremptorily determines what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will do, and what ſhall inevitably come to paſs, which becauſe he hath not diſcovered to us, except matter of prophecy, or promiſe, is therefore called his ſecret will.</p>
            <p>Or, that it is his will, by way of approbation, he approveth, alloweth and liketh well of univerſall and perfect obedience, and the ſalvation of all men as agreeable to his nature and generall inclination, and as morally good: though he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly and perfectly will it, ſo as to effect it.</p>
            <p>And that his will to ſave all men conſiſteth in procuring a Saviour or Redeemer for all men, and ordaining means of ſalvation more or leſſe for all men; not in cauſing thoſe means always to take place. Thus have we been taught by thoſe whom you had done better to follow, than to take the chair of the ſcorners, and make a mock of what you cannot or will not underſtand.</p>

               <q rend="margQuotes">But were not the Ceremonies of Gods appointing then, more warrantable and ſutable to <hi>Davids</hi> ſpiritual worſhip, than Rites or Ceremonies of mans Inſtitution now, that God never commanded? might not a man expect more bleſſing then in obſerving them, than in the other now?

            <p>You compare the Rites and Ceremonies given to the Jews by <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the Ceremonies of Mans Inſtitution now. And you do it ſo, that the people may think, the Rites eſtabliſhed in our Church, are appointed as appertaining to Gods ſervice, no leſs than thoſe which were impoſed upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews in the old Teſtament.

            <p>Before the Liturgy is declared, that what of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies is retained, is for <hi>Diſcipline and Order,</hi> and not to be <hi>eſteemed equall with Gods law.</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96772:127"/>
proteſt againſt any ſuch intention, and declare that they meant it onely as a witneſs of their conſent in Gods worſhip, and of their joint-profeſſion with their brethren that dwelt in the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> they gave over preſently, laid aſide their jealouſie add ſuſpicion, and reſted well content.</p>
            <p>They who have endeavoured to ſatisfie the Non-conformiſts, did fully declare theſe things to be matters of indifferency, no part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, no way neceſſary to ſalvation, no more than any thing elſe that is done, and ought to be done at the command of a Superiour. They did always diſclaim any opinion of neceſſity, or efficacy aſcribed by Papiſts to their Ceremonies, any obligation of Conſcience, otherwiſe than in civill Laws, which God in the general hath commanded us to obſerve. The more to blame are they that will not at laſt, after ſo many proteſtations and declarations receive ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>If any of thoſe high-flown <hi>Anabapiſts</hi> with whom you have diſcourſed, who are againſt civill cuſtomes, yea againſt cuſtomes of Civility, as well as againſt Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and will not come at our Churches becauſe they have been defiled with; <hi>Maſs,</hi> ſhould argue thus againſt you, as you have in a ſort taught them to do; Might not a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more bleſſing in going to the Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> which was of divine dedication, appointed and conſecated by God himſelf, deſcending from heaven, and by his cloud of glory, owning it for

            <p>Upon occaſion of thoſe words in the Church-Cathechiſme, [<hi>To keep Gods holy will, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>] you asked your Scholar, what is the will and Commandment of God concerning thee?

            <p>IN your laſt chapter there is little I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, beſides that which you have in effect mentioned twice before, namely pag. 2. preſſing ceremonies and domination in the Church yon call <hi>Beaſtly doing,</hi> and the <hi>voice of the Dragon,</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi>

36. The Magiſtrate muſt not exerciſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> in appointing Ordinances of worſhip, and here you are at it again.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">If the time of Beaſt-worſhipping be not yet over, (as many godly perſons think it is not) then the Scripture ſays, all that then dwell upon the earth are falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, onely excepted, whoſe names written in the book of life.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>And many godly perſons know, that there have been, and are ſtill many ungodly perſons, who would gladly overthrow and deſtroy all Chriſtianity upon pretence of <hi>Antichriſtianiſme.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. hath given us warning of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger incident to Reformation, and what the Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Machinations of <hi>Satan</hi> are at ſuch a time, and what his Method: and that is this, to drive men from one extreme to another. Witneſs the caſe of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> there, who being at the firſt tolerated in his wickedneſs without any manner of cenſure, was in the next place well nigh plunged into deſpair, and ſwallowed up of ſorrow; through over-rigorous dealing. When the abuſes of <hi>Popery</hi> were to be reformed, not onely the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded laid to their hands, but perſons alſo world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, godleſs, and enemies to Religion joyned with the reſt in the deſtructive part, but intended to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96772:129"/>
promote Atheiſme, when they ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Superſtition. Hereticks alſo, whoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lay on that ſide, were zealous in their manner, but their zeal was more like Wild-fire, which they threw in, to have marred all, if it might have been. For after that Antiquity came to be a badge ot Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery then (1) whatſoever was found to have been practiſed by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Church-orders, was for that reaſon rejected. Not a ſtone muſt be taken from <hi>Babylon,</hi> for a foundation, or a corner. If the leaſt matter of all were yielded, it was as a pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn in acknowledgement of the Antichriſtian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And (2) even the moſt ſacred Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, have been denyed, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and thither were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. So the name of Antichriſt, the Beaſt, and the Dragon, ſerved the turne for many hereſies, &amp; for all profaneneſs. A Diſcourſe came forth enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The ſtorming of Antichriſt,</hi> a right proper and well choſen word, of which they know the meaning, who had experience of the Wars, and laying ſiege to Towns, and ſtrong places, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting them: ſtorms of winde, tempeſts of hail, and of Lightning, do ſpare nothing that is in their way, having no regard, ſhewing no mercy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no difference: for being meer naturall Agents, they always act according to their utmoſt power and might. So deſcribes the <hi>Poet</hi> his hardy Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. not likening them to Wolves and Lions, which have been
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96772:129"/>
known to relent, and their mouths have been as it were ſtopped; but they fought as it were a flame, fell on like a tempeſt, noting, ſaith the great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they were irrationally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, violent without ſenſe or reaſon, without mean or meaſure. And much like theſe ſtormers were ſome of thoſe that went among our Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both firſt and laſt. You ſeem to extend Beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip very far, even to thoſe matters in queſtion betwixt us. But you give no inſtance, nor ſhall I inſiſt upon any. I know you can, if you will, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt <hi>Poperie,</hi> and the Chriſtian Religion; and if you do not conſider apart, what belongs to one, and what belongs to the other, what to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and what to Truth; you may ſoon do that which tendeth to the weakening and undermining of the whole building. Divers of the Papiſts have twitted us with the Jews, laying to our charge Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme for refuſing ſome Apocryphal books, and for condemning Image worſhip, as the Jews do now; and for ſaying that a man cannot forgive ſins, as they alſo ſaid: and for inſiſting upon the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the precedents of the old Teſtament, to prove that unto Chriſtian Kings belongeth the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in ordering matters of Religion in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he that argueth thus, ſay they, is more like a Jew than a Chriſtian. The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Leſſon too; for when they were bent upon ſuch a confuſion, as ſhould take away the difference betwixt Clergie and Laitie, they were wont upon
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96772:130"/>
occaſion to revile the Prieſts and Levites, as blinde and ignorant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> demanding of <hi>John the Baptiſt, by what authority</hi> he did what he did: as if obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of order in the Church, and pretence of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi> in Gods worſhip and ſervice were points of Judaical blindneſs and infidelity. Againſt all theſe and ſuch like let us remember that the Jews were once the onely true Church of God, and our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity came to us from them, and through their hands, &amp; we are all but proſelytes to their Church. So that as they had once all the Subſtantials of the true Religion, both for belief and practice, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe but that they do retain many of them ſtill. In like manner the Chriſtian Religion came to us, through the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and our profeſſion is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the additions and ſuperſtructures of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, by which the right belief and worſhip have been corrupted; and to throw out the earth with which the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> had filled the well, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſprings. Antichriſts are many, there is falſe worſhip on both hands, Anarchie is beaſtly doing, as well as Tyrannie; and Confuſion, as much as Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">I cannot but think ſome prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt my perſon (I know not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ſo meer a ſtranger to him) hath clouded his reaſon.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:96772:130"/>
By this Clauſe, he that will may judge of all your book, as of the ſack by a handfull, for it is like the reſt, full of confidence, but void of reaſon, as if your Doctrine were ſo blameleſs, that nothing could be ſpoken againſt it: Perhaps againſt your perſon ſome may harbour prejudice, but againſt what you teach and write, no man, unleſs his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be overclouded, can juſtly except. You ſhould have been well aſſured firſt, that there was any ſuch prejudice born againſt you, before you took ſuch thought, and put your ſelf to a loſs in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what might be the cauſe of it. For my part, I am as much to ſeek, what ſhould be any the very leaſt ground of ſuch a vain ſurmiſe.</p>
            <p>Some little while after the comming forth of this your Piece, a friend of mine, and of yours too, who doth nor much give his mind to read Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, nor was at that time much inclined out of his good nature, to pitie my condition, did ask me thus; <hi>Who bade you begin?</hi> And becauſe this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is very conſonant to your ſenſe, I will now give you the Anſwer to it. And firſt, if my charge, which is <hi>that I began,</hi> be in reference to thoſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of right-believing Chriſtians, who have a long time been offended at your Doctrine, My De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is this, that if any other whoſoever had before endeavoured to hinder the ſpreading of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; then, as I could not have begun, ſo I would not have followed. There aroſe indeed ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between the <hi>Reverend Doctor</hi> and your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96772:131"/>
Vniverſity-learning, but for other Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxies of yours, no man, ſo far as I know, gave notice or publick warning. I <hi>began</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none other <hi>would,</hi> though very many much better <hi>might.</hi> But I ſuppoſe, the meaning of the queſtion was not, why I rather than another, but why I would begin <hi>with you,</hi> when as you gave me no provocation. But I pray conſider well, they are the Schiſmaticks, who, though they abide, give juſt occaſion unto others for to depart; He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the debt, begins the ſute; and he that invades my right, ſends for the proceſs. Will you not give others leave to defend their own againſt you, and and to continue in the things that they have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contend for the Faith once delivered to them, which you with your Innovations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions have corrupted? <hi>you</hi> began when you taught and promoted ſo many opinions contrary to what we have received; when you wrought upon the people to draw them after you; when at laſt you took advantage of their age, to ſow your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties among them early, leſt they ſhould take a reſolution to hold their own, after they were once prepoſſeſſed with the truth; when you preſumed to contrive your errours into <hi>Queſtion</hi> and <hi>Anſwer</hi> by way of <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> with impreſſion upon impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the inſtruction of children, as if you meant to lay a ground-work for the men of the next gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be built upon, becauſe the men of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are infatuated.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96772:131"/>
In the next place I deſire you to conſider, that you have (further than by teaching otherwiſe) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and as it were ſent a challenge to thoſe that are not of your mind. In the Preface to your <hi>Open Door § upon theſe,</hi> You do in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the cowardize of your Adverſaries, <q>
                  <hi>"that will gird and argue when they get into a Pulpit, where none may interrupt them, but they will not Abide An argument or two to their faces.</hi>]</q> And in your Eſſays, where you took a very little occaſion to <hi>begin,</hi> I finde theſe words, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. <hi>perhaps you may ſay, or ſome for you</hi>] and <hi>pag.</hi> 22. <hi>But haply you or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may reply</hi>] as expecting the debate would not end there, but that ſome or other would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Duel. I do ſuppoſe therefore that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhew you make, you are not much offended. <hi>Maffeius</hi> writeth of <hi>Ignatius Loiola,</hi> that he had <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num lacrymarum,</hi> Tears at command, and could weep when he would, and as he would, more or leſs: So I think you can be angry at any time, and chide when you have a mind to it, though you be in ſport, and take upon you great diſpleaſure then, when you are beſt of all content and pleaſed. I pray Sir, be perſwaded to believe, that I bear you no manner of grudge, nor did ever ow you ill will, as you never gave me the leaſt occaſion; and if in this Anſwer of yours, you have given me any, I have not taken it. It belongs not to me to ſay, how far my reaſon is clouded, but my affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you continueth very fair. And for the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96772:132"/>
between us controverted, I am where I was. You have brought nothing of moment wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to ſtrengthen and ſupport that cauſe to which you are a wel-willer, nor yet to incline thoſe that are wavering and unſetled, to be of your mind: but a twine threed will draw that which is coming: and thoſe whom you have miſled, you may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead ſtill, untill God be pleaſed to ſhew them better.</p>
