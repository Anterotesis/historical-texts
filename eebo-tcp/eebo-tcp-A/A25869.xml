         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Wedneſday, April</hi> 27. 1681. the Grand Juries for the County of
<hi>Middleſex</hi> were ſworn, and after the Charge delivered by Mr.
Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> His Majeſties Attorney General deſired, That ſome
of that Grand Jury which ſerved for the Hundreds of <hi>Edmonton</hi>
and <hi>Gore</hi> (that for <hi>Oſwolſton</hi> Hundred, being immediately adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a Week) might be preſent at the ſwearing of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
upon an Indictment for High-Treaſon, to be preferred againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi>
Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which was granted; but the Grand Jury
being under ſome ſcruples againſt receiving of the Bill, deſired the Opinion of the
Court therein, which Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> alone, thought not fit to give, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them to attend next day when the Court was full.</p>
            <p>And accordingly on <hi>Thurſday, April</hi> 28. the ſaid Grand Jury came to the Bar,
and Mr. <hi>Michael Godfrey</hi> (Brother to Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey)</hi> who was their
Foreman, addreſſed himſelf thus to the Court.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Godfrey.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have an humble requeſt to make to the Court on
the behalf of my ſelf, and another on the behalf of the Grand Jury for the
County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> of which I am Foreman; This Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> I
did beg of, when I was Sworn, to chooſe another man that was fitter for the
ſervice, as being more experienced, but he would not; and I beg your pardon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49318:3"/>
if I ſhould commit any failure for want of experience: But I do deſire before we
proceed upon this Indictment before us, that this ſame <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
about my Brothers Death, of which I ſuppoſe he may know much,
becauſe in the Printed Narrative he does ſpeak of one <hi>De Puy,</hi> who was a very
active man about that Murder; and how ill a man ſoever he hath been, we do
hope he hath ſo much Truth in him, as to tell what he knows of that horrid
Murder: Therefore I pray your Lordſhip, that you would grant an <hi>Habeas
Corpus</hi> to fetch him before your Lordſhip, to be examined upon that point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we do proceed; that is all as to my ſelf. My Lord, as to the Jury, we
do all of us humbly preſent this Paper, and deſire it may be Read in Court.</p>

the Hundreds of <hi>Edmonton</hi> and <hi>Gore,</hi> in this County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> &amp;c. and being
yeſterday ſent for into the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> by a Meſſenger from the ſaid
Court, to be preſent at the Swearing of ſeveral Witneſſes produced on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of our Sovereign Lord the King, to prove the truth of ſome Indictments,
then in the hands of the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Crown;</hi> and obſerving that Sir <hi>William
Waller, Smith,</hi> and others were Sworn to give Evidence againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi>
now Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who in the late Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> was
Impeached by the Honourable Houſe of Commons in the name of themſelves
and of all the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> of which, we the ſaid <hi>Michael Godfrey,</hi> &amp;c.
are part, and as Jury-men, be his Judges alſo.</p>
               <p>We therefore Humbly deſire the opinion of this Honourable Court, whether
it be lawful and ſafe for us, the ſaid <hi>Godfrey, &amp;c.</hi> (in caſe an Indictment of the
ſaid <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould be brought before us) to proceed to Examin any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
in reference to the ſaid Indictment? or any way to meddle with it, or
proceed upon it, notwithſtanding the ſaid Impeachment, and Votes purſuant to
it by the ſaid Honourable Houſe of Commons? And this being a great point in
Law, and of ſo great conſequence, for us to undertake, in a point of Right,
not ſettled by Conference, and remaining yet undetermined in the High Court of
Parliament?</p>
               <p>We therefore humbly deſire the opinion of this Court upon the whole matter,
whether legally and ſafely, we may proceed upon, to find the Indictment of
<hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> or no?</p>

this matter, as a thing of weight; for we are between Two Millſtones as we
apprehend it, and ſhall be Ground between them.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. General.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Be pleaſed to ſpare me one word: This Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was tendred to this Grand Jury yeſterday, and this Gentleman was againſt
accepting the Bill till he had your Judgement, and ſo were two more; but for
all that, the body of them carried it (all but theſe three) to hear the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
whereupon Mr. <hi>Solicitor</hi> and my ſelf did go on upon the Evidence, and
ſpent ſometime in opening it to them, and it was all given to them; and truly,
the Gentlemen did ſeem to be abundantly ſatisfied what an horrid Villany it was,
and we did think they would have found the Bill; but it ſeems they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
to put theſe ſcruples into the others Heads.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Mr. Attorney, We will not now inquire into that.
Gentlemen of the Jury, you ſeem diſſatisfied in this matter, and deſire the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Court in it, whether you may lawfully proceed to find this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or not? We did hear yeſterday of ſome ſcruples you made to my Brother
<hi>Jones</hi> when you were Sworn, and he ſat in Court to give you the Charge,
which he thought not fit then to Anſwer, but left it till to day; truely we
would have all things fairly and clearly done, that we may underſtand how we
go all along in this matter: Your ſcruple is this; Here was, you ſay, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
offered againſt <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> by the Commons to the Lords, and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49318:3"/>
Impeachment was of High-Treaſon, which was not received, and thereupon
there was a Vote of the Houſe of Commons that he ſhould not be tryed by
any other Inferior Court: You deſire now to know whether you may inquire
concerning this Treaſon, notwithſtanding theſe things that have paſſed thus?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Godfrey.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, My Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>We are very ready and willing to ſatisfy any of the King s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in any matters in Judgment before us, that they may ſee there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fair proceedings in all Caſes; We do tell you tis our Opinions, that
notwithſtanding any thing of this matter that you ſuggeſt in the Caſe before you,
it is fit for you to enquire upon the Indictment, and you are bound to enquire by
vertue of your Oaths, if an Indictment be exhibited to you; you cannot, nor
ought to take any notice of any ſuch Impeachment offered to the Lords, nor of
any ſuch Votes of the Houſe of Commons afterwards, if any ſuch there were,
for they will not excuſe you (who are Sworn to Inquire of the matters given
you in Charge) in caſe you do not your duty; and therefore if you have Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough given you, to ſatisfy you that the Indictment is true, you are to
find it: And likewiſe we ought to proceed according to Juſtice in Caſes that are
brought before us. Neither you nor we can take notice of theſe things, in caſe
there be any ſuch as you ſuggeſt, nor will they excuſe us before God or man
for the breach of our Oaths, if we ſhould do the contrary; And this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you, not only as our Opinions, but as the Opinion of all the Judges of
<hi>England:</hi> For when we did hear there was a ſcruple made by you the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Jury; becauſe we would make the way fair and clear, all the Judges
did aſſemble to debate the matter for your ſatisfaction; not that we were diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
at all in it our ſelves, but that it might appear to you and the Kingdom,
That there is nothing but fairneſs uſed in this Caſe, as in all others; and all the
Judges, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> were all of Opinion, that you are not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of any of theſe things; but if the Indictment be exhibited, and you have
Evidence enough, you ought to find it. This we have endeavoured for your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to make your way clear.</p>

of it: I do therefore tell him it may be fatal and Peremptory to him, for

For as we would ſhew you all the favour we can, in Equity and Juſtice, ſo
we muſt not deny the King Juſtice neither. And you hear Mr Attorney ſay,
that theſe things (if they ſhould delay the buſineſs too long) would be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to much of the King's buſineſs. It may be, that this Delatory Plea, may
ſpend ſo much time of the Term, that we cannot try it; and therefore if we

am with three others of the Gentlemen that attend this Bar, aſſigned of Counſel
for Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> and that which I would beg for my ſelf and them is this,
There is one thing we deſire may be explained a little in the Rule. I humbly
apprehend your Lordſhip gave leave to the Counſel, who you ſo aſſigned, to
come to Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and entruſted them with the Liberty of ſpeaking
with him alone; but by the penning of the Rule, we apprehend that the ſame
Reſtraint is put upon them, that is upon other perſons, to have ſome body at

               <p>We think it may have a Conſtruction either way; but
we deſire it may be made plain, as you meant it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

and we deſire as much as may be to expedite this matter, as far as we can, for
our own Reputation, and doing our Duty to the perſon we are aſſigned of
Counſel for. But truely ſo ſoon, as is appointed by your Lordſhip, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for us to prepare things ſo, as to be ready by <hi>Wedneſday</hi>-Morning. The
Plea I never ſaw, nor did I ever hear of it, till it was brought and read here;
but ſince that, I have not ſeen it till this time. The Rules were brought but laſt
Night to our Chambers, there is no Soliicitor in the Cauſe that may attend us.
The Indictment I have not ſeen that we are to Plead to, and truely I think the
Courſe is to have a Copy of the Indictment.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> Fran. Winnington.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We ought to preſent things to the Court as
they are in Fact, that we may not lye under any reflection from the Court, nor
any body elſe. You made a Rule on <hi>Saturday,</hi> that I ſhould be of Council for
him, (which I ſubmit to) but I knew not of this till afterwards. I never ſaw
the Plea, nor any Paper in this Cauſe as yet: The Rule was left at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this laſt Night, and when I ſaw it, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and we got together in the
Hall this Morning; We could not do it till juſt now, and we come now to
wait upon the Court, to acquaint them how the matter ſtands. I was not in
Court, when you gave your Directions about this matter; but when I finde
what the Nature of the Caſe is, I ſhall be ready to do my Duty to the Court,
and to him who is upon his Life It is a mighty Cauſe, it is a Cauſe that may-be,
if we do not acquit our ſelves as we ought, have reflection upon our Poſterity,
if we do not do it as well as we can. Therefore we deſire ſome reaſonable
Time that we may have Copies of the Papers and things concerned in this
Cauſe, as the Court ſhall direct. And we are aſſured your Lordſhip is ſo well
acquainted with the uſual Method in ſuch Caſes, that you will give us all the
favour in it you can.</p>

               <p>For my part, My Lord, the Notice I had was but very lately; I
was by, indeed, when this perſon <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> did deſire Connſel, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
aſſigned me amongſt the reſt; but nothing of the Order was brought to me
till this Morning; So that I know nothing of the matter leſs or more, than
what I heard upon the reading of the Paper here on <hi>Saturday.</hi> I do not deſire
Time, for Time-ſake or for Delay; but we think the nature of the thing is ſuch,
as will aequire great Conſideration, and we deſire convenient Time to prepare
it for the Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> You muſt conſider here the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your Caſe; This is an Indictment of High-Treaſon, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I ſee, that is ſo greatly conſiderable in the Caſe, but the heighth of the
Crime. Tis an extraordinary Crime indeed, if he be Guilty of it, (for I ſpeak
not to prejudice your Client, but of the thing it ſelf.) 'Tis a Treaſon of a very
high Nature: And then what have we to conſider in this Caſe? We might have
taken your Client at advantage here, and it had been no Injuſtice if we had
made him to plead immediately, as he would ſtand by it: And we are not to
conſult your leaſure, but your Clients Cauſe; he hath pitch'd upon you for his
Counſel; We have given him three days time to Plead as he will ſtand by
it, <hi>Saturday, Munday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and he is to come with his Plea upon <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday.</hi>
We have appointed for Conveniency ſake, that you ſhould give a Copy
of the Plea to Morrow Morning to Mr. Attorney; But we do not tye you ſo
peremptorily to that Copy, that you may not vary in Words from that Form.
Give him but the ſubſtance of the Plea, and we will not tye you to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Formal Words. Peradventure Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> could not have expected
three days time, in courſe of Law, upon ſuch a Crime, to put in ſuch a Plea;
when he tells us, He will plead ſpecially to the Juriſdiction of the Court. But
we have done it in this Caſe, to ſhew, that all the fairneſs that can poſſibly be
uſed, ſhall be uſed. On the other ſide, we muſt not ſpend all our time ſo, as to
let the Term ſlip, for his neglect of waiting upon you. Therefore if he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to ſend to adviſe with you, he muſt ſuffer for it. Suppoſe he did not come
to you till to Morrow, what can we help it?</p>

               <p>My Lord, I think it will be very hard upon us that are of
Counſel to be ſo ſtraightned in point of Time; for my part, the Rule was left
under my Door the laſt Night, and I had it not till this Morning: It will be
a mighty hard matter for us to get the Plea ready without a ſight of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.
Things muſt be averr'd to be the ſame, which we cannot, unleſs we
ſee what is there alleadged. This man hath been kept cloſe Priſoner, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
ſuffered to come at him to inſtruct him; and we have not ſo much as
Copies of any thing that we muſt make uſe of. We have no concernment, my
Lord, in this matter, but what is aſſigned us by the Court; and we do not
know by any Papers, if there be any, how we ſhould put it into Form, and
that is it, my Lord, which may lye heavy upon us: If this man's buſineſs
ſhould miſcarry for want of putting it into due Form, the blame will be upon
us, who are aſſigned his Counſel: Therefore if your Lordſhip pleaſe, under
theſe Conſiderations, to give us Time and Leave to ſee the Indictment we
are to Plead to, we may be the better inabled to do our Duty.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I do really move, not in favour of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> but
for my own Reputation; I cannot put my hand to a Plea of this Conſequence,
without time to conſider very well of it; and unleſs, in truth, I can ſee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
and compare the Plea with it, to put it into Form fit for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Court. And if theſe things cannot be granted, I deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>

               <p>Why Gentlemen, See what you ask, Where do you find any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of a man Indicted for High-Treaſon, that would Plead to the Juriſdiction
of the Court, that had more time given him than is in this Caſe?</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Fran. Winnington.</speaker>
               <p>We do not know what his Plea will be, my Lord, till
we have ſeen it and conſidered it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Your Clyent told us all, and we know all of us very well, That
it is to the Juriſdiction of the Court, and can be no otherwiſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſtice Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Any thing elſe you may give in Evidence upon, Not
Guilty. And it would be conſidered on your Tryal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sr.</hi> Fran. Winnington.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it may happen to be not ſo properly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Juriſdiction of the Court; We know not what it will be till we
have ſeen the things neceſſary to draw it into Form. It is true conſequentially,
it is the Concern of our Clyent; but the ground of our Motion at this time
is for our ſelves. I did apprehend by the Rule, his Special Plea was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
if he tendered one, let it be what it will; We muſt conſider many
things in a Caſe of this Nature; And at laſt, whether it will be to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
or what 'tis, we can't tell as yet. And till we have ſeen the Nature
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49318:7"/>
of the thing, and what is neceſſary to prepare it for the Court, I cannot ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to give it its proper Term. But our time is ſo ſhort, if your Lordſhip
will afford us no longer, that we know not how to be ready for it. Your
Lordſhip does ſpeak of Mr. Attorney's being attended with the Subſtance of the
Plea, not tying us to the Form in the Copy delivered to him. Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was here upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> when this matter was firſt ſtarted, and he
knew the Subſtance then: We know not what it is more than by Report.
It is a Plea that ſo rarely happens, that we muſt be cautious in what Form
we put it. Tis as your Lordſhip hath been pleaſed to ſay, an horrible
Treaſon, that in the Indictment is ſpecifyed. We muſt not ſpeak, nor do not
mitigate the hainouſneſs of the Crime; nor do we ſpeak it becauſe it is
Term-time, and may hinder our other buſineſs: We ſhall all of us, I am
ſure, not at all conſider our own time, or loſs in the matter; but it being
of ſo great weight, we deſire reaſonable time to do our duties: we name
no time, nor dare do it; we ſubmit that to the Court. But, My Lord,
under favour, for the Copy of the Indictment, we do conceive 'tis neceſſary
that we ſhould ſee a Copy of it; and when the Court is pleaſed to admit the
party to give in a Special Plea to the matter he is accuſed of, and aſſign
him Counſel to Plead it, I take it to be very rational and conſonant to Law,
that he have a Copy of the Charge.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>Fran. Winnington,</hi> For you to come and ſay theſe things here,
methinks is very ſtrange, I think you can ſhew us no Preſident, that ever ſo
long time was given to any man to Plead to the Juriſdiction of the Court, nor
that ever a Copy of the Indictment was granted in High-Treaſon; and for you,
becauſe of the greatneſs of the Treaſon, therefore to go about to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that it is more reaſonable that a Copy of the Indictment ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this Caſe than in another; that the greatneſs of the Crime ſhould be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,
and deſerve a Favour of the Court, not granted in other Caſes, is a
thing extraordinary.</p>

               <p>I do not preſs it that way, I pray I may be underſtood
aright; upon what appeared the other day, upon the nature of the Plea, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it to your Conſideration, Whether or no, when you have been pleaſed to
admit a Special Plea, You will not let us ſee that which we are to Plead to?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <p>No, it hath been conſtantly denied in Caſes of Felony and
Treaſon, and ſo you will find the practice to have always been. But I'll tell
you what hath been done ſometimes, They have granted ſome Heads out of
the Indictment, that ſhould inable the Party to fit his Plea to the Charge, and
that was done in <hi>Wittypooles</hi> Caſe, upon a Plea of <hi>Auter forti acquit.</hi> They gave
him the Times, and ſome other Circumſtances to fit his Plea to his Caſe; but
never was there a Copy of the Indictment granted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Wallop.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in his Preface to the 3d <hi>Report,</hi> declares, That it
was the Ancient Law of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo declared by Act of Parliament in
<hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time, That any Subject may, for his neceſſary Uſe, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to Records and Copies of them, be they for the King or againſt the King,
and that the practice to the contrary is an Abuſion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>So then, Mr. <hi>Wallop,</hi> you take it, that we are bound when any man is
Indicted of Fellony, or Treaſon, or any Capital Crime, if he ſay he muſt have a
Copy of the Record, we muſt grant him a Copy of the Indictment; If you
think ſo, the Court and you are not of the ſame Opinion.</p>

               <p>My Lord, It may be neceſſary, for ought we know, for him
to Plead over to the Fact laid in the Indictment, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> as ſometimes it is
requiſite for the Party to do. Now if we ſhould miſtake for want of having
what is neceſſary, and thereby preclude him of the Advantages he might have
had if the Plea had been rightly drawn, for ought I know, it will lye upon me
for ever. My Lord, I do it merely out of Caution, and for my own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſake: If any Legal Advantage ſhould be loſt by my unwarineſs, it will
be a perpetual Reflection upon me; And therefore I am ſo earneſt in this Caſe.
And, my Lord, I can tell you what was done in a Caſe wherein I was of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
It was not a Caſe of Treaſon indeed, but it was Murder, the next Crime
to it; it was the Caſe of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Thomas: Thomas</hi> was Indicted of Murder
in one County, and found Guilty of Manſlaughter; and afterwards was Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for the ſame Murder in another County, and being to plead this matter,
I did inſiſt upon it, that we ought to have a Copy of the Indictment; There was
ſome Debate about it, but at laſt we had a Copy, and we alledged there, as
here, it was impoſſible to plead without it; and the Cauſe was removed hither
into this Court for Judgment.</p>

ſay likewiſe, that they deſire a Copy of the Indictment. Now, in truth, they
ought to have given you notice of this, that you might have been here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

are miſtaken, if they think they are aſſigned as Counſel to all Events. They

are only to draw up a Plea upon that matter that is alledged by the Priſoner,

                  <hi>Sir</hi> Fran. Win.</speaker>
               <p>No, My Lord, I beg your Lordſhips pardon: The Rule is to

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. General.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Under favour, It is as I ſay, and ſo is the courſe
of Law; For the Priſoner ought to acquaint you with the Points he deſires his
Counſel to be heard to: And in this Caſe, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> did acquaint the Court
before he would Plead, that he had ſome thing to object to the Juriſdiction
of the Court; and ſo his Wife directed him when ſhe gave him the Paper.
I ſuppoſe ſhe had other adviſe upon it; for ſhe could not draw it up in that
Form it was, her ſelf; and he did acquaint the Court, he had matter to
Plead to the Juriſdiction of the Court, and concluded ſo in the Paper that
was read. And thereupon, according to his Prayer he had Council aſſign<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him,
theſe Gentlemen: I conſented to it, as it was juſt I ſhould; but that they
ſhould think, that they are to adviſe him in other matters than that particular
upon which they are aſſign'd, I know they know their Duty better than to offer
at any ſuch thing. Now ſince then there is but one ſingle point, the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Court and nothing elſe, for they are not to adviſe in other
matters: I think it was more than ſtrict Juſtice, nay it was a very great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
for all men ought to be ready to plead ſuch Pleas immediately.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in ſtrictneſs, we might have required him to Plead as he would

            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. General.</speaker>
               <p>The Law is, that he muſt have all ready, <hi>in Poigne,</hi> to
make it appear that what he avers in his Plea is ſo; Therefore you needed
not to have given him any longer Time: But becauſe all the World might
ſee the Court and King's Counſel dealt fairly in this matter, and did not mean
to take advantage of any thing that lookt like a Surprize, I conſented to that
time that your Lordſhip was pleaſed to ſet: And as for the Copy of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I know not any reaſon they have to deſire it; for they are not to adviſe
in that, what Defence he ſhall make; but only upon this matter he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>

               <p>Look you, Gentlemen, what Mr. Attorney tells you, is ſo, and we
do expect that you ſhould conform your ſelves to it: We have given you three
Days time, which is ſufficient for ſuch a thing as this. And Mr. Attorney, we
told them thus, When we did direct them, that they ſhould deliver you a Copy
of the Plea to Morrow-morning. We are not ſo critical with them, as that we
will not receive their Plea, if it be variant in Form from that which they deliver
to you. That that we intend by it is this, That they ſhould deliver you a Plea,
the ſame in ſubſtance as that which they do plead here: If they would alter it
in the Form, we can give them leave to do that without any prejudice.</p>

               <p>I have but a few words to ſay before it be read, if your Lordſhip
pleaſe, for our ſelves, or at leaſt for my ſelf. According to the beſt Inſtructions we
have had, we have drawn up this Plea, and I pray it may be entred ſo. But, my
Lord, I humbly conceive we have not had, or for my own part I have not had
thoſe Inſtructions that were fit to direct me in this Caſe. It is a ſpecial Plea, and
of a matter that rarely happens; and the nature of this ſpecial Plea is, that the
matter contained in the Indictment and in the Impeachment, is one and the ſame
matter. Now I have not yet ſeen, nor could I come at a ſight, though I deſired it,
of the Impeachment, nor of the Indictment: But I humbly conceive, that by the
Law, as this Caſe is upon a ſpecial Plea, the Priſoner ought to have a Copy of the
Indictment. And I do not ſay that every one may demand a Copy of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
to find faults; but upon a ſpecial Plea, and particularly upon this, I
humbly conceive he ought to have a ſight and a Copy of his Indictment.</p>

               <p>Thus, my Lord: if we can have no further Inſtructions, nor can by
any other means come to a ſight of theſe things, then it is the beſt Plea we can make
in ſuch a Caſe, and I avow the Plea; but if any thing ſhould fall out amiſs to the
Priſoner for want of ſuch a ſight, I pray it may not lie upon me.</p>

ſtand upon his Plea, that he ſtands impeached in the Houſe of Peers. I ſent to
know of them whether they would plead this to the Juriſdiction, or in Abatement,

were poſſible to be obtained, a Copy of the Impeachment in Parliament. We
ſent to the Houſe of Lords Clerk to get it, but they that went down, tell us the
Clerk is not in Town; or elſe we had ſent Mr. Attorney the whole Plea at that

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Pray go on, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I do pray your Judgment upon it; for 'tis a Plea
that is inſufficient: nay, 'tis no Plea to bar you of your Juriſdiction. Firſt, I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49318:10"/>
obſerve, that whoſoever will plead a Plea to the Juriſdiction, if he have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to plead, muſt have it in <hi>poigne,</hi> muſt produce it in the Court, or at leaſt
muſt produce a Copy ſworn, that the Court may ſee there is nothing dilatory
in the Caſe. And for this matter it will appear upon Examination to be a plain
frivolous Plea; for there is no ſuch matter depending as this Plea alleadges.
But I ſpeak of it as a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Court; and ſuch an one as
will plead ſuch a Plea, he muſt have the Record ready, to ſhew it to the Court,
and by the Courſe of Law, ought to have it ready to aſſert to the Court, that
they have not Juriſdiction: So then 'tis certainly nought. That is the firſt
thing. Another thing is this, with ſubmiſſion, I ſay, They have pleaded no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
at all, nor any Impeachment at all, as this Caſe is; for the Notes that I
have taken, my Lord, are, They ſay he was impeached by the Commons <hi>de alta
Proditione;</hi> but that is nought: He ought in his Plea to have ſet forth his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
and for what Crime particularly; for either an Indictment or an
Impeachment <hi>de alta Proditione,</hi> or Felony, or any other Crime, is nought, the
Law allows it not. He ought to ſet forth, and muſt not aver upon a Record, but
ſet it forth <hi>in haec verba,</hi> or in the ſubſtance of it; and ſo ought to plead the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
intire as it is. And for thoſe neceſſary Averments that cannot otherwiſe be
made, the Law allows of them. But in this Caſe he cannot come and aver upon
this Record; for he hath ſet forth the Impeachment not as it was, but onely
barely <hi>de alta Proditione</hi> in general, which the Record muſt ſhew, ſo as the Court
may judge of it, and it muſt not be intended. But as they have ſet it forth, in
this Caſe there is nothing of Treaſon ſpecified in the Record averred, that can
intend this to be the ſame; and, my Lord, ſo are all the Preſidents. Whoſoever
pleads a private Act of Parliament, muſt plead it as it is, not in general that it is
for the ſame matter; for I take it then 'tis nought: and we are in your judgment,
that this is no Plea to the Juriſdiction upon that point.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Mr Attorney, Do you think it prudent to argue it this time, or will
you take a day? Pray conſider of that a little.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think delay is very dangerous and miſchievous in
this Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>We can give you as ſhort a day as you pleaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But to ſatisfie the Court, the Clerk will be ready with the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
to ſhew that the Fact is not as they plead it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Mr. Attorney, we muſt go on in a legal and formal way,
when we have a Plea put in: Therefore whether you will not take time for a day
or two to conſider of this Plea: you had the ſubſtance of it, but nothing concerning
the manner of the pleading; they would not tell you whether they would plead
it in Abatement, or in Bar, or how: Therefore whether you will not take time to
conſider of this pleading for a day or two, pray conſider with your ſelf.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Not onely for what I have already offered, but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other reaſons, we can ſee this can be no way a Plea to the Juriſdiction of this
Court; for upon any Impeachment or Indictment, the King hath Election to
proceed upon which he will: and if there were ten Indictments for one and the
ſame thing, if none of them are come to a Judgment, the King may proceed upon
which he pleaſes, as in that Caſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> yeſterday; though the party were
arraigned and ready to be tryed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet the King might, if he pleaſed, try
him here, and the King hath ordered it ſo to be. But, my Lord, I take it, that
this is not onely apparently a falſe Plea, but a frivolous Plea in it ſelf, being to the
Juriſdiction of this Court: For there was never any thing of a Crime ſo great,
but this Court of <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> which hath a Soveraign Juriſdiction for Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
eſpecially, could take Cognizance of it; and I put it upon that, my Lord.
Never was ſuch a Plea pleaded to your Juriſdiction; and therefore we pray your
Judgment upon it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, before we come to that which is the Queſtion, if there
were ſuch a Plea pleaded to the Juriſdiction as they would have this to be, we
humbly pray the Judgment of the Court, whether this be any ſuch Plea at all as can
bear any Debate: For it will not be a Queſtion now, how far an Impeachment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
is a Bar to your Juriſdiction, but the Queſtion is, firſt, whether this be ſuch
a Plea? For, my Lord, I do take it, No Man can plead any Record in another
Court, any Indictment or Acquittal upon it, by pleading it in this Form as this is
pleaded, by ſaying generally, that ſuch a time in ſuch a Court he was indicted for
the ſame Offence and was acquitted: yet thus this Plea is and no more. But he
that will plead <hi>auter foitz acquit,</hi> muſt plead that ſuch a time he was indicted in ſuch
a Court, and ſet forth the Indictment and all the proceedings of that Court upon
that Record, and then 'tis proper for Judgment; ſuch a Plea is Formal and requires
an Anſwer, and it will be proper for us to give it an Anſwer; and when ſuch a
Plea is put in, we ſhall either Demur to it, or give it the Anſwer that it requires, of
<hi>null tiel Record.</hi> But this does not require any particular Anſwer, becauſe it ſets forth
no Record at all that we can anſwer to: for it is not ſufficient to ſay in general,
that he was Indicted and Acquitted, or Impeached, and then aver that it was for
the ſame Offence, but he ought to ſhew forth the Impeachment, and ſet forth in
the Plea the Record, that upon it you may paſs a certain Judgment. Therefore we
hope you will ſet this aſide, as not being at all Formal, or requiring any Anſwer
to it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, If you pleaſe to conſider in this Caſe what is the
Queſtion; and what not. At preſent 'tis not the Queſtion whether if a Man be
Impeached of High Treaſon by the Commons before the Lords, and this Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtands unreverſed in the Court of Parliament: I ſay, 'tis not the Queſtion
whether this Court have Juriſdiction over this Man for that Offence, but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is, Whether he hath put in ſuch a Plea before you as will put that in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Under Favour, 'tis not ſufficient for him that will Plead a particular Record,
in Bar or other way, and make uſe of it, that he plead it in general Terms,
but he muſt ſet forth that Record as it is, he muſt not give you the Title only,
or ſay, he was Indicted for ſuch a thing generally, but he muſt ſo ſet it forth
to the Court, that if Iſſue be taken, the Court may by comparing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
with the Plea, judg whether it be the ſame Matter or no. Now when
he pleads he was Impeached for the ſame Treaſon, he muſt ſet forth what
that was, that it may appear it was for the ſame Treaſon; and if that be
particularly ſet forth as it ought, upon <hi>null tiel Record,</hi> the Queſtion will be,
Is there ſuch a Record or not? Now if he comes and ſays he was Indicted or
Impeached, and not for what in particular, the two things that upon the Iſſue are
to be compared, are not made ſo fit for your Judgment. In our Law, my Lord,
if a Man will plead, he need not ſet forth a general Act of Parliament, but if he
will plead a particular Act, he muſt ſet forth the Matter of it, to bring his Caſe
under the Judgment of the Court; And whether this be ſo pleaded or no, we
ſubmit it to you.</p>

read, whereon any Point in Law may ariſe, you do put the Party to demur or take
Iſſue, but according to the common Courſe of this Court in common Caſes, and
much more in extraordinary Caſes, and eſpecially in Capital Caſes, and moſt of all
in a Caſe of High Treaſon, ſuch as this if it do appear to the Court and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
That the Plea is in its Nature a frivolous Plea, you do uſually refuſe to admit
ſuch a Plea, and give Judgment upon it: Now we would acquaint your Lordſhip
with our Apprehenſions in this Caſe, and we would pray you to conſider what the
danger may be upon us to demur, if this Plea be frivolous as it appears to be; For
whether an Indictment in this Court, or an Indictment in another Court be for
one and the ſame Offence, and ſo a Bar to the Juriſdiction, we are not ſo much as
admitted into the Queſtion of that as this Plea is; Whereas according to the
Courſe in other Pleas, we pray you would be pleaſed to ſee the inconvenience, if
we ſhould be put to demur to it, for then we do admit by this Demurrer, that this
Impeachment is for one and the ſame thing, and we humbly conceive my Lord,
that is a little dangerous. How then will it be poſſible for you ever to judg, That
the Impeachment (which in Fact is otherwiſe) and the Indictment is for the ſame
thing, unleſs you will put them to purſue the common Methods, how it was in the
Houſe of Lords, by ſhewing forth the Record, and what can we do otherwiſe (it
being apparently againſt the common Form of Pleas, and manifeſtly for delay only)
then Pray the Judgment of the Court, which we hope will be to reject this Plea.</p>

Formerly I confeſs, when they pleaded Pleas <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> and took their Exceptions
<hi>Ore tenus</hi> too, they would demand Judgment of a Plea preſently, and ſo it was in
the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter's</hi> Caſe, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. where there was an Indictment againſt
the Biſhop here in this Court, for going away from the Parliament at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
without the leave of the Lords; There <hi>Shard</hi> comes in, and Pleads <hi>Ore tenus</hi> this
Matter, and ſays, This is a thing that concerns the Lords in Parliament, of which
they have Cognizance only, and ſo prays the Judgment of the Court preſently,
Whether they have Juriſdiction of the Cauſe or no, and he pleads it in abatement.
There they over-ruled him preſently without any more to do, becauſe their Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were not as now they are, now they are grown into a formal Way, all entred

the Court is to maintain their own Juriſdiction, the King's Counſel have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>Will your Lordſhip pleaſe to ſpare me one Word. As it hath
been obſerved to your Lordſhip, This is a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Court;
and if they do plead a Plea of that Nature, the Court always expects the Plea ſhould
be ſubſtantially good, otherwiſe it is not to be received, now it is not ſubſtantially
good here; For it ſays, that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was impeached of High Treaſon: now ſuch
an Impeachment is nought, for no body can be impeached of High Treaſon generally.
It ought to come and ſet forth the particular Acts that make up the Treaſon: for
the calling of a thing ſo, does not make it ſo: Therefore they that would plead this
Plea, muſt come and ſhew that there is an Impeachment that hath ſuch Matter in
it as does amount to Treaſon, ſo that then it being a naughty Plea in the Subſtance
of it, and the end of it to put this Court out of a Juriſdiction, we hope for that
Reaſon you will not receive it.</p>

               <p>One Word further, if your Lordſhip pleaſe, on the ſame ſide for
the King. As for this Plea that he hath pleaded here, if it had had ſubſtantial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Law, whereupon to ground a Debate, we ſhould not preſs your Lordſhip not
to receive it, but we muſt get off of it as well as we could; but when it is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaded merely for delay, and it ſo appears to your Lordſhip upon the reading
of it, and that there is nothing of Subſtance in it, then we hope you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, nor put Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> to Demur to it, or take Iſſue upon it. Now for the
Plea, the Caſe is thus, Here is an Indictment for Treaſon againſt Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi>
for conſpiring the Death of the King, compaſſing of it, and declaring ſuch his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
by a venemous Libel. Now he comes and Pleads to out this Court of their
Juriſdiction, and what does he Plead? He ſays he was formerly Impeached of High
Treaſon in the Parliament, that is all he ſays concerning the Impeachment; then he
does come and make an Averment without ſhewing more that this High Treaſon,
and that for which he was Impeached, is the ſame, and takes upon himſelf to judg,
whether the Court will or not, and will not ſubmit it to the Court, which certainly is
not the right way of Pleading. If Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould come and Plead <hi>auter foitz
acquit,</hi> That he had been tryed at another time for the ſame Offence and acquitted,
he ſhould not have ſaid generally he had been formerly indicted and acquitted, and
this for the ſame thing. But he muſt have ſhewed the Record, and then averred
upon the Record, that it was for one and the ſame Crime. For ſuppoſe in this
Caſe, which would have appeared perhaps to be ſo, if he had done as he ſhould
have done, ſhewn that there was ſuch an Impeachment, whereby he was Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of High Treaſon, and which Impeachment did charge him with Treaſon for
levying War againſt the King, and then have made a Concluſion as he does now,
with an Averment, that the Impeachment and the Indictment was for one and
the ſame Offence: Under favour, notwithſtanding his Averment, the Court would
have adjudged them not to be the ſame. For if ſo be the Treaſon do not appear
upon the Record to be the ſame, his Averment will ſignify nothing; why then his
Pleading now thus inſufficiently for want of the Record, will be better for him than
if he had pleaded it ſufficiently. Why then if he had now pleaded, that there is a
Record of the former Impeachment, and ſet forth the Record, and then averred this
was for the ſame, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> might take Iſſue either there was no ſuch Record, or
ſaid it was another Treaſon, and traverſed it that it was not for the ſame, and ſo
there would either have been one Tryal by the Record, or the other upon the Fact
by the Country. But now as he hath made it, this Tryal both upon the Record,
and upon the Fact, is only tryable by the Country, not by the Record. For if
Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> take Iſſue that there is no ſuch Record, then all the Record is, that he
was Impeached for High Treaſon, and then a Record of Impeachment for any High
Treaſon would ſerve the turn, which if it be not for the ſame, it ought not: ſo then
the Iſſue of <hi>null tiel Record</hi> could not be taken; Why then now, my Lord, as to the
Fact; If Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> take Iſſue, that it was not the ſame Treaſon, then the Record
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49318:12"/>
muſt be tryed, that is, whether there was ſuch a Record that does contain an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
for the ſame Treaſon for which he ſtands indicted; this I ſay, muſt be
tryed by the Country. And if he have pleaded it ſo, that matter of Record upon
Iſſue muſt be tryed by the Country, for that reaſon his Plea is naught; and if that
be ſo, then the Court may be ſatisfied, that 'tis apparently pleaded only for delay,
becauſe he would not come to the principal Matter, and plead Guilty or Not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is the matter of Fact moſt proper for the Country. I rather hope he is
not Guilty than that he is: but if he be Guilty, 'tis the moſt horrid venemous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as ever was ſpread abroad in any Age. And for that reaſon your Lordſhip will
not give Countenance to any delay. And therefore we pray the Plea may be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and he may anſwer over.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Attor. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, hear what I pray. My Lord, I deſire your Judgment,
that the Plea may ſtand over-ruled for a plain fatal Error in it; This is a particular
Indictment for the framing a moſt pernicious ſcandalous Libel againſt the King, and
the Government, for Treaſon in that particular. And I think there is no Perſon does
doubt, but that this is a Matter within the Juriſdiction of this Court to try: There
is no difficulty in that. What do they do to out this Juriſdiction? They come and
Plead that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was Impeached <hi>de alta proditione,</hi> that's all they plead of High
Treaſon in general, to out the Court of a Juriſdiction, of a particular Treaſon, for
framing a malitious trayterous Libel: And this is a particular Treaſon upon the
Statute of the 13<hi>th</hi> of this King. Now they have pleaded no particular Treaſon
upon that Statute they were Impeached for, nor upon the Statute of the 25<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>Edw.</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> which hath a general Clauſe of a Declaratory Power, and it may be he
was Impeached upon that, and we ſhall not intend it otherwiſe, that being the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Law, the other but a particular Law for this Kings Life. Now in all Pleas to
the Juriſdiction, they ought to be the ſtricteſt and moſt certain of any Pleas what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
And as I offered before to you, ſo I do now again, they ought to be ready
with the Record to juſtify their Plea; but this in ſhort I inſiſt upon, that to out a
Court of its Juriſdiction, for a particular Treaſon, 'tis not a good Plea, by ſaying
he was Impeached or Indicted generally of High Treaſon, and no Averment can
poſſibly help it. For it appears by the Impeachment 'tis not for the ſame, and 'tis
rather to be intended that it was not, but the Impeachment being general, that they
went upon a Declaratory Power, in the Statute of the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> which
reſerves to them the Power of declaring Treaſon at large, and not upon that which
may be tryed here in an Inferiour Court upon a particular Statute. I ſay, my Lord,
they ought to have pleaded it certainly, which they having not done, 'tis Fatal; and
I pray your Judgment upon it, and I hope they are ready to make good their Plea.</p>

               <p>My Lord, That that we do ſay to it, is, That this Plea is neither
good in Matter nor Form, and if it had been pleaded never ſo formally, perhaps we
would have demurred to it: But as now it is pleaded, it is not Formal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we pray it may be over-ruled. The Exception we take to it in point of Form,
we think is Fatal; for there is no Man that pleads an Indictment or an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in another Court, but muſt ſet forth the Indictment in the Plea, which is not
done in this Caſe, and we take that to be fatal to it. For a Man that will plead <hi>auter
foitz acquit,</hi> muſt ſet forth the Indictment and all the Proceedings of the Court up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Indictment, this is the conſtant pleading in all Caſes, and particularly in
<hi>Vaux</hi>'s Caſe, the 4<hi>th</hi> Report; who ever will plead <hi>auter foitz acquit,</hi> muſt ſet forth
the Record, before it will require an Anſwer to be given to it.</p>

               <p>This is that we ſay, my Lord, We hope your Lordſhip, and
the Court in this Caſe, will not tye us up preſently to come and argue this Matter.
One thing I would mention, becauſe it hath been ſaid, there was never ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
I think to this Purpoſe; the Precedent of <hi>Elliot</hi>'s Caſe is very full in it,
Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, he never found that any Plea to the Juriſdiction did
require a Demurrer, but was over-ruled or allowed by the Court preſently; But
that Caſe is plain to the contrary upon that very Matter. It was an Indictment
brought againſt <hi>Elliot</hi> for ſome Miſdemeanours committed by him in the Houſe of
Commons, this being pleaded to the Juriſdiction of the Court, the <hi>Attorney General</hi>
at that time ſaid it was not to be received, that was the Matter he inſiſted on then,
that ſhould be rejected; but the Court did then, as you do now, over-rule the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi>
in it, and put him to demur.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Williams.</speaker>
               <p>Then, my Lord, here is a Precedent that Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath not
ſeen: Now for time, the Court in that Caſe did not tye the Counſel up to argue
the Plea preſently, but gave them time till the next Term. We ask not ſo hard a
thing of the Court, as ſo long a time in this Caſe, only here is a Man's Life in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
'tis indeed for Treaſon, and ſo it is of Conſequence to the King, and there is
alſo the Priviledg of Parliament conſequently concerned in it: What time your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and the Court ſhall think reaſonable for us to be ready in, we leave it to your
Lordſhip; we deſign not to delay at all, only we deſire a reaſonable time. Your
Lordſhip did in the Caſe of <hi>Plunket,</hi> give him time for his Tryal till next Term,
which is as high a Treaſon as this I am ſure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>You would have People think you have ſtrange meaſure in this Caſe,
that you have not the ſame time given to you that was given to <hi>Plunket;</hi> Pray conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
you object theſe things as tho the Court were hard upon you, to tye you up in
point of time. Is your Caſe like <hi>Plunket</hi>'s? pray give us leave to clear our Accounts
as we go along; he is brought from <hi>Ireland</hi> hither, is Indicted for what he did in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Kingdom, and it is by Law he is ſo Indicted indeed, but he being kept cloſe
Priſoner, and not knowing what time he ſhould be brought to a Tryal, he deſires
time to ſend for his Witneſſes, who are to be brought over to clear him of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
Could we in Juſtice deny it him, or could there be a ſhorter time than next
Term given him, when his Witneſſes are in another Kingdom, and it would be a
fortnight or three Weeks before, poſſibly, he could have his Witneſſes here? This I
mention, becauſe you will needs make uſe of ſuch a Caſe, that is no more like yours
than any thing that is the fartheſt different from it, yet you will have the Caſe to
meaſure with your Caſe.</p>

your Lordſhip did what was juſt for <hi>Plunket,</hi> to you will to this Perſon, I know
you will do what is right to every Body. We are Counſel aſſigned by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

Plea, ſo as to be able to maintain it, when they come to plead it here; for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we gave him time to plead it, ſo as he would ſtand by it. What needed we elſe
to have aſſigned him ſo much Counſel in ſuch a Caſe as this is, but that he ſhould be
ready? and why you ſhould now hope that we will give you a longer time for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſuch a Caſe, I ſee not. Conſider, whether in Diſcretion you think longer
time ought to be expected upon ſuch a Plea as this is.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> Fra. Win.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we will not take upon us to preſcribe, nor to mention
any time in particular, we leave that to the Diſcretion and Judgment of the Court,
but this I think, we may pray according to the Duty we owe to our Client, upon
your Lordſhip's aſſigning us of Counſel. We could not foreſee till to day, what the
King's Counſel would do, whether Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> would take Iſſue upon us of <hi>null
tiel Record,</hi> or upon any of our Averments. We could not foreſee, whether he
would demur to us or not. I know your Lordſhip will be as favourable to us as you
can, not having thoſe Papers or ſight of thoſe Records that were neceſſary, and
would have expedited this Matter, our time was all ſpent in forming of the Plea;
and we could not prepare particular Matter in Law to defend it. We are as ready
as can be expected, and we have been as induſtrious to prevent any delay, as any
Perſons could be in our Condition: Therefore it may be, we have had a general
Conſideration of the Plea, but now we ſee where the doubts do lye upon it: 'Tis
a Matter of Law pleaded to the Juriſdiction of the Court. I do not indeed love to
cite Precedents upon what is plain, but withal, I do not love to ſay things upon a
ſudden are plain, without Conſideration: But this I will ſay, as 'tis now upon this
Demurrer joyned, it is a Caſe well worth our taking care of, and yours too, I muſt
ſay it with your Lordſhips leave. Therefore, if in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi>
which was but upon an Information, and that but for a Miſdemeanour, and tho it was
a Plea directly to the Juriſdiction of the Court, and certainly they came prepared, for
they were all at Liberty, and had reſort to all Papers and Books before the Plea
pleaded, which we could not have, yet the Court was pleaſed to aſſign them time,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49318:13"/>
and give them a large time, I hope we ſhall have ſome reaſonable time. I do not
ſpeak it that we ſhould have ſo long time; but I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip,
that we may do our Duty to the Court and to our Client, that we may have a
little time. It is true it is a great and a horrid Treaſon, but it is as true here is
the Life of a Man concerned in it; we do not affect delay at all, but hope you will
not deny us what time is reaſonable.</p>

to the Treaſon, then we could have given you time to have ſpoken to it, and
not delayed the King at all; but you have thought fit not to plead over. I muſt
confeſs, I did expect you would have pleaded over, as you might have done, and
I thought you would. Therefore having not done it, it is in our Conſideration,
whether we will give you time, and what time we will give you.</p>

               <p>It is under your Lordſhips Favour, according to the uſual courſe of
modern Practice. I have been an unprofitable Attendant here near forty years, and
for my part, I did never yet ſee ſo ſwift a Proceeding as this is now, it is as ſwift
as Lightning: It is a very extraordinary thing, we might well conceive, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ſhould be expected from us, than what is uſual, and that we ſhould not
be put out of the ordinary Proceedings; antiently indeed, as your Lordſhip did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the other day, they pleaded <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> and then the Proceedings were very
quick; now indeed it is otherwiſe, modern, and what we may call antient Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
too, hath made an Alteration from that Method: And we humbly pray, we
may not proceed, but according to the rate of modern Practice. My Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they are pleaſed to call it a frivolous Plea, I believe it is a Plea of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that ever theſe Gentlemen came here about, whatſoever they are pleaſed to
ſay. But your Lordſhip knows, the Life of a Man is the greateſt Favourite in Law,
and that to be a moſt antient and wiſe Rule, <hi>de morte hominis nulla eſt cunctatio longa.</hi>
And ſince we could not reaſonably expect to be thought to come provided in this
Caſe; we humbly pray, that your Lordſhip will allot us ſuch a reaſonable time, as
your Lordſhip ſhall think fit.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I will give you an Anſwer to that, we cannot do it.
When we were together, we did conſider, whether if we ſhould plead over, it would
not deſtroy the Plea, and we were of Opinion that it would deſtroy the Plea; we
cannot plead over but we give up the Juriſdiction. It is as indifferent and light to me
as any Body, to be forced to argue it now; but as to the Matter of it, I believe, no
Body can ſay, they ever ſaw many Inſtances of the like Nature: Therefore, pray my
Lord, let us not go on ſo haſtily with it, for we could not foreſee, what ſince we
know, how it would be with us. I did not think they would have demurred, but
now 'tis come to that we muſt make the beſt of it. We have pleaded this Plea; if
you will not be pleaſed to give us leave and time to be prepared to argue it, you
muſt take it as we are able, ſince we can't have time to make our ſelves
able.</p>

               <p>Certainly, Mr. <hi>Pollexfen,</hi> in <hi>favorem Vitae,</hi> it would not hurt the

               <p>My Lord, If your Lordſhip pleaſe to favour me a Word
in this Caſe, I hear ſeveral things urged, particularly inſtancing in modern
Practice. If that Gentlemen will ſhew that in any Caſe the King and the
Court were ſo Indulgent to give four days to plead to the Juriſdiction of
the Court, then he will ſhew me ſome thing of modern Practice which
I know not, but if that Gentlemen will remember modern Practice in a
great Nobleman's Caſe, for whom he was of Counſel; it was told
him, If he would debate the Point of Law, he muſt do it preſently:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49318:14"/>
They never would give him time to prepare for his Argument, there was no ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Practice then. I would deſire him to give me one Inſtance, that when Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are aſſigned of Counſel to plead a Matter to the Juriſdiction, and deal ſo with
the King's Counſel as they have dealt with us, not to let us ſee the Plea till now, the
modern Practice hath been to give them any time. For them to ſay that they could
not foreſee what we would be at: Could they not foreſee the Points of Law? Could
they not foreſee a plain Caſe? But they do not take off the great Matter that he that
doth plead to the Juriſdiction, ought to have the Record ready in his Hand; but my
Lord, we lay our Thumb upon that which is our Exception, they have pleaded no
Impeachment of any Crime, that can appear to be the ſame with that for which they
are indicted, that is the Point. Is there ſuch difficulty? did not theſe learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
think. Could they not foreſee that we ſhould look into their Plea, that it
ſhould be legal, therefore I did and do pray your Judgment? If they had pleaded and
ſet forth the Record truly, as it is and as it ought to be ſet forth, in caſe they would
have any benefit by it, we would have given them another Anſwer; but if it be
done purpoſely, as it is done with Artifice, I am bold to ſay, for theſe Gentlemen
know how to plead a Record as it ought to be, and how this ought to be pleaded to,
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o out the Court of a Juriſdiction of a particular Crime. they ſay, the Life of a
Man is concerned, and ſo is the Peace of the Kingdom concerned too in the Life of as
great a Traitor as ever was tried in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall.</hi> For if his Treaſon had taken
effect, certainly the Kingdom had been very near embroyled in civil Wars by this
time. Therefore the whole Peace of the Kingdom depends upon his Life, and it
depends upon the clearing of the whole Matter. And I challenge them again, if they
can ſhew me any Inſtance of the like Nature. That of <hi>Elliot</hi>'s Caſe that was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
it was an Information; and to Pleas upon Informations there have been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrers,
but to Indictments found by twelve Men, we do not meet with any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer
any where to a Plea to the Juriſdiction. But I pray your Judgment, that
he may plead in Chief, for 'tis but a <hi>Reſpondes ouſter,</hi> and if theſe Gentlemen deſire
to take time, I hope you will not delay the King by giving Countenance to ſuch a
plain imperfect Plea, and for thoſe high Matters they talk of, that will be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
they can never come in queſtion upon this Plea.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have but one ſhort word to that which is now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
Our Exceptions to the Plea we offered and opened before: the Queſtion is
now, whether they ſhall have time to argue this Plea; And the Arguments they
uſe for longer time, is, the Life of a Man, and they could not be prepared on a
ſudden; becauſe they knew not what we would do. For the haſty proceedings that
have been in this Caſe, which they clamor of, I think they have little reaſon to ſpeak
ſo, ſince that hath been done in this Caſe, that never was done in any other. He
hath had three days time to conſider, whether he will plead to the Juriſdiction of the
Court, which never was done to any, and ſo great a Favour, that he is ſcarce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
to any farther Favour: Does any Man believe that they are not prepared?
Do not Gentlemen when they conſider of a Plea, conſider upon what Grounds they
Plead? And does not that let them into the whole Matter where the weak parts of
the Plea are, and what may be objected againſt it. I am ſure that theſe Gentlemen
are of that Conſideration, that no Man does believe they would put in this or any
Plea, without having conſidered before-hand what to do. And then, when they
have put in a Plea upon great Conſideration, no Man is to think that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to maintain it. Our Exception is ſhort, and they do but talk in general Terms
that they are unprepared, and they have no reaſon to expect this Kindneſs from the
Court; eſpecially ſince they uſed Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> at this rate, they gave him not the
Plea, but only a Note, to tell him they would do that which they ſaid four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and no more; if they had done regularly, they ſhould have brought
Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> the Plea, and left a Copy with him, and deſired him to conſider of
it. But we do not pretend we are ſurprized for all this Uſage, we ſee the
Plea here, and we ſee the Faults of it, and we have demurred to it, and tell
them our Exception, ſure they are better prepared than 'tis poſſible for the
King to be, yet we are ready; and we hope you will grant them no longer
time.</p>

               <p>Will your Lordſhip be pleaſed to ſpare me one Word, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at what Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> ſeems now to urge, concerning the Life of a Man that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Caſe; 'tis true the Life of a Man is concerned, which is a dear thing
to the Law; but certainly the Life of the Government is more dear to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all Courts of Juſtice, than the Life of any one ſingle Perſon. And I am ſure,
this one Perſon hath done as much as in him lies, to ſtrike at the Life of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in caſe this be true, that is laid to his Charge. Now to make this Caſe like
to <hi>Plunket</hi>'s the other day, is ſtrange, I think your Lordſhip hath given an account
of that. For hath he pleaded to the Fact, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> as <hi>Plunket</hi> did? We that are
of the King's Counſel, would in common Charity hope, that he is not Guilty; but
I am ſure, if he be Guilty, no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man can think that he deſerves to live; why
then ſhould we be ſo fond of a Man's Life, that hath been Guilty of ſuch a Fact as
this? For Example ſake, ſurely, if that be the thing in queſtion, we ought to have
ſpeedy Juſtice executed upon a Man that deſerves no Mercy. Your Lordſhip was
pleaſed to take notice of another Circumſtance in the Caſe of <hi>Plunket:</hi> He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
he was Arraigned, and was to have had his Tryal in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was to
fetch his Witneſſes from thence; all theſe things were in that Caſe. He deſired
time to conſider what he ſhould plead, but your Lordſhip finding an Indictment
found againſt him, according to the Rules of Juſtice, over-ruled that matter he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
and made him plead <hi>Not Guily</hi> before ever you admitted him to debate any
thing of that Fact. And then it appearing to your Lordſhip to be in another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and that it was impoſſible, in regard of the hazards of the Winds, and Seas,
to get over his Witneſſes in a little time; your Lordſhip gave him time, but you
gave him as ſtrait a time, as could be conſiſtent with the Rules of Juſtice, and as his
Caſe would bear. Now, my Lord, this being offered in a Caſe of that expectation,
which the Caſe before you ſeems to have; We deſire the diſpatch of it, as much as
we can. In caſe the Man be Innocent, God forbid but he ſhould be acquitted; but
if he be Guilty, God forbid he ſhould live a Minute.</p>

               <p>Surely you don't take the Caſe, Gentlemen, to be a Caſe of ſo much
Difficulty, as to deſerve long Conſideration; we did expect truly, that you would
have been ready to have maitained your Plea.</p>

               <p>'Tis ſaid, 'tis in a Caſe wherein the Life of a Man is concerned, 'tis
true here is the Life a Man, of whom till he be found Guilty, we ought to have
Conſideration, as we would of any other whatſoever. For we have no reaſon to
conclude him Guilty, till we hear him, and we are to be indifferent till we hear the
Evidence, therefore notwithſtanding the Indictment, we ought to weigh his Life
as we would another Man's, till he be found Guilty. We in our ſelves, do not ſee
there is any ſo great matter of Neceſſity, for time to conſider of this Caſe, yet I muſt
tell you, ſince they pray it, Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> we are inclineable to give them a day or
two's time to conſider of it, and ſee what they can ſay to maintain this Plea. But
then, Gentlemen, if we do ſo, you muſt take notice, we will call you to plead
preſently after our Judgment upon the Plea.</p>

but the <hi>ſubjecta materiae,</hi> upon the deciſion of it, ſuppoſing Judgment be againſt the
Plea. Therefore, Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> we do think fit to give him till <hi>Friday</hi> Morning,
and he ſhall be brought hither then again by the Lieutenant of the Tower; then we
will hear theſe Gentlemen: and if they do not ſhew us any conſiderable Matter to

for this Matter, for we are all of us to be by and by with all the Judges in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
Chamber; therefore we pray this of you, we will abridge no Man's ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Attor. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>That is the reaſon, my Lord, why I would lay my Finger upon
thoſe Points, that will be the Queſtions between us. Now the Exceptions I take
to the Plea, are theſe; This is a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Court, and ſome of
our Exceptions are to the Form, and one is to the Matter. To the Form, my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are theſe; Firſt, we ſay, that the general Allegation, that he was Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>de Alta Proditione,</hi> is uncertain, and too general, It ought to have been parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
ſet out, that the Court might judg, whether it be the ſame Crime; and it is
not helped by the Averment. And the next Exception I take to it, is, here is no
Impeachment alledged to be upon Record, I mentioned this the laſt time, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more ſtrictly into it, I find, 'tis ſo as I ſaid: For they come and make a general
Allegation, that <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> ſuch a time, was Impeached, <hi>Impetitus fuit,</hi> by the
Commons, before the Lords, <hi>Quae quidem Impetitio in pleno robore exiſtit prout per
Recordum inde,</hi> &amp;c. Now, my Lord, there is no Impeachment mentioned before:
And <hi>quae quidem Impetitio,</hi> is a Relative Clauſe, and if there be no Impeachment
mentioned before in the Plea, then there is nothing averred upon the Record, to be
continued or diſcontinued, for <hi>Impetitio,</hi> does not actively ſignify the Impeaching,
or paſſively the Perſon Impeached, but it ſignifies the Indictment or Impeachment,
that Inſtrument which contains the Accuſation, and which is to be and remain upon
Record. Therefore, when they come and ſay, he was Impeached, and afterwards
alledg, <hi>Quae quidem Impetitio</hi> remains upon Record, that cannot be good; If a
Plea ſhould be <hi>Indictatus fuit,</hi> and afterwards they ſay <hi>quod quidem Indictamentum,</hi> &amp;c.
It cannot be good, for the Relative there is only illuſive. Theſe are our Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Form. For the Matter of it, 'tis a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Court,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49318:16"/>
and with ſubmiſſion there the Point will be, whether a Suit depending, even in a
Superior Court, can take away the Juriſdiction of an Inferior Court, who had an
Original Juriſdiction of the Cauſe, of the Perſon, and of the Fact, at the time of
the Fact committed. What uſe might be made of it, as a Plea, in Bar, might be of
another Conſideration, but whether this be enough to make it amount to ſuch a
Plea, as will take away the Juriſdiction of a Court, that had an Original Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
that's the Queſtion before you. Theſe are the Exceptions I take, and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon: And I deſire, my Lord, the Counſel will apply themſelves to theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
to anſwer them, and when we have heard what they can ſay, I hope to
give them an Anſwer.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I am aſſigned of Counſel for the Priſoner at the Bar,
<hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> who is Indicted here for High Treaſon, and hath pleaded a
ſpecial Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Court: And I muſt crave leave to ſtate his
Caſe upon the Indictment, the Plea to the Indictment, and the Demurrer to the
Plea. And the Caſe, my Lord, upon the whole Record ſtands thus: He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
this Term, by one of the Grand Jurie's for this County, of High Treaſon.
As to the Indictment, it cannot be expected I ſhould ſtate the Parts of it, it being
an Indictment I never ſaw; To this Indictment thus preſented, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> hath
pleaded thus: That he ought not to be compelled to anſwer to this Indictment,
becauſe, that before the Indictment was found, at a Parliament held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the
21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>March</hi> laſt, he was impeached by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, of
the Houſe of Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, in the Name of themſelves, and
of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> of High Treaſon; and that this was before the
Court of Lords in that Parliament. He ſays further, that this Impeachment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in full force, and effect, before the Lords in Parliament, <hi>prout per Recordum
inde int' Record. Parliamenti remanens plenuis liquet &amp; apparet.</hi> Theſe are the Words
of the Plea: And then he avers, that the High Treaſon mentioned in the Indictment,
and the High Treaſon ſpecified in the Impeachment, are one and the ſame. And
he further avers, that he is the ſame <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> named in that Indictment, and
mentioned in the Impeachment. And after the Averments, he concludes, to the
Juriſdiction of the Court; Whether upon all this Matter, they will proceed any
further againſt him, upon this Indictment, and demands the Judgment of the Court
to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Plea Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath demurred generally, and we that are of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
for the Priſoner, have joyned in Demurrer with him. Now in this Caſe, which
thus comes before you, for your Judgment upon this Plea and this Demurrer, I
take theſe things to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Priſoner ſtands Impeached, by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Aſſembled, of High Treaſon. Secondly, That the Impeachment thus made
by the Commons, in the Name of themſelves, and of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi>
before the Lords in Parliament for Treaſon, is now in being. Thirdly, Which I
omitted in the opening of the Plea, that this was done <hi>ſed in Legem &amp; Conſ. Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi>
and being ſo, remains in <hi>plenis ſuis Robore &amp; Effectu;</hi> And more particularly
this Plea does refer to the Record, for the Parts and Circumſtances of the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>prout patet per Record inde inter,</hi> &amp;c. So that it does refer the Impeachment
it ſelf to the Record, and tells you this is among the other Records of that Parliament,
all this is admitted by the Plea. Fourthly, And moreover, that this Treaſon, for
which he ſtands Impeached before the Lords, and the Treaſon for which he ſtands
Indicted before this Court, are one and the ſame Treaſon, and no way diverſe, and
ſo they are the ſame numerical thing, and there is no manner of Difference. And
that this Perſon <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> now Indicted, and the <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> In peached, are
one and the ſame Perſon, and no way diverſe. And withal, my Lord, it appears
plainly upon the Record, that this Impeachment was depending before: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
found for the Parliament was the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and it appears by the
Record, this is only an Indictment of this Term. And another thing I muſt entreat
you to obſerve, my Lord, it does not appear but that this Parliament is ſtill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for any thing to the contrary in the Record, and as I take the Caſe, then it
muſt be admitted ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49318:16"/>
So then I take the Plea to be in ſubſtance thus, though Mr. Attorney was
pleaſed to except to both the ſubſtance and the form; but in ſubſtance the
Caſe is thus: Here is a Perſon Impeached in Parliament, by the Commons in
Parliament for High Treaſon, before the Lords in Parliament; and for
ought appears that Parliament ſtill in being, and this impeachment ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending:
Then here is an Indictment for that very Treaſon; whether your
Lordſhip now will think fit in this Court to proceed upon that Indictment is
the ſubſtance of the Caſe; I ſhall ſpeak to the form, by and by.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, by the way I think it will not be denyed, but that the Commons
in Parliament, may Impeach any Commoner of Treaſon before the Lords in
Parliament, I take that to be admitted. And I do not find that Mr. Attorney
denys it or makes any doubt of that, for I think that was the Caſe of <hi>Treſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and <hi>Belknapp,</hi> who were Impeached in Parliament, by the Commons before
the Lords: I am ſure my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aughan</hi> does in his Reports in
<hi>Buſhell</hi>'s Caſe ſay ſo; and upon that Impeachment of the Commons one of
them was executed, and the other baniſhed in Parliament. My Lord, I cite
it not merily, but I cite it as Authority. Indeed I do not go ſo far as to cite
the Parliament Roll, it was in the time of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2. I have not ſeen the Roll of
late truly, but I am ſure 'tis upon the Roll, and there 'tis to be found.</p>
                  <p>Since then Impeachments of Commoners will lye in Parliament, here then
My Lord, will be the Queſtion, whether this Court may proceed upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
for the ſame offence the Parliament was for. And here I ſhall diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
upon Mr. Attorney; he does allow the Parliament to be a ſuperior Court,
but admitting that he ſays, though it be ſo, yet the inferiour Court having
Original Juriſdiction of the Perſon and the Cauſe, it may proceed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
an Indictment in the Superior Court: And <hi>Ergo,</hi> he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does inferr
that this Court may proceed upon an Indictment, notwithſtanding an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I will compare a little the Caſe of an Indictment and an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſhew you how manifeſtly they differ. I do take the Caſe of an
Impeachment not to be the Caſe of an Indictment; and ſo the Principle that
Mr. Attorney hath taken is wrong, and the ground of that Argument wrong.
I cannot ſay 'tis like the Caſe of an Appeal, but I may ſay the Caſe of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
is like the Caſe of an Impeachment. For in an Appeal of Murder, though
the Indictment be Capital and the ſame that is given upon Criminals proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for the King, yet it is at the ſuit of the party, as in this Caſe 'tis at the
ſuit of the Commons, and ſo 'tis an intimation of, and Analogical to, and
bears the reſemblance of an Impeachment in Parliament; I will not compare
an Impeachment to an Appeal, but I will ſay an Appeal imitates an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And 'tis as plain as can be, becauſe Appeals are proper to Courts in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and 'tis at the ſuit of the party, the Proſecution and all the
Proceſs is <hi>ad inſtantiam partis,</hi> ſo is an Impeachment at the ſuit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
An Indictment is found upon the preſentment of a Grand Jury who are
Sworn <hi>ad inquirendum pro Domino Rege pro Corpore Com.</hi> And 'tis a miſtake in
the form when 'tis ſaid <hi>&amp; pro Corpore Com.</hi> for it is not for the King and the
body of the County, but for the King for the body of the County: But now an
Impeachment in Parliament is otherwiſe, 'tis not in the Name of the King, but
in the Name of the Commons in Parliament and of all the Commons in <hi>England,</hi>
wherein it ſuites with an Appeal which is at the ſuit of the party, ſo that 'tis
like an Appeal and not like an Indictment: an Indictment is for the King, an
Impeachment for the people. And as it is in its nature and conſtitution diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
ſo 'tis in the proſecution alſo, for that is by the Commons of <hi>England,</hi>
they are the proſecutors in effect, but now in all Indictments they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
always by the Kings Attorney, or by ſome perſon in the name of the
King. We are now arguing upon the Methods and forms of Parliament,
therefore I muſt crave leave to inſiſt upon thoſe Methods more particularly.
The Commons they bring up the Impeachment to the Lords, the Commons
they proſecute the Impeachment, they manage the Evidence upon the Tryal,
and when the Lords have conſidered of it, and have found the fact, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49318:17"/>
come and demand Judgment, and Judgment is given at the Prayer of
the Commons, and no otherwiſe, and there are no proceedings by the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.
Indeed there have been attempts by Attorneys to proſecute perſons in
Parliament, by exhibiting Informations in the Parliament, but what ſucceſs
they have had I leave to them to conſider that are concerned, and have read
the Rolls of Parliament. But it is not ſafe to alter the old ways of Parliament;
therefore I take it under Correction, that it is out of the road of Compariſons,
when they will compare an Indictment and an Impeachment together, for
they do not agree but differ extreamly.</p>
                  <p>I would then offer you ſome reaſons why this Court ought not to proceed upon
this Indictment: I take it, it does not become the Juſtice of this Court to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Methods of proceedings in Parliament, as this Court will certainly do.
For if you will admit this to be the courſe that I have open'd, your proceedings
will alter it. When there is an Impeachment depending in Parliament for
Treaſon, if your Lordſhips will admit there may be an Indictment here after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in this Court, and proceedings in this Court upon that Indictment, 'tis
to alter the Method of Parliament proceedings, and to ſubject the Method of
their proceedings there to the proceedings of this Court. And what the
Miſchief of that will be, I muſt leave to your Lordſhip. As I open'd it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Methods of both Courts are different, and their proceedings very
much vary, I think I need not trouble your Lordſhip with that, We all know
it very well in the main. Indictments in this Court are to be tryed by a Jury,
where a Verdict muſt be given preſently. There is but very little time for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Evidence, or for making Obſervations for the Crown, or for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and in order to bring it to the Tryal, there muſt be an immediate Plea
of <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> Now if the proceedings of Parliament were ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
there might be a great ſurprize, and great offenders paſs unpuniſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Proſecutors had not greater time to inſpect the Records that might
be of avail in the Caſe. Therefore in Parliament 'tis quite otherwiſe, there
is time for Deliberation and Conſideration, there are many references, and
many Examinations, which are matters of Deliberation, and Conſideration,
which take up a great deal of time: But here you are ſtraitned not only
in time, but bound up to ſtrict Rules, and ſo are ſtraitned in your Methods
and forms of proceedings, as Mr. Attorney would here tye us up to the forms
of little Courts; but it is not fit that the Juſtice of the Kingdom and the high
Court of Parliament ſhould be crampt by the Methods of an Inferior Court
and a Jury. So you will then ſubject the Methods of proceedings in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and what the Conſequence of that will
be is worth the conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon I would humbly offer is this, My Lord, the Parliament is the
Supream Court certainly, and this Court is every way inferior to it, and it will
be very ſtrange that that Supream Court ſhould be hindred by an inferior: For
the Higheſt Court is always ſuppoſed to be the wiſeſt, the Commons of <hi>England</hi>
in Parliament are ſuppoſed to be a greater and a wiſer body than a Grand
Jury of any one County. The Peers who are the Judges in that Court are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be the wiſeſt Judges, as the Commons the wiſeſt Inqueſt. Will the Law
of <hi>England</hi> now ſuffer an Examination, Impeachment and Proſecution for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be taken out of the hands of the greateſt and wiſeſt Inqueſt in <hi>England?</hi>
And will the Law of <hi>England</hi> ſuffer the Judicature upon this Proſecution to be
taken out of the hands of the wiſeſt and greateſt Judicature, and put it into
the power of a ſmaller Number of Judges, or of an inferior Jury? I do think
it does not ſtand, My Lord, with the wiſdom of the Law or of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Government.</p>
                  <p>Another thing is this, My Lord, the common argument in any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Caſe, there is no Precedent for this way of proceeding: 'tis my Lord <hi>Cokes</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Comment upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> fol. 108. and in the 4th. Inſt. <hi>fol.</hi> 17. in
his Comment upon the High Court of Parliament. And he takes occaſion to
ſpeak it upon the account of that Precedent, the Caſe of the Indictment againſt
the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and of that againſt Mr. <hi>Plowden,</hi> and he ſays this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49318:17"/>
wus never practiſed before. Therefore it ought not to be, ſo he infers, and
puts a black mark upon it, by ſaying 'tis a dangerous attempt for inferiour
Courts to alter or meddle with the Law of Parliaments; for the words I refer
my ſelf to the Book, I dare not venture to repeat them upon my memory.
So in this caſe, in regard that it never was done from the beginning of the world
till now, the 33 year of this King, I may ſay, it being without Precedent, there
is no Law for it.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, there is another miſchief that will certainly follow upon this,
and that too runs upon the Compariſon of an Appeal and of an Indictment.
In the Caſe of an Indictment 'tis in the power of the Prince to pardon that
Indictment, to pardon the puniſhment, and to pardon the offence, but in the
Caſe of an Impeachment, I take it to be otherwiſe, as 'tis in the Caſe of an
Appeal. And My Lord, if your Lordſhip will take this Caſe out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Parliament, and bring it into this Court where the offence may be
pardoned, You do by that means ſubject that offence, and that method of
proceedings which would make it without conſent of the party proſecuting,
not pardonable by Law, to a Pardon: and this may be of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the publick, that crimes that are heinous and great in themſelves,
mighty bulky crimes, fit for the conſideration of a Parliament, be they never
ſo great, never ſo dangerous to the Government, yet ſhould by giving this
Court a juriſdiction, and poſſeſſing it of theſe cauſes, expoſe them to the
will of the Prince; and ſo thoſe crimes which are impardonable by methods of
proceedings in Parliament, would become pardonable by proſecution in this
Court.</p>
                  <p>Now My Lord, for my Authority, that Impeachments are not pardonable,
I would only hint a little, to compare it to the Caſe of an Appeal, as <hi>Peuryn</hi>
and <hi>Corbett</hi>'s Caſe in 3 <hi>Croke, Hill.</hi> 38 <hi>Eliz. fol.</hi> 464. There was an Appeal
of Murder; upon which he is found Guilty of Man-ſlaughter, and Not Guilty
of the Murder. Then there was a Pardon pleaded of the burning in the hand,
or of the puniſhment; it is not plain in the Book whether the Pardon was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Verdict or before (that I can't be clear in) but however there was a
queſtion whether the Queen could pardon the burning in the hand, however
it was there allowed, but there was an exception. My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> who was
then Attorney General, took, that the King could not pardon if it had been
an Appeal of homicide, and he concurr'd with the Court in that opinion:
but that Appeal being for Murder, and the Verdict of Man-ſlaughter, they
paſſed over the queſtion for this reaſon that I have mentioned, That the appeal
was not for Man-ſlaughter, it was for Murder, and if he had been found guilty
of the Murder, it was not in the power of the King to pardon him, it being
at the ſuit of the party. So the opinion of that Book is, and of the then At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
General.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſtated the thing, and the conſequences of it, and it is not fit
for me to dwell upon it: You will conſider of it I am ſure.</p>
                  <p>Another thing I would ſay is this, if your Lordſhip ſhould meddle with
this way of proceeding, it will invert the Law in another thing; for 'tis a
principle with us, That no mans life is to be put twice in danger for one and
the ſame thing: I will then put the Caſe thus, If your Lordſhip ſhould proceed
upon this Indictment, and this perſon ſhould be acquitted upon it, I am in your
Lordſhips judgement whether that acquittal will bind the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
if that will not bind them, but they may ſtill proceed on the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then you invade that common right which every Engliſh-man by the
Law ought to have preſerved to him, that no perſon ought twice to be brought
in queſtion for one and the ſame thing: And ſo, My Lord, you make a man
to run the riſque of his life twice by Indicting him in this Court, where,
though he be acquitted, he may be called to an account again, if the Law be
ſo. And if the Lords in Parliament ſhould be of opinion, for they are the Judges
of that Caſe, that the acquittal will not be binding to them, then a mans life
is brought in queſtion twice upon the ſame account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49318:18"/>
My Lord, I now come to this, the Time, how unſeaſonable a thing it is,
and how dangerous to the Government; I take it to be a critical thing now at
this time to make ſuch attempts as theſe are. There are Lords now that lye
under Impeachments of Treaſon, the higheſt Treaſon I think that ever was
contrived; and upon this Impeachment one Lord hath been convicted and
executed. Suppoſe upon the diſſolution of that Parliament that impeached
the late Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> there had been an Indictment againſt him for one and
the ſame Treaſon; and by the ſame reaſon that this Court may proceed, his
Majeſty may appoint a High Steward to try by a Jury of Peers: For the
Court held before the High Steward is as much a Court as any Court of the
Kingdome, except that of Parliament. I ſay, ſuppoſe the King had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an High Steward, and that Lord High Steward had proceeded againſt my
Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> I think my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had been alive at this day. For in
the caſe of Treaſon your Lordſhip knows there muſt be two Witneſſes, and I
am ſure there came in freſh Teſtimony againſt my L. <hi>Stafford</hi> after the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
after the Impeachment. I appeal to thoſe Noble Lords that are here
if it were not ſo; and had it not been for that freſh Teſtimony that came in
afterwards, poſſibly my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> might have been alive at this time.
And the Lords in Parliament, as I obſerved in the beginning, when they find
an high crime before them, when they find ſuch a general contagious deſign to
ſubvert the Government, and yet they cannot come to cut off the principal
agents in this deſign, becauſe perhaps there may not be two Witneſſes in
ſtrictneſs of the Law at the firſt, 'tis the wiſdome of a Parliament to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and to take time. The good Queen who was uſed to ſay, Truth was the
daughter of Time, and Time would produce Truth, <hi>Veritas filia temporis.</hi> If
then there had been any any ſuch haſty proceedings as in this Caſe, I doubt
my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had been now alive. Now then for theſe Lords that are
now in the <hi>Tower,</hi> if your Lordſhips do go on in this way, do you not open
ſuch a gap as may be a ground to deliver them by the ſame Juſtice (I ſpeak it
under correction here, and I only offer it to your judgement, for I have not
had many hours to conſider of it, but your Lordſhip will think well of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you give any Judgement; by the ſame Juſtice) the other Lords may be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by another Court? This I offer in point of reaſon, that this proceeding
will be very hard, and is an imprudent thing, if not an illegal proceeding. My
Lord, I am ſure it will have this effect, it will ſtir up a queſtion between the
juriſdiction of this Court, and the Court of Parliament. For in all probability
if this perſon ſhould be acquitted, the Commons and the Lords too will look
into it. They are a Court that make a ſurvey of the proceedings of all other
Courts, and they will examine this proceeding, or at leaſt may do. And if he
be found Guilty, here is the power of the Commons in Impeaching, and the
Juriſdiction of the Lords in Tryal and Judgement taken away by an Inferiour
Court to them, and ſo ſtir a queſtion between this Court, and that higheſt of
Courts, the Parliament. And what will be the conſequence of that, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that queſtion will be in the Superiour Court, for there is no middle
Court between this Court and the Parliament to judge of it. Therefore I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to your Lordſhips.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the things which I offer to your Lordſhip in point of reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome go to the prudence of the thing, ſome to the reaſon, and ſome to the
ill conſequences that may happen upon it, and I think many to the illegality
of the act. And now this being ſaid in the general, I come to the particular
exceptions made by Mr. Attorney as to the form of our Plea.</p>
                  <p>He was pleaſed to ſay, That this Plea was a plain frivolous Plea, which is his
exception in general, and he gave you three reaſons for it at firſt, and does
now inſiſt upon the ſame for ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>One was this, and he inſiſted upon it at this time, This Plea does not ſet
forth any Record of an Impeachment, nor the particular matter of it, ſo
as this Court may judge of the reaſon of it, and he compares it to the Caſe of
a Plea of <hi>auter foitz acquit.</hi> If a man hath been Indicted and acquitted, he
may plead it in another Court that hath Juriſdiction of the cauſe, if he be again
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49318:18"/>
Indicted for the ſame matter, but My Lord, firſt of all I take this Plea to be
well pleaded in form, and in the ſecond place, if there be any informality or
defect (which I do not take it that there is, but if there were any ſuch thing)
I take it 'tis of another conſideration, which the Court will deliberate before
they give their Judgement on.</p>
                  <p>But I ſay in the firſt place, I take it to be a very good Plea, and that it is
good according to the pleading of <hi>auter foitz acquit.</hi> In pleading of a general
Act of Parliament, we need not ſet forth the whole Act, but referr to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and that will depend upon the Method of Impeachments in Parliament,
which I am of opinion being the General Law of Parliaments, this Court
ought to take Cognizance of. In the Caſe of <hi>auter foitz acquit,</hi> there is firſt an
Indictment, proceeding of the Court upon the Plea, a fair Tryal and a fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital;
and a Record of all this matter. If now this Perſon come to be Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
again for the ſame offence, there is a Record for him to plead that will
ſhew forth the whole matter, and if he does not plead that Record, 'tis his own
default. But in this Caſe here is no ſuch Record to plead, and there is the miſtake,
upon which Mr. Attorney hath gone all along. And you muſt in this Caſe
be governed by the Rules and Methods of Parliament, which is this, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in the name of themſelves, and of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
ſuch a perſon, and they bring up this Impeachment to the Lords in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and there they have Liberty to preſent Articles in due time after due
Conſideration, which ought not to be done haſtily. All this is no Record,
ſuch as may be had in the Caſe of <hi>auter foitz acquit;</hi> for firſt, the Impeachment of
the Commons is no Record, when 'tis brought up to the Lords, there is only
an entry into the Journal for the Lords, that ſuch a day, ſuch a perſon came
from the Houſe of Commons, and Impeached ſuch a one. And you are not
to expect the ſame ſtrict Method, and form of proceeding as in other Courts,
the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or inferior Courts. Your Lordſhip in this
Caſe, muſt be governed by ſuch a proceeding as is in Parliament. And muſt take
it as it is, and we have ſaid enough, and as much as can be in our Caſe. We have
not indeed ſet forth an Indictment, a Plea, a <hi>Venire facias, &amp;c.</hi> For there is no
ſuch proceeding in Parliament, but there was an Impeachment, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in the name of themſelves, and of all the Commons of <hi>England</hi> before the
Lords, that it is <hi>in pleno robore &amp; Effectu,</hi> and that it was <hi>ſecundum legem,
&amp; conſuetudinem Parliamenti, prout patet inde inter Recorda remanen. &amp;c.</hi> And here
is enough. For when we refer you to a Record; that is as much as if we had
ſet forth the Record it ſelf, for we tell you there is ſuch a Record, and we
point you to the place where you may find it. So we take it, 'tis a very full
Plea, and if not, 'tis as much as any man can plead in ſuch a Caſe, though it
be not pleaded particularly.</p>
                  <p>And My Lord, that your Lordſhip is to judge in this Caſe according to the
Methods of Parliament; I depend upon the authority of My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> I will
repeat you ſome of his words, ſpeaking of the Law of Parliaments, he ſays,
and he borrowed it out of <hi>Fleta:</hi> That this high Court of Parliament <hi>propriis
ſuis Legibus. <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> Et iſta lex ab omnibus quaerenda,
à multis ignorata, &amp; à paucis Cognita.</hi> But he tells you, and certainly he ſays
true in it: Who ever will be learned in the Law of Parliaments, muſt repair
to the Rolls of Parliament; and give me leave to cite his Opinion, which I
hope may be of great weight with this Court: It is in the fourth Inſtitutes, <hi>fol.</hi>
15. He ſays for any thing moved or done in the Houſe of Commons, it ought
to be determined, adjudged and diſcuſſed by the courſe of Parliament, and
not by the Civil Law, nor yet the Commons Laws of this Realm, uſed in more
inferior Courts, which was declared ſo to be <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem
Parliamenti,</hi> concerning the Peers, and the like <hi>pari ratione</hi> for the Commons,
and that ſtops this Court in our Caſe: For ſo it is ſaid in this Plea, which is the
matter you are to be governed by, that it is <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.</hi>
He tells you further there is no notice to be taken of any thing
ſaid or done in the Houſe of Commons, but by the Report of that Houſe,
and every member thereof hath a judicial place, he takes it out of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49318:19"/>
7th. and ſo the Book is expreſly: And he goes on, this is the reaſon that Judges
ought not to give any opinion of matters of Parliament; becauſe it is not to
be decided by the Commons Laws, but <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenti.</hi>
So he tells you, you are bound by the Methods of Parliament, and
I need not preſs the thing much after his authority, for he was learned in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
matters.</p>
                  <p>But I would crave leave to mention a Caſe that was lately in this Court,
and that was the Caſe of My Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> who was brought by Habeas-Corpus
to this Court, and upon that Habeas-Corpus, it was thus returned,
that he was committed by order of the Lords in Parliament; there to remain
during the pleaſure of the King, and of the Houſe of Lords. And this for an
high Contempt committed in that Houſe: Upon this return we inſiſted,
that My Lord might be bailed, becauſe it was uncertain, the pleaſure
of the King or the Houſe of Lords; and upon reading the Order there is no
Crime expreſſed, but only in general for an High Contempt. I ſpeak it not
for the particular Caſes ſake, but to apply the reaſon of it to our Caſe, the
reaſon then given by the Judges, Mr. <hi>Juſtice Jones</hi> will pleaſe to remember
it (for it was particularly declared by him) why they could not baile
My Lord, was this: He was pleaſed to ſay, we in this Court take notice of
the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and other Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and it would be
ſtrange, if we ſhould not take notice of the Courſe of Parliament, and
Houſe of Lords. And if you are bound ſo to do in other Caſes, you are bound
to do ſo in this: And if without pleading you take notice of the Courſe of
thoſe Courts, you will alſo take notice of the Law of Parliaments, and Cuſtoms
of Parliaments: and (that I may make uſe of it to our purpoſe in this
Caſe) we need not particularly ſay <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem Parliamenti in
hoc,</hi> inſtancing in this, and that, and t'other particular, but the Court is to look
into it, without my pointing to the particular Law of Parliament. So that
My Lord, here is ground enough before the Court, and I know the Court will
look into it before they give judgement.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Exception is this, that it is not ſaid in the body of the Plea,
that <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> is impeached for this Treaſon, but it comes in only in the
Averment. Now My Lord, as to that we muſt purſue the Impeachment as it
is in the Lords Journal: 'tis for Treaſon generally there, and 'tis ſaid to be
<hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem Parliamenti,</hi> which goes to all, and there is a
Record of it among the Records of Parliament, and Mr. Attorney hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
it by the Demurrer.</p>
                  <p>And that this is the ſame Treaſon we do Aver in fact, which alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by the Demurrer, and your Lordſhip will ſee by the Records and forrus
of Entries in Parliament, (that I may not repeat things over and over again) that
this is the Courſe, and Method of Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Attorney hath fancied an Exception of Grammar, an Adjective for a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive,
but I take it to be as well as any man can plead in this Caſe. For what
ſays the Priſoner? The Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
did Impeach me, which Impeachment is ſtill in force before the Lords.
I take it to be as plain as can be: If they did impeach me, then there was an
Impeachment; it can bear no other ſence.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, another Exception, and which was thought a ſtrong one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, and ſtrongly urged, is, that the King may chuſe his Court, and they
compared it with the other Courts, but there is the miſtake that runs all along in
this Caſe. 'Tis no doubt the King may choſe his Court for his own action and
ſuit, but the Impeachment is an Impeachment of the Commons, and their ſuit is to
be tryed no where elſe but in Parliament. And the Caſe that was the other day
cited by Mr. Attorney, for this purpoſe is true, of the perſon that was arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Treaſon, and had been Indicted and arraigned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he may be
arraigned and tryed here, there is no Queſtion of it; but to ſay therefore that this
is a Conſequence from that Rule, that therefore he will chuſe whether he will
proceed in Parliament upon the Commons Impeachment, and put a ſtop to the
proceeding of the Parliament, by proceeding in this Court, I take to be a great
<hi>Non ſequitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49318:19"/>
My Lord, I have offered theſe Reaſons, as to the form of the Plea to maintain
it. Now as to the Precedents, I would a little ſpeak what hath been done in
the like Caſe, where this Court hath taken hold of Cauſes, and the proſecution
of the Court hath been ſtop'd by Pleas to the Juriſdiction, and what hath been
done upon thoſe Pleas: What doom they have had, I will hint ſome of them
to you.</p>
                  <p>There was a Caſe mentioned by your Lordſhip the other day, the Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſters</hi> Caſe, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. I dare not ſay that I have looked upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Roll, but my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> tells us he hath recited the Record, <hi>de verbo in
verbum:</hi> in the 2. Inſtitutes, <hi>fol</hi> 15. there are all the proceedings, it was not an
Indictment, for my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> contradicts that, and ſays it was a declaration;
there the Record at large ſets forth, that the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> was attached to
anſwer the King, for that whereas at a Parliament held at <hi>Sarum,</hi> it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<hi>per ipſum Regem ne quis ad dom. Parliament. ſummonitus ab eodem recederet
ſine licentia Regis.</hi> And that this Biſhop in contempt of the King, <hi>receſſit</hi>
without leave of the King; I think 'tis rather an action than a Criminal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
what ſays the Biſhop to this? He comes and ſays, <hi>ſi quis deliquerit
erga Dominum Regem in Parliamento aliquo, in Parliamento debet corrigi &amp; emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari
&amp; non alibi in minore Curia quam in Parliamento,</hi> &amp;c. What becomes of
this Plea; 'tis ſtrange there ſhould be ſuch an Inhibition, that no man ſhould
depart without leave of the King, and the Biſhop be puniſhed for it, we do
not find any Judgement was given, nor would they venture to do it. My
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> hath a mark upon it, for this very reaſon it looked as if there was
a deſign to weaken the Parliaments, by bringing their proceedings into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall,</hi>
but they would not do it, they would give no judgment for the
King, but for ought appears the Plea ſtood.</p>
                  <p>Then there is the other Caſe of Mr. <hi>Plowden,</hi> and many more in <hi>primo &amp;
ſecundo Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> where a great many of them, ſome whereof were Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,
and they ſubmitted, but he did not. The Information there is this, that
theſe perſons were ſummoned to the Parliament, and departed from thence,
without the leave of the King and Queen, though it was prohibited by them
that any ſhould depart, moſt of them ſubmit to a Fine, and if it had reſted
there, it might have turned to the prejudice of the Commons as an example.
But Mr. <hi>Plowden,</hi> he pleads as one that underſtood himſelf, and the power of
Parliaments and their proceedings very well, and conſiders the time to have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, ſays he continued in the Parliament from the beginning to the end of
the Parliament, but he relies not there, but he brings a traverſe full of pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and if our Plea be faulty theirs was 100 times as faulty, <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> that he
the ſaid <hi>Edmond Plowden,</hi> the ſaid day and year, during the ſaid Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Licenſe of the ſaid King and Queen, and the Court aforeſaid, did contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
depart in Contempt of the ſaid King and Queen, and their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and inhibition, and to the great detriment of the Common-Weal and
State of this Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe things he pleads, which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
knows to be a very ill traverſe; and yet this Caſe continued all the time
of that Queen, and the Court would never give judgement in it. This was in
<hi>primo, &amp; ſecundo.</hi> and yet it appearing upon the face of the Information, that it
was a Caſe that concerned the Commons, the Court would not give judgement
for or againſt the Commons as long as the King and Queen lived.</p>
                  <p>There is a later Caſe, and that is <hi>Elliots</hi> Caſe 5 <hi>Car.</hi> there is an Information
againſt My Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> and many more: and there is a Plea put
in to the Juriſdiction of the Court; I have a Copy of My Lord <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Plea,
and 'tis in a manner as faulty as <hi>Plowdens</hi> Plea, but the Court in that Caſe does
go, not upon the inſufficiency of the Plea, but gives judgement generally that
this Court had a Juriſdiction, the aſſault happen'd in Parliament, and the
words were ſpoken there, and upon the Demurrer, they gave judgment upon
the whole matter; what became of that judgement? We know very well, it was
reverſed 19 of this King: And pray obſerve the proceedings in the reverſal
of that judgment. Judgment w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s given againſt My Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> and the reſt
of the Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, though there was no proſpect of a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49318:20"/>
Parliament, yet they were obſtinate and would not plead; for they thought the
judgment to be a very hard judgment, and this being a Plea in abatement, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was given for want of a Plea over. It may fall out in this Caſe, that this
perſon may be obſtinate, and not plead over, if you ſhould give your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt this Plea. In <hi>Elliots</hi> Caſe they were fined ſeverly, and they
continued under this judgment in Priſon, and in execution for the Fine a great
while, and they were delivered, by what I cannot indeed juſtifie in all its
proceedings, I mean the long Parliament, but what was done in 19 of this King,
I think is good authority, which none can ſay but was a Parliament as uſeful
to the King, and Kingdom as ever could be: In that Parliament the Commons
examined this judgment; I ſpeak becauſe I have it in my printed Book, tis in
<hi>Croke Car.</hi> I confeſs 'tis not in the firſt Impreſſion, but it is in the 2. Edition
that I have, and theſe are the expreſſions in it.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Williams.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't ſay ſo abſurd a thing. If your Lordſhip will have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to hear me, I'le tell you what I ſay. My Book which is the 2. Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Croke,</hi> reflecting upon that Caſe in 5 <hi>Caroli,</hi> does publiſh the Votes of
the Houſe of Commons about it, and the Reverſal of the judgment, in the 19.
of this King. There the proceeding is this, Information is given to the Houſe
of Commons, that there was ſuch a Caſe publiſhed, which did Derogate much
from the priviledge of Parliament invading the Liberty of ſpeech, and the
Houſe of Commons conſidering the Conſequence, ordered the book to be ſent for
and read, and taken into Conſideration and debated; and upon Debate the
Houſe came to this reſolution, That the judgment againſt <hi>Elliott</hi> and others
is an illegal judgment and againſt the freedom and Liberty of ſpeech, and this
Vote they ſend up to the Lords, where 'tis confirmed and reſolved in agreement
with the Vote of the Commons. And by the way in Anſwer, to a Paper
that is commonly ſpread about by the name of the <hi>Obſervator:</hi> I ſay the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
come to a Reſolution, and paſs a Vote which is not indeed a Law, and
when they have done that, they may tranſmit their opinions to the Lords, and
deſire them to concur; then the Lords and Commons have a Conference up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and at the Conference the Commons reaſons are delivered, which the
Lords take up with them to their Houſe and debate them. Then they come
to a Reſolution to agree with the Commons. Afterwards upon this Reſolution
of both Houſes they go regularly to work, by Writ of Error to reverſe
the judgement. And if it ſhould fall out in this Caſe, that your Lordſhip
ſhould give judgment againſt the Plea, and this perſon ſhould be obſtinate,
and not plead over, and thereupon your Lordſhip give judgment of death
upon him, it may come to be a very hard Caſe if a Writ of Error ſhould be
brought in Parliament, to reverſe this judgment, and it ſhould be reverſed
when the party is dead. Therefore it will be of great Conſequence in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I'le mind you of one old Caſe; it was 20 of <hi>Ri.</hi> 2. a perſon there
preſents a Petition to the Commons in Parliament, and it ſeems there was
ſomething ſuggeſted in the Petition, which did amount to High Treaſon, as there
may be ſome Petition or ſome Complaint againſt a great Miniſter that may
contain an Inſinuation, as it were of High Treaſon; he was indicted out of
Parliament for High Treaſon, and was found Guilty, and by the grace of the
Prince he was pardoned, but becauſe the Commons would not lye under that
Precedent of an Invaſion of their Priviledge, though he was a perſon without
doors, that prepared the Petition, and no more hurt done to him, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
he being pardoned the judgment was voided.</p>

And now My Lord, I have done with the ſubſtance of the Caſe, with my
reaſons for the matter and for the form. In this Caſe here is the Life of a
perſon before you, here is the right of the Commons to Impeach in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before you, here is the Judicature of the Lords to determine that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
before you, here is the Method and proceedings of Parliament before
you, and how far you will lay your hands upon this Caſe, thus circumſtantiated
we muſt ſubmit to you, but I hope you will proceed no further on the

                  <p>Pray Gentlemen let us a little direct you, not to ſpend our time
about that which is not to the purpoſe, or that is not in the Caſe; here is nothing
of the Commons Right to Impeach in Parliament before us, nor of the Lords
Juriſdiction, nor the Methods of Parliament in this Caſe, they are things quite
foreign to the Caſe, and the matter in hand, which is, whether this Plea as
thus pleaded, be ſufficient to protect the Priſoner, from being queſtioned in
this Court, for the Treaſonable matter in this Indictment before us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ought not to ſpend time in things that are not before us to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
being out of the Caſe: For we have nothing to do with any Priviledge
of Parliament, or of either of the Houſes, here at this time.</p>

                  <p>We ſpeak to you to come to the point, which is the
duty of all Courts, to keep Counſel to the points before them: The Sole
matter before us is whether this be a good Plea, to Ouſte this Court of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
which otherwiſe unqueſtionably, we have of this matter.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I ſhall purſue your direction as well as my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
will give me leave, and ſave your time as much as I can, but the
Court having aſſigned us of Counſel, you will give us leave to uſe our diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
keeping as near as we can to the points of the Caſe, and to the Pleading.
But if upon the reaſoning of this Caſe, other Parliament Caſes fall in, I hope
you will give me leave to cite them for maintaining our Plea. The Plea here is
to the Juriſdiction, and conſiſts of two parts; firſt matter of Record, which is that
an Impeachment is depending in the Houſe of Lords, (for ſo it muſt be taken
upon the pleading as I ſhall manifeſtly prove) the ſecond is matter in <hi>pais
(viz.)</hi> the Averment that the Impeachment, and Indictment are for one and
the ſame Treaſon, and the Plea is made up of theſe 2 parts, together with
an Averment that the perſon is the ſame. The Kings Attorney hath been
pleaſed to Demur generally to us, and I am ſure that if our Plea be well and
formally pleaded, all the matter of fact is confeſſed by the Demurrer.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Attorney did to my apprehenſion make but one Objection the other day,
and he ſtill inſiſts upon it, That here is a Record too generally pleaded, and they
compare it to the common Caſe of an <hi>auter foitz acquit,</hi> upon another Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but I hope to make it evidently appear, That it is in no ſort a parallel
Caſe. The matter which I conceive is confeſſed by the Demurrer, is that there
is an Impeachment by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> of High Treaſon againſt <hi>Fitz.
Harris</hi> lodged in the Houſe of Lords <hi>ſecundum Legem &amp; conſuetudinem Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenti.</hi>
And that the Treaſon for which he was Impeached is the ſame
Treaſon contained in the Indictment, to the which the Priſoner hath
now pleaded. Upon this matter of fact ſo agreed, the general Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is,</p>
                  <p>Whether an Impeachment for Treaſon, by the Houſe of Commons, and
ſtill depending be a ſufficient matter to ouſt the Court from proceeding
upon an Indictment for the ſame Offence. My Method will be, ſhortly to ſpeak
to theſe things.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I know the Caſe is very nice and tender on all
ſides, and therefore may very well bear an interruption; however I expreſs'd my
ſelf, my meaning is the ſame with your Lordſhips. The Method that I ſhall
proceed in will be this, I will ſuppoſe the Caſe before you had been of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
containing the ſpecial Treaſon for which he is now Indicted. I
will ſhew in the next place, that as it is now pleaded, 'tis as available as
if the Impeachment, in the Houſe of Lords had mentioned the particular
Treaſon. I ſhall then give ſome reaſons why it is ſo, and mention one or
two Precedents, that have not yet been cited. Two of the Kings Council
did agree that they would not make a doubt of the Plea, if there had been a
particular Impeachment, and therefore I would, by conſidering what would be
the reaſon of that Caſe, apply it particularly to the preſent Caſe. The Houſe
of Lords is a Superior Court to this: And is agreed to be the Higheſt Court of
Record in the Kingdom, <hi>Plowden</hi> 389. <hi>Co. Litt.</hi> 109, 110. 9. <hi>Co. in Pr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>fat.</hi> And
then I am within the Common Rule of Pleading, according to the differences
taken in <hi>Sparries</hi> Caſe, 5. <hi>Co.</hi> 61. and 62. That a ſuit firſt Commenced in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Court cannot ſtop a ſuit in a ſuperior Court though ſubſequent, but a ſuit
in a Superiour Court, may be pleaded to ſtop the procedings of one that is Infeor.
And though it may be objected here, that the Parliament is determined and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſolved,
and ſo there would be a failure of Juſtice; yet this Objection is of no
force, for if once the ſuit be well Commenced in the Superior Court, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
after go down to the Inferior: And what is begun in one Parliament
may be determined in another; ſo is the Caſe 4 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 16. of the
Lord <hi>Barkeley,</hi> and thoſe that were accuſed for the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2.
And though it was objected there, as hath been here, that by this means there
might be a ſtop of Juſtice, by the Diſſolution of the Parliament; yet the ſhort
and the true anſwer is, that it is in Law to be preſumed Parliaments will be
called frequently; to conſider of the buſineſs of the Kingdom, and redreſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
according to the ſeveral Statutes made for that porpoſe, 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
cap. 14. 36 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 10. I ſhall labour this no farther, but taking it as the
common Rule of pleading, that a Record in a Superior Court may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to ſtop a proceeding in an Inferior: I ſhall come to prove that this Record
is well pleaded and could not be otherwiſe unleſs Mr. Attorney would
have had us plead what is falſe; this being the truth of the Caſe; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
did Impeach Mr. <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> generally of Treaſon, as 'tis the Courſe of
Parliaments for them to do, and in our very Plea we alledge that he was Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem Parliamenti,</hi> and ſo Mr. Attorney hath confeſſed
by the Demurrer, and if they may prefer an Impeachment in general accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament; why then ſo far it muſt be allowed
that we have pleaded well that he was Impeached of Treaſon. It is very true
My Lord, If a man will plead generally that he was Indicted of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
this would be ill, becauſe the Court cannot take it otherwiſe than he has
pleaded it, and ſuch a general Indictment would be altogether void, and therefore
no Averment could make it good or ſupply that generality and uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>But an Impeachment generally for Treaſon, is good and warranted by the
Law and courſe of Parliament, and ſo confeſs'd by the Demurrer. And ſo
your Lordſhip will take it to be, and will give Credit that all is regular in the
proceedings of that High Court. You will preſume even in the Eccleſiaſtical
Courts (as My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays in the 4th. Report) that all things are rightly
done, when they have a Juriſdiction <hi>à fortiori</hi> you will believe the greateſt
Court in the Kingdom does proceed regularly. My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in the 4th.
<hi>Inſt. fol.</hi> 14. and 15. does ſay what the Law and Courſe of Parliament is, the
Judges will never intermeddle with. They always leave it to the Parliament
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49318:21"/>
who are the Superior Judges, and are to determine the matters before them.
For they take notice that the Courſe of a Court, is the Law of a Court,
as 'tis in <hi>Lane</hi>'s Caſe in the 2. Report, in the Caſe of the Exchequer. And
therefore if a general Impeachment is <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem,</hi> which is
confeſſed by the Demurrer in this caſe, then you muſt take it for granted
that the Parliament proceed rightly, and that ſuch a general Impeachment is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in Law. There is a famous Caſe that ſtrengthens what I ſay, 11 <hi>Ri.</hi> 2 <hi>di.
Rot. Parl. par.</hi> 2. the Caſe of the Lords Appellants. You will find it alſo
cited in <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Col. part 1. in the Appendix, <hi>fol.</hi> 51. <hi>Treſillian</hi> and others
were appealed againſt for Treaſon, and both the Judges of the Common, and
of the Civil Law were by direction of the King called to adviſe of that matter.
And they did all declare that the proceedings in that Caſe were neither
agreeable to Common Law, nor Civil Law. But the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſaid it did not belong to the Judges of the Common Law, or Civil
Law, to guide them, but that they ought to proceed according to the Courſe,
and Law of Parliaments, (which are the words of our Plea) and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no opinion of theirs ſhould out them of their Juriſdiction, or alter the
Courſe and Method of proceedings. My Lord, this Caſe is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but I will go a little further, the Judges in all Ages have been ſo far from
taking upon them to judge of the Laws and Cuſtoms of Parliament, that they
have denied to anſwer when their Advice has been demanded, and inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that they were not proper Judges of ſuch matters, as in 31 <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ words">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Speaker of the Houſe, during the Adjournment of Parliament might be
arreſted; they deſired to be excuſed from giving any opinion; for ſaid they, in
this great matter they ought not interpoſe, it being a matter of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>In the great Council <hi>primo &amp; ſecundo Jacobi,</hi> about the Union of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
the Judges refuſed to give their opinions upon ſeveral Queſtions put
to them, deſiring to be excuſed for that ſuch things did not belong to them,
but were matters fit for Parliament only. My meaning is to infer from hence
that ſince it is pleaded here to be according to the Law, and courſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and Mr. Attorney hath acknowledged it, that now your Lordſhip
is forecloſed from further meddling with this Caſe, it appearing upon record
to be a matter whereof you cannot judge.</p>
                  <p>But the objection is, that admit the Impeachment ſhould be taken to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the courſe of Parliament, yet it is ſo general that the Court cannot
judge upon it: I anſwer, that 'tis evident the Impeachment was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
'tis moſt certainly to be preſumed, that ſuch a body of men as the
Houſe of Commons would not Impeach a man for no Crime.  <hi>Fitz Harris</hi>
Avers by his Plea, that it was for the ſame Treaſon, for which the Jury have
found this Bill againſt him: Now this Averment makes the matter as clear
to the Court, as if the Impeachment had mentioned the particular
Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Every days Experience ſhews that Averments, which are conſiſtent with the
Record are good, and are of neceſſity to clear the Fact to the Court, ſo that
the Judges may give a judgment upon it. If the Defendant will plead a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
in a formal action, in bar to an action of Debt, or other action it is
not enough for him to ſet out the Record, he muſt Aver alſo that the Cauuſes
of the action are the ſame, and that it is the ſame perſon, who is mentioned in
one Record, and in the other Records, and this ſhews that the moſt ſpecial
and particular are of no uſe without Averments.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, there is a Caſe that I find directly to this purpoſe, which goes
further than the Caſe I did but now put, and that is, 26. <hi>Aſſiz. pl.</hi> 15. It
is alſo mentioned in <hi>Stamf. Pla. Cor.</hi> 105. Where a man was indicted for
the Murder of <hi>I. S.</hi> and he pleads a Record of acquittal, where he was
indicted for the Murder of <hi>I. N.</hi> But he Avers that <hi>I. S.</hi> in this Indictment
is the ſame perſon with <hi>I. N.</hi> in the other Indictment, and that was adjuged
a good Plea, and the party was acquitted, though the Averment there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49318:22"/>
to be a contradiction to the Record. This makes it clear, that if an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may conſiſt with the Record, the Law will allow it. In <hi>Mores Rep.</hi> 823.
<hi>Pl.</hi> 1112. The King againſt <hi>Howard,</hi> it is ſaid that if an Act of Parliament
be certified into Chancery, no Averment lies to ſay this is no Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe the Commons did not aſſent to it; but if it appears in the Body of
the Act, that the Commons did not aſſent as if it was ordained by the King, and
Lords, and without mentioning any aſſent of the Commons: There it may be
Aver'd to be no Act, for this being a matter conſiſtent with the Record, is
Averrable: And ſo it is agreed in 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 18. <hi>Pilkingtons</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now Mr. Attorney has his Election here (as it is in all ſuch Caſes) either to
plead <hi>Null tiel Record,</hi> and then we muſt have produced it, and if we had fail'd, it
had been againſt us, as to the whole Plea. Or if he would not deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
(as indeed he could not) he might have taken iſſue upon our Averment,
that it was not for one and the ſame offence; but he has Demurred and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
confeſſed there is ſuch a Record, and confeſſed the Averment to be true
that he was Impeached for the ſame Crime, and that he is the ſame perſon,
and now it is plain to your Lordſhip, that I ſtated the Queſtion right at firſt.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I ſhall cite you one Precedent out of <hi>Raſt. Ent. fol.</hi> 384. and 385.
Where a man was Indicted and acquitted, before certain Juſtices, and being
Indicted <hi>de novo</hi>

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> Fran. Win.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, My Lord, it is: And he pleads, that he was Indicted
<hi>coram aliis Juſtitiarlis,</hi> for the ſame fellony and upon this Plea the entry is made,
<hi>Quia teſtatum eſt hic in Cur. in praefat<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s Juſticiarios,</hi> that the ſaid party was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
of the fellony, in manner and form as he had alledged in his Plea.
Therefore 'tis adjudged, that he ſhould be diſcharged and go without day.
My Lord, I do not altogether rely upon this Precedent for Law, but I find
it in that book.</p>
                  <p>Now My Lord, I ſhall offer ſome Reaſons in general: Firſt that when once the
Commons in Parliament in the name of themſelves, and of all the Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> have lodged an Impeachment againſt any man, it ſeems to me
againſt natural Juſtice, that ſhould ever any Commoners afterwards come to try
or judge that man for that fact. I ſpeak this becauſe every man in <hi>England,</hi> that
is a Commoner, is a party to the accuſation, and ſo we have pleaded by ſuch
an Impeachment, a man is ſubjected to another ſort of Tryal, <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
ſays that every man ſhall be tryed by his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.
And by the Law of the Land, there are ſeveral ſorts of Tryal, ſome by Juries,
others not by Juries. This is one of thoſe ſorts, where the Tryal is by the
Law of the Land, but not by his Peers; for it would be hard that any man
ſhould come to Try or to give judgement upon a perſon, who hath been his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer
before. And in effect hath already given his judgment, that he is Guilty
by the accuſation of him, and ſo ſtands not indifferent. By this means the
Tryal by Jury is gone: And the Lords, who are the Peers of the Realm, are
Judges in point of fact, as well as Law. Here is an enormous offence, againſt
which all the Nation cryes, for ſo they do in the Impeachment: Then ſays
the Law, it is not fit that you ſhould try him, who are parties, but the Lords
are the proper Judges, they ſhall Try him <hi>per teſtes,</hi> and the Commoners may
come in as Witneſſes, but not as Judges.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, another reaſon is this, that if an Appeal of death, or any other
Appeal, were depending before the Statute of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. The King could
not proceed upon an Indictment for the ſame fact, becauſe the King as the
Common parent does only take care that ſuch Offenders ſhould not go away
with Impunity, but the preference was given to the perſon more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned, and the Kings Indictment muſt ſtay till the year and day were
out, to ſee whether they will proceed in their ſuits: And ſo ſays My Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> in his Pleas of the Crown, 2442, 45. Then <hi>à minori admajus</hi> does
the Law ſo regard the intereſt of the Wife or the Heir, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their ſuit, and
has it no regard to the ſuit of all the Commons of <hi>England?</hi> For manifeſtly
an Impeachment is the ſuit of the people, and not the Kings ſuit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49318:22"/>
Thats the 2. Reaſon; another Reaſon I ſhall urge, is that which was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Mr. <hi>Williams:</hi> Suppoſe this man ſhould be tryed here, and be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Is it to be preſumed that he can plead this acquittal in Barr to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
before the Lords? My Lord, I believe there is no conſidering man
in <hi>England,</hi> that has regard either to the Juriſdiction of Parliament or to the
Nature of the ſuit, will affirm that it would be a good Plea; and that he could
barr the great Court of the Kingdom, from proceeding againſt him, by ſaying he
was acquitted by a Jury in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> after the ſuit was firſt well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
in that Court.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I ſay with reverence to the Court, that ſhould you proceed in this
Tryal, it may fall out that contrary to a Fundamental Rule of Law, a man ſhall
be twice put in danger of his Life, for one offence, which by the Law he
cannot be; and therefore I urge that as a reaſon, why you cannot proceed here
on this Indictment.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I will now mention two or three Precedents, which will prove
that this Impeachment is according to the Courſe and Law of Parliaments,
though it may ſeem needleſs, after the Kings Learned Council have agreed it.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I ſhall firſt mention the Caſe of <hi>Michael. de La Poole, Rot. Par.</hi>
18 or 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 18 He was a very great man, and came to the Houſe of
Lords voluntarily, and ſaid there was a Rumour that he was Guilty of horrible
things.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fran. Win.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes My Lord; There upon the Commons pray he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon his own confeſſion, and that the thing being Debated in the Houſe,
the Lords ſaid we know not what was meant by thoſe words, horrible things;
it may import only Miſdemeanours, if it had been ſaid Treaſon, we had known
how to have proceeded thereupon: And thereupon within a few days after
the Commons came and accuſed him of Treaſon: and there 'tis ſaid that the
Courſe of Parliament, is to find out the Truth by Circumſtances, and ſuch
degrees as the Nature of the thing will bear, and they are not confined to the
ſtrict rules of other Courts. I will not cite any more ancient Caſes, though
there are many to be found of general Impeachments; for we are not diſputing
what is the right and courſe of Impeachments, which is confeſſed, upon the
pleading; but we have had ſeveral Caſes of late, the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> was
Impeached generally, and the Commons took time to bring in their Articles:
and I have had the experience in 3 or 4 a Parliaments wherein we have been pretty
well buſied with Impeachments, though we have had no great ſucceſs in them;
That though the Commons may if they pleaſe, carry up particular Articles at
firſt, yet the Law and courſe is for the Lords to receive the general Impeachment,
and the Commons ſay that in due time they will bring in their Articles: So
it was done in the Caſe of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Popiſh Lords, ſome particular Member was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to go up and Impeach them of High Treaſon in General; and in that
Caſe though the Parliament was Diſſolved, before any Articles ſent up; yet
afterwards in the next Parliament, the Articles, upon the former Impeachments
were ſent up, and receiv'd, and My Lord <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>fford</hi> ſince executed, upon his
Conviction, upon that Impeachment; yet Indictments were exhibited againſt
them, before ever any Impeachment, was ſent up by the Commons, and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were made for their Tryals. But from that day to this, there hath been
no attempt to Try them upon their Indictments, though there have been
ſeveral Intervals of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Our Caſe is ſtronger than that of the Lords, for in the Caſe at
the Bar, the firſt ſuit was in the Houſe of Lords, by the Commons; whilſt
in the other Caſe, the firſt was the ſuit of the King, by Indictment, and
yet by a ſubſequent Impeachment, that was ſtop'd, and the Lords continue
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49318:23"/>
yet Priſoners in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Our time hath been ſo ſhort that we could not
ſee the Copies of Orders, which we might otherwiſe have made uſe of, for
maintaining this Plea; we ſent to the Houſe of Lords, but the Officers were
out of Town, and we could come at the ſight of nothing there, we
have been told the opinion of the Judges was delivered at Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe very Lords, that the Impeachments being lodged in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no other proſecution could be againſt them, till the proſecution of the
Commons was determined. So far the Courts below have always been from
meddling, with the Juriſdiction of Parliament, that even many times in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
upon Acts of Parliament, they have gone up to the Parliament, to
know what was meant by it: And I remember it was ſaid by the Court in
that Caſe of My Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> where it was agreed by all, that the
Commitment was too general, for it was only for a Contempt; whereas the
Crime ought particularly to appear in the Warrant, that it being in a Caſe
of Commitment, by the Parliament, (at leaſt while that Parliament was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing)
they ought not to meddle with it, nor could they inquire into the
formality of the Warrant.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I muſt mention one thing touching the Caſe of My Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi>
which was cited by Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and I have but a word to add: It is in
the Appendit to the firſt part of <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Col. and alſo in <hi>Croke, Car. fol.</hi>
181. It was there pleaded to the Juriſdiction of this Court, that it was a
matter done in Parliament: In our Caſe his pleaded that an Impeachment
is depending in Parliament, that was but a proſecution for a Miſdemeanor,
this is a Caſe of High Treaſon; it fell out in that Caſe, the Court here did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge,
that the Information did lye but upon a Writ of Error, it was agreed
by the Lords unanimouſly, that the judgement was Erroneous, and that the
Parties ſhould be reſtored to all which they had loſt, by reaſon of it; but if
this man ſhould loſe his Life by your judgment, what help would there be
upon a Writ of Error? The danger of ſuch a thing requires great conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and it would be of fatal conſequence, if the Lords ſhould hereafter
adjudge that this Court had no Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. Attorneys objection to day, that we have not ſet forth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
that there was any Impeachment; I do confeſs I was a little ſtartled
at it; for the words of the Plea are, that <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> by the
Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes was Impeached, which Impeachment is in
force. I do not know how in the world we could have thought of more
expreſs words, than to ſay he was Impeached, and that that Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in full force as appears by the Record.</p>
                  <p>For the other Objection, the other day (for we would mention all, how
little ſoever they deſerve an anſwer) that the King may chuſe in what
Court he will ſue; it is agreed when it is at his own ſuit, but this is
not ſo but at the Commons ſuit, and can be no where elſe proſecuted,
than where it now depends. This is the Method and Courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we ſay, and that the Method and Courſe of Parliaments is the Law
of the Land; your Lordſhip will take notice that it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>To conclude as this Plea now ſtands, the Demurrer confeſſing the matter
of it, it cannot be over-ruled without deciding, whether the Lords can proceed
upon ſuch General Impeachments, and whether the Commons can Impeach in
ſuch a General way. We ſubmit, the whole to your judgment, it is a Caſe
deſerves great Conſideration, as being of great weight and Moment, and
highly concerns the Juriſdiction of the Lords, the Priviledges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and the Rights of all the people of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, There are in this Plea three
Principal Parts upon which it turns, which are expreſly alledged. Firſt, That
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> before the Indictment was according to the Law and Cuſtom of
Parliament impeached of High Treaſon, and this I humbly conceive is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by Mr. Attorney upon the Demurrer. The Second thing is, That this
Impeachment, be it as it will, general or particular, does remain in full force
and vertue. This is plainly alledged and demurred to, and ſo confeſſed by
Mr. Attorney; for all things well alledged and pleaded, are confeſſed by the
Demurrer. The Third great Point and Hinge upon which it turns is this,
That the High Treaſon mentioned in the Indictment, and the High Treaſon
for which he was Impeached in the Houſe of Lords, is one and the ſame
Treaſon. This we have plainly averred, and this Mr. Attorney hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
by his Demurrer plainly confeſſed, as we humbly conceive.</p>
                  <p>For the two former Points there is no difficulty in them, and therefore I
ſhall paſs them over: 'Tis this third matter which I take to be the only
point in the Caſe, and if we have well averred it, and can by Law be let
into ſuch an Averrment, then I hope your Lordſhip and this Court will not
pretend to go on in this Caſe. They Object and ſay becauſe he is Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of High Treaſon generally, without naming any particular Treaſon, that
cannot be averred to be the ſame, and a Demurrer does never confeſs the
truth of that which by Law cannot be ſaid; but if it may be ſaid, and is
ſaid plainly, then the Demurrer confeſſes it.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I humbly conceive this matter is well averrable, and we have
taken a good Averrment. I grant that a repugnant and an impoſſible Averr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be taken, as to averr a Horſe to be a Sheep, which is apparently
repugnant and impoſſible, and in that Caſe a Demurrer can never confeſs
the truth of that which appears impoſſible to be true. But, My Lord, if
there be no Impoſſibility nor Repugnancy, nor Contradiction in the Averr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the matters that are averred to be the ſame, as there is not
between that which is but generally expreſſed, and that which is more ſpecially
alledged, where all may well ſtand together, and the one includes the other, and
needs only ſome farther explanation, it is not only allowable to avert it,
but moſt proper and in ſuch caſe only neceſſary. For, <hi>quod conſtat cla<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="6+ letters">

                        </gap>
debet veriſicari,</hi> in this Caſe it is not neceſſary that it ſhould appear to the
Court upon the view of the Indictment and Impeachment, that the matter
contained in both is the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is ſufficient that it be proveable upon an
Iſſue to be taken. And ſo much is admitted by the Judges in <hi>Sparries</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co.</hi> 5.
<hi>rep.</hi> 51. that if there be convenient certainty which may be put in Iſſue, it
is ſufficient, and conſequently not neceſſary to appear at the firſt, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the event of the iſſue afterwards to be tryed. And if they intend it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
I confeſs I underſtand them not. It is true, it muſt appear to the
Court either at the firſt opening, or upon an Iſſue ſubſequent to be found:
And, My Lord, if this matter may appear at firſt or at laſt, and the thing
is poſſible to be proved, then we are well enough: In <hi>Corbet</hi> and <hi>Barnes</hi>
Caſe in the firſt <hi>Croke, fol.</hi> 320. a Battery ſuppoſed to be in <hi>London,</hi> and a
Battery ſuppoſed to be in <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> were averred to be one and the
ſame Battery, which naturally is impoſſible, yet being tranſitory and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuppoſable to be done in any County, ſuch an averrment is allowable,
though it ſeemed contradictory and could not appear to the Court by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the ſeveral declarations to be any way the ſame: And there being a
Demurrer for that Cauſe in that Caſe, the truth of the averrment was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to be confeſſed by the Demurrer: And ſo hereby the Demurrer, the
truth of the ſuggeſtion that the Treaſon in the Impeachment, and the
Treaſon in the Indictment is one and the ſame, is confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49318:24"/>
By taking this Averrment, we offer them here a fair Iſſue, an
Iſſue of Fact tryable by a Jury, wherein the Attorney General
might have joined with us if he had pleaſed; but refuſing that,
and having demurred, and thereby confeſſed what we have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it muſt be taken to be true as if found by a Jury. And,
My Lord, That this matter is properly averrable and tryable, I
think 'tis plain, it being a Queſtion of Fact, which is properly
triable by the Countrey; and if they had taken Iſſue upon that,
we might have gone to a Jury where the matter would have been
eaſily proved. For upon Evidence given, the Jury might fairly
take into conſideration the reading of this very numerical Libel
ſet forth in the Indictment, and the particular and ſpecial debates
of the Houſe of Commons thereupon: And that upon thoſe very
Debates the Houſe voted that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould be Impeached
for matters contained in that Libel. And that upon thoſe Votes the
Impeachment was carried up to the Lords: This is Evidence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
that the Houſe of Commons did intend to accuſe him of
the ſame Treaſon contained in the Indictment, which proves the
Iſſue, that is, that the Treaſon contained in the Impeachment is the
ſame with that contained in the Indictment: neither is this to put
the Intention of the mind or ſecret thoughts of the heart in Iſſue,
which is againſt the rules of Law; but to put them into a way of
proof, which well ſtands with the rules of Law, which upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
or other collateral Iſſue may well be inquired of by the Jury.
As in an action <hi>quare canem inordacem defendens ſcienter retinuit;</hi> Here
<hi>[Soienter]</hi> is not directly iſſuable, but it is proveable, and muſt be
proved upon the general Iſſue. So in the preſent caſe the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Commons upon the Iſſue offered by us, and refuſed by
the Attorney General, might, and ought, and would have been
proved, and, without doubt, found by the Jury. Neither is this
general Impeachment ſuch a notional thing as the other ſide would
pretend; but 'tis as if they ſhould ſay, We do charge him to have
Committed certain Crimes that are Treaſon. Now whether the
Crimes they ſay he had committed, and for which they Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him are the ſame with thoſe for which he is Indicted, is a good
and proper Iſſue. And if it appear to the Court to be the ſame,
you will certainly your ſelves take off your hands from theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
This is all I ſhall ſay as to the Averrment. And if
we can well get over that, I take it, all the reſt is well enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49318:24"/>
But again they ſay the Impeachment is too general, and no man ſhall be
put to anſwer to ſuch a general Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>And I ſay ſo too, neither ſhall <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> be put to Anſwer to it
without ſpecial Articles; yet he cannot quaſh the Impeachment for this Cauſe,
as he might an Indictment, which ſhews the difference betwixt an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
and an Indictment, which always contains the ſpecial matter,
and without which it might be quaſht, and made no Record. But hereby
the Law of Parliament ſuch general Impeachments are held good; And
Articles are uſually brought in afterwards, and after thoſe additional Articles,
which cannot be in the courſe and way of Indictment; and therefore we
muſt take the Impeachment as we find it, and ſince it ſtands againſt us as a
Record, though this general, we may, and muſt Plead it in the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity;
having no way to make it no Record, as we have in caſe of ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Indictment.</p>
                  <p>So then this being an Impeachment according to the Courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is well lodged in the Houſe of Lords where it only ought to be
Tryed, and we muſt Plead it as we may, and as we find the Caſe to be:
And having averred the Crimes to be the ſame, we have done what we
could, and therefore, Enough.</p>
                  <p>And that a general Impeachment without Articles is a Bar to any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
for the ſame matter, was reſolved by all the Judges, as I am informed,
in the Caſe of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who were all Indicted for Treaſon,
either in the Kings Bench, or before Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer:</hi>
And afterwards [5. <hi>Dec.</hi> 78.] generally Impeached before the Lords in
Parliament; and no Articles exhibited till, 3. <hi>April</hi> 79. And yet in the
mean time it was reſolved at the Council Table by all the Judges there
attending, that after the general Impeachment, before Articles, they could
not be proceeded againſt upon thoſe Indictments, though the Parliament
wherein they were Impeached, was diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>And that was a ſtronger Caſe than this of <hi>Fitz Harris;</hi> For there the
Inferiour Court was firſt poſſeſſed of the Cauſe, and yet the general Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
cloſed up the hands of the Court: But in this Caſe, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Court the Parliament was firſt poſſeſt of the Cauſe, which cannot be
taken out of their hands by the Inferiour Court.</p>
                  <p>There is a farther difference betwixt an Impeachment in Parliament, and
an Indictment: That in an Indictment, which is always as particular as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
upon an Impeachment, you cannot Plead <hi>auter foitz</hi> Arraigned, but
you muſt Plead either <hi>auter foitz</hi> Convict, or Acquit, as appears in Sir
<hi>William Wiſhipoles</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cron.</hi> 1. 105. But in an Impeachment in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the other ſide will acknowledge that after Articles exhibited there
can be no Proceedings upon an Indictment for the ſame offence, although
the Defendant in the Impeachment be neither Convict, or Acquit: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
you may bring back all the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> to the Kings Bench to be
Tryed, which Mr. Attorney will not I ſuppoſe Attempt.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable in the Caſe of Sir <hi>William Wiſhipole;</hi> That to avoid
the doubt that the Party there ſhould not be queſtioned, both upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49318:25"/>
Inqueſt, and the Indictment of Murther, it was Ruled by the Court,
that the firſt ſhould be quaſht as inſufficient; ſo careful were the Judges to
avoid double vexation, in a Caſe, compared with this, of no great import.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay no more to the Caſe, but only obſerve how ſcrupulous the
Judges have been to touch upon a Caſe, where they had the leaſt ſuſpicion
or jealouſie that the Parliament had, or pretended to have a Juriſdiction, or
were poſſeſſed of the Cauſe. I am ſure I could never get any thing by any
Labours of mine in thoſe Caſes; But upon all ſuch Motions they were ſo
aware of what might be the Conſequence, that they would always worſhip
afar off, and would never come near the Mount. They would ever retire
when they came but near the Brink of this Gulf.</p>
                  <p>Now my Lord, If you retain this Cauſe, in conſequence you Charge your
ſelves with the blood of this man, wherein if you proceed regularly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law, all is well; But however, by over ruling his Plea, you take
upon you his blood one way or other: Through which you muſt wade to
come at the Cauſe. And whether it be adviſeable to come at it upon theſe
terms, I leave it to your Lordſhips wiſdom to conſider.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I ſhall not make any long Argument, there hath
been ſo much ſaid before me. But I would fain come to the Queſtion if I could,
for I muſt confeſs afterall, I cannot ſee what the other ſide make the Queſtion;
Mr. Attorney was pleaſed to ſay that both for the matter and form he objected
againſt our Plea: But if for the matter it be admitted to me that an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Parliament for the ſame matter will out this Court of Juriſdiction;
I will ſay nothing at all of it, for I apprehend that is not then in Queſtion.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Pollexfen.</speaker>
                  <p>Then the matter ſeems to be agreed, and only the manner
and form of the Plea are now in Queſtion. And for the manner they except
to it in theſe particulars. Firſt, they ſay 'tis not alledged that there is any
Impeachment upon Record; now I confeſs form is a ſubtile matter in it ſelf,
and it is eaſy for any man that reads other mens words and Writings if he will,
to make what Conſtruction he will of them even <hi>Nolumus</hi> to be <hi>Volumus,</hi>
but I know the Court will not ſo do, But for an Anſwer to the Objection
I think it is as ſtrongly and cloſely penned as I can tell how to pen any thing, he
was Impeached <hi>Quae quidem Impetitio &amp;c.</hi> What can that <hi>Quae quidem</hi>
ſignifie but the Impeachment that was juſt mentioned before? But what they
mean by this to ſay this is not the ſame Impeachment when the Words are
poſitive that 'tis the ſame I muſt confeſs I cannot Fathom.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, there was another thing ſpoken the laſt day, but they have not
mentioned it now; if there be any thing ſtirred in it, I hope your Lordſhip will
be pleaſed to hear us before you give your Judgment in it, That it was not
ſaid to be <hi>ſub pede ſigil<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i,</hi> but I know they won't inſiſt upon it therefore I ſay
nothing to that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49318:25"/>
But the great Queſtion now is; whether or no this be not
too general, the alledging that he was Impeached in Parliament,
and not ſaying how or for what Crime, tho there be an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
afterwards that 'tis for the ſaid Crime, Whether this be
not ſo general as that therefore this Plea ſhould be naught.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for this of the Averment, I take it with ſubmiſſion let
the Crimes be never ſo particularly ſpecified in the Record that
is pleaded, and in that upon which the party is brought in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature
yet always there muſt be an Averment, and that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
is ſo much the ſubſtantial part of the Plea, That let the
matter never ſomuch appear to be the ſame without an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it would be naught, And it muſt come to be tryed <hi>per pa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
whether the offence be the ſame or not; for if a man plead one
Indictment for the murder of <hi>I. S.</hi> to another Indictment
for the murder of <hi>I. S.</hi> tho' they bear the ſame Name, he
muſt Aver they are one and the ſame Perſon, For elſe
<hi>Non conſtat</hi> to the Court,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there may be two <hi>I. S.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Averments are ſtill the ſubſtance of the Plea, to bring
the <hi>Identity</hi> of the matter into Judgment, and are to be tryed
by the Country, ſo then the Objection to the Generality is not
an Objection to the ſubſtance, but rather an Objection to the
form on their ſide, Becauſe the ſubſtance is alledged in the
Plea that it is for the ſame Treaſon, which ſubſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
had thought not fit to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have demurred to but taken Iſſue
on, muſt have been tryed <hi>per pais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus ſpoken to the Averment, My Lord, Let me
ſpeak to the general Allegation that he was Impeached for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and not ſaying particularly what the fact was.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, If they admit the Law that an Impeachment in
Parliament does ſuſpend or take away the Juriſdiction of this
Court then they have admitted a great part of the fact and
then the matter in Queſtion will be what Impeachment in
Parliament it is that will take away the Juriſdiction of the
Court, and there can be but two ſorts; the one at large where
the whole Offence is ſpecified; the other not at large, but only
in general Words, the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Aſſembled in the Name of themſelves and of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of <hi>England,</hi> do Impeach ſuch an one of High Treaſon.
Now my Lord, if ſo be ſuch Impeachment in Parliament be a
good Impeachment, then have We, I think, the moſt plain
Caſe pleaded that can be, as plain as the Fact, that this is an
Impeachment in Parliament, and then this Court is outed of
its Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49318:26"/>
They that have gone before have ſaid which I muſt pray
your Lordſhip to remember, That the Court and we are to take
notice of the proceedings in other Courts, as other Courts are
bound to take notice of the proceedings of this, Then I would
ſuppoſe in other familiar Caſes, there is generally (as 'tis true
in <hi>Sparry's</hi> Caſe) the Writ or the Declaration which does in
all civil Cauſes ſet forth the particularity of the thing in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet in ſome Caſes we are ſure it does not do ſo,
but the Courſe and practice of ſome Courts admits general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
Now where-ever that is ſo, the party cannot mend
himſelf by making their Courſe otherwiſe than it is, For he
muſt not ſay it is more particular than the Courſe of the Courrt
does make it, Therefore he hath no other way by the Law
to bring his matter on, and help himſelf, but by an Averment
that 'tis the ſame, I will ſuppoſe a Caſe of ſuch a Nature as
this, a man brings an Account in <hi>London</hi> upon <hi>Conceſſit Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi>
and he does not particularize in the Count any thing what
or how his Debt did ariſe, But after he brings another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or delivery aſpecial Declaration in an Account of Debt
ſhall not I becauſe the firſt Declaration is in general Words,
Aver, that this is the ſame matter that he ſued for by the
<hi>Conceſſit Solvere,</hi> which he now ſues for in this particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration:
Or ſuppoſe a man in this Court does bring an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for divers wares and Merchandiſes ſold and does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
any particulars, but that he was indebted, in general Words
for Wares ſold, and afterwards he comes and brings another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and ſays it is for ſuch and ſuch Wares, ſo much for,
Cloth, ſo much for Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' his firſt Declaration be in
general not expreſſing what the Wares were, and the laſt is
particular, ſhall not I come and plead in Abatement to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Declaration, that the firſt and ſecond were for one and
the ſame thing. Suppoſe again an Indictment of Barrelry be
found againſt a man which is an Offence that is only general
and hath no particulars alledged in the Indictment, Should not
a man that is the ſecond time Indicted come and ſay this is
one and the ſame. My Lord, under favour in all theſe and
ſuch like Caſes the Law muſt be Govern'd by its own proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and take notice of the Nature of the things depending
before the Court. And if ſo be upon Conſideration of the
Nature of the thing, there is as much of certainty ſet forth as the
Caſe will admit and is poſſible to be had, we muſt permit the
party to plead as he can, and help himſelf by the Averment.</p>
                  <p>Then my Lord, the Queſtion is whether an Impeachment
generally in Parliament, without particularly ſetting forth for
what, be a good Impeachment there or no. If they ſay it is not,
then the bottom of the Plea is naught, and all is quite gone, but
if they ſay it is, then I have Pleaded my matter as it is? For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay that that is particular or make that particular that is not,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49318:26"/>
and I have done all that is poſſible for me to do in my Caſe. I have
Pleaded what is in the Record, and as 'tis in the Record, from
which my Plea muſt not vary, and I have Averred 'tis for the
ſame matter, and you have Confeſſed it by the Demurrer.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I would not intangle the Queſtion, but I muſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I do not ſee how they can extricate themſelves out of this
<hi>Dilemma,</hi> if they do admit a General Impeachment is a good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.
Then there are freſh Inſtances of this conſiderable in
the Caſe, as that which hath been particularized of the Lords
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and of the Opinion in <hi>February</hi> of the Judges in their
Caſe. For in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> were thoſe Lords Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and after, on the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Dec.</hi> the Houſe of Commons taking
it into their Conſideration, that there was a Commiſſion going
out for an High Steward with an intent to bring them to Tryal
before the Peers they, purpoſely to have the Carriage and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of this great and horrid Treaſon, and take off the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
upon the Indictment, do Impeach the ſame Lords, and
there the Impeachment is juſt the ſame as this in our Plea of
High Treaſon, but not of any particular Fact adding only of
other Crimes and Miſdemeanors, which is as general as can be.
Now my Lord, the Judges did take ſo much Notice of it, that
though the Parliament was Diſſolved before the particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were carryed up to ſet forth the particular Offence. Yet
in <hi>February</hi> following (ſome of the Judges are here, and they
will rectifie me if I be miſtaken) their Opinions being asked
about it at the Council Board upon the Petition of the Lords to
be either Bayled or Tryed, they were of Opinion that this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
though thus general, was ſo depending in Parliament
that they could not be Tryed. So that I think the Proceedings
in Parliament are of that Nature, that if you will meddle with
what they do, you will take notice of their Method of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as you do of other Courts.</p>
                  <p>Why then my Lord, if this be ſo, how is it poſſible for us to
do better? We have Pleaded as our Fact is an Impeachment of
High Treaſon, What would they have had us to do, or wherein
is our fault? What would they have had us ſaid? We were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
of any High Treaſon ſo and ſo particularizing, how can
that be? There is no ſuch thing. Then they would have ſaid
<hi>Nul. Trel.</hi> Record. And we muſt have been Condemned for fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our Record, then indeed we had been where they would have
had us; But having done according to our Fact, if that Fact be ſuch
as in Law will out this Court of Juriſdiction, I ſee not how it is
poſſible we ſhould Plead otherwiſe, or what Anſwer they will
give to it.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I will meddle as little as I can with what hath
been ſaid, they have mentioned that it is a Caſe of an high
Nature, and this Impeachment in Parliament they will look upon
it as the Suit of all the people of <hi>England,</hi> why then my Lord
this muſt needs be agreed to me, if this Impeachment in
Parliament be in the Nature of an Appeal; Surely an Appeal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49318:27"/>
does ſuſpend the Proceedings upon any Indictment for that Fact,
which is the Caſe expreſly in my Lord <hi>Dyer, fol.</hi> 296. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
was Indicted of Murder and Convicted; after he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
and before any Judgment, the Wife of the Party Murdered
brought her Appeal, then came they and moved for Judgment;
no ſaid the Court here is an Appeal brought, and they could
not go to Judgment till that Appeal was determined. So the
<hi>Stat.</hi> of 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Ca.</hi> 1. and <hi>Vaux</hi>'s Caſe 4 <hi>Report. fol.</hi> 39.
an Appeal of Murder, the Party Convicted, before Judgment
the Petitioner in the Appeal did die. Then an Indictment
brought and this Conviction Pleaded in Bar of that Indictment,
and Adjudged to be a good Plea, but then there was a fault
found in the Appeal, upon which the Conviction on the Appeal,
was void in Law, and they went on upon the Indictment. This
is to ſhew that if this be of the Nature of an Appeal, then ought
this Suit firſt to have its Courſe and Determination before your
Lordſhip proceed on this Indictment.</p>
                  <p>But my Lord, whether it be of this Nature or no, is a matter
we know where under great Controverſie, and whether your
Lordſhip will interpoſe in that great Queſtion, or whether it
comes in Judgment under this Queſtion, you will do well to
Conſider, for 'tis a matter of Parliament and determinable
among themſelves, not in the Courts below, nor have ever
Inferiour Courts taken upon them to meddle with the Actions
of the Superiour Courts, but leave them to proceed according
to their Laws, and if that be done in any Caſe there will be
as much regard had in this great Cauſe to the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
as in others.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Authorities Cited out of my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> and
others, I would Cite one more, and that is <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Records,
5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 426. the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Caſe. He comes
and Confeſſes himſelf to be Guilty of an Offence againſt his
Allegiance, the King delivered his Petition to the Juſtices and
would have them to Conſider of it, No ſaid the Parliament
'tis matter of Parliament, and the Judges have nothing to do
with it, The Lords make a Proteſtation to this purpoſe, and
then they went on themſelves and Adjudged it to be no Treaſon.
There is only that one Record more which has been often Cited,
and that is, <hi>Rot. Parliamenti</hi> 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2 <hi>pars.</hi> 1. <hi>N.</hi> 6. In
this Parliament the Lords Spiritual and Temporal Claimed the
ſame Priviledge: My Lord, I only offer theſe things with
what my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays hath been formerly thought prudence
in the Judges to do.</p>
                  <p>So that I hope that if the matter be good the Form is as
good as the matter can be put into, and therefore we hope you
will allow us the benefit of it.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Attorney.</speaker>
                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I am of Counſel in
this Caſe for the King, and notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid I
take it with Submiſſion that this Plea is a naughty Plea, as a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49318:27"/>
Plea to your Juriſdiction, and there is no matter diſcloſed
therein that we can take a good Iſſue upon.</p>
                  <p>The great Subſtance of the Arguments of theſe Gentlemen
Aſſigned of Counſel for the Priſoner, is againſt the Priſoner.
For the great matter of their Arguments was leſt this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhould eſcape (which Arguments in ſeveral Inſtances they
have uſed to ſupport the Plea) but the Priſoner Pleads this Plea
to the purpoſe that he might eſcape. Therefore if theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
had taken Inſtructions from him, ſurely they would have
uſed Arguments to the ſame purpoſe that he might eſcape.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, they object we have admitted here that there is an
Impeachment depending, that we have admitted 'tis for the ſame
matter, and that we have admitted the Parliament to be in being,
but no Fact is admitted that is not well Pleaded. Indeed if that
be admitted that the Parliament is ſtill in being then it goes very
hard with us, and if not ſo admitted the whole force of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
his Argument falls to the ground. But I ſay my Lord,
with Submiſſion to this matter that the beginning, continuance,
Prorogation, Adjournments, and Diſſolution of Parliaments are
of publick Cognizance, and the Court <hi>ex Officio</hi> will take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, ſo that they need not be Averred. And ſo is the
41. of the Queen, the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s Caſe. A Private
Act of Parliament was Pleaded, and the day of the Parliament
miſtaken, there was a general Demurrer, and it was reſolved
that it was naught, and Judgment given againſt the Biſhop
though no Exception was taken in particular, becauſe the days
of the beginning and ending Parliaments are of publick Notice,
and the Judges take notice, when a Parliament is in being
and when not. That's a ſufficient Anſwer to that matter.</p>
                  <p>Then for thoſe many Cautions that have been given you, what
a difficult thing it is for two Juriſdictions to interfeir, Mr. <hi>Fitz
Harris</hi> is much concerned in that matter who hath forfeited his
Life to the Law as a moſt notorious Offendor that certainly
deſerves nothing but puniſhment, yet he would fain live a little
longer, and is much concerned that the Judicature of Parliament
ſhould be preſerved. If it be not Law he ſhall not be oppreſſed
in it, but if it be Law <hi>fiat Juſtitia.</hi> Certainly no Conſideration
whatſoever ought to put Courts of Juſtice out of their ſteady
Courſe, but they ought to proceed according to the Laws of
the Land.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I obſerve 'tis an unuſual Plea, and perhaps they
had ſome reaſon to put it ſo. It concludes <hi>ſi curia procedere
vult,</hi> I wonder they did not put in <hi>aut debeat,</hi> that is the uſual
form of ſuch Pleas for you have no Will but the Law, and if you
cannot give Judgment you ought not to be preſſed in it, but it
being according to Law that great Offendors and Malefactors
ſhould be brought to Condign puniſhment, we muſt preſs it
whatſoever the Conſequences are. And if we did not take it to
be the Intereſt of all the Kingdom, and of the Commons too
as well as of the King, my Lord, I ſhould not preſs it, but it is
all their Intereſt that ſo notorious a Malefactor that hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49318:28"/>
been Guilty of Treaſon in the higheſt Degree, and that
for the utmoſt Advancement of the late Popiſh Plot, ſhould not
eſcape or the truth be ſtifled, but brought into Examination in the
face of the Sun that all men may ſee what a Villanous thing
hath been Attempted to raiſe up the whole Kingdom againſt
the King, but they ſay if it be not Law you will not proceed,
it Ties your hands. But with Submiſſion they have not given
you one Inſtance to make good what they ſay. Many things
have been that a Plea pending in a Superiour Court is Pleadable
to the Juriſdiction of an Inferior Court; for my Lord, that is it
we put upon them to ſhew if it had been Pleaded in Abatement it
would have had its weight and been conſidered of, as in <hi>Sparry</hi>'s
Caſe where it was no Plea to the Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>Put the Caſe it had been a good Impeachment, and he had
been Arraigned upon it and acquitted, If he had afterwards come
to be Indicted in this Court, and the Priſoner will not plead this
in Bar but to the Juriſdiction of the Court, it would not have
been a good Plea? But he had loſt his Advantage by miſpleading:
If then an Arraignment, and an acquittal or Conviction thereupon
not a good Plea to the Juriſdiction; then certainly an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
depending ſingly cannot be a good Plea to the Juriſdiction.
This Court hath a full Juriſdiction of this Caſe and of this Perſon,
both of the Crime and of the party who is a Commoner and not
only to find the Indictment, but to proceed to Juſtice, and this
you had at the time of the fact Committed: For certainly we
need not put Caſes for to prove that the King's Bench eſpecially
ſince the Statute for trying Treaſon beyond the Seas hath an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Juriſdiction of all Perſons and Offences. Pray then what
is it that muſt out this Court of their Juriſdiction? For all the
Caſes that have been, or can be put about matters which are not
originally examinable in this Court, make not to the matter in
Queſtion, there 'tis true the Court may be by Plea outed of its
Juriſdiction as at Common Law, where a fact is done <hi>ſuper altum
mare,</hi> and ſo Pleaded, that puts it out of the Courts Juriſdiction,
and that was my Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> and Sir <hi>J. Eliots</hi> Caſe, and ſo
that was my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Caſe too, the fact was done out of
their Juriſdiction, and that may be Pleaded to the Juriſdiction,
becauſe they had no Original Juriſdiction of the fact, but where
the Crime and the Perſon were abſolutly within the Juriſdiction
of the Court, and the Court may Originally take Cognizance of
it, as this Court had of the preſent Caſe, I would fain know what
can out that Juriſdiction leſs than an Act of Parliament, I will be
bold to ſay the King by his Great-ſeal cannot do it, nor can an
Act of either Houſe, or both Houſes together without the King
out the Juriſdiction. To ſay their proceedings ought to be a Bar,
that is an other Caſe, the party hath his Advantage and may
plead it in abatement or Bar as the Caſe requires, for if there had
been an Acquittal or Conviction, the party could not plead it to
the Juriſdiction, Therefore for thoſe Caſes they put when you
come to examine the reaſon of them you ſee how they ſtand. <hi>viz.</hi>
that the Court had no Original Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:49318:28"/>
My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was committed by the Lords for a Crime in that Houſe, a
Contempt to that Houſe; he is brought here, and it appears to be a Commitment
in Execution. My Lord, that was out of your Juriſdiction; and if you had bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, what would you have done? would you have bailed him to be tryed here?
No, you could not do it, and therefore you proceeded not in that Caſe. And ſo
in the other Caſes; for there is not one of their Caſes that have been cited of the
other ſide, but where it was out of the Juriſdiction of the Court originally, and
not at all within it. As for the Caſe of the five Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> becauſe they
ſay it will have a mighty influence upon them, and they put the Caſe, That there
was in <hi>December</hi> an Indictment, and afterwards an Impeachment from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
and they cite ſome Opinion given at the Council-board, which I hope theſe
Gentlemen will not ſay was a Judicial Opinion, or any way affects this Cauſe: But
for that, my Lord, I obſerve the Lords took care that theſe Indictments ſhould be all
removed into the Lords Houſe; ſo they did foreſee that the King might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon the Indictments, if they had not been removed thither. But our Caſe
now is quite another thing: for thoſe Lords were not fully within your Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
You cannot try a Peer of the Realm for Treaſon: and beſides, the Lords have
pleaded in full Parliament, where, by the Law of Parliament, all the Peers are to be
their Judges; and ſo you can't out them of that Right. And the reaſon is plain,
becauſe thereby you muſt do them an apparent prejudice; they having pleaded
there, all the whole Peerage are their Tryers. But upon Tryal before Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
they muſt have but a ſelect number of Peers to be their Tryers. But in none
of thoſe Caſes hath any Judicial Opinion been given: for the Caſe of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. firſt
cited by Sir <hi>Fran. Winnington,</hi> and then by Mr. <hi>Pollexfen,</hi> a Declaration in Parliament,
That they proceeded according to the Law of Parliament, and not according to the
Common-Law, nor according to the practice of Inferiour Courts; that will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our purpoſe at all, that was in caſe of the Lords Appellants; a proceeding
contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> contrary to the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and the known Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Subject. But thoſe proceedings had a countenance in Parliament; for
there was an Oath taken by all the Lords in Parliament, That they would ſtand by
the Lords Appellants: And thereupon they would be controuled by none, and they
would not be adviſed by the Judges, but proceed to the trying of Peers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
according to their own will and pleaſure. And between that time of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
and 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. ſee what havock they made by thoſe illegal proceedings; and in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
you will ſee, that theſe very Lords were ſentenced, except one or two of them who
were pardoned: and then it was expreſly reſolved by Act of Parliament, That no
more Appeals of that nature, nor any Appeals whatſoever, ſhould be any more in
Parliament. And if ſo, theſe Gentlemen had beſt conſider how they make an
Impeachment like an Appeal; for in that Statute 'tis ſaid, There ſhall be no more
Appeals. And the Petition upon which this Act is founded, runs thus: They
pray that no Impeachment or Appeal may be in Parliament. But when the King
came to make the Grant, he grants onely for Appeals, and principally to out thoſe
Lords Appellants who were condemned by that very Parliament: So that 'tis a very
pretty matter at this time of day to liken an Impeachment to an Appeal.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, the other great point is this: There is nothing at all certainly
diſcloſed to you by this Plea; therefore there is nothing confeſſed by us, onely the
Fact that is well pleaded: therefore I ſhall come to conſider what is ſaid by them as
to the form of it. They ſay, my Lord, that they have pleaded it to be <hi>ſecundum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
&amp; Conſuetudinem Parliamenti;</hi> and if that be ſufficient, let them have ſaid what
they would, that would have healed all. But I ſay, my Lord, with ſubmiſſion, they
muſt diſcloſe to you what is the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament in ſuch caſe, or
elſe you muſt take it upon you upon your own knowledge, or you cannot give
Judgment. 'Tis very well known what this <hi>Lex &amp; Conſuetudo Parliamenti</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no
perſon verſed in the Records, but knows it, that by courſe of Parliament a Meſſage
goes up with a Declaration to impeach the party generally; and then after, there
are Articles or a Bill of Impeachment produced. Now till that be produced, ſure
there is no Counſel of the other ſide will ſay, that ever the party can be called to
anſwer. And becauſe theſe Gentlemen do pretend to urge their knowledge herein,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49318:29"/>
I would obſerve, there are three things to be conſidered of the Parliament; the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
part, the matters of Priviledge, and the Judicial part proper to this Caſe:
For the Legiſlative part, and matters of Priviledge, both Houſes do proceed onely
<hi>ſecundum legem &amp; Conſuetudinem Parliamenti;</hi> but for the Judicial part, does any
man queſtion, but that in all times they have been guided and directed by the
Statutes and Laws of the Land? and have been outed of a Juriſdiction in ſeveral
Caſes, as by the Statute of 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. And the Lords in all Writs
of Errour, and all matters of Judgment, proceed <hi>ſecundum legem Terrae;</hi> and ſo
for Life and Death. And there is not one Law in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-hall, as to matters
of Judgment, and another in the Court of the Lords above. But I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your Lordſhip any farther to purſue theſe things: But it is not ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
to you, that there is any ſuch thing as an Impeachment depending there; 'tis
onely alleadged, that he was impeached, and ſo much the News-book told us that
he was impeached: but to infer thence that there was an Impeachment carried up
and lodged for the ſame High-Treaſon, is no conſequence. And then 'tis alleadged,
<hi>Quae quidem Impetitio,</hi> when no Impeachment is before ſet forth, but onely that
he was impeached generally. And as I obſerved before, a perſon might go up with
a Meſſage to impeach, but that cannot be ſaid to be an Impeachment to which the
party is compelled to anſwer; it muſt be an Impeachment on Record, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on the face of the Record for what Crime it is; and ſo they ought to have ſet
it forth.</p>
                  <p>Now that this is too general that is alleadged here, I take it the Books are very
full. When a Record is pleaded in Bar or in Abatement, the Crimes ought to be
ſet out to appear the ſame; and ſo, my Lord, are all the Preſidents of <hi>Coke</hi>'s En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
53. <hi>Holdcroft</hi> and <hi>Burgh</hi>'s Caſe, and <hi>Watts</hi> and <hi>Brays</hi> Caſe in 41 and 42 of Q.
<hi>Eliz. Coke</hi>'s Ent. 59. <hi>Wrott</hi> and <hi>Wigg</hi>'s Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 45. and in <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica</hi>'s
Caſe, and <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Manning</hi>'s Caſe. The Record muſt be ſet out, that the
Court may judge upon it; and the Record muſt not be tryed <hi>per Pais,</hi> but by it
ſelf. But for what they ſay, plead it never ſo certainly, there muſt be an Averment,
it muſt be ſo 'tis true; but that is for another purpoſe than they urge it: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe if it be for another Fact that he hath committed, he may be indicted
again, though it be of the ſame nature; but whether of the ſame nature or not of
the ſame nature, is the thing muſt appear upon the Record pleaded, becauſe the
Court muſt be aſcertained that it was ſufficient for the party to anſwer to it: for
if it were inſufficient, he may be again proceeded againſt; as if an Indictment be
pleaded which was inſufficient, though the party pleads an Acquittal or Conviction
upon it, it will not avail him; for the Court will proceed on the other Indictment:
And ſo is the Reſolution in <hi>Vaulx</hi>'s Caſe, and in <hi>Wigg</hi>'s Caſe, though there was
a Judgment given of Acquittal, yet he was tryed again. So that, my Lord, that is one
great reaſon why it muſt appear, that the Court may judge whether it be ſufficient
for the party to anſwer. And you have now that here before you, if this be ſuch
an Impeachment as they have pleaded it, as this perſon could not anſwer to by any
Law of Parliament or other Court; then 'tis not ſufficient to out you of your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction:
And I do think that by no Law they are or can be compellable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a general Impeachment of High-Treaſon. And to give you authority in
that, there are many might be cited, as the Caſes of my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> and the other
Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſo is the ancient courſe of Parliament; with ſubmiſſion, I
will be bold to ſay, the Impeachments are all ſo, that ever I met with: And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by them, that they all conclude <hi>contra Coronam &amp; dignitatem Regis,</hi> in the form of
Indictments, laying ſome Overt-Acts and the ſpecial particular Crimes for which
the perſon is impeached, as Overt-Acts for Treaſon required by the Statute of
25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And I hope they will not ſay, That without an Overt-Act laid in the
Impeachment, the Impeachment can be good. If then this be ſo general that it
cannot make the Crime appear to the Court, and is ſo inſufficient that the Court
cannot give Judgment, I take it you will go on upon the Indictment, which char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him with a particular Crime.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> does put the caſe of Barretry where ſuch Averment is
allowable, but that is a ſpecial, certain, and particular Crime, but High-Treaſon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49318:29"/>
is <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot ſo; there are abundance of ſpecial ſorts of High-Treaſon, there is but one
ſort of Barretry, and there are no ſub-diviſions; therefore there is nothing to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred
but the ſpecial facts that make that Barretry.</p>
                  <p>Then there was another Authority out of the Book of Aſſizes cited by Sir <hi>Fra.
Winnington,</hi> and greatly relied upon: A man is indicted for the murder of <hi>J. S.</hi>
and afterwards for the murder of <hi>J. N.</hi> the former was pleaded to the ſecond with
an Averment that it is the ſame perſon, that is but according to the common form
of Averments, to be of matter of fact: For if <hi>J. S.</hi> was known as well by the
name of <hi>J. N.</hi> as of <hi>J. S.</hi> the Indictment was for the murder of the ſame perſon,
and there 'tis pure fact averred. But where 'tis Eſſential, as this caſe is, that the
particular Treaſon do appear, to ſay that it is the ſame particular Treaſon, and to
ſay that matter of fact aver'd ſhall enlarge a Record, I think, is impoſſible to be
found any where. And of all the Caſes that I have ſeen or heard, I confeſs none
of the Inſtances come up to it. For the Caſe in <hi>Moor, King,</hi> and <hi>Howard,</hi> cited by
Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> that is an authority as expreſly againſt him, that nothing
can be more: For if there be an Indictment for Felony in ſuch a particular act,
and then he is indicted again, he cannot come and plead a general Indictment
of Felony, and then aver 'tis for the particular Felony, and ſo to make the fact en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the Record, and put matter of Record to be tried by a Jury.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> was of opinion that upon this Averment the Jury may try the Fact.
What a pretty caſe would it be, that a Jury ſhould judge upon the whole Debates
of the Houſe of Commons whether it be the ſame matter or no; for thoſe Debates
muſt be given in evidence if ſuch an iſſue be tried. I did demur with all the care
that I could, to bring nothing of that in queſtion; but your Lorſhip knows
if they have never ſo much in particular againſt a man, when they come to make
good their Impeachment they muſt aſcertain it to a particular Crime; and the
Overt-acts muſt be alleadged in the Impeachment, or elſe there is another way to
hang a Subject than what is the Kings high-way all over <hi>England.</hi> And admit
there was an intimation of a purpoſe to Impeach, a Meſſage ſent up, and any
Judgement given thereupon, pray conſider what may be the conſequence as to the
Government; a very great matter depends upon this: if there be any Record of
that Parliament, then is the French Act gone; for ſo is the Reſolution in 12
<hi>Jacobi,</hi> where the Journal-book was full of proceedings, yet becauſe there was no
Judgement paſſed, nor no Record of a Judgement in a Writ of Errour, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
it no Seſſion; but if any Judgement had been given, then it had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
So that the conſequences of theſe things are not eaſily ſeen, when men
debate upon touchy matters.</p>
                  <p>But that which is before your Lordſhip is this point upon the pleading, and, I
conceive, I have anſwered all the Preſidents they have cited; therefore, my Lord, I
do take it, with ſubmiſſion, there is nothing of that matter before you concerning
an Impeachment depending before the Parliament; but whatſoever was done, 'tis
ſo imperfectly pleaded, that this Court cannot take any notice of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I ſhall endeavour to be ſhort, and ſhall confine my ſelf
(becauſe I am tender of your time) to the point in Queſtion; which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Plea be ſufficient in point of Form. There have been many things ſaid
on the other ſide, which I muſt crave leave to take notice of ſo far onely as to ſhew
they are not in queſtion before you. Thoſe are what relate to the matter of the
Plea; for they argue 'tis good both in matter and form; and from the matter of
the Plea they have taken occaſion to debate, whether a Commoner may be impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Whether this Court hath power to judge of the priviledges and courſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?
none of which Queſtions will ariſe upon our caſe now. Therefore I
will not now debate whether <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which hath ordained that every man
ſhall be tried by his Peers, and the Statute of 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which ſays, that the
Lords ſhall not be compelled, nor ſhall have power to give Judgement upon a
Commoner, have ſufficiently ſecured the Liberty of the Subject from Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nor is it the queſtion before your Lordſhip, whether you ſhall judge of
any matter that is a right or priviledge of Parliament; here is nothing before you
that was done in Parliament; but this is an Indictment for High-Treaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49318:30"/>
by <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in this County. Now, my Lord, as that is not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
neither will it be the Queſtion, Whether an Impeachment depending in the
Houſe of Lords againſt a Commoner, by the Houſe of Commons, will bar this
Court of its Juriſdiction. For though they have entred upon it, and debated it
at large, and ſeemed to obviate the Objections made to that if it had been a
Queſtion; as by ſaying that the King hath no Election, becauſe this is not the ſuit
of the King, but the ſuit of the Subject. I will not now <hi>ex inſtituto</hi> argue that
point; but I will humbly offer a few things to your Lordſhips conſideration, and
I ſhall take my hints from them. They ſay the Houſe of Commons are the grand
Inqueſt of the Nation, to enquire of Treaſons and other high Crimes, and they
make theſe Preſentments to the Houſe of Lords. Now when ſuch a Preſentment is
made, 'tis worthy conſideration whether it be not a Preſentment for the King; for
an Impeachment does not conclude as an Appeal does, but <hi>contra Ligeantiae ſuae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum,
&amp; Coronam &amp; Dignitatem Domini Regis,</hi> ſo far 'tis the Kings ſuit. In an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
the Witneſſes for the Priſoner are not ſworn, the Priſoner hath not
Councel for his life in matter of Fact, as in caſes of Appeal at the ſuit of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
he hath. The King may pardon part of the Sentence, it was done ſo in <hi>Rich.</hi>
the 2<hi>d</hi>'s time, and it was done ſo lately in my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe; but take it
for a ſuppoſition that it is the ſuit of the People, yet that cannot preclude the
King from his ſuit neither; for at Common Law before the Statute of 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.
where a man had an Appeal for Murder, the King had not his hands tied up, not
to proceed upon the Indictment; it had been uſed ſo, I do agree, and ſo 'tis reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it had been uſed ſo, in the Statute of 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. but there was no poſitive
Law for it, nor could it have been pleaded in bar of an Indictment, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
was within the year, but the King uſed to ſtay out the year in favour of
that ſuit. But ſince the Statute the uſe is otherwiſe; and the reaſon why they
proceed immediately is, becauſe now an Acquittal or an Attainder upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
is no bar to the Appeal, but the party may go on in his Appeal. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this, becauſe the conſequence which they urge as ſuch a diſmal one, will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
which is, What if he ſhould be acquitted here, he could not plead <hi>auter foits
acquit,</hi> ſo would be twice brought in jeopardy for the ſame offence: For it is the
ſame in all Caſes of Appeals, a man comes in jeopardy twice if he be indicted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the year, and attainted or acquitted within the year, it is no bar to the Appeal.
But this is not like the Caſe of an Appeal for Murder neither, for though it hath been
uſed diſcretionarily in the Court to ſtay the Suit of the King, and to prefer the
Suit of the Subject, it was then becauſe the Subject had the firſt and neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
as the Son in the death of his Father, and it did moſtly concern him to
proſecute it. The King is concerned as the Fountain of Juſtice onely, to bring
Offenders to condigne puniſhment; but the neareſt damage, and the firſt
to be prefer'd, was that of the party who had loſt his Relation. Now the
reaſon of that turns quite contrary here: For as in that Caſe the Subject had the
neareſt concern in the loſs of his Father, and ſo was beſt intituled to the Suit;
ſo in this Caſe that very reaſon will have the Kings Suit to be prefer'd; for there
is no Treaſon but againſt the King, and in Treaſon againſt himſelf, the King has
the neareſt concern, and the wrong is primarily and originally to himſelf. And
the Subjects damage is but a conſequence of that, as all hurt to the King muſt needs
hurt the people. So the Kings Suit is to be prefer'd here, as the Subjects was in
the other Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Objection that has been made, that if you try this man, upon
the ſame reaſon you may try the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Their Caſe is different, as
has been already obſerved by Mr. <hi>Attorney;</hi> And that which has been done by
the Lords in that caſe, to me does rather ſeem to imply that this Trial may be in
this caſe. For if the Lords after an Impeachment brought up againſt the five Lords
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and after the ſpecial matter in the Articles which does aſcertain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what they do proceed, have thought fit notwitſtanding to remove the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by <hi>Certiorari</hi> into Parliament, (for ſo it was in fact) that no proſecution might be
upon them, then certainly they thought the Kings Court might proceed without
doing ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49318:30"/>
My Lord, I will mention no more upon this matter, but leave it to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
conſideration: But as to the form of the Plea I do conceive, with ſubmiſſion,
'tis not a formal Plea.</p>
                  <p>We know here of no form of pleading an Indictment, but what does ſet forth
the Indictment particularly; the Preſidents are ſo, 'tis ſo in <hi>Vaulx</hi>'s Caſe, and all
the Preſidents that I have ſeen; ſo is the Preſident in <hi>Raſt.</hi> Ent. where in an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
the Defendant waged Battle, the Plaintiff replies he was formerly indicted, he
ſets forth the Indictment particularly. All the Preſidents are ſo, and the Law-Books
reſolve it muſt be ſo, as <hi>Wrott</hi> and <hi>Wigg</hi>'s Caſe, where the Defendant in an
Appeal of Murder by the Wife pleads, that he was indicted for Manſlaughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Coroner of the Verge, and Coroner of the County, for killing the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
at <hi>Shepperton</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and had his Clergy with reference
to the Record, and the uſual Averments; with this farther, that he averred that
<hi>Shepperton</hi> at the time of the Indictment and Death was within the Verge. To
which the Plaintiff demurred, and Judgement for the Plaintiff. Now two things
are reſolved by this Judgement.</p>
                  <p>1. That 'tis neceſſary to ſet forth the whole Record of the Indictment, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they ought not to have given Judgement for the Plaintiff, by reaſon the
Indictment was inſufficient, as 'twas pleaded, (in that it did not ſay that <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perton</hi>
was within the Verge, which was neceſſary to intitle the Coroner of the
Verge to a Juriſdiction) becauſe being pleaded with reference to the Record up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Nul tiel</hi> Record pleaded, and the Record thereupon brought in, that defect
might have been cured.</p>
                  <p>2. That no Averment of Fact can ſupply that which ſhould appear upon Record,
therefore the Averment that <hi>Shepperton</hi> was within the Verge did not mend the
matter, though confeſt by the Demurrer as much as it is in this caſe, that 'tis the
ſame Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay there is a difference between this Caſe and thoſe which I have put;
for that 'tis the courſe of Parliament (of which your Lordſhips muſt take notice)
to impeach general, ſo they could not have pleaded otherwiſe than they have
done, unleſs they had pleaded it otherwiſe than the Caſes was; this reaſon holds
rather the other way: for if in any Caſe ſuch a general way of pleading with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Record were to be admitted, it were in caſe of an Indictment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Court knows there is no Indictment but what does particularly ſet forth
the Felony, which when produced, is capable of being applied; but here if the
Record be brought in, 'twill no more aſcertain the matter of the Impeachment
than the Plea does already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whereas they ſay your Lordſhip is bound to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the courſe of Parliament, ſo your Lordſhip will take notice too, that 'tis not
the courſe of Parliaments to try any man upon ſuch a general Impeachment. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of any man (I ſpeak it with ſubmiſſion to them that know better) that
was brought to plead Not guilty upon a general Impeachment of High-Treaſon;
that is, upon the Commons bare ſaying, We do impeach ſuch an one of High-Treaſon.
I know none that ever was brought to anſwer that general Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Lord, as the Plea is nought for not ſetting out the Record, ſo is
the Averment, with ſubmiſſion, inſufficient too. For though he does aver that
the Treaſon in the Indictment and the Treaſon for which he was impeached, are
one and the ſame, and not divers Affirmatively and Negatively; yet as this Caſe
is, he ought to have ſaid, that the Treaſon for which he is indicted, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
mentioned in the Impeachment, is one and the ſame: For if he was impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
generally for High-Treaſon without mention of particulars, it is impoſſible
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49318:31"/>
to be reduced to a certainty: So 'tis an Averment of a Fact not capable to be
tried.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe, with ſubmiſſion to theſe Gentlemen that have ſaid it, the Debates
of the Houſe of Commons are not to be given in Evidence, and made publick to
a Jury; nay, they are not always poſſible to be reduced to a certainty, as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
may be; for they do not always particularly reſolve upon what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
they will accuſe before they go up, but a general Allegation ſerves the
turn: So that ſuch Averment is not triable <hi>per Pais,</hi> becauſe as the Caſe may be,
it may not be capable of any certainty from the Debates of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is, becauſe by this way of pleading, Proceedings may be ſtaid for
Treaſon, though ſubſequent to the Impeachment, which no man yet has preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ſay: For ſuppoſe now a general Impeachment lodg'd, and a Treaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
committed by the party, I think no man will ſay that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
when they bring up their ſpecial matters cannot make even this ſubſequent
Treaſon an Article upon that Impeachment, neither can it be ſaid that ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
as this is upon ſuch Plea pleaded to an Indictment here below would be
repugnant, becauſe there is no time at all laid in the Impeachment as 'tis here
pleaded, nor no time when the Impeachment was brought up, ſo that it cannot
appear to the Court whether the Treaſon in the Indictment be ſubſequent or
not, the conſequence of which is, we muſt try whether the Houſe of Commons
upon this general Impeachment did intend to proceed to try him for a fact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
after the Impeachment carried up. My Lord, this would be to affirm, that
a man once impeached in Parliament ſhall never be tried for any offence; it would
be like that <hi>Privilegium Clericale</hi> which they made uſe of to exempt themſelves
from puniſhment for all offences.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, we do think upon the whole matter without entring upon the
Debate, whether a particular Impeachment lodged in the Houſe of Lords does
preclude the King from his proceedings: We have a good Caſe upon this Plea,
for that is not a Queſtion neceſſary to be reſolved, though it be not granted by
the King neither. But the Queſtion is, whether this be a formal Plea, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here be ſufficient matter ſet forth upon a Record to bring that other matter
into queſtion, and tie up the hands of the Court.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, there hath been already enough ſpoken in this Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I ſhall deſire onely to offer one word to that ſingle point <hi>(viz.)</hi> the informality of
the Plea; which I take to be the ſole Queſtion in this Caſe, for to argue whether
becauſe there was no Bill paſs'd, or Decree made in the Houſe of Lords (though
the Articles had been carried up) the Impeachment did not fall to the ground by
the Diſſolution, I conceive altogether improper; for I think it does not affect the
Queſtion, though I deſire to take notice that Sir <hi>Fr. Win.</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,</hi>
were all miſtaken: for there were no ſuch Conceſſions made by any of the
Kings Counſel the other day, as they alleadge, becauſe we did not think it to be the
Queſtion, and therefore made no diſcourſes about it.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, I deſire firſt to take notice of a Caſe or two that hath been cited
on the other ſide, and then I ſhall apply my ſelf to that which is the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you at this time. They cite the Caſe of the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> as a Judgment
for them, which ſeems to be a Judgment againſt them; for by the Lords granting
a <hi>Certiorari</hi> to remove the Judgments into Parliament, they ſeem to be of opinion,
that notwithſtanding they were impeached before the Lords, yet there might haue
been proceedings below upon thoſe Indictments, had not they been removed, and
there they remain to this day; nay further, to thoſe Impeachments they have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49318:31"/>
to Iſſue, which is ready for a Tryal. But in the Caſe at Bar, there onely is an
Accuſation, without any further proceedings thereupon.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that makes ſtrongly for us, as I conceive.
Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi>'s opinion was taken notice of by Sir <hi>Fran. Winnington,</hi> that they
would not meddle by any means with matters depending in Parliament: But I
muſt remember, he then gave this reaſon for his opinion, becauſe the Parliament was
then in being. And I muſt humbly put your Lordſhip in mind, that the whole
Court did then declare, That if the Parliament had been diſſolved, they would have
ſaid ſomething more to that Caſe. I do not ſay, that they would have given ſuch
or ſuch a Judgment, but I attended at the Bar at that time, and I appeal to the
memory of the Court, if the Court did not then make ſuch a Declaration.</p>
                  <p>But now to the Queſtion: Without all peradventure, the Caſes cited by <hi>Mr.
Pollex<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en</hi> are true. If I bring a general <hi>Indebitarus aſſumpſit</hi> for Wares ſold and
delivered, and after bring a particular <hi>Indebitatus aſſumpſit</hi> for ſuch and ſuch
Wares, naming the particulars, the party may come and plead in Bar, and aver
'tis for the ſame thing; and 'tis a good Averment, becauſe there is ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſet forth in the Record to ſupport ſuch an Averment: For the doubt is onely,
whether the particular Goods mentioned in the ſecond, be not the ſame that
were intended under thoſe general words (Goods and Merchandizes) in the
firſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe there had been onely an account brought, and no declaration put in,
could then the Defendant have pleaded ſuch a Plea with ſuch an Averment, when
there was not ſufficient matter of Record ſet forth in their pleading, whereby the
Court might be able to give a Judgment, or put it into a way of Tryal whether it
was for the ſame or not?</p>
                  <p>And is it not ſo in this Caſe? there being but a bare Accuſation: For I ſtill
keep to the informality of the pleading, and I take it not to be ſuch a dangerous
Caſe, as theſe Gentlemen of the other ſide do pretend, for you to determine it:
For I am ſure it will be better for the Court to anſwer, if ever they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that they have performed their Duty and done Juſtice according to their
Conſciences and their Oaths, than ever to be afraid of any Threats or Bug<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>s
from the Bar.</p>
                  <p>For would not they by this manner of pleading, put upon your Lordſhips a
difficulty to judge, without any thing contained in the Impeachment to guide your
Judgment, whether the Priſoner be impeached for the ſame thing for which he is
indicted? May not the Treaſon intended in this Impeachment be for Clipping
or Coyning of Money? for 'tis generally ſaid to be onely for High-Treaſon. How
comes this then to be help'd ſo as to be any way iſſuable, and be tryed? Shall it
be by that way which Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> laid down, that if Mr. Attorney had taken Iſſue,
the Jury muſt have tryed the Queſtion by having the Debates of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
given in Evidence? Certainly that cannot be, my Lord. If there were but
one ſort of Treaſon, there might be ſome colour for this ſort of pleading; but
there are divers kinds of Treaſons, and how is it capable to be tryed? who can
prove the intentions of the Houſe of Commons, before they are come to a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
and therefore cannot be given in Evidence, or be regularly brought into
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we rely upon the informali<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y and uncertainty of the pleading onely,
and meddle not with the Queſtion, whether an Impeachment in the Houſe of
Lords ſuperſedes an Indictment in the <hi>Kings-bench;</hi> for we ſay, the have not
pleaded it ſo ſubſtantially, as to enable the Court to judge upon the Queſtion: and
therefore we pray your Lordſhips Judgment, that the Plea may be over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fran. Withins.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, there has been ſo much of your time already taken
up by thoſe Gentlemen that have argued before me, that I ſhall be very ſhort in
what I have to ſay.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is not at this time, how far forth the Commons in Parliament
may impeach or not impeach a Commoner, before the Lords in Parliament, or
where the Lords may admit or not admit of ſuch Impeachments; that is not the
Caſe here, as I humbly conceive, nor will I meddle with it: I ſhall onely ſpeak to
the validity of the Plea according to the Law. Now I ſay that this Plea of the
Priſoner as thus pleaded, cannot be good to out this Court of Juriſdiction: For
firſt, the Priſoner cannot be admitted to make the Averment in this Plea, that the
Treaſon mentioned in the Impeachment in Parliament, and that contained in
this Indictment, is the ſame; for if, as the Gentlemen that argued on the other
ſide urg'd, that this Court muſt take notice of the Proceedings and Law of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
then you will take notice that no perſon is there tryed upon a general
Impeachment of Treaſon. Special Articles are always firſt exhibited: In this
Caſe then either the Houſe of Commons have carried up ſpecial Articles againſt
the Priſoner to the Lords in Parliament, or not; if the Houſe has done it, then
the Plea might have been pleaded better by ſetting forth the Articles (which is
part of what they ſay on the other ſide, that it could be pleaded no better) for
then it would have appeared plainly whether the Treaſon were the ſame or not.
If the Articles are not carried up, ſhall it lie in the mouth of any particular perſon
to ſay what Articles the Commons in Parliament would have carried up? Shall
any ſingle perſon be admitted to ſay what the Houſe would have done, before the
Houſe it ſelf ſays it? In Caſes of Impeachments, it lies in the Diſcretion and
Judgment of the Commons upon Debate to exhibit what Articles they in their
Wiſdoms ſhall think fit; and ſure it ſhall never come, that any particular perſon
ſhall limit them to this or that particular Treaſon before-hand; no ſurely.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſe in ſuch a Caſe as this, after ſuch a Plea pleaded, the Commons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deliberation ſhould carry up Articles quite different, ſuch a Plea then would
appear to be a ſtark lye, and the pleading and allowing of it, an apparent delay
of Juſtice. So that I conceive, my Lord, the Priſoner ſhall by no means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
(nor indeed can it be) to aver the intention of the Houſe of Commons,
(which cannot be tryed) before they have declared it themſelves: and therefore I
conceive the Plea to be naught for that reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, I conceive that the Priſoners Plea is ill for another reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Court in this Caſe, by any thing expreſſed in this Plea, cannot diſcern
nor take notice whether it be the ſame Treaſon or not.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why the Record, as this Caſe is, ought to be alleadged ſpecially,
is becauſe the matter contained in it may plainly appear to the Court, and then by
that means the Court might judge whether it be the ſame Treaſon or not. Now
Treaſon generally alleadged in the Impeachment, is the Genus, and the particular
Treaſon mentioned in the Indictment is onely a Species, and the Averment in the
Plea is, that the Genus and the Species is the ſame, which is abſurd, and if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
tends to hoodwink and blind the Court inſtead of making the matter plain
for their judgement.</p>
                  <p>Pleas ought to be plain and certain, becauſe the Court upon them alleadged, is
to judge either of mens Eſtates or Lives; and for that reaſon the matter ought to
come plainly and fairly before them, that wrong may be done to neither party by
reaſon of the obſcureneſs or doubtfulneſs of the Allegation: if therefore a Hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink
be brought inſtead of a Plea it ought not to be allowed. And therefore for
theſe reaſons (for what I have farther to ſay has been already ſaid by others) I
conceive it ought to be overruled. I humbly ſubmit it to the Court.</p>

Blood, we were willing to hear all you could ſay, that you might not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſay, but that you were fully heard on all ſides. But in truth, I
muſt tell you, you have ſtarted a great many things that are not in the
Caſe at all. We have nothing to do here, whether the Commons Houſe at
this day can Impeach for Treaſon any Commoner in the Houſe of Lords,
we have nothing to do with this, what the Lords Juriſdiction is, nor with
this point, whether an Impeachment in the Lords Houſe (when the Lords
are poſſeſſed fully of the Impeachment) does barr the bringing any Suit, or
hinder the proceeding in an Inferior Court: But here we have a Caſe
that riſes upon the pleadings; whether you have brought here before us a
ſufficient Plea to take away the Juriſdiction of the Court, as you have
pleaded it, that will be the ſole point that is before us: And you have
heard what exceptions have been made to the form, and to the matter of
your pleading. We do ask you again, Whether you think you are able to
mend your Pleading in any thing, for the Court will not catch you, if
you have any thing wherein you can amend it, either in matter or form?
If you will let us know it we ſhall conſider of it; But if you have not, if you
abide by this Plea, then we do think 'tis not reaſonable, nor will be expected of
us in a matter of this conſequence to give our Judgment concerning this Plea
preſently. All the Caſes cited concerning Facts done in Parliament, and where
they have endeavoured to have them examined here, are nothing to the purpoſe
at all. For plainly, we do not aſſume to our ſelves a Juriſdiction to inquire of
ſuch matters, for words ſpoken, or Facts done in the Commons-Houſe, or in
the Lords, we call none to queſtion here, nor for any thing of that nature which
takes off moſt of the Inſtances you have given; but our Queſtion is barely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the pleading before us, whether we have a ſufficient pleading of ſuch an
Impeachment as can forecloſe the hands of the Court? And as to that we ſhall
take ſome reaſonable time to conſider of it; we will not precipitate in ſuch a
Caſe; but deliberate well upon it before we give our Judgment. Take back
your Priſoner.</p>

                  <p>Why? Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> you have been Arraigned here for High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and it is for endeavouring and compaſſing the Kings death, and other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſpecially mentioned in this Indictment; you have pleaded here to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of this Court, that there was an Impeachment againſt you by the
Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, before the Lords for the Crime of High-Treaſon,
and you do ſay that that Impeachment is yet in force, and you do
ſay by way of averment, that this Treaſon whereof you are now Indicted, and
the Treaſon whereof you were Impeached by the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> before
the Lords, are one and the ſame Treaſon. And upon this the <hi>Attorney General,</hi>
for the King, hath Demurred, and you have joyned in Demurrer. And we have
here the arguments of your Counſel, whom we aſſigned to argue it for you;
we have heard them at large, and have conſidered of your Caſe among our
ſelves, and upon ſtill conſideration and deliberation concerning your Caſe, and
all that hath been ſaid by your Counſel, and upon conference that we have had
with ſome other of the Judges, we are three of us of Opinion that your Plea is
not ſufficient to bar this Court of its Juriſdiction, my Brother <hi>Jones,</hi> my Brother
<hi>Raymond,</hi> and my Self are of Opinion that your Plea is inſufficient, my Brother
<hi>Dolben</hi> not being reſolved, but doubting concerning it: And therefore the Court
does order and award, That you ſhall anſwer over to this Treaſon.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> When you propoſed a difficulty you had in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Law, the Court were willing to aſſigne you Counſel; becauſe 'tis known
you cannot be a fitting perſon to adviſe your ſelf concerning the Law. But as
to this, we cannot aſſigne you Counſel; 'tis only a matter of Fact, whether
you be Guilty, or not Guilty? Therefore in this Caſe you can't have Counſel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to adviſe you.</p>

you had ſome ſcruples of Conſcience, and that you were now become
another man, and would reveal and diſcover the whole of this deſign and Plot,
that you are ſaid to be Guilty of here; but you have trifled ſeveral times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, and we can ſay nothing concerning that now; we muſt now have
your Plea; if afterwards you have a mind to confeſs and be ingenious, you may
do it; but now you muſt either plead, or not plead.</p>

If he have any thing to offer, he may do it publickly, in the face of Juſtice. And

here; and I do not know what ſurprize he can complain of. As to the
Witneſs he tells you of that is in <hi>Holland,</hi> he doth not tell you to what purpoſe
he is a Witneſs; ſo that you may know whether it be material or not. I know
very well, my Lord, in the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> when the Prieſts did urge it, that they
had Witneſſes beyond Sea in other Countreys, they were not ſuffered to delay
their Trial upon ſuch a pretence. We muſt ſubmit it to your Lordſhip's diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

inable him to have what Witneſſes he doth pretend to have.</p>

allowed to come and ſpeak to me, tho' I had a Rule for him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you, as to your Counſel now, which was the main Reaſon
why you prayed a Solicitor, we cannot allow you them any more; for now
We are come to a matter of Fact only, and we cannot by the Rules of Law
allow you Counſel. Therefore what need you have of a Solicitor, I cannot
tell; his buſineſs before, was to go from you to the Counſel, and from them to
you, which is ceaſed now. But this, Mr. Attorny, if he have a deſire to ſee
Papers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would ſend for any Papers that concern his Defence, ſo as they
contain no new Treaſonable matters and Contrivances, he ought ſure to have
them; and if he have Papers at his Houſe, or any where elſe, which he deſires
to make uſe of in his own Defence, being inſpected by the Lieutenant, to ſee
that there be no matter of evil contained in them, he may have one to do that
for him without any danger.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not oppoſe it, My Lord; But I deſire that all Caution
may be uſed that can be; for this Solicitor of his is a Lawyer, and writes Tracts
of Law; but any thing material for his Defence I am not againſt.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Attorney, You need not fear any harm will be that ways; for
he is not to ſpeak with him alone.</p>

And the Courſe of the Court ſhall be obſerved. But I doubt how we can.</p>
