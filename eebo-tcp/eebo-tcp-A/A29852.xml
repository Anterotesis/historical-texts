         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat intercourse between the <hi>Lo: Digby</hi> and my self (fed on their side with hope of prevailing, and on mine with hope of fortifying by the Defign we had upon each other) is happily (I blesse God) on our side, and with rage and fury on theirs, brought to a period. It hath been in the womb ever since the 14. of <hi>September,</hi> as soon as it was quick, I gave Your Excellency and the <hi>Committee</hi> of both Kingdoms notice of it, and ever since have (for fear of Abortion) born it with some difficulty the full time, and not miscarryed, till it gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and big, that it delivered it self.</p>
            <p>VVhen the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> savv it was born with an honest face, and nothing like the Brat which he hoped for, he presently would have made it away, by the poison of his last forged Letter, which is so full of malice, that I wonder he burst not with it, before he could have time to vent it: I do believe <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> where he hath grown, afford not a more dangerous Drug then this of his last Letter, wherein Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istically and wickedly by his Forgery, he (as it were) defies the God of Heaven, and hates Truth perfectly.</p>
            <p>My Lord, were it not that I dare not conceal this mans impiety and cruelty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd in his last, I should be content for my own part, to conceal all his Flattery and Folly, express'd in his former Letters, But I am not my own, but the Kingdoms Servant; and therefore, though I be but a bad VVriter, I hold it my duty to give

            <p>IT seems (by the Story) that when the Enemy had done what he could in the West, and was ready to return, It was fancied, <hi>That Abingdon, as weak as it was, might be made theirs again by Policy rather then Power, and my self won out of it by good words, sooner then warr'd out of it</hi>; And therefore, in <hi>September</hi> last, they made use of a spirituall Engine, one Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> sometimes a Preacher in <hi>London,</hi> now (as it appears) a great Clerk at <hi>Oxford</hi>; This man being my former acquaintance, by reason of some remote alliance, took opportunity, by a Trumpet, who came from thence about Exchange of Prisoners, to send me this Letter:</p>

            <p>Vpon this I acquainted some friends about me, with the Request, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and Qualities of the man, and then sent a Passe, which brought him on our Lecture day: when he came I received him courteously; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to Preach, but was denyed; he dined with me and some of my Officers, and at last, upon his going away, desired a word or two with me privatly, and then he falls upon the Errand (which it seems he was sent on) and wisheth me on their side, laying about him, and lavishing out his breath in paintings and flatteries at random.</p>

your owne principles in that which you your selfe think honest, (how erroneously soever) but rather from some new and greater corruption of interest on that side, then what was proposed unto you on this, whereof I make no doubt but the world will be a right Iudge, when by the publishing what hath passed between us, it shall appear how industriously and how mercenarily you long courted your own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption before I ever provoked you to it, and offer'd to you those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which I did, as to a prostituted, not solicited person, who hence forwards must necessarily be infamous of all sides; on this, both s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </opener>
                     <p>IN the first place I must extreamly lament the unlucky burning (by chance) of the Cipher, wherein all my former Letters, but only those which were meant sor your well-serv'd masters supervizing, were written; whereby I am constrained to venture these mysteries without a vaile, which I should not have done, but that the necessity of this instant time presseth it; and that I am as confident as I can be of any thing, that this will come safe to your hands.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I must chide you for hazarding in your Cousin <hi>Bernards</hi> packet that other paper of yours, which was so little meant for his sight. But your Letter of defiance which I read out to him, made him so mad, that he observed not my <hi>Cleanly Conveyance</hi> away of the Treasure within it. For truly I cannot give any other name to that which conteined so admirable contrivance and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the principall Scene of our Act.</p>
                     <p>You know my opinion from the beginning, that <hi>I</hi> valued <hi>Abington</hi> but as a sleight part of those services (which if your reputation and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:123412:18"/>
trust with your masters could bee by any act upheld) his Majes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y might expect from a person of your dexterity and interests; and therefore I willingly consented to the designe of seeming to make those with whom you were to improve the confidence of you, privy to all our Negotiations with me, though with the inconvenience of making the Surrender of <hi>Abington</hi> somewhat more difficult, and lesse seasonable by the delay.</p>
                     <p>But I must confesse to you, with an unfained pleasure, to be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celd, that it was beyond my skill to finde out such a way (as that which you resolve on, by blowing up so artificially your Magazine) to make <hi>Abington</hi> the Kings upon such Conditions, as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ght let you march away unsuspected and unblemisht in your power, to doe his Majesty those greater services aymed at by you.</p>
                     <p>I will enlarge no further, then to assure you, that the time and houre upon the blazing signe given, shall be punctually observed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your agreement, with our incomparable Engineer <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whose escape so artificially and so unsuspectedly, as to your having any hand in it hath succeeded even to a Miracle.</p>

                        </gap>ise any difficulty unforeseene in the course proposed, and that there should need a nearer approach of our Forces, either for assault or surprize, direct your pleasure to <hi>Beckman,</hi> by the conveyance agreed on by you, and it shall be punctually executed; for there is no roome for distrust when there are such Hostages given; of which take it upon my word, the one (your friend) shall be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I must not conclude without admiring your incomparable Letter of defiance, which as if it were to prevent the scornes being first put upon me at London, I have in great rage caused to be printed here with my Eloquent Answer, which I send you here inclosed, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented (with moderate insulting) unto your masters, to whom certainly the world could not have furnished you with a pleasanter endearment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The scope of it is to possesse the world, that I had appointed him time and manner of betraying Abington, notwithstanding my Letter of defiance; I knew God would blesse me with an opportunity which would seriously sooner or later by action confute it, and in the interim, laughing at his miserable shifts to heale himselfe and wound me, I shut up with him merrily, and returned this, which left him speechlesse.</p>

                  <p>Sir, my Magazine is safe, and will be when your dishonourable underground dealings shall bee blown up; within these few dayes you may expect a Blaze, but it must be of this machination of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, wherein your Honour shall goe for the <hi>Faux</hi> and the <hi>Garnet,</hi> (I finde you can personate them both) against the Kingdom; and at such a time as now when you feared his Majesty (who I know hath

                  <p>You say <hi>Bernard</hi> saw not your cleanly conveyance; I am glad they take your Lordship for a Iugler in Oxon, they have done in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a long time; but being your Familiar, I much wonder he should not know your tricks.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry your Honour should be his Majesties Hocus Pocus, and have the knack of cleanly conveyance. Now the world may see which way the King was conveyed from London, the jewels beyond Sea, the Irish Rebels brought over; which way so many overtures of peace have appeared and vanished, surely by my Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> trick of cleanly conveyance. Play above board, my Lord, that is fittest for a Councell Table.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I tax you now for your incomparable base <hi>Beckmans</hi> escape, I verily think he got away by one of your Lordships tricks of cleanly conveyance. You upbraid me much with my Masters, my Lord they will answer for themselves, and it is unworthily done to scoffe at them whom your Master and mine calls his Parliament againe whether you will or no; and to them I referre you, who are fit to judge of such language.</p>
                  <p>If I were a Prostitute, my Lord, as you call me, why did your Honour act the Pimp, and offer me a reward with such sollicitations so frequently, so hotly, so long a while? Let the world judge of your wooings, which since they faile, I look now your force should venture upon a rape.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, you say at Oxford, that Londoners can preach (which is more then we can say of you againe, the rest therefore shall bee wholsome exhortation.) Doe not destroy a Noble mans soule, pity your selfe, though not the Kingdome, and let the feare of God bee in you to expell forgeries, even for your owne (if not yours) for his Majesties sake and honour, who hath taken you so neare to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for if you counterfeit hands and seales of Subjects, it will be historied that you were not chast to his. For my selfe, you see my Lord, this Plot of yours is so farre from molesting my thoughts, that it makes them merry; for I serve a God and a Cause which shall

            <p>Since this Conclusion, they sent a party of 200 to fortifie a house of Mr Speakers two or three miles from us; as soone as I had notice, I sent out some of ours, who took, the house upon Composition, and there unexpectedly we found <hi>Beckman</hi> their Swedish Engineer, who being my prisoner before, made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
