            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I your loving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearing to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deserted of my glorious Spouse the Lord Iesus, and to be childles hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, haue weeped sore in the night this time bypast my teares are on my cheekes; Among all my lovers few to comfort mee, my friendes haue dealt treacherously with me, they are become my enemies, Lament. 1. 2. So would ye my dear children dolefully cry out: The joy of our heart is ceased, our daunce is turned into mourning, the crown is fallen from our heads, woe unto us that we haue sinned, Lament. 5. 15. 16. If ye were touched with the sense and feeling of your present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and could by the thick shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of this evening be brought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7573:3"/>
to consider the comfortles desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that approaching night of darknes, after so bright a day of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation. But so much the more dangerous is defection, and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of iniquitie the more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that it proceeds from so subtile beginnings as to your simplicitie ar almost insensible.</p>
            <p>It is not time then for me your dolorous mother to keepe silence. But love and feare presse me to put you in minde, that it hath been in all ages the holy disposition &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py practise of all Gods people way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the appearing of Iesus their Lord, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring the weal of his spouse, and taking to hart the aeternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own soules; to set<note place="margin">A three fold consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of every Christian, ap plyed to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and tyme.</note> continually before their eyes. 1. His inaestimable goodnes towardes his Kirk. 2. Her case and condition, while she is militant here on earth. And 3. in consideration of the one and the other, the duetie required and expected at their handes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7573:3"/>
in the goodnes of God they have beene safe from that dreadfull ruine, that hath overtaken the wicked. And which I wish you my beloved children to escape by calling to minde in like manner at this tyme of your danger and my distresse. First how wonderfull the Lordes mercies have been towards me his Kirk in this nation. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie my present case crying with the complaints of a mother for help at your hands. And thirdly what is due from your affection, places, and callings to me, in whose wombe ye were conceived, and by whose care ye are brought up to that which ye now are. <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is commanded by the God of heaven, it may be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven. For why should he be wroth against the realme of the King and his sonnes, Ezra</hi> 7. 23. And that Christ may say to me yet once againe: <hi>Thou art beautifull my love as Tirzah,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7573:4"/>
comelie as Ierusalem, terrible as an army with banners. Cant.</hi> 6. 3. Words and motions of this sort as they have been, so they will be but oyle to feede the fire of the furie of such ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diaries, as make their own earthlie particulars their highest projects; for the wicked shall doe wickedlie and none of them shall understand; yet by the grace of God manie shalbe purified and tryed &amp; the wise shall understand. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test wisdome of the greatest of you in other matters; and your gracious countenance towards me, and the meanest of your brethren at other tymes, suffereth me not to doubt of your audience of any message or motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from heaven; but especiallie be my mouth, which may either dis cover, or prevent anie spirituall or temporall danger. Now the spirit of wisdome and knowledge give unto yow all wise hearts, that in the sight of God ye trying thinges that differ may approve things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7573:4"/>
(which is above the reach of the naturall man) that ye may be sincere &amp; without offence till that day of Christ your Lord &amp; mine.</p>
            <p>THe riches of the unsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable<note place="margin">First of the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God to the Kirk of Scotland.</note> favours of my spouse towardes me have beene so greate, he hath made his glorie to dwell so sensiblie in this land, that I may bouldlie say, Mercie and truth righteousnes and peace had never since Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the flesh a more glorious meeting, &amp; amiable embracing on earth, then ye have seene amongst your selves in the roughe end of this northern Yland: which therfore hath justlie obteined (to my no small comfort) a great name among the cheefe Kirkes and Kingdomes in the World. A people that sat in<note place="margin">In making the Gospel to shine here beyond the light of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations.</note> darknes hath seene a great light, and to them who sat in the region of death light is sprung up. To what nation under heaven (when now the sunne of righteousnes hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7573:5"/>
upon the most part of the world) hath the Lord communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Gospell for so large a time, with such puritie, fulnes, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, power, libertie and peace. The hottest persecutions had never greater puritie, and power; the most halcyon hereticall tymes had never more prosperitie and peace; the best reformed Kirks in other places can hardlie parallel your ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and libertie. And all these with such continuance, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hath he made the truth to stay with you, as he did the sunne in the daies of Iosuah; but when the cloud of your iniquities did hasten it to goe downe, in his mercie hath he brought back the glorious sunne by manie degrees as in the tymes of Ezekiah. Oh that ye had known the long pleasant day of your visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in this your day the things belonging unto your peace. Christ hath not onely beene one, &amp; his name one, in respect of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall

office for your informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of his priesthood for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your sinnes, and intercession for you: but also hath displayed his banners; and hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (few can say the like) a sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne King in our Land, to governe you with his owne scepter erected in his Worde, to cutt off with his sword all monuments of Idolatry, and superfluitie of pompous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; &amp; to restore all the meanes of his worship in Word, Sacraments and discipline to the holy simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and integritie of the first paterne shewed in the mount; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which, by that wisdome of man which is ever foolishnes with God, they had fearfully and shamefully swerved.</p>
            <p>The sincerer sort of the bordering nations about you, haue been so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with that beautie of the Lord upon your Sion, with that crowne of glorie and rich diademe<note place="margin">Testified by their confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions' and wishes.</note> by the hand of our God set upon your heades, that they have made

you the meath of ther religious wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes: they haue with vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires longed to see the things that ye have seene. And have not spared to profess, that in your case, they would rather suffer themselves to be dissolved, then that one pinne of that holy Tabernacle so divinelie compacted should be loosed.</p>
            <p>Within and amongst your selves that puritie of profession received u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversallie with so full consent, that Prince and Peeres, Pastors and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were all for Christ, one heart &amp; one soule of these who beleeved, with such evidences of Gods favour that the windowes &amp; gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven seemed to be opened, to raine downe upon this Land spirituall gifts to save you, as sometime they had beene readie to powre downe raine to destroy the world, every hand almost received some gift, and every head crowned with some grace, with such successe that it brought a rare unitie, prosperitie, &amp;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7573:6"/>
peace upon Kirk &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. With such power and presence of the spirit of God in converting, comforting &amp; confirming his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that Satan was seene fall like lightening from heaven, the infidel and unbeleever casting himselfe downe on his face, and confessing that undoubtedlie God was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst yow, and in the middest of your meetings, as the soules of his own secret ones can best beare witnesse, who have beene most submitted to that holie and happie simplicitie, the effectes whereof yet remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the harts of many, all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power be it never so violent sall not be able to remove it.</p>
            <p>And with such terrour from God and the Kings Lawes, that ye wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not your Theodosians publikly humbling themselves. The hardest hearted and haughtiest were made to stoup. The Atheist either chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in heart, or in countenance, and forced to play the hypocrite, the

proudest papist, eyther made like you, or made to leave you. Heresie never hatched within your walles, and the Babylonish brood of schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the infancie till this tyme was dashed against the sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es. Ye sought not then (my dere children) with Iohn and Iames like great Princes one to sitt on the right hand, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the left; nor to be busked with earthly glorie and Persian pompe, better beseeming the kings of the world, then the kingdome of Christ. The Carbuncles, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyres, the Emeraulds, the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solites; the gold, the precious stones, wherewith my foundation, walles, windowes, gates were set and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were out of the Lords own thesaurie. Your ambition was then set upon spirituall glorie, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quest of syn and Satan by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull puritie of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and discipline. The joy of your soules was to see Christ reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the middest of his enemies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7573:7"/>
his sword dividing the father from the sonne, and the sonne from the father: yea &amp; a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himself, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the soule and the spirit, the joynts and the marrow, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in glorie to God, and peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. Then were the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God amiable; then provoked ye one another with cheerefulnes to go up to the mountaine of the Lord, to the house of <hi>the God</hi> of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: ye were sure there to learne his wayes, and how to walke in his pathes. Then found ye the Lord his glorie filling his Sanctuarie, and one of the largest springs of the blood of Christ from Eden watring the citie of God, and glaiding your soules wearied with sinne. This was my beautie so truelie glorious in the sight of God and his Angels that all the glorie of this lyfe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to enter in comparison with it.

Besides these he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth<note place="margin">Divers other causes.</note> the tyranny of Prelates, which as it is a violent thing, so it cannot long indure, the promoting of the unworthie, and neglecting of the worthie, the tribulations of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward policie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the refusing of correction in the Princes and Rulers of the Kirk, the backsliding from righteousnes, lack of discreet and learned preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, promoting of children unto Kirk offices, and such other like. This sermon changing the name &amp; time, might seem to haue bene stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died for our present estate. And happy were we, if we were not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried with the perillous opinions, which he ascribes to the Prelates of that time. One opinion is of them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7573:18"/>
who thinke the Prelates to bee the Kirk, which the Lord will alwayes keep, and never forsake. An other who deferred time, thinking that the causes &amp; tokens before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, have been in the Kirk at other times no lesse then now. The third of such as say, Let come what will come, let us conforme our selves to this world, and take our time with temporizers. And the last is of such as being unfaithful, beleeve not that any such thing shall come. But so long as men are drunken with one or moe of those errors, what hope is there of happinesse of recovery? We might heare <hi>Henricus de Hassia</hi> in the yeare 1371. speaking that of our times which he said of his own, <hi>That the Ecclesiasticall governours in the primitive Kirk were compared to the Sunne shining in the day time, and the politicall to the Moon shining in the night. But the spiritual men which now are, doe neither shine in the day nor in the night. But rather with

the Romans to rest upon a blinde faith, receiving for truth whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carries my name or authority; nor with the rich man in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to wish that one may rise from the dead for your satisfaction. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it was in the time of Eliah, to seek for a miracle from heaven, nor yet to run to any on earth for decision of all questions; for within and amongst your selves all are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and without Papists are your enemies; Protestants are strangers to your secrets, and unacquainted with your covenants and oathes: your comfort may be that your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died not intestate. Let his testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee read with attentiue reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Search his latter will which he hath left for a plain and perfect direction to his comming againe. Consider what is most agreeable to his wisedome, what makes most for his honour, for the edification of your owne soules, for the restraint of the liberty of the flesh, and for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7573:22"/>
the comfort of a distressed consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without respect to the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of wisedome and humility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, or to that which seems most to serve to your worldly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that wooes your flesh, or courts your carnall senses: for this will bee a meager consolation, when the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of God are upon your soules ready to be presented before his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Continue in the things yee have learned and are perswaded of, knowing of whom yee have learned them.

your soules. In the time of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ponder with your hearts what better warrants yee have for some practises of religion more substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in mens estimation, and whether the motives of the one alteration may not as wel inforce the other. As ye should be able to try your selves, whether ye are in the faith or not, which Paul requireth of the whole Kirk of Corinth, so should ye have skill to try the spirits, whether they be of God or not. For such are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as are ever learning, &amp; never come to the knowledge of the truth. And as in respect of the time yee ought to be teachers, and to be able to edifie every one another in the most holy faith, so are yee charged by the Apostle Peter to be ready to give an account, even to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of that hope which is in you. He that hath faith can try himselfe, can try the spirits, and teach others, and give a reason both of his hope and practise before the adversary.</p>

Offences, schismes, troubles, persecutions, have been in all times, &amp; in every period of the Kirk hath opened a back doore for a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to slip forth at. Others before us have had their own trials, &amp; these in the dispensation of God are now made ours. Hee hath never been a Christian in action, that hath not been a martyr in affection. And (let the world still sit in the chaire of the scorners) that professor that will not bee a ceremoniall confessor, would refuse to bee a substantiall martyr. The smallest threed of

the seamlesse coat of thy Saviour, the lowest hem of his garment, the least pin or latchet of that heavenly tabernacle may be a matter of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and comfortable suffering to thee.

The heart may be sound, and voyd of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, and yet the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of adoration may prove Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous. Knowledge is greater, and Christ now more glorious, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, martyrdomes, prescription of time, and profession of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then in the primitive times. He that now counteth it no religion to renounce a Christian rite, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Antichristian in place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, would not have spared of old, to set Antichrist himself in the throne of Christs kingdome.

Or if yee had lived in their troublesome times, spoyled of your goods, hated of the world, pinched in prison, sequestrate from wife, house, and children, looking every houre for death: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what would have been your thoughts of infidelity, your words of blasphemy, your deeds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>If it please my glorious head to<note place="margin">Your care and your comfort in suffering.</note> call you to suffer for his name, let your care bee (as Peter hath taught you) 1. to sanctifie him in your hearts, and not to feare the feare of men. 2. to bee ready with your mouthes to make apologie to every one that craveth a reason of your hope: and 3. to have a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation

And 3. the assurance of an happy out-gate by his power, who was put to death in the flesh, but was quickned in the spirit, and now stands on the right hand of the father to maintaine his owne, and to revenge himself upon his enemies. Deceive not your selves with worldly policie, under the name of that heavenly vertue of Christian prudence, which doth nothing, intendeth nothing, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing, in deed, in word, or in shew, neither by dissimulation nor simulation against the honour of God, in prejudice of the least truth against the love of your brethren, or

This is it which carieth with it a secret cause of the conformity of the most part. For how shal he that makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of morall duties in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, count it religious to stand against ceremonies in his vocation? Or how can he be a director of thee in rites, who is a neglecter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in substance. The sonnes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li made the people to abhorre the

selves some hope to bee repossessed in your former liberty, not betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of you by your wilfull silence, but extorted from you by wicked violence. Were this cloud past, and I restored to the sunne-shine of the lightsome countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of my God, ye would all be ashamed and blush at your present mis-behaviour. <hi>In the time of peace yee would seeme lyons,</hi>

               <hi>but when battell comes, you prove but Harts.</hi> Could ye have looked that at the first so many of Gideons ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would haue fled home. But if the remnant were faithfull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their noyse and light would yet make Madian to flee. They who have yeelded under colour of care for their congregations, but indeed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straint for feare of worldly losses, have brought the rest of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in suspition, that either they will follow at last, or else that they deale more obstinately then consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously. It were good therfore that yee cleared your selves to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7573:29"/>
consciences of others by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reason, and sine lift up your voyce as a trumpet, that the deafest and deadest may heare: that yee were instant in season and out of season, to shew Israel their transgressions, lest yee bee guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their bloud. Why should yee bee ashamed to cry that in the eares of others openly, which ye think with your hearts, &amp; speak among your selves secretlie? Who shal stand for Christ, &amp; suffer for his crowne, if yee fall away and betray his honor? If ye hold your peace, Christ will tell you, that the stones will cry out, although whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of you bee silent. Suppose all Ierusalem should be offended at you, yet it becomes you to crie, <hi>Thou sonne of David have mercy on us.</hi> And, <hi>blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord.</hi> Let schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes load you, according to their malicious custome, with carts full of reproches of schisme &amp; sedition,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7573:30"/>
yet ye must follow the example of those glorious ministers of God, who before peace upon earth, did sing glory to God in the highest heavens. Ye must first be pure, then peaceable. It is a cursed silence of the mouth, that makes the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within to cry. Remember the example of <hi>Aphraades;</hi> remember the modest virgins behaviour, when shee saw her fathers house on fire; remember the cryes of the dumbe child of <hi>Craesus</hi> at his fathers danger. The woe is terrible, that belongs to you, in case ye crie not. The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Cynegirus</hi> detained the Persian Gallie with his right hand, &amp; when that was cut off, with his left; and being mutilate of both, hee spared not his teeth. No meane should bee left unassayed with God, and with men, to maintain the least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of truth for his sake, whose truth it is, and who hath concredit you with the bloud of his own sonne. As the <hi>Libellatici</hi> wer odious of old,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7573:30"/>
for redeeming from the Gentiles their peace with money: so may ye be suspected of defection, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the truth, if yee shall redeeme either your peace or places with promise of silence. Away with hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, with luke-warmnesse, with sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, to utter the words of Christ in the midst of an adulterous and sinful generation, lest he be ashamed of such, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The occasion of the preaching of the Gospell procured by dealing of this sort, is not unlike to Pilates subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who thought meet to scourge Christ, for saving of his life.

Their intention is to cast you loose of your own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to draw you on by degrees, to make the number behind the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the common clamor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint the lesse, their owne travels in cutting off the rest, the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and plausible.

Oh, if the Lord would open your eyes to see the subtill working of that mystery of iniquity.

But in the iustice of God, punishing the world for the contempt of the truth, and in respect of Satans malice, bringing in his lye, it is all of one threed.

Yet farre from the artificial fulnes, whereby the Tyrian spirits of the world do disquiet their neighbour nations, striving to subject all to their formes, that they may reigne over all, as Queenes; against the protestations made in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of faith of other Kirkes. A single forme of policie is more fit for a plain people, and mean provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, then the gorgeous shew of a pompous port, necessarily requiring rents, complements, and carriage, that neither this land may beare, neither wee nor our fathers have learned. Rites must have rents: their service is both cumbersome &amp; cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they scorne the assignations of

our plotted povertie; they strive with Statesmen, Earles and Lords for place &amp; precedencie; they loath the preaching of the Gospell, and like better the chief places of estate. The restitution of the Kirk to her wonted possessions, &amp; to her world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignities, must goe on together with equall speed. Neither can so long experience be denied, but that ordinarily the estate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth accompanies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the kirk, as the morning starre goes with the Sunne, which Constantine acknowledged in his grant to the Kirkes of Africa, thus beginning his Epistle, <hi>Considering that the due observation of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to true religion, and the worship of God, brings great happinesse to the whole estate and common wealth of the Empire of Rome:</hi> and Charles the 8. of France lamentably experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For when he had faire occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to reforme the Kirke of Rome at his pleasure, and to help the Kirk

of God, he neglected both: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shortly after striken with a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den sicknesse, he died, according to the forewarning of Savanarola; who told him plainly, that he should have great successe in his voyage to Italy, for reforming the corrupt state of the Kirk, which if hee did not, he should returne with disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and God would reserve the honour of that work unto some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All the policie of Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, and wisdome of Salomon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not establish a kingdome, wherein the kingdome of Christ is misregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. His true worship is the pillar and wall of policies. If the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his truth from you, hee will deprive you also of your civill liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and give you over into the hands of mercilesse enemies. If he spare not his own strength, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but give over the one to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the other to the hands of his enemies, he shall respect you no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mire in the street.

The testimonies of his love belong to them all for their comfort in this world, and safe conduct to the world to come. As they feare God, they honour his highnesse, they pray for him and his children, and all that are in authoritie, that they may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God their Saviour, who will have all to be safe, and come to the knowledge of the truth.

Although the inferior law were inacted, (as God forbid) yet in all Christian Prudence it ought to give place to the royall law of love, and unity, as being of a more noble descent.

The promise, Rev. 14. 13. Blessed are they who in the last time suffer against the beast, as well as they who in the first times were persecuted by the heathen, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them. For if the Lord mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured sufferings by the inequality of his enemies, and not by the equity of the cause, there would bee great disparagement betwixt the Martyrs put to death by the Pope, and the persecuting Emperours. Neither is there any suffering here, but for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7573:52"/>
that which is papall. It is no shame for them to suffer that of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which Christ suffered: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it honour to their enemies to doe that, which Iudas did.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God Revel. 2. speakes more comfortably to the kirk of Smyrna, a figure of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kirk under Constantine trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with intestine enemies: then to Ephesus representing the primitive Kirk invaded by the heathen. <hi>I know thy workes, and tribulation, and poverty, but thou art rich: and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Iewes, and are not.

            <p>Next, let them be considered 1. in the urgers intention. Whatsoever they be in valuation, they are not of so small moment. For albeit they bee concluded by way of counsell, and not of command; albeit that conclusion want a sanction; albeit
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7573:53"/>
no punishment bee determined by law; and albeit that Synod be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to be null, yet they lay upon the transgressors, and for their cause, upon their innocent families and congregations, the heaviest of all punishments, except death: and to some equall with death, if not more bitter, and intollerable; heavier then for non-residence, idlenesse, error, wickednesse, scandall. In delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are talked of as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but in execution they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced as most necessary. A necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conclusion inferred upon indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent premisses. Anticeremoniall Christians more rigorously used then Antichristian practisers of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.

            <p>4 According to the confession of both parties, tending to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or dishonor of Christ, serving either to beautifie or deface his spouse, and to the edification or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of weak Christians.</p>
            <p>5 In the estimation of some holy martyrs: who, howsoever in their prosperity they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tended for them: yet neere the time of their martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when their minds were most unpartiall, condemned them for foolish and abominable. And in the judgement of many worthy men, suffering bitter persecutions for the like: as for <hi>officium Ambrosianum,</hi> the service of Ambrose against the lame Liturgie of Gregory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to practise in matters of farre lesse importance. If yee looke to the fountaine, yee sustaine a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause with all the Saints, who in any age have opponed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the current corruptions of the Kirk &amp; Kirkmen in their time: such as Basil, Ierome, &amp;c. The

Albigenses contemptuously stiled Apostolickes, the Waldenses called Puritans, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6 In consideration of the change brought upon me, and of the course of my declining from my former perfection, my errors now may bee smaller: and yet my case is worse, then in my growing dayes, when I was wrastling against greater infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. My lukewarmnesse then was a way to, and a degree of heate, but now after my zeale, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Laodicean, waxing colder fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day: And increase (with Vincentius) I love; but defections &amp; changes I loath. <hi>Our bodies</hi> (sayth he) <hi>albeit in processe of time they grow, yet they change not. The same mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the same joynts are in children, which are in men, though in the one stronger and greater, in the other smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and weaker. But if the shape bee turned into another kinde, or any thing be added to the number of the members, or taken from them, then either the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perisheth, or becometh monstrous, or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7573:55"/>
at the least becomes weak.</hi> It is right so in religion, if we begin to make cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherof the kirk of Christ should be a diligent keeper, changing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, diminishing nothing, adding nothing. I admit no alteration for indifferent that tends to Apostasie, and not to accretion.</p>
            <p>7 Considered in themselves, &amp; not in relation to other things more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. A leg or an arm is necessary for a mans body, yet not in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it is necessary for the life, as the soule. I may live, &amp; be the kirk of God, so long as Christ by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit breathes faith into my soule. Yet wanting the least thing which God hath ordained, and receiving supply of a leg of wood from mens artifice, I can never bee beautifull in Gods fight, nor cheerfull in performing my own actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; but pines &amp; dwines away, til at last nothing be left, but a stinking carkasse, unfit both for the habitation &amp; celebration of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of my God.</p>

But farrest from indifferencie, and most intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in you, who ought to bee wise by the dolefull experience of others, to walk again upon the same snares, after yee have escaped twice, to make shipwrack, to lick up your own vomit, and to make your sins once of a simple die, now to bee of a scarlet colour.</p>

It is no small part of the hope of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that his majesty hath declared, that by the grace of God he is set &amp; disposed, equally to love and honor the learned and grave men of either of these opinions, avowing his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie in that religion, which hee ever constantly professed. And confessing, that if his conscience had not resolved him, that all the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion professed by him and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, were not grounded upon the plaine word of the scripture (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all poynts of religion were superfluous, as any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the same is abomination) he had never outwardly avowed it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7573:58"/>
for awe of any flesh. He calleth it the religion wherin he was brought up, and ever made profession of, wishing his sonne ever to continue in the same, as the onely true forme of Gods worship. He purgeth the good men of the ministery that like better of the single forme of policie in our Kirk, then of the many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Kirk of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. That are perswaded that their Bishops smel of a papallsupremacie, and that the surplice, the corner cap, &amp;c. are the outward badges of Popish er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. And praises God, that there is a sufficient number of good men in this kingdome, and yet they are all knowen to be against the forme of the English Kirk. And shall yee think now, that his Majestie will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cease to love, and maintaine his owne loyall subjects for slow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a sentence in so old a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie: or will impaire the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the kingdom of Christ, who hath added so largely to his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But rather as hee is the Lords

He hath run many times like the Roe, or the yong Hart, over the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of difficulties, to succour you in your distresse, when ye have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon him. Let no pretended impediment be an hinderance unto you to help his cause most instantly suing for support at your hands. If there bee any iniquity in my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, let them suffer for it, spare them not. But if they be innocent, smite them not. Open your mouth for the dumbe. Iudge righteously the afflicted and poore. Deliver the oppressed, that they may offer sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and pray for the life of the king and his sonne. If hard courses be taken against faithfull ministers and people, let not your honours wash your hands of that harme. It is all one to doe them evill, and not to helpe them against wrong done by others. The hoast of Israel spake

in great courage for the life of Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and Ionathan for David to the danger of his life. Ebedmelech spake a good word for Ieremie, and was saved when his master Zedekias was slaine. But curse yee Meroz, curse the inhabitants thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they came not to the helpe of the Lord against the mightie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had no hand against them. God that hath given you grace and credit with his highnesse, requireth that ye bestow it upon his matters; and that yee reserve it not for your own. Remember the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that worthy Courtier Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, who esteemed a libertie to build up the walles of the Citie of God, a sufficient reward for all his faithfull service. As your solicitude is great to leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and your own hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houses in good case: so dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidat not my libertie.

It was that name of Iehovah, and holinesse to the Lord put upon the head of the high Priest, that was the greatest beautie, and crowned all the other inferiour ornaments.

As this is the first great triall of your hearts, Love to Christ and me: so it may be your last occasion. It is not long, since the places, which ye possesse, were filled with your ancestors of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy memory, (whose constancy in defending the liberty of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is frequently observed in your owne history) who now are passed to their eternity; and ere be long, according to the succession of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations one after another, others

Set your eyes upon him, that is invisible, and that recompence of reward: so shall yee esteeme the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treasures of AEgypt. And shall choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. The Lord who searcheth the reignes, sees you, and the secrets of your deliberation, and conclusions, and could make them to found again outwardly in your eares, and to the hearing of others. All your thoughts are legible to that piercing eye, from which nothing is hid. Look not what ye may say for your excuse, or what one partie may say against another, whether in private conference, or publick vell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

            <p>I have many children, some aged, some poore, some consumed with godly griefe, not so much for their own trouble, as for the decay of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and my desolation. They would doe all things for pleasing all parties, wherin God is not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and their consciences not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted. But the honour of God, and peace of their soules, they dare not but regard. And albeit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the word should destroy their own &amp; all other mens worldly estate, yet they must still and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly

urge it. If in times past your honors have been pleased to hearesome of them in pulpit, and in privat, in the matters of religion: and have not despised their spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when there was greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie for suspition: there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason now, when they are in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of suffring, to beleeve, and take to heart, that which they say, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

with him, to give to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his workes shall bee. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit my messengers may now cry with the prophet, Who beleeves our report; yet that dreadfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence shall make the soule once brought within the sight of death, to tremble and quiver. God wil not be mocked. If the righteous scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be saved, and God spares not his Angels, where shall they appeare, who make marchandise of his truth; albeit at the highest rate of honour and wealth? The whole word of God, his law, promises, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, his practises, and the works of providence cannot prevaile with the sencelesse soules of men. But death (so violent are his perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his might so unresistable) at his first approch, shall make every heart to beleeve and feele, that all the workes under the Sunne are but vanity. The conscience and happy remembrance of one word uttered or suffered for Christ, his crowne, his truth, or his needy members,

Being therfore given &amp; restored, I ow my selfe for my selfe, and so ow my selfe unto God by a double right. But what shall I render unto God for giving himself unto me. For though I should give my selfe a thousand times for recompence, what am I in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of him.</hi> And I add, <hi>that seeing all

my well-doing can be no recompence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. I wish the increase of his glory by a second restitution of me unto my selfe, by giving himselfe now the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time unto me; and am content to be put to a greater perplexity, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to render, that his mercies yet may be the greater.</hi> O that it would please him yet again to pitty me. At least, let all the blessed of the Lord keep themselves from troubling the preachers of peace, and bringers of blessings: let them be stout, stedfast, and play the men, that they may all run out their course with joy, and report that excellent price conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the blood &amp; bitter sufferings of Iesus Christ my spouse, now at the right hand of the father; for whose revelation I am waiting dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that my marriage may bee perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and I with all the Saints may enter into the ioyes conquesed by his bitter suffering.
