            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CAUTION Humbly Offer'd ABOUT Paſſing the Bill againſt <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Caution</hi> requiſite in the Conſideration of the Bill againſt <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> is this, that the Word may be ſo well Diſtinguiſh'd and Explained, that it may not prove, in Practice, a greater <hi>Snare</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> to Good Men, than a Reſtraint upon Ill Ones. For if it be left <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,</hi> ſo that it may Affect <hi>Religious,</hi> as well as Lewd and Wicked People, it will, like the <hi>Trojan Horſe,</hi> carry an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Belly of it, to ſerve the Spleen or Pride of every Party, in their turn of Government, to Oppreſs the Reſt.</p>
            <p>Charity forbids me to think the Gentlemen, whoſe Zeal is Imploy'd to Promote the Succeſs of this Bill, have any ſuch unfair Latitudes in their Deſign; and therefore I ſhall Firſt ſay, <hi>What</hi> Blaſphemy <hi>is in it ſelf.</hi> Secondly, <hi>How</hi> Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy <hi>is Cognoſcible to the Civil Authority,</hi> and how far It may fall within Its Province to Conſider and Suppreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> then, in it ſelf, is certainly, <hi>a Speaking Evilly of God:</hi> But what that Evil Speaking is, and how to Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and Explain it, to the Magiſtrates Purpoſe, will be the Narrow and Pinch of the Queſtion.</p>

I Grant, a Man that ſhall Seriouſly Proſeſs ſome Erroneous Opinion concerning God, upon a weak Judgment, or a miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Education, that Contradicts the Expreſs Text of Holy Scripture, may be ſaid to hold a <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Opinion, juſt as ſuch may be ſaid to take God's Name in vain, that Pray to Him, and yet <hi>hate to be Reformed</hi> by Him: And is God Charges <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> on them <hi>that ſay they are Jews, and are not, but of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan:</hi> Which, whether it was Error or Hypocriſie, It does not appear to be of ſuch a Nature as is Puniſhable by the Civil Magiſtrate. I therefore Diſtinguiſh and Say, That <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> as it falls under the Notice of Civil Power, is not an Humble and Serious Miſtake of the <hi>Text,</hi> but a <hi>Preſumptuous and Deſpiteful Expreſſion,</hi> or <hi>Opinion about the Nature and Being of God:</hi> An <hi>Irreligious and Scornful Treating of the Divine Majeſty in his Nature and Attributes;</hi> and not an Incongruous Speculation, or Erroneous Notion from an Unſound Judgment, or a Miſguided Conſcience. For what is true of an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and is his <hi>Characteriſtick,</hi> is alſo true of a <hi>Blaſphemer;</hi> that is, not a Miſtaken, but a <hi>Guilty</hi> Man: Not a Conſcientious, but an <hi>Irreligious</hi> Perſon: One that is <hi>Condemned in himſelf,</hi> who <hi>Dares</hi> the Divinity, and Proudly Acts againſt Knowledge, and ſo, Conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his own Evil and Error.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus; A Man that is an</hi> Heretick, <hi>after the firſt and ſecond Admonition,</hi> Reject; <hi>Knowing that he that is ſuch,</hi> is <hi>Subverted and Sinneth, being Condemned of himſelf.</hi> And ſuch a Self-condemned Sinner is the Blaſphemer proper for the Magiſtrates Cognizance.</p>
            <p>Not Conſidering well of this one word <hi>Heretick,</hi> in the Apoſtles ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> One <hi>Self-Condemned, or Condemned of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> has fill'd the World with <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> through many Generations. Whereas had St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Definition and Direction been underſtood and follow'd, Miſtaken Men had been Pittied and Informed, and not Perſecuted and Killed for <hi>Gods ſake;</hi> while the Impious Contemners and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36348:3"/>
of God and Religion had met with their Deſerts from the Civil Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>But I will readily confeſs, that a Perſon never ſo Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Miſtake concerning God, may very well be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by the Church he is a Member of, becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sentiment might be one of the Terms of Communion, and no Wrong done; But Therefore, to ſay, <hi>Take him Goaler,</hi> though otherwiſe a Vertuous, Peaceable and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Man, is a Method, not to be Juſtified by True Chriſtianity; eſpecially when that which is required to be Believed, is the <hi>Comment,</hi> and not the <hi>Text,</hi> which alone ſhould be <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Controuling</hi> in point of Doctrine among Chriſtians. And to ſay True, 'twould be too hard a Task, to defend the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of a Doctrine, not delivered in the Terms of Scripture, which is the Great <hi>Creed</hi> of Chriſtians, when the Party to Believe does not refuſe to give his Faith in the Terms thereof: For after all, Truth loſes no Ground by fair Conceſſions, and I know not how we can well deny that <hi>Comments</hi> are a ſort of Begging of the Queſtion, which have not a Voice from Heaven to Confirm them.</p>
            <p>I perceive the Bill is Fram'd in favour of the <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as a main Pillar of it. But after all, I believe our <hi>Good Lives</hi> will beſt Recommend and Maintain It. <hi>Framing</hi> of <hi>Creeds</hi> hath coſt former Ages ſo very Dear, by the Diſtraction of Churches, and the Deſtruction of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it were great pitty freſh occaſions ſhould be given to Revive a Controverſie ſo well laid.</p>
            <p>This Quarrel alone, had ſo beſmeared the Face of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with Blood, in the firſt Ages of the Church, that it loſt to Chriſtians that Reverence with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> their Piety and Charity had before rais'd to themſelves, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: And whatever we may think, nothing elſe can <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our Breaches, and Reſtore to us Paths to Dwell in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36348:4"/>
There are ſeveral ſorts of Creeds, I know, as the Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian, Nicean, Sabellian, and in ſhort the Real and Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Trinitarians. But ſince none can be ſo orthodox as that deliver'd to us in <hi>Gods Book,</hi> why ſhould we preſs the point further? Who can Determine with equal Authority to that of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Who can expreſs His mind Apter? Or how can we frame a better <hi>General</hi> to Center In? At leaſt to maintain Charity by, If our ſentiments of the Intention of the Text are not the ſame? I ſpeak this with great reſpect to the ſecular Authority. For it is certain, that the ſeveral Churches, or Religious Societies that may hold theſe ſeveral Modes of Trinity, have that Power over their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by the Common Rules of Fellowſhip, that as to ſuch Points as are the Terms of Communion, They may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively deal with any of them that may forſake their uſual Belief; ſo far as refuſing them any further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But for the Civil Authority, <hi>at this time of Day,</hi> to Interpoſe, and <hi>Penally</hi> Impoſe any one of them, unleſs it were the ſacred Text (to which all Parties Refer and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) looks ſomething hard: And when we conſider the <hi>Divided</hi> State of the Nation, the <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of Spirit that is now among the <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> they are in the Poſſeſſion of, I muſt acknowledge, I cannot ſee the Prudence of it. But to make Property a Sacrifice for miſtakes about Religion, if yet it be a miſtake; and to make it So by the vote of Civil Authority, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may Conclude but not Convince, (for that pretends not to an Infallible Spirit of Deciſion, as to Truth and Error) has certainly a Difficulty in it not eaſily overcome: Since to me it ſeems to ſhake thoſe Fundamental Laws by which Property is Declared and Deſended. For it is hard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how Faith is the Foundation of Property.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all; for if this Bill Paſs, to pick a hole in the Coat of any one Party this time, the reſt may ſay, that perhaps lye open to be hitt upon other Points, what know
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36348:4"/>
we but that it will <hi>be our Turn</hi> next time; and tho' as to this Doctrine we are within the Pale and Safe, yet upon other Articles we may at another time be equally expoſed; and ſo that which cannot be done at once, may, in the ſame manner, by little and little, be accompliſhed at laſt, to the Prejudice of every Intereſt that Diſſents from that which is uppermoſt? I mean, a forced Uniformity in Worſhip, Doctrine and Diſcipline. Certainly Preſidents in ſo Nice a Caſe muſt be very dangerous, and every Party being concern'd in every Party's Security, it is obliged, by its own ſafety, to endeavour the ſafety of the Reſt, tho', as to the Point on Foot, They Differ'd as much from the Party in Queſtion, as that which holds the Chair.</p>
            <p>I confeſs this Conſideration moves much with me; and if their be any ground for it, then certainly there can be no Good One now, for a Bill againſt <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> without great Caution and Diſtinction in the wording of it; leſt Virtue ſuffer more than Vice, and Diſſent rather than Impiety.</p>
            <p>I have been the Freer in this matter, being neither <hi>Deiſt</hi> nor <hi>Socinian;</hi> and have no other Exception to the Bill, than that which I have Expreſt: For I fear it will be an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Animoſity, if not of <hi>Perſecution:</hi> And as it has more than once happened, that part which Affects the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious</hi> ſhall be more Vigorouſly Executed, than that which Regards the Irreligious Blaſphemer. For it has been Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, during the Reign of <hi>King Charles</hi> the Second, that the Diſſenters Suffered more in <hi>One Year</hi> that the Laws were put in Execution, for their Religious Meetings, than the <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Debauched</hi> did in his <hi>Whole Reign:</hi> So much more Inclinable were ſome Men to <hi>Wink</hi> at <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> than Indure a Conſcientious Diſſent: Of which the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> were but too great an Inſtance, as well as the Ordinary Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Juſtice</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36348:5"/>
To Conclude, but with all Submiſſion and Reſpect to Authority, I ſay again, to make a <hi>Culpable</hi> and <hi>Puniſhable</hi> Blaſphemy, there muſt be an <hi>Irreligious</hi> and <hi>Deſpiteful</hi> Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Deſign in the words of the Perſon Accuſed.</p>
            <p>And here I conceive the Civil Magiſtrate has the full and free uſe and exerciſe of his Authority againſt Blaſphemy: For Blaſphemy, in this Sence, <hi>Corrupts Good Manner,</hi> being a plain and Impudent Indignity and Affront upon the moſt High Good and God; and merits not only Law, but the warmeſt Zeal to ſuppreſs It: For to endure it, as it hath been, God knows, too long and too much already, is the high way to Provoke God to <hi>vindicate</hi> his own Glory and Soveraignity at the coſt of the whole Nation; wherein the Innocent may happen to ſuffer with the Guilty, tho' to theſe a <hi>Judgment,</hi> and to them but an Affliction.</p>
            <p>It is to be Lamented, as well as aborr'd, that a People of ſo much Light and Knowledge, and under ſuch pretences to <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſhould want Zeal to ther Power, to Root out ſuch Scandalous and Impious Practices from among us. There are good Laws, if they were but Imployed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch Irreligious Perſons, let their Quality be what it will. Law knows <hi>No Reſpect of Perſons,</hi> Tho' it too often happens that many Cloathed with Authority Do, that have the Power and are ſworn to Suppreſs them.</p>
            <p>And indeed, as the caſe ſtands, If we are in earneſt to ſuppreſs <hi>Blaſphemy, Prophaneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> There ſeems to be but two ways in the Power of the Civil Magiſtrates; but they are good ones, and might be in great meaſure effectual.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to ſuppreſs all <hi>Play-Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Gameing-Houſes,</hi> and Places of <hi>Looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> thoſe Seminaries or Nurſeries of Impiety: That have palpably <hi>Relax'd</hi> the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diſcipline of the Nation, and corrupted the Youth of it, to the Ruin of the <hi>Honour, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> of many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Worthy Families: And which therefore are the <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Averſion</hi> of the Sober Men of every Perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36348:5"/>
The next way to Extinguiſh Vice, is to make a Vicious Man <hi>Uncapable</hi> of being a <hi>Magistrate;</hi> who, being conſcious of his own Ills, will but <hi>faintly</hi> Puniſh other Men's, and whoſe Power will <hi>Awe</hi> others from Informing againſt him. If Publick Employments and Marks of Favour were made the <hi>Rewards</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Ability,</hi> where-ever they are found, we ſhould quickly ſee an Alteration among the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> and by their Power and Example, a Reformation among the Common People. And to ſay true, If <hi>Virtue,</hi> and not <hi>Opinion,</hi> were the <hi>Teſt, England</hi> would have the Uſe and Service of the Sobriety and Good Sence of all Her People, <hi>for the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Vice,</hi> and <hi>Introducing of a General Reformation of Manners:</hi> Which God Almighty ſend.</p>
