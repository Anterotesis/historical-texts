            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My dear and honoured Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F my Pen were both able, and at leisure to get glory in Paper, it would be but a paper-glory when I had gotten it; but if by displaying (which is the design of these papers) the transcendent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Iesus Christ, I may win glory to him from you, to whom I humbly offer them; or from any other into whose hands providence shall cast them: that will be glory indeed, and an occasion of glorifying God to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>It is not the design of this Epistle to <hi>complement,</hi> but to <hi>benefit</hi> you. Not to blazon your excellencies, but <hi>Christs.</hi> Not to acquaint the world how much you
<pb facs="tcp:54346:3"/>
have <hi>endeared</hi> me to your self, but to increase and strengthen the <hi>endearments</hi> betwixt Christ and <hi>you</hi>; upon your part. I might indeed (this being a proper place for it,) pay you my acknowledgements for your great kindnesses to me and mine; of which I assure you I have, and ever shall have deep resentments: but you and I are Theatre enough to one another, and can satisfie our selves with the inclosed comforts and delights of our mutual love and friendship: but let me tell you, the whole world is not a Theatre large enough, to shew the glory of Christ upon: or unfold the one half of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches that lye hid in him. These things will be far better understood, and spoken of in Heaven, by the noon day Divinity in which the immediately illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Assembly do there preach his praises; than by such a stammering tongue, and scribling pen as mine; which doth but mar them.</p>
            <p>Alas! I write his praises but by Moon-light. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not praise him so much as by halves. Indeed, no tongue but his own (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> said of <hi>Basil</hi>) is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to undertake that task. What shall I say of Christ! The excelling glory of that object, dazles all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension; swallows up all expression. When we have borrowed metaphors from every Creature that hath any excellency or lovely property in it, till we have stript the whole Creation bare of all its ornaments; and cloathed Christ with all that glory: when we have worn our tongues to the stumps, in ascribing praises to him; alas! we have done nothing, when all is done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54346:3"/>Yet wo is me! how do I every day behold reasonable souls, most unreasonably disaffected to my lovely Lord Iesus! denying love to one, who is able to compel love from the stoniest heart! yea, though they can never make so much of their love (would they set it to sale) as Christ bids for it.</p>
            <p>It's horrid, and amazing to see; how the minds of many are captivated and insnared by every silly trifle. And how others can indifferently turn them with a kind of spontaneity to this object, or to that; (as their fancy strikes) among the whole universe of beings; and scarce ever reluctate, recoil, or nauseate, till they be perswaded to Christ: and then, 'tis as easie to melt the obdurate rocks into sweet syrrup, as their hearts into divine love.</p>
            <p>How do the great men of the world ambitiously court the honours and pleasures of it? the Merchants of the earth trade and strive for the dear bought treasures of it; whilst the price of Christ (alas! ever too low) falls every day lower and lower upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> of this world! I speak it as a sad truth, if there were no quicker a trade (as dead as they say it is) for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing treasures of the earth, than there is for Christ this day in <hi>England</hi>; the <hi>Exchange</hi> would quickly be shut up, and all the Trading Companies dissolv'd.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, Christ is the Peerless Pearl hid in the field, <hi>Mat. 13.46.</hi> will you be that <hi>wise Merchant</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to win and compass that treasure; whatever it shall cost you? Ah Sir, Christ is a commodity that can never be bought too dear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54346:4"/>My dear Kinsman, my flesh and my blood; my soul thirsteth for your salvation, and the salvation of your family. Shall you and I resolve with good <hi>Joshua,</hi> that whatever others do, <hi>we and our families will serve the Lord.</hi> That we will walk as the redeemed of his blood, shewing forth his vertues, and praises in the world? that as God hath made us one in name, and one in affection; so we may be one in Christ. That it may be said of us, as it was of <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Alippius</hi> long ago; that they were <hi>sanguine christi conglutinati,</hi> glued together by the blood of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, <hi>I</hi> have given in my name to him long since, woe to me, if I have not given in my heart also; for should I deceive my self in so deep a point as that, how would my <hi>profession</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> my <hi>calling</hi> as a <hi>Minister</hi>; yea, these very <hi>Sermons</hi> now in your hands, rise in judgement to condemn me? which God forbid.</p>
            <p>And doubtless, Sir, your eyes have seen both the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all Creatures, and the necessity and infinite worth of Christ. You cannot forget what a vanity the world appeared to you, when in the year <hi>1668.</hi> you were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the messengers of death, (as you and all that were about you then apprehended) to shoot the gulf of vast eternity: when a malignant <hi>Feaver,</hi> and <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> (whereof your <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> Physitian hath given an account to the world) did shake the whole frame of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle wherein your soul through mercy yet dwells; and long may it dwell there, for the service and praise of your
<pb facs="tcp:54346:4"/>
great deliverer. I hope you have not, nor ever will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; how the vain world then appeared to your eye; when you looked back (as it were over your shoulder) and saw how it shrunk away from you. Nor will you ever forget the awful apprehensions of Eternity, that then seized your spirit; or the value you then had for Christ; which things I hope still do, and ever will remain with you.</p>
            <p>And for you, Dear Cousin, as it becomes a daughter of <hi>Sarah</hi>; let your soul be adorned with the excellencies of Christ, and beauties of holiness. A King from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven makes suit for your love. If he espouse your soul now, he will fetch it home to himself at death; in his Chariot of salvation; and great shall be your joy, when the Marriage of the Lamb is come. Look often upon Christ in this glass; he is fairer than the Children of men. View him believingly, and you cannot but like and love him.<note place="margin">Ep. S.R.</note> 
               <hi>For</hi> (as one well saith) <hi>Love when it seeth, cannot but cast out its spirit and strength upon amiable objects; and things love worthy. And what fairer thing than Christ! Oh fair Sun, and fair Moon, and fair Stars, and fair flowers, and fair Roses, and fair Lilies, and fair Creatures: but oh ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, thousand times fairer Lord Jesus! alas, I wronged him, in making the comparison this way. O black Sun and Moon; but oh fair Lord Jesus! O black Flowers, and black
<pb facs="tcp:54346:5"/>
Lilies, and Roses; but O fair, fair, ever fair Lord Jesus! O all fair things, black, deformed and without beauty; when ye are set beside the fairest Lord Jesus. O black Heavens, but O fair Christ! O black Angels but O surpassingly fair Lord Jesus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope you both are agreed with Christ, according to the Articles of peace propounded to you in the Gospel; and that you are every day driving on Salvation work, betwixt him and you in your family, and in your Closets.</p>
            <p>And now my Dear Friends, if these discoveries of Christ, which I humbly offer to your hands; may be any way useful to your souls, to assist them either in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in clearing their interest in him; my heart shall rejoice, even mine. For none under Heaven can be more willing, (though many are more able) to help you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than is,</p>

                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Directions to the Converted for their esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment. <hi>p.</hi> 96.</note>A young ungrounded Christian when he seeth all the fundamental truths, and seeth good evidence and reasons of them, perhaps may be yet ignorant of the right order and place of every truth: It's a rare thing to have young Professours to understand the necessary truths me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically: and this is a very great defect. For a great part of the usefulness and excellency of particular truths, consisteth in the respect they have to one another. This therefore will be a considerable part of your confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and growth in your understandings, to see the body of the Christian doctrine, as it were at one view, as the several parts of it are united in one perfect frame; and to know what aspect one point hath upon another; and which is their due places. There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the sight of the several parts of a Clock or Watch, as they are disjoynted, and scattered abroad; and the seeing of them conjoyned, and in use and motion. To see here a pin, and there a wheel, and not know how to set them all together, nor ever see them in their due places; will give but little satisfaction: it is the frame and design of holy doctrine that must be known, and every part should be discerned as it hath its particular use to that design, and as it is connected with the other parts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By this means only can the true nature of Theology, together with the harmony and perfection of truth, be clearly understood. And every single truth also will be much better perceived by him that seeth its place, and order, than by any other: for one truth exceedingly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrates, and leads in another into the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing— Study therefore to grow in the more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical knowledge of the same truths, which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and though you are not yet ripe enough to discern the whole body of Theology in due method, yet see so
<pb facs="tcp:54346:6"/>
much as you have attained to know, in the right order, and placing of every part. As in Anatomy, it's hard for the wisest Physician to discern the course of every branch of Veins, and Arteries; but yet they may easily discern the place and order of the principal parts, and greater vessels (<hi>and surely in the body of Religion there runs not a branch of greater or more necessary truth than these</hi>) so it is in Divinity, where no man hath a perfect view of the whole, till he come to the state of perfection with God; but every true Christian hath the knowledge of all the essentials, and may know the orders, and places of them all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as it serves to render the <hi>mind</hi> more <hi>judicious,</hi> so it causes the <hi>Memory</hi> to be more tenacious, and retentive of truths. The chain of truth is easily held in the memory, when one truth links in another, but the loosing of a link endangers the scattering of the whole chain. We use to say, <hi>order is the mother of memory</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ordo est mater memoriae.</hi>
               </note> I am sure it's a singular friend to it: Hence it's observed, those that write of the art of memory, lay so great a stress upon <hi>place</hi> and <hi>number.</hi> The memory would not so soon be overcharged with a multitude of truths, if that multitude were but orderly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. It's the incoherence, and confusion of truths, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their number that distracts. Let but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing receive them regularly, and the <hi>memory</hi> well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with much more facillity. A bad memory is a common complaint among Christians. All the benefit that many of you have in hearing, is from the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of truths upon your hearts. There is but little that sticks by you, to make a second and third impression upon them. I know it may be said of some of you, that if your <hi>affections</hi> were not better than your <hi>memories,</hi> you would need a very large charity to pass for Christians. I confess it's better to have a well-ordered <hi>heart,</hi> than a methodical <hi>head,</hi> but surely both are better than either. And for you
<pb facs="tcp:54346:7"/>
that have constantly attended these exercises, and followed us through the whole series, and deduction of these truths, from text to text, and from point to point: who have begun one Sabbath, where you left another; it will be your inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable fault, if these things be not fixed in your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and memories, as nails fastened in a sure place; especially since providence hath now brought to your <hi>eyes,</hi> what hath been so often sounding in your <hi>ears,</hi> which is no small help to fix these truths upon you, and prevent that great hazard of them, which commonnly attends bare hearing: for now you may have recourse, as often as you will to them, view, and review them, till they become your own.</p>
            <p>But though this be a great, and singular advantage, yet it is not all you may have by a <hi>methodical understanding of the doctrine of Christ:</hi> it's more than a judicious understanding them, or faithful remembring them, that you and I must design; even the warm, vital animating influences of these truths upon our <hi>Hearts,</hi> without which we shall be never the better; yea, much the worse for knowing and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them.</p>
            <p>Truth is the sanctifying instrument, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. the mould into which our souls are cast, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. according therefore to the stamps and impressions it makes upon our understandings, and the order in which truths lye there, will be the depth, and lastingness of their impressions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences upon the heart. As the more weight is laid upon the seal, the more fair and lasting impress is made upon the wax. He that sees the grounds and reasons of his peace and comfort most clearly, is like to maintain it the more constantly.</p>
            <p>Great therefore is the advantage Christians have by such methodical systems. Surely they may be set down among the <hi>desiderata Christianorum,</hi> the most desired things of Christians.</p>

            <p>And such is the <hi>deliciousness</hi> of this subject that were there ten thousand Volumes written upon it, they would never cloy, or become nauseous to a gracious heart. We use to say <hi>one thing tires,</hi> and it's true that it doth so; except that one thing be virtually, and eminently all things; as Christ is: and then one thing can never tire.

            <p>The <hi>Synopsis</hi> praefixed to this Treatise, will shew you, that the method is wholly new, and the Treatise it self will satisfie you, that I have not boasted in another mans line; of things made ready to my hand: which I speak not in the least to win any praise to my self, from the undertakement; but to remove prejudices from it: for I see more defects in it, than most of my Readers will see; and can forethink more faults to be found in it, than I shall now stand to tell thee of, or make answer for. It was written in a time of great distractions, and didst thou but know how oft this work hath dyed, and revived under my hand, thou wouldst wonder, that ever it came to thine.</p>
            <p>I am sensible it may fall under some censorious, (it may be envious) eyes; and that far different judgements will pass upon it, for <hi>pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli:</hi> and no wonder if a Treatise of Christ be, when Christ

            <p>But to the ingenious and candid Reader, I owe satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the obscurity of some parts of this discourse, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned partly by the conciseness of the <hi>stile,</hi> and partly by the mistakes of the <hi>Printer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, I have this only to say, that I was willing to crowd as much matter as I could into this number of sheets in thy hand, that I might therein ease thee, both in thy pains, and purse. I confess these Sermons were Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a more relaxed stile, and most of these things were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which are designedly contracted in the <hi>Press</hi>; that the Volume might not swell above the ability of common Readers. And it was my purpose at first to have comprised the second part, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Application of the Redemption that is with Christ, unto sinners,</hi> in one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; which occasioned the contraction of this; but that making a just Volume it self, must await another season to see the light. If the Reader will be but a little the more intent, and considerate in reading, this conciseness will turn to his advantage.</p>
            <p>And for the mistakes that have happened in the Press, they are not (for the most part) very material; and the principal ones are collected to your hand; which being corrected before you read, the obscurity which is objected, will in great part be thereby removed.</p>
            <p>This may suffice to shew the usefulness of such compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and to prevent offence; but something yet remains
<pb facs="tcp:54346:8"/>
with me, to say to the Readers in <hi>general,</hi> to those of this <hi>Town</hi> in special; and to the <hi>Flock</hi> committed by Christ to my charge, more especially.</p>
            <p>To Readers in general, according as their different states,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and conditions may be; there are six things earnestly to be requested of them, (1.) If you be yet strangers to Christ, let these things begin, and beget your first acquaintance with him. I assure thee, Reader, it was a principal part of the design thereof; and here thou wilt find many directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, helps, and sweet incouragements, to assist a poor stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as thou art, in that great work. Say not, I am an enemy to Christ, and there is no hope of Reconciliation, for here thou wilt see, how <hi>God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself:</hi> say not, all this is nothing, except God had told thee so, and appointed some to treat with thee about it; <hi>for he hath committed unto us the word of this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; say not, yea, that may be from your own pity, and compassions for us, and not from any commission you have for it: for <hi>we are Ambassadours for Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.19.</p>
            <p>Say not, O but my sins, my sins, are greater than can be forgiven; the difficulties of my salvation too great to be overcome; especially by a poor Creature as I am, that am able to do nothing, no not to raise one penny towards the discharge of that great debt I owe to God: for here thou wilt find upon thy Union with Christ, that there is <hi>merit</hi> enough in his <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> enough in his <hi>bowels</hi> to justifie, and save such an one as thou art. Yea, and I will add for thine incouragement that it is a righteous thing with God to justifie and save thee, that canst not pay him one penny of all the vast sums thou owest him, when by the same rule of justice he condemns the most strict, self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Pharisee that thinks thereby to quit scores with him. It is righteous for a judge to cast him that hath paid 99 l. of the 100. which he owed, because the payment was not full; and to acquit him, whose surety hath paid all,
<pb facs="tcp:54346:9"/>
though himself did not, and freely confess that he cannot pay one farthing of the whole debt.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If thou be a self-deceiving soul, that easily takest up thy satisfaction about thine interest in Christ, look to it as thou valuest thy soul, Reader, that a fond, and groundless conceit of thine interest in Christ, do not effectually, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally obstruct a true, and saving interest in him. This is the common and fatal errour in which multitudes of souls are insnared and ruined:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>tassent.</hi> Seneca.</note> for look as a conceit of great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hinders many from the attaining of it; so, a groundless conceit that Christ is already thine, may prove the greatest obstacle betwixt Christ and thee; but here thou wilt meet with many Rules that will not deceive thee; tryals that will open thy true condition to thee.</p>
            <p>Thou sometimes reflectest upon the state of thy soul, and enquirest is Christ mine? may I depend upon it, that my condition is safe? thy heart returns thee an answer of peace, it speaks as thou wouldst have it; but remember (friend) and mark this line, <hi>Thy final sentence is not yet come from the mouth of thy judge;</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>and what if after all thy self flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering hopes, and groundless confidences a sentence should come from him quite cross to that of thine own heart? where art thou then? what a confounded person wilt thou be? Christless, speechless, and hopeless all at once!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O therefore build sure for Eternity: take heed lest the loss of thine eternal happiness, be at last imputed by thee to the deceitfulness, and laziness of thine own heart; lest thy heart say to thee in Hell, as the heart of <hi>Apollodorus</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his sufferings to say to him.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>I am the cause of all this misery to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If thou be one whose heart is eagerly set upon this vain world, I beseech thee take heed, lest it interpoe it self betwixt Christ and thy soul, and so cut thee off from him for ever. O beware lest the dust of the earth getting into thine eyes, so blind thee, that thou never see the beauty or
<pb facs="tcp:54346:9"/>
necessity of Christ. The God of this world so blinds the eyes of them that believe not. And what are the sparkling pleasures that dazle the eyes of some, and the distracting cares that wholly divert the minds of others, but as a Napkin drawn by Satan over the eyes of them that are to be turned off into Hell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Some general aims, and faint wishes after Christ thou mayest have, but alas! the world hath centered thy heart, intangled thy affections, and will daily find new diversions for thee, from the great business of life. So that if the Lord break not this snare, thou wilt never be able to deliver thy soul.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) If thou be a loose and careless professor of Christ; I beseech thee, let the things thou shalt read in this Treatise of Christ, convince, shame, and reclaim thee, from thy vain conversation. Here thou wilt find how contrary thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is, to the grand designes of the death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ. O methinks, as thou art reading the deep humiliation and unspeakable sorrows Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, for the expiating of sin, thou shouldst thenceforth look upon sin as a tender Child would upon that knife, that stab'd his Father to the heart! Thou shouldst never whet, and sharpen it again, to wound the Son of God afresh. To such loose, and careless professors, I particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the last <hi>general use</hi> of this discourse, containing many great motives to reformation, and strict Godliness, in all that call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) If thou hast been a prophane and vain person, but now art pardoned, and dost experience the super-abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches of grace; my request to thee is, that thou love Jesus Christ with a more fervent love, than ever yet thou hadst for him. Here thou wilt find many great incentives, many mighty arguments; to such a love of Christ; poor soul! consider what thou hast been, what the morning of thy life was. What treasures of guilt, thou laidst up in
<pb facs="tcp:54346:10"/>
those dayes, and then think, can such a one as I receive mercy? and that mercy not break my heart! can I read my pardon, and mine eyes not drop! What? mercy for such a wretch as I! a pardon for such a Rebel! O what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous thaw should this cause upon thy heart! if it do not, what a strange heart is thine!</p>
            <p>Did the love of Christ break through so many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come to thee. Did it make its way through the Law, through the wrath of God, through the grave, through thine own unbelief, and great unworthiness to come to thee? O what a love was the love of Christ to thy soul! And is not thy love strong enough to break through the vanities, and trifles of this world which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle it, to go to Christ, how poor, how low, and weak is thy love to Christ then?</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Lastly, Art thou one that hast through mercy at last attained assurance, or good hope through grace, of thy interest in Christ? Rejoice then in thy present mercy, and long ardently to be with thine own Christ in his glory. There be many things dispersed through this Treatise of Christ to animate such joy, and excite such longings. It was truly observed by a worthy Author, (whose words I have mentioned more freely than his name in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) <hi>that it is in a manner as natural for us to leap,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>S. R.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>when we see the New Ierusalem, as it is to laugh when we are tickled. Ioy is not under the souls command, when Christ kisseth it.</hi> And for your desires to be with Christ, what considerations can you find in this world strong enough to reine them in! O when you shall consider what he hath done, suffered, and purchased for you, where he is now, and how much he longs for your coming, your very hearts should groan out those words, Phil. 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. The Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54346:10"/>Having delivered my message to the Reader in general, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> have somewhat more particularly, to say to you of this place.</p>
            <p>You are a people that were born under, and bred up with the Gospel. It hath been your singular priviledge above many Towns and Parishes in <hi>England,</hi> to enjoy more than 60 years together an able and fruitful Gospel Ministry among you. The dews of Heaven lay upon you, as it did upon <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece, when the ground was dry in other places about you. You have been richly watered with Gospel showers. You with <hi>Capernaum</hi> have been exalted to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the means of Grace. And it must be owned to your praise, that you testified more respect to the Gospel, than many other places have done, and treated Christs Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors with more civility, whilst they prophesied in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth; than some other places did. These things are praise worthy in you. But all this and much more than this amounts not to that which Jesus Christ expects from you, and which in his name I would now perswade you to, and oh that I! (the least and unworthiest of all the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of Christ to you) might indeed prevail with all that are Christless among you, (1.) to answer the long continued calls of God to you, by a through and sound Conversion, <hi>that the long suffering of God may be your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and you may not <hi>receive all this grace of God in vain.</hi> O that the damned might never be set a wondering to see a people of your advantages for Heaven sinking as much below many of themselves in misery, as you now are above them in means, and mercy.</p>
            <p>Dear friends, my hearts desire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be saved. Oh that I knew how to engage this whole Town to Jesus Christ, and make fast the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age knot betwixt him and you, albeit after that I should presently go to the place of silence, and see man no more, with the Inhabitants of the World. Ah sirs! methinks I see the Lord Jesus laying the merciful hand of an holy
<pb facs="tcp:54346:11"/>
violence upon you, methinks he calls to you as the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> saying, <hi>arise lest ye be consumed; and while he lingred the men laid hold upon his hand, the Lord being merciful unto him. And they brought him without the City and said, escape for thy life, stay not in all the plain, escape to the Mountain, lest thou be consumed,</hi> Gen. 19.15. How often (to allude to this) hath Jesus Christ in like manner laid hold upon you in the Preaching of the Gospel, and will you not fly for refuge to him? Will you rather be consumed, than endeavour an escape? A beast will not be driven into the fire, and will not you be kept out? The merciful Lord Jesus, by his admirable patience and bounty hath convinced you, how loath he is, to leave, or loose you. To this day his arms are stretched forth to gather you, and will you not be gathered? Alas! for my poor neighbours. Must so many of them perish at last? what shall I do for the daughter of my people?</p>
            <p>Lord, by what Arguments shall they be perswaded to be happy? what will win them effectually to thy Christ? they have many of them escaped the pollutions of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour. They are a people that love thine Ordinances, they take delight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God; thou hast beautified many of them with lovely, and obliging tempers and dispositions. Thus far they are come, there they stick, and beyond this, no power but thine can move them? O thou to whose hand this work is and must be left, put forth thy saving power, and reveal thine arm for their salvation: thou hast glorified thy name, in many among them; Lord glorifie it again.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) My next request is, that you will all be perswaded, whether converted, or unconverted; to set up all the duties of Religion in your families, and govern your Children, and Servants as men that must give an account to God for them in the great day. O that there were not a prayerless Family in this Town. How little will your Tables differ
<pb facs="tcp:54346:11"/>
from a manger, where beasts feed together, if God be not owned, and acknowledged there, in your eating, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And how can you expect blessings should dwell in your Tabernacles, if God be not called upon there! Say not you want time for it, or that your necessities will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, for had you been more careful of those duties, it's like you had not been exposed to such necessities; besides, you can find time to be idle, you can waste a part of every day vainly. Why could not that time be redeemed for God? Moreover, you will not deny, but the success of all your affairs at home, and abroad, depends upon the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, and if so, think you it is not the right way, even to temporal prosperity, to engage his presence, and blessing with you, in whose hand your all is? Say not, your Children, and servants are ignorant of God, and therefore you cannot comfortably joyn with them in those duties. For the neglect of these duties, is the cause of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and it is not like they will be better, till you use Gods means to make them so.</p>
            <p>Besides, prayer is a part of natural worship, and the vilest among men are bound to pray, else the neglect of it were none of their sin. O, let not a duty upon which so many, and great blessings hang, fall to the ground, upon such silly (not to say wicked) pretences to shift it off. Remember, death will shortly break up all your families and disband them, and who then, think you, will have most comfort in beholding their dead? The day of account also hastens, and then who will have the most comfortable appearing, before the just, and holy God? Set up I beseech you the ancient, and comfortable duties of reading the Scriptures, singing of Psalms, and Prayer in all your dwelling places, and do all these conscientiously, as men that have to do with God, and try the Lord herewith, if he will not return in a way of mercy to you, and restore even your outward prosperity to you again. How ever, to be sure, far greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
<pb facs="tcp:54346:12"/>
than that lye before you, to oblige you to your duties.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>(3.) More especially I have a few things to say to you, that have attended on the Ministry, or are under my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, in a more particular manner, and then I have done. And,</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1.)"/> First, I cannot but with deep resentments observe to you, the goodness of our God; yea, the riches of his goodness,</p>
            <p>Who freely gave Jesus Christ out of his own bosom for us, and hath not withheld his spirit, Ordinances, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to reveal and apply him to us. Here's love, that wants an Epithete to match it!</p>
            <p>Who engaged my heart upon this transcendent subject in the course of my Ministry among you. A subject which Angels study, and admire as well as we.</p>
            <p>Who so signally protected, and overshadowed our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly in those dayes of trouble, wherein these truths were delivered to you. You then sate down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to your taste. His banner over you was love, your bread was then sure, and your waters failed not. Yea, such was his peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and special tenderness to you, that he suffered no man to do you harm. And it can hardly be imagined any could attempt it, that had but known, this, and no worse than this, to be your only design, and business.</p>
            <p>Who made these Meditations of Christ, a strong sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and sweet relief to <hi>mine,</hi> now with Christ; and no less to me under the greatest exercises, and tryals that ever befell me in this world. Preserving me yet, (though a broken vessel) for some farther use, and service to your souls.</p>
            <p>Who in the years that are past left not himself without witness among us, blessing my labours, to the conversion, and edification of many; some of which yet remain with us, but some are fallen asleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54346:12"/>Who hath made many of you that yet remain, a willing and obedient people, who have in some measure supported the reputation of Religion, by your stabillity, and integrity in dayes of abounding iniquity, my joy, and my Crown; so stand ye fast in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Who after all the dayes of fears, and troubles, through which we have past, hath at last given us, and his Churches rest, <hi>that we being delivered out of the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, might serve him without fear in righteousness and holiness</hi> (which doing this mercy may be extended to us) <hi>all the dayes of our life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In testimony of a thankful heart for these invaluable mercies, I humbly and cheerfully rear up this pillar of remembrance, inscribing it with EBEN EZER and IEHOVAH IIEREH.</p>
            <p>As I could not but observe these things to you, so I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a few things to request of you, in neither of which I can bear a denyal: so deeply doth Christs, your own, and my interest lye in them.</p>
            <p>Look to it (my dear friends) that none of you be found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christless at your appearance before him. Those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Christless now, will be left speechless then. God forbid that you that have heard so much of Christ, and you that have professed so much of Christ, should at last fall into a worse condition than those that never heard the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>See that you daily grow more Christ-like, by conversing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with him, as you do, in his precious Ordinances. Let it be with your souls, as it is with a piece of cloth, which receives a deeper dye every time it is dipt into the Fat. If not, you may not expect the continuance of your mercies much longer to you.</p>
            <p>Get these great truths well digested both in your heads <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and hearts and let the power of them be displayed in your lives. Else the pen of the Scribe, and tongue of the Preacher
<pb facs="tcp:54346:13"/>
are both in vain. These things that so often warm'd your hearts from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> return now to make a second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon them from the <hi>Press.</hi> Hereby you will reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and fix those truths, which it's like are in great part already vanisht from you. This is the fruit I promise my self from you, and what ever entertainment it meet with from others,<note place="margin">

               <p>First, The knowledge of Jesus Christ is the very marrow and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Kernel of all the Scriptures:<note place="margin">

                  </gap> in Jesus Christ; it is the chief scope of that excellent <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> to discover: for we may call that <hi>Epistle,</hi> The sweet Harmony of both Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: this argues the unspeakable excellency of this Doctrine,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54346:19"/>
the knowledge whereof must needs therefore be a Key to unlock the greatest part of the Sacred Scriptures: for it is in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Scripture, much as it is in the knowledge men have in Logick and Philosophy: if a Scholar once come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the bottom principle, upon which as upon its hinge the controversie turns; the through knowledge of that principle shall carry him through the whole controversie, and furnish him with a solution to every argument; even so the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jesus Christ, like a clew leads you through the whole Laberynth of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The knowledge of Jesus Christ is a <hi>fundamental knowledge,</hi> and foundations are most <hi>useful,</hi> though least <hi>seen:</hi> the knowledge of Christ is fundamental to all <hi>Graces, Duties, Comforts,</hi> and <hi>Happiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, It's fundamental to all graces: they all begin in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Col. 3.10. <hi>the new man is renewed in knowledge</hi>; as the old, so the new Creation begins in light; the opening of the eyes, is the first work of the spirit: and as the beginnings of grace, so all the after improvements thereof depend upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing knowledge, 2 Pet. 3.18. <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour:</hi> see how these two, grace and knowledge keep equal pace in the soul of a Christian, in what degree the one increases, the other increases answerably.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the knowledge of Christ is fundamental to all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the duties, as well as graces of Christians are all founded in the knowledge of Christ: must a Christian believe; That he can never do without the knowledge of Christ; Faith is so much dependent upon his knowledge, that it is denominated by it, Isa. 53.11. <hi>by his knowledge shall my righteous servant Iustifie many:</hi> and hence <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.40. Seeing, and believing are made the same thing: would a man exercise hope in God; That he can never do without the knowledge of Christ, for he is the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of that hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. he is also its <hi>object, Heb.</hi> 6.19. its ground-work and support, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. and as you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or hope, so neither can you <hi>pray</hi> acceptably, without a competent degree of this knowledge: the very Heathen could say, <hi>non loquendum de deo sine lumine,</hi> (i. e.) men must not speak of God without light: the true way of conversing with, and enjoying God in Prayer; is by acting faith on him through a Mediator; so much of faith, and Christ as is in a Duty, so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54346:19"/>
much comfort, and true excellency there is in it, and no more. Oh then how indispensible is the knowledge of Christ; to all that do adress themselves to God in any Duty!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It's fundamental to all comforts: all the Comforts of believers, are streams from this Fountain. Jesus Christ is the very object-matter of a believers Joy, Phil. 3.3. <hi>our rejoycing is in Christ Iesus:</hi> take away the knowledge of Christ, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is the most sad, and melancholy creature in the world: again, let Christ but manifest himself, and dart the beams of his light into their souls, it will make them kiss the stakes, sing in flames, and shout in the pangs of death, as men that divide the spoil.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this knowledge is fundamental to the eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of souls: as we can perform no duty, enjoy no comfort, so neither can we be saved without it, Joh. 17.3. <hi>this is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to know thee the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent:</hi> and if it be eternal life to know Christ, then it is eternal Damnation, to be ignorant of Christ: as <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>door</hi> that opens Heaven, so <hi>knowledge</hi> is the <hi>key,</hi> that opens Christ. The excellent gifts, and renowned parts of the Moral <hi>Heathens,</hi> though they purchased to them great esteem, and honour among men; yet left them in a state of perdition; because of this grand defect: they were ignorant of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. thus you see how fundamental the knowledge of Christ is, and essentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to all the graces, duties, comforts, and happiness of souls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The knowledge of Christ is profound and large: all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> other Sciences are but Shallows; this, a boundless, bottomless Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: no creature hath a line long enough to fathom the depth of it: there is height, length, depth, and breadth ascribed to it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14. yea,<note place="margin">

                  </note> it passeth knowledge: there is <hi>a manifold wisdom of God in Christ,</hi> Eph. 3.10. It is of many sorts and forms, of many folds and plights: it is indeed simple, pure and unmixed with any thing but it self, yet it is manifold in degrees, kinds and Administrations: though something of Christ be unfolded in one age, and something in an other, yet eternity if self cannot fully unfold him. I see something (said <hi>Luther</hi>) which blessed <hi>Austin</hi> saw not, and those that come after me, will see that which I see not: it is in the studying of Christ, as in the planting of a new discovered Country; at first men sit down by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54346:20"/>
Sea side, upon the skirts and borders of the Land; and there they dwell, but by degrees they search farther, and farther into the heart of the Country: ah, the best of us are yet, but upon the borders of this vast Continent.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The study of Jesus Christ is the most noble Subject, that ever a soul spent it self upon: those that rack, and toture their brains upon other studys, like Children, weary themselves at a low game: the Eagle plays at the Sun it self, the Angels study this Doctrine, and stoop down, to look into this deep abyss: what are the Truths discovered in Christ? but the very secrets that from eternity lay hid in the bosom of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8, 9. Gods heart is opened to men in Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. this makes the Gospel such a glorious dispensation, because Christ is so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously revealed therein, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. and the studying of Christ in the Gospel, stamps such a Heavenly glory upon the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating soul, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>

                  </note> ye know it's ignominious by the common suffrage of the civilized world, for any man to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with his own calling, or not to intend the proper business of it. It's our calling (as the Bridegrooms friends) to woo and win souls to Christ: to set him forth to the people as Crucified among them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. to present him in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive excellencies that all hearts may be ravished with his beauty, and charmed into his arms by love: we must also be able to defend the truths of Christ, against undermining Hereticks; to instill his knowledge into the ignorant, to answer the cases and scruples of poor doubting Christians. How many intricate knots have we to untye? what pains, what skill is requisite for such as are imployed about our work? and shall we spend our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time in frivolous controversies, Philosophical niceties, dry and barren Scholastick notions? shall we study every thing but Christ? revolve all Volumes but the Sacred ones! what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served even of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that he turn'd with loathing from School Divinity, because it wanted the sweet juice of piety; may be convictive to many among us, who are often too much in love with worse imployment, that what he is said to loath.

               <p>

Remember Brethren, an holy calling never saved any man, without an holy heart; if our tongues only be <hi>sanctified,</hi> out whole man must be <hi>damned:</hi>
                  <q>we and our people must be judged by the same Gospel, and stand at the same bar,<note place="margin">

Remember the pinching wants of souls who are perishing, for want of Christ; and if their tongues do not, yet their necessities do bespeak us, as they did <hi>Ioseph,</hi> Gen. 47.15. <hi>wherefore should we dye in thy presence, give us food that we may live, and not dye:</hi> even the Sea-monsters draw forth their breasts to their young ones, and shall we be cruel! cruel to souls! did not Christ think it too much to sweat blood, yea to dye for them; and shall we think it much to watch, study, preach, pray, and do what we can for their salvation? O let the same mind be in you, which was also in Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To the people that sit under the Doctrine of Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2.)"/> daily, and have the light of his knowledge shining round about them.</p>
               <p>First, Take heed ye do not reject and despise this light: this may be done two ways, (first) When you despise the means of knowledge, by slight and low esteems of it. Surely if you thus reject knowledge, God will reject you for it, <hi>Hosea</hi> 4.6. it is a despising of the richest gift that ever Christ gave to the Church: and however it be a contempt and slight that begins low, and seems only to vent it self upon the weak parts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial discourses, and untaking tones and gestures of the speakers; yet (believe it) it's a daring sin, that flyes higher than you are aware, Luk. 10.16. <hi>he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, You despise the knowledge of Christ, when you despise the directions, and loving constraints of that knowledge; when you refuse to be guided by your knowledge, your light and your lusts contest and struggle within you: Oh 'tis sad when your lusts master your light; you sin not as the Heathens sin, who know not God; but when you sin, you must slight and put by the notices of your own Consciences; and offer violence to your own convictions; And what sad work will this make in your souls? how soon will it lay your consciences waste?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54346:23"/>Secondly, Take heed that you rest not satisfied with that knowledge of Christ you have attained, but grow on towards perfection: it's the pride and ignorance of many professors when they have got a few raw and indigested notions, to swell with self-conceits of their excellent-attainments, and it's the sin even of the best of Saints, when they see <hi>(veritas in profundo)</hi> how deep the knowledge of Christ lyes, and what pains they must take to dig for it; to throw by the Shovel of Duty, and cry <hi>dig we cannot.</hi> To your work Christians, to your work; let not your candle go out, sequester your selves to this study, look what intercourses and correspondencies are betwixt the two worlds, what communion soever God and souls maintain; it is in this way: count all therefore but dross in comparison of that excellency which is in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.</p>

                  </note> Joh. 13.23. <hi>now there was leaning on Iesus bosom one of his Disciples, whom Iesus loved:</hi> but Christ did not lean upon the Fathers bosom, as that Disciple did on his, but lay in it: and therefore in Isa. 42.1. <hi>the Father calls him mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth,</hi> which is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously rendred, the Septuagint <hi>quem suscepit,</hi> whom my soul takes, or wraps up: others <hi>complacuit:</hi> one that highly pleases, and delights my very soul: and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. he is said in this estate, wherein I am now describing him, to be rich: and Phil. 2.7. <hi>to be equal with God, and to be in the form of God,</hi> (i. e.) to have all the glory, and ensigns of the Majesty of God, and the riches which he speaks of, was no less, then all that God the Father hath, Joh. 16.15. <hi>all that the Father hath is mine:</hi> and what he now hath in this his exalted state, is the same he had before his humiliation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.5. now to glimpse out (as we are able) the unspeakable felicity of that state of Christ, whilst he lay in that blessed bosom; I shall consider it three ways, <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, positively,</hi> and <hi>comparatively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us consider that state <hi>negatively,</hi> by removing from it all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> those degrees of abasement, and sorrow, which his incarnation brought him under: as First, he was not then abased to the condition of a Creature, which was a low stoop indeed, and that which upon the matter undid him, in point of reputation; for by this (saith the Apostle) <hi>he made himself of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.7. it emptied him of his glory: for God to be made man, is such an abasement as none can express: but then not only to appear in true flesh; but also in the likeness of sinful flesh, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. O what is this!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54346:25"/>Secondly, Christ was not under the Law in this Estate. I confess 'twas no disparagement to <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to Angels in their state of glory, to be under Law to God; but it was an unconceivable abasement, to the absolute indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent being, to come under Law: yea not only under the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but also under the malediction and curse of the Law, Gal. 4.4. <hi>but when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman made under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In this State he was not lyable to any of those sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful consequents, and attendants of that frail and feeble state of humanity, which he afterwards assumed, with the nature: as (1.) He was unacquainted with griefs: there was no sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, nor sighing in that bosom where he lay; though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he became <hi>a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> Isa. 53.3. <hi>a man of sorrows,</hi> as if he had been constituted and made up of pure and unmixed sorrows: every day conversing with griefs, as with his intimate companions, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. (2.) He was never pinched with poverty, and wants, while he continued in that bosom, as he was afterwards when he said,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>the Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> Ah blessed Jesus! thou needest not to have wanted a place to have lain thine head,<note place="margin">He that <hi>was in the bosom of the Father,</hi> an expression shewing the intimate, close, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret delight, and love he had from the Father: how unspeakable is it that he should deprive himself of the sense of it? to put himself as it were out of Heaven, into Hell; this is deeper love than ever we can imagine, or conceive: no wonder the Apostle calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the unsearchable riches of grace: we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to go to the bottom of it, but still there is more grace, and love behind. Mr. <hi>Anth. Bugs, Lect. in Ioh.</hi> 17. <hi>p</hi> 503.</note> hadst thou not left that bosom for my sake. (3.) He never under-went reproach and shame in that bosom, there was nothing but glory and honour, reflected upon him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though afterwards he was despised and rejected of men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.3. his Father never looked upon him without smiles and love, delight and joy, though afterwards he became a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of men, and despised of the people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.6. (4.) His holy heart was never offended with an impure suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or temptation of the Devil; all the while he lay in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of peace and love, he never knew what it was to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted with temptations, to be besieged, and battered upon by unclean spirits, as he did afterwards, Matth. 4.1. <hi>then was Iesus led up of the Spirit, into the Wilderness to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> It was for our sakes that he submitted to those exercises of Spirit,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54346:25"/>
                  <hi>to be in all points tempted like as we are, that he might be unto us a merciful and faithful high-Priest,</hi> Heb. 4.15. (5.) He was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sensible of pains and tortures, in soul or body, there were no such things in that blessed bosom where he lay: though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he groaned and sweat under them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.5. the Lord embraced him from eternity, but never wounded him till he stood in our place, and room. (6.) There were no hidings or withdrawments of his father from him, there was not a cloud from eternity upon the face of God, till <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had left that bosom: it was a new thing to Christ to see frowns in the face of his Father: a new thing for him to cry, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Matth. 27.46. (7.) There were never any impressions of his Fathers wrath upon him, as there were afterwards: God never delivered such a bitter cup of wrath into his hands before, as that was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. Lastly, There was no death, to which he was subject in that bosom, all these things were new things to Christ, he was above them all, till for our sakes he voluntarily subjected himself unto them: thus you see what that state was not.</p>
               <p>Let us consider it positively, what it was, and guess by some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> particular considerations (for indeed we can but guess) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the glory of it: as (1.) We cannot but conceive it to be a state of matchless happiness, if we consider the persons enjoying; and delighting each in other: he was with God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. God you know is the Fountain, Ocean, and Center of all delights and joys, Psal. 16.11. <hi>in thy presence is fulness of joy.</hi> To be wrapt up in the soul; and bosom of all delights as Christ was, must needs be a state transcending apprehension: to have the Fountain of love, and delight, letting out it self so immediatly and fully, and everlastingly upon this only begotten darling of his soul, so as it never did communicate it self to any; judge what a state of transcendent felicity this must be? great persons have great delights. (2.) Or if we consider the intimacy, dearness, yea oneness of those great persons one with another: the nearer the union the sweeter the communion: now Jesus Christ was not only near, and dear to God, but one with him, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> Joh. 10.30. one in nature, will, love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; there is indeed a Moral union of souls, among men by love, but this was a natural oneness; no Child is so one with his Father, no Husband so one with the Wife of his bosom,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54346:26"/>
no Friend so one with his Friend, no Soul so one with its body, as Jesus Christ and his Father were one. O, what matchless delights must necessarily flow, from such a blessed Union! (3.) Consider again the purity of that delight, with which the blessed Father and Son embraced each other; the best Creature-delights one in another, are mixed, debased, and allayed: if there be something ravishing, and ingaging, there is also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cloying and distasting: the purer any delight is, the more excellent.</p>
               <p>Now there are no Christal streams flowing so purely from the Fountain, no beams of light so unmixed from the Sun; as the loves and delights, of these holy and glorious persons were: the holy, holy, holy Father, embraced the thrice holy Son; with a most holy delight, and love.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Consider, the constancy of this delight: it was from everlasting as in <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and from Eternity, it never suffered one moments interruption: the ever-flowing Fountain of Gods delight and love, never stopt its course, never ebbed, but as he speaks in the Text, I was <hi>daily</hi> his delight, rejoycing <hi>always</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: once more, consider the fulness of that delight, the perfection of that pleasure. <hi>I was delights:</hi> so the word is in its original: not only plural delights, all delights, but also in the abstract delight it self; as afterwards from the abundance of his sorrows, he was stiled, a man of sorrows, so here, from the fulness of his delights: as who should say, even constituted, and made up of pleasure, and delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Once more, let us consider it comparitively, and this state will yet appear more glorious, comparing it with, either the choicest delights that one Creature takes in another, or that God takes in the creature, or that the creature takes in God: measure these immense delights betwixt the Father, and his Son, by either of these lines, and you shall find them all infinitely short: For, (1.) Though the delights that creatures take in each other, be sometimes a great delight; such was <hi>Iacobs</hi> delight in <hi>Benjamin,</hi> whose life is said <hi>to be bound up in the lads life:</hi> a dear and high expression, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.30. such was that of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> whose soul was knit with his soul, <hi>and he loved him, as his own soul,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.1. and such is the delight of one friend in another, <hi>there is a friend that is as a mans own soul,</hi> Deut. 13.6. yet all this is but Creature-delight, and can in no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54346:26"/>
particular match the delights betwixt the Father, and the Son: for this is but a finite delight, according to the measure, and abilities of Creatures; but that is infinite, suitable to the infinite perfection of the Divine being: this is always mixed, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Or if you compare it, with the delight that God takes in the Creatures; it is confessed that God takes great delight in some creatures: <hi>the Lord takes pleasure in his Saints, he rejoyces over them with singing; and resteth in his love,</hi> Zeph. 3.17. Isa. 62.5. but yet there is a great difference betwixt his delight in creatures, and his delights in Christ; for all his delight in the Saints is <hi>secondary,</hi> and for Christs sake: but his delights in Christ are <hi>primary,</hi> and for his own sake: we are accepted in the beloved <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6. he is beloved,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and accepted for himself. (3.) To conclude, compare it once more, with the delights that the best of creatures take in God, and Christ; and it must be confessed that is a choice delight, and a transcendent love, with which they love and delight in him, Psal. 73.25. <hi>whom have I in Heaven but thee? and on earth there is none, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire besides thee:</hi> what pangs of love? what raptures of delight, did the Spouse express to Christ? <hi>oh thou whom my soul loveth,</hi> but surely our delight in God is no perfect rule to measure, his delight in Christ by: for our love to God (at the best) is still imperfect, that's the burden and constant complaint of Saints: but this is perfect, ours is inconstant, up and down, ebbing and flowing, but this is constant: so then, to conclude, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and state of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> before his Incarnation was a state of highest, and matchless delight, in the enjoyment of his Father.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To Saints, if Christ lay eternally in this bosom of love, and yet was content to forsake and leave it for your sakes; then, (1.) Be you ready to forsake and leave, all the comforts you have on earth for Christ: famous <hi>Galleacius</hi> left all for his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Moses</hi> left all the glory of <hi>Aegypt. Peter,</hi> and the other <hi>Apostles</hi> left all, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.28. but what have we to leave for Christ? in comparison of what he left for us. Surely Christ is the highest pattern of self-denyal in the world. (2.) Let this confirm your faith in prayer, if he that hath such an interest in the heart of God, intercede with the Father for you, then never doubt of audience; and acceptance with him: surely you shall be accepted through the beloved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Christ was never denyed any thing that he asked, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.42. the Father hears him always; though you are not worthy, Christ is; and he ever lives to make intercession for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. (3.) Let this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thy heart, O Saint; in a dying hour, and not only make thee patient in death; but in a holy manner impatient, till thou be gone; for, whither is thy soul now going but to that bosom of love whence Christ came? Joh. 17.24. <hi>Father I will, that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am:</hi> and where is he? but in that bosom of glory, and love where he lay before the world was, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. O then, let every believer incourage his soul: comfort ye one another with these words. I am leaving the bosom of a creature, I am going to the bosom of God.</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter, the Gospel seems to be epitomized; the subject matter of it is, the death of Christ, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Issue thereof: by reading of it, the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of old, and many Jews since have been converted to Christ. Christ is here considered <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>relatively:</hi> absolutely, and so his innocency is industriously vindicated, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. though he suffered grievous things, yet not for his own sins; <hi>for he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth:</hi> but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively considered, in the capacity of a surety for us. So the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54346:29"/>
Justice of God is as fully vindicated in his sufferings, vers. 6. <hi>the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all:</hi>

                  <p>The call of the Lord Jesus unto office includes election on the Fathers part, and acceptation on the Mediators part; and is set down after the manner of mutual transaction between God and Christ, whereby he was designed thereunto as it were by way of Covenant. <hi>If his soul shall set it self an offering for sin</hi>; (for so according to the original do good Authors read the Text) <hi>he shall see his seed prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               </note> how he came to sustain this capacity, and relation of a surety for us, is in these verses plainly asserted, to be by his compact, and agreement with his Father, before the worlds were made, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>In this verse we have (1.) His Work, (2.) His Reward, (3.) The Respect or Relation of each to the other. (1.) His Work, which was indeed a hard work; <hi>to pour out his soul unto death,</hi> aggravated by the companions <hi>with whom being numbred with transgressors:</hi> the capacity in which, bearing all the sins of the Elect: <hi>he bare the sins of many</hi>; and by the manner of his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, <hi>viz.</hi> meekly, and forgivingly, <hi>he made intercession for the transgressors:</hi> this was his work. (2.) The Reward, or fruit which is promised him for this work; <hi>therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong</hi>; wherein is a plain allusion to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours in War; for whom are reserved the richest garments; and most honourable captives, to follow the Conquerour as an addition to his magnificence, and triumph: these were wont to come after them in chains, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.14. see <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.3. (3.) The Respect or Relation betwixt that work, and this Triumph, some will have this work, to have no other relation to that glory; then a meer antecedent, to a consequent: others give it the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and relation of a meritorious cause to a reward; 'tis well observed by Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> that the Hebrew particle <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I would not here be mistaken, as though I were now to treat of the Covenant of Grace; made in Christ betwixt God and us; it is not the Covenant of Grace, but of Redemption I am now to speak to; which differs from the Covenant of grace both in regard of the <hi>foederates,</hi> in this 'tis God the Father, and Jesus Christ that mutually Covenant; in that it's God and man; they differ also in the <hi>preceptive</hi> part, in this it is required of Christ that he should shed his blood, in that it is required of us, that we believe; they also differ in their <hi>promises,</hi> in this God promises to Christ a name above every name, ample Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from Sea to Sea; in that to us grace and glory: so that these are two distinct Covenants.</p>
               <p>The substance of this Covenant of Redemption is Dialogue-wise exprest to us in <hi>Esa.</hi> 49. where (as Divines have well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) Christ begins at the first and second verse,<note place="margin">

               <p>Having told God how ready and fit he was for his service, will know of him what reward he shall have for his work, for he resolves his blood shall not be sold at low and cheap rates: hereupon <hi>vers.</hi> 3. the Father offers him the elect of Israel for his reward; biding Low at first (as they that make bargains use to do) and only offers him that small remnant, still intending to bid higher: but Christ will not be satisfied with these, he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues his blood higher than so; therefore in <hi>vers.</hi> 4. he is brought

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3.)"/> For the manner or quality of the transaction, it was <hi>foederal,</hi> or of the nature of a Covenant: it was by mutual engagements and stipulations, each person undertaking to perform his part in order to our recovery.</p>
               <p>We find each person undertaking for himself by solemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; The Father promiseth, that he will <hi>hold his hand and keep him,</hi> Isa. 42.6. The Son promiseth he will obey his Fathers call to suffering and <hi>not be rebellious,</hi> Isa. 50.5. and having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, each holds the other to his engagement. The Father stands upon the satisfaction promised him, and when the payment was making, he will not abate him one farthing, Rom. 8.32. <hi>God spared not his own Son: (i. e.)</hi> he abated nothing of the full price he was to have at his hands for us.</p>
               <p>And as the Father stood strictly upon the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant so did Christ also, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth</hi> (saith he to the Father) <hi>I have finished the work thou gavest me to do, and now father glorifie me with thine own self:</hi> as if he had said, father the work is done, now where's the wages I was promised? I call for glory as my due, as much my due, as the hire of the labourer is his due, when his work is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4.)"/> More particularly, we will next consider the Articles to which they do both agree, or what it is that each person doth for himself promise to the other. And to let us see how much the Fathers heart is engaged in the salvation of poor sinners, there are <hi>five</hi> things which he promiseth to do for Christ, if he will undertake that work.</p>
               <p>First, he promiseth to invest him, and anoint him to a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold office; answerable to a threefold misery that lay upon the elect; as so many bars to all communion with, and enjoyment of God: for if ever man be restored to that happiness, the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his mind must be cured; the guilt of sin expiated; and his captivity to sin led captive: answerably, Christ must <hi>of God be made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. And he is made so to us, as our <hi>Prophet,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54346:31"/>
Priest,</hi> and <hi>King:</hi> but he could not put himself into either of these, for if so, he had acted without commission; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all he did had been invallid, Heb. 5.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Christ glorified not himself to be made an High-Priest, but he that said unto him, thou art my Son.</hi> A Commission there for to act authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in these offices, being necessary to our recovery; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engages to him to seal him such a three-fold commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>He promiseth to invest him with an eternal and Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Psal. 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent; thou art a Priest for ever after the order of</hi> Melchisedeck: this <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> being King of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and King of <hi>Salem</hi>; that is, Peace; had a Royal Priesthood, and his descent not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned, it had an adumbration of eternity in it; and so was more apt to Type and Shadow forth the Priesthood of Christ, than <hi>Aarons</hi> was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16, 17, 24, 25. as the Apostle accommodates them there.</p>
               <p>He promiseth moreover to make him a Prophet, and that an extraordinary one, even the Prince of Prophets: the chief Shepherd, as much superiour to all others, as the Sun is to the lesser Stars: so you have it, Isa. 42.6, 7. <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And not only so, but to make him <hi>King</hi> also; and that of the whole Empire of the World: so Psal. 2.6, 7, 8. <hi>ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance; and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ends of the earth for thy possession:</hi> thus he promiseth to qualifie and furnish him compleatly for the work, by his investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with this Three-fold office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And for as much as he knew it was a hard and difficult work his Son was to undertake, a work that would have broken the backs of all the Angels in Heaven, and men on earth, had they engaged in it: therefore he promiseth to stand by him, and assist and strengthen him for it: so <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.5, 6, 7. <hi>I will hold thy hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ego cujus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensa ac infinita est potentia, sic tibi favebo, ita te fulciam, ut nihil adversus te posuit omnes adversarii tui.</hi> Marlor. in loc.</note> or take hold of thee with my hand, for so it may be rendred, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> I will under-prop and support thy humanity when it's even over weighed with the burden, that is to come upon it, and ready to sink down under it; for so you know the case stood with him, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.34. and so it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.7. He was <hi>oppressed,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed the humanity needed a prop of no less strength than the infinite
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54346:32"/>
power of the God head, the same promise you have in the first verse also <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He promiseth to crown his work with success, and bring it to a happy issue, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.10. He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days; and the pleasure of the Lord shall pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his hand. He shall not begin, and not finish; he shall not shed his invaluable blood upon hazardous terms; but shall see and reap the sweet fruit thereof. As the Joyfull mother forgets her pangs, when she delightfully embraces and kisses her living Child.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Father promiseth to accept him in his work, though millions should eternally perish. <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.4. <hi>Surely</hi> (saith he) <hi>my work is with the Lord.</hi> And (<hi>verse</hi> 5.) <hi>I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> His faith had therein respect to this compact and promise, accordingly the Father manifests the satisfaction he had in him, and in his work; even while he was about it on earth; when there came such a <hi>voice from the excellent glory saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, He engaged to reward him highly for his work, by exalting him to singular and supereminent glory and honour; when he <hi>should</hi> have dispatched and finished it. So you read, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I will declare the decree the Lord hath said unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> It's spoken of the day of his resurrection, when he had just finished his suffering. And so the Apostle expounds and applies it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32, 33. For then did the Lord wipe away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his Cross, and invested him with such glory that he looked like himself again. As if the Father had said, now thou hast again recovered thy glory, and this day is to thee as a new birth-day.</p>
               <p>These are the incouragements and rewards proposed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to him, by the Father. This was <hi>the joy set before him,</hi> (as the Apostle phraseth it) in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. which made him so pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to <hi>endure the Cross and despise the Shame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in like manner, Jesus Christ restipulates, and gives his engagement to the Father; that upon these terms he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be made flesh; to devest (as it were) himself of his glory; to come under the obedience and malediction of the Law; and not to refuse any, the hardest sufferings it should
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54346:32"/>
please his Father to inflict on him. So much is carryed in <hi>Esai.</hi> 50.5, 6, 7. <hi>The Lord hath opened mine ear, and I was not Rebellious; neither turned away back; I gave my back to the Smiters, and my cheeks to them that pulled off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting: for the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded; I have set my face as a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</hi> When he saith I was not <hi>Rebellio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> he meaneth I was most heartily willing and content to accept the terms; for there is a <hi>Meiosis</hi> in the words, and much more is intended than expressed. And the sense of this place is well delivered to us in other terms, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Then said I loe I come, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will O God, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> O see with what a full consent the heart of Christ closeth with the Fathers Offers, and Proposalls; like some Eccho, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers your voice twice or thrice over. So doth Christ here answer his Fathers call, I <hi>come,</hi> I <hi>delight</hi> to do thy will, yea, <hi>thy Law is in my heart.</hi> And thus you see the Articles to which they both Subscribed, or the <hi>Terms</hi> they agreed on.</p>
               <p>I will briefly shew, how these Articles and agreements were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> on both parts performed, and that precisely and punctually to a tittle.

God calls him <hi>his elect</hi> or chosen one. (2.) His giving Christ implys a parting with him, or setting him (as the <hi>French</hi> hath it) at some distance from himself for a time: there was a kind of parting betwixt the Father and the Son, when he came to tabernacle in our flesh: so he expresseth it, Joh. 16.28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father</hi>; this distance that his incarnation and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set him at, was properly as to his humanity which was really
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54346:37"/>
distant from the glory into which it is now taken up; and in respect of manifestation of delight and love. The Lord seemed to carry it as one at distance from him. O this was it that so deeply pierced and wounded his Soul, as is evident from that complaint, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from the voice of my roaring? O my God I cry in the day time, and thou hearest not,</hi> &amp;c. (3.) Gods giving of Christ implies his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into the hands of Justice, to be punished. Even as condemned persons are by sentence of Law, given or delivered into the hands of executioners. So <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the determinate counsell of God, ye have taken; and with wicked hands have slain.</hi> And so he is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>To deliver him up to death for us all.</hi> The Lord when the time was come that Christ must Suffer, did as it were say; O all ye roaring Waves of my incensed Justice, now swell as high as heaven; and go over his soul and body. Sink him to the bottom, let him go like <hi>Ionah</hi> his Type into the belly of Hell, unto the roots of the Mountains. Come all ye raging storms that I have reserved for this day of wrath, beat upon him; beat him down that he may not be able to look up. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. Go Justice put him upon the rack; torment him in every part, till all his bones be out of joynt; and his heart within him be melted as wax, in the midst of his bowels. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.14. And ye assembly of the wicked, Jews and Gentiles that have so long gaped for his blood, now he is delivered into your hands; you are now permitted to execute your malice to the full. I now loose your chain, and into your hand and power is he delivered. (4.) Gods giving of Christ implys his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of him, with all the purchases of his blood; and setling all this upon us, as an inheritance, and portion. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.32, 33. <hi>My Father giveth you the true bread, from heaven, for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven; and giveth life unto the world.</hi> God hath given him as bread to poor starving creatures, that by faith they might eat, and live.

                  </note> And this will be evidenced by the following particulars. (1.) If you consider how near and dear Jesus Christ was to the Father. He was his Son, his only Son; saith the Text. The Son of his Love. The darling of his soul. His other self. Yea one with himself. The express Image of his person. The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Fathers glory. In parting with him, he parted with his own heart, with his very bowels, as I may say. Yet <hi>to us a Son is given, Esa.</hi> 9.6. And such a Son as he calls <hi>his dear Son, Col.</hi> 1.13. A late writer tells us that he hath been informed that in the Famine in <hi>Germany,</hi> a poor family being ready to perish with Famine; the Husband made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Wife, to sell one of the Children for bread, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themselves, and the rest. The Wife at last consents it should be so, but then they began to think, which of the four should be sold. And when the eldest was named, they both refused to part with that, being their first born, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their strength. Well, then they came to the second; but could not yield that he should be sold; being the very picture and lively image of his Father. The third was named, but that also was a child that best resembled the mother. And when the youngest was thought on, that was the <hi>Benjamin</hi>: The child of their old age And so were content rather to perish altogether in the Famine, than part with a child for relief. And you know how tenderly <hi>Iacob</hi> took it, when his <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were rent from him. What is a child; but a piece of the parent wrapt up in another skin? And yet our dearest children are but as strangers to us, in comparison of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable dearness that was betwixt the Father and Christ. Now that he should ever be content to part with a Son, and such an only one; is such a manifestation of Love, as will be admired to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>And then (2.) let it be considered, <hi>to what he gave him,</hi> even to death and that of the Cross; to be made a curse for us. To be the scorn and contempt of men. To the most unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell'd sufferings that ever were inflicted or born by any. It melts our bowels, it breaks our hearts to behold our children

To wrath, to the wrath of an infinite God without mixture, to the very torments of hell, was Christ delivered; and that by the hand of his own Father. Sure then, that love must needs want a name, which made the Father of mercies deliver his own only Son, to such miserys for us. (3.) It is a special consideration to enhance the love of God in giving Christ, that in giving him, he gave the richest Jewel in his Cabinet. A mercy of the greatest worth and most inestimable value. Heaven it self is not so valuable and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Christ is. He is the better half of heaven. And so the Saints account him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? Ten thousand thousand worlds,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O what a fair one! What an only one! What an excellent lovely ravishing one, is Christ. Put the Beauty of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Paradices, like the garden of Eden into one; put all Trees, all Flowers, all Smells, all Colours, all Tasts, all Ioys, all Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, all Loveliness in one; O what a fair and excellent thing would that be! And yet it should be less to that fair and dearest well beloved Christ, than one drop of rain to the whole Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and Fountains of ten thousand Earths. Christ is heavens wonder, and earths wonder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for God to bestow the mercy of mercys, the most precious thing in heaven or earth upon poor sinners: and as great, as lovely, as excellent as his Son was; yet not to account him too good to bestow upon us, what manner of love is this! (4.) Once more, let it be considered on whom the Lord bestowed his Son. Upon Angels? No, but upon men. Upon man his friend? No, but upon his enemies. This is Love; And on this consideration the Apostle lays a mighty weight in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. <hi>But God</hi> (saith he) <hi>commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us.</hi>— When we were enemies we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54346:39"/>
to God by the death of his Son. Who would part with a Son, for the sake of his dearest friends? but God gave him to, and delivered him for enemies. O Love unspeakable! (5.) Lastly, let us consider how freely this gift came from him. It was not wrested out of his hand by our importunity, for we as little desired, as deserved it. It was surprizing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, eternal love that delivered him to us. <hi>Not that we loved him, but he first loved us.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. Thus, as when you weigh a thing; you cast in weight after weight, till the scales break: so doth God, one consideration upon another to overcome our hearts, and make us admiringly to cry, what manner of Love is this! And thus I have shewed you what Gods giving of Christ is. And what matchless love is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that incomparable gift.</p>

They hold all other things in Christ; who is the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and most comprehensive mercy. To make out the grounds of this comfortable deduction, let these <hi>four</hi> things be pondered, and duly weighed in your thoughts. (1.) No other mercy you need, or desire, is, or can be so dear to God, as Jesus Christ is. He never layed any other thing in his bosom, as he did his Son. As for the world and the comforts of it, it is the dust of his feet, he values it not. As you see by his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial disposals of it; having given it to the worst of men. <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> (said <hi>Luther</hi>) as great and glorious as it is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Totum Iurci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum imperiam quantum, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est; mica tantum est<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quam Pater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milias projicit cambus.</hi> Luther.</note> is but a crum which the Master of the family throws to the Dogs. Think upon any other outward enjoyment that's valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in your eyes, and there is not so much compare betwixt it, and Christ, in the esteem of God, as is betwixt your dear Children, and the Lumber of your houses, in your esteem. If then God have parted so freely from that which was infinitly dearer to him than these, how shall he deny these, when they may promote his glory and your good? (2.) As Jesus Christ was nearer the heart of God than all these, so Christ is in himself much <hi>greater,</hi> and more excellent than them all; Ten thousand worlds, and the glory of them all, is but the dust of the ballance, if weighed with Christ. These things are but poor creatures, but he is over all; God blessed for ever. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. They are the common gifts, but he is <hi>the gift of God.</hi> Joh. 4.10. They are ordinary mercys, but he is <hi>the mercy, Luk.</hi> 1.72. As one Pearl or precious stone is greater in value than ten thousand common pebbles. Now, if God have so freely given the greater, how can you suppose he should deny the lesser mercys? Will a man give to another a large inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and stand with him for a trifle. How can it be. (3.) There is no other mercy you stand in want of, but you are entitled to it by the gift of Christ. It is (as to right) conveyed to you with Christ. So in the forecited, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. <hi>The world is yours, yea, all is yours; for ye are Christs.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. For all the promises of God in Christ, in him they are, yea, and in him Amen. With him he hath given you all things, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54346:40"/>
The word signifies <hi>rem aliquam cum laetitia percipere.</hi> To have the sweet relish, and comfort of an enjoyment. So have we in all our mercys, upon the account of our title to them in Christ. (4.) Lastly, if God have given you this <hi>nearer, greater,</hi> and <hi>all comprehending mercy</hi> when you were enemies to him; and alienated from him: it is not imaginable he should now deny you any inferiour mercy, when you are come into a state of reconciliation and amity with him. So the Apostle reasons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</hi> And thus you have the second Inference with its grounds.</p>

Beside, methinks its astonishing, that you should despise a mercy in which your own souls are so dearly, so deeply, so everlastingly concerned in; as they are in this gift of God. If it were but the soul of another, nay less, if but the body of another; and yet less than that, if but anothers beast, whose life you could preserve, you are obliged to do it: but when it is thy self, yea, the best part of thy self; thine own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable soul that thou ruinest and destroyest hereby: Oh what a monster art thou to cast it away thus! What! will you slight your own souls? Care you not whether they be saved, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be damned? Is it indeed an indifferent thing with you, which way they fall at death? Have you imagined a tollerable Hell? Is it easie to perish? Are you not only turned Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but your own too? O see what monsters can sin turn men and women into! O the stupifying, besotting, intoxicating power of Sin! But perhaps you think that all these are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain sounds, with which we alarm you. It may be thine own heart will Preach such Doctrine as this to thee. Who can assure thee of the reallity of these things? What shouldst thou trouble thy self about an invisible world? or be so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for what thine eyes never saw, nor didst ever receive the report from any that have seen them? Well, though we cannot now shew you these things, yet shortly they shall be shewn you: and your own eyes shall behold them. You are convinced and satisfied that many other things are real, which you never saw.

But be assured, that <hi>if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every transgression, and disobedience received a just recompence of reward: How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? Which at first began to be spoken to us by the Lord, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by them that heard him: God also bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. But if they be certain, yet they are not near. It will be a long time before they come: poor soul, how dost thou cheat thy self! It may be not by twenty parts, so long a time as thine own phancy draws it forth for thee. Thou art not certain of the next moment.</p>
                  <p>And suppose what thou imaginest, what is Twenty or Forty years when it is past? yea, what is a thousand years, to the vast eternity? Go trifle away a few days more, sleep out a few nights more, and then lie down in the dust; it will not be long ere the Trump of God shall awaken thee: and thine eyes shall behold Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven, and then you will know the price of this sin. O therefore if there be any sence of eternity upon you, any pity or love for your selves in you, if you have any concernments more than the beasts that perish, despise not your own offered mercies, slight not the richest gift, that ever was yet opened to the world, and a sweeter cannot be opened to all Eternity.</p>

               <p>To explicate this mysterie more particularly, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p>First, The humane nature was united to the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>miraculously,</hi> and extraordinarily: being supernaturally fram'd in the womb of the Virgin, by the over-shadowing power of the highest, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.34, 35. By reason whereof it may truly and properly be said, to be the fruit of the womb,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54346:44"/>
not of the loyns <hi>of man,</hi> but not by man. And this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to exempt the assumed nature from the stain and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, which it wholly escaped; in as much as he received it not as all others do, in the way of ordinary generation; wherein Original sin is propagated: but this being extraordinarily produced, was a most pure and holy thing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. And indeed this perfect shining holiness in which it was produced, was absolutely necessary; both in order to its union with the Divine person, and the design of that union; which was both to satisfie for, and to sanctifie us. The two natures could not be conjoyned in the person of Christ, had there been the least taint of sin upon the humane nature. For God can have no fellowship with sin, much less be united to it. Or supposing such a conjunction with our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nature, yet he being a sinner himself, could never satisfie for the sins of others. Nor could an unholy thing ever make us holy. <hi>Such an high-Priest therefore became us as is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. And such an one must he needs be, whom the holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in such a peculiar way <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That holy thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As it was produced miraculously, so it was assumed <hi>integrally.</hi> That is to say Christ took a compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect humane soul and body, with all and every faculty and member pertaining to it. And this was necessary (as both <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> have well observed) that hereby he might heal the whole nature,<note place="margin">

These it was no way necessary that Christ should; not did he at all assume but the natural ones, such as Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Sweating, Bleeding, Mortality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which though they are not in themselves formally and intrinsecally sinful; yet are they the effects, and consequents of sin. They are so many marks, that sin hath left of its self upon our natures. And on that account Christ is said to be sent <hi>in the likeness of sinful Flesh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. Wherein the gracious condescension of Christ for us, is marvelously signallized. That he would not assume our innocent nature, as it was in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall; while it stood in all its primitive glory, and perfection: but after sin had quite defaced, ruined, and spoil'd it.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Another fruit of this Hypostatical union is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular advancement of the humane nature in Christ far beyond and above what it is capable of in any other person, it being hereby replenished and fill'd with an unparelell'd measure of Divine graces and excellencies,<note place="margin">

(1.) That the humane nature was not assumed to any intrinsecal perfection of the Godhead, but to make that humane nature it self per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Divine did not assume the humane nature necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but voluntarily; not out of indigence, but bounty: not because it was to be perfected by it, but to perfect it, by causing it to lie as a pipe to the infinite all-filling Fountain of grace and glory; of which it is the great receptacle. (2.) And so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to qualify and prepare him for a full discharge of his mediatorship in the offices of our Prophet, Priest, and King.

I can say no more. I would, I could build as much on this,</hi> My Christ is God, <hi>as it would bear: I might lay all the world upon it.</hi>

            <p>YOU have heard Christs compact or agreement with the Father, in the Covenant of Redemption. As also what the Father did in pursuance of the ends thereof; in giving his Son out of his bosom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also what the Son hath done towards it in assuming Flesh. But though the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work be thus far advanced, yet all he should act in that assumed Body, had been invallid and vain, without a due call, and Commission from the Father so to do. Which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the words now before you.</p>
            <p>This Scripture is a part of Christs excellent reply to a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ended generation, who followed him, not for any Spiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that they saw in him; or Soul advantages they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, but for bread. Insteed of making his service their meat and drink, they only served him that they might eat, and drink. <hi>Self</hi> is a thing may creep into the best hearts, and actions; but it only predominates in the Hypocrite. These

Christs reply is partly <hi>disswasive,</hi> and partly <hi>directive.</hi> He disswades them from puting the secondary and subordinate, in the place of the principal, and ultimate end. Not to prefer their Bodies to their Souls. Their fleshly accommodations, to the glory of God. <hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth.</hi> Wherein he doth not take them off from their lawful labours, and callings: but he disswades them, <hi>first,</hi> from minding these things too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, and <hi>secondly,</hi> he disswades them from that odious Sin of making Religion but a pretence for the belly.</p>
            <p>And it is partly <hi>directive,</hi> and that in the main end and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life. <hi>But labour for that meat which endures to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> To get bread for your Souls, to live Eternally by. And that he might engage their diligence in seeking it to purpose, he shews them not only where they may have it, [<hi>Which the Son of Man shall give you</hi>] but also how they may be fully satisfied that he hath it for them; in the clause I have pitched on, <hi>For him hath God the Father Sealed.</hi>

               <head>In these words are three parts observable.</head>
               <p>First, The Person Sealing, or investing Christ with Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power. Which is said to be <hi>God the Father.</hi> Though all the Persons in the Godhead are equal in nature, dignity, and power: yet in their operation there is an order observed among them. The <hi>Father</hi> sends the Son, The <hi>Son</hi> is sent by the Father, The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is sent by both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Subject in which God the Father lodges this Authority [<hi>Him</hi>] that is the Son of Man. Jesus Christ he is the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> first receptacle of it. And he must here be understood exclusively. God the Father hath so Sealed him, as he never Sealed any other before him, or that shall arise after him. No name is given in heaven or earth, but this name by which we are Saved, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>The government is upon his shoulders,</hi> Isa. 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here is farther observable; the way and manner of the Fathers delegating and committing this Authority to Christ. And that is by <hi>Sealing</hi> him. Where we have both a

               <p>When I say he did not of himself undertake this work, I mean not that he was unwilling to go about it; for his heart was as fully and ardently engaged in it as the Fathers was: so he tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Loe I come to do thy will O God, thy Law is in my heart.</hi> But the meaning is, he came not without a due call and full commission from his Father.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> What was that office or work to which his Father Sealed him? I answer more generally, he was Sealed to the whole work of mediation for us, thereby to recover and save all the elect, whom the Father had given him. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.2. It was to <hi>give Eternal Life to as many as were given him.</hi> It was <hi>to bring Iacob, again to him,</hi> Esa. 49.5. Or as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle expresses it, Pet. 3.18. <hi>That he might bring us to God.</hi> More particularly in order to the sure and full effecting of this most glorious design, he was Sealed to the offices of a Prophet, Priest, and King; that so he might bring about and compass this work.</p>
               <p>First, God Sealed him a commission to Preach the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Salvation to sinners. This commission Christ opened, and read in the audience of the people, Luk. 4.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>And when he had opened the Book, he found the place where it is written; the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath annointed me to Preach the Gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, to Preach deliverance to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised. To Preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the Book,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he began to say unto them, this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He also Sealed him to the Priesthood, and that the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Authorizing him to execute both the parts of it, <hi>viz. Oblatory,</hi> and <hi>intercessory.</hi> He call'd him to offer up himself a Sacrifice for us. <hi>I have power</hi> (saith he) <hi>to lay down my Life, this commandment have I received of my Father,</hi> Joh. 10.18. And upon that account his offering up of his Blood, is by the Apostle stiled an act of obedience, as it is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death.</hi> He also call'd him to intercede for us, Heb. 7.21, 24, 25. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54346:51"/>
Fathers commission, as it is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power in heaven and earth, is given to me.</hi> To all this was Christ Sealed and Authorized by his Father.</p>
               <p>What doth the Fathers Sealing of Christ to this work and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> office imply? There are divers things implyed in it. As
<list>
                     <item>First, The validity and efficacy of all his mediatory acts. For by vertue of this his Sealing, what ever he did was fully ratified. And in this very thing lies much of a believers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and security. For as much as all acts done without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and authority, (how great or able so ever the person that doth them is) yet are in themselves null and void. But what is done by commission and authority, is Authentick and most allowable among men. Had Christ come from heaven and entred upon his Mediatory work, without a due call, our Faith had been stumbled at the very threshold, but this greatly satisfies.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, It imports the great obligation lying upon Jesus Christ to be faithful, in the work he was Sealed to. For the Father in this commission devolves a great trust upon him; and relies upon him for his most faithful discharge thereof. And indeed upon this very accompt, Christ reckons himself specially obliged to pursue the Fathers design and end, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4. <hi>I must work the works of him that sent me.</hi> And Joh. 5.30. <hi>I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which sent me.</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssity of punctual and precise obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it. And as a faithful servant will have his own will swallowed up in the Fathers will.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, It imports Christs compleat qualification or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumental fitn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ss, to serve the Fathers design and end in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Had not God known him to be every way fit and qualified for the Work, he would never have Sealed him a commission for it. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n may, but God will not Seal an unfit or incapable person for his work. And indeed what ever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable in a servant, was eminently found in Christ. For <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> none like him. <hi>Moses</hi> indeed was faithful to a Pin, but still as a Servant: but Christ as a Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. He is the faithful and true witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ss, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, For Zeal, none like him. The Zeal of Gods house did eat him up, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16, 17. He was so intent upon his Fathers work, that he forgat to eat bread,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54346:52"/>
counting his work his meat, and drink, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.32. Yea, and love to his Father carryed him on through all his work, and made him delight in the hardest piece of his service. For he served him as a Son, <hi>Heb,</hi> 3.5, 6. All that ever he did was done in love. For wisdom, none like him. The Father knew him to be most wise, and said of him before he was imploy'd, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my Servant shall deal prudently,</hi> Isa, 52.13. To conclude, for self-denial, never any like him; he sought not his own glory but the glory of him that sent him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.50. Had he not been thus faithful Zealous, full of love, prudent, and self-denying; he had never been imployed in this great affair.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, It implys Christs sole authority in the Church, to appoint and enjoyn what he pleaseth. And this is his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar prerogative. For the Commission God Sealed him in the Text, is a single, not a joynt Commission he hath Sealed him, and none beside him. Indeed there were some that pretended a call and commission from God, but all that were before him, were Thieves and Robbers, that came not in at the door, as he did,<note place="margin">

                  <item>Thirdly, Christ was Sealed <hi>by the Fathers immediate testimony from Heaven, whereby he was declared to be the Person whom the Father had solemnly designed and appointed to this work.</hi> And God gave this extraordinary testimony of him, at two remarkable seasons. The one was Just at his entrance upon his Publique Ministry,<note place="margin">Caryll. in Job 1.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> The other but a little before his sufferings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. This voice was not formed by such Organs and Instruments of speech as ours are, but by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54346:53"/>
creating a voice in the air, which the people hear sounding thereby this God owned, approved, and as by a Seal ratified his work.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, Christ was Sealed by the Father, <hi>in all those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary miraculous works wrought by him,</hi> in which the Father gave yet more full and convincing testimonies to the world, that this was he whom he had appointed to be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. These were convictive to the world, that God had sent him. And that his Doctrine was of God. <hi>God annointed Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power, who went about doing good; and healing all that were oppressed of the Devil; for God was with him,</hi> Acts 10.38. And so <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.36. <hi>I have a greater witness than that of</hi> John, <hi>for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</hi> Therefore he still refer'd those that doubted of him, or of his Doctrine, to this Seal of his Father: even the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works he wrought in the power of God. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.3.4, 5. And thus the Father Sealed him.</item>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lastly, We will enquire why it was necessary Christ should be Sealed by his Father to this work. And there are these three weighty reasons for it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>Else he had not corresponded with the Types which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured him, and in him it was necessary that they be all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</hi> You know under the Law, the Kings and High-Priests had their Inaugurations, by solemn unctions; in all which this consecration, or Sealing of Christ to his work, was shadow'd out. And therefore you shall find, Heb. 5.4, 5. <hi>No man taketh this honour to himself, but he that is call'd of God, as was Aaron; so also</hi> (mark the necessary correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency betwixt Christ and them) <hi>Christ glorifi'd not himself to be made an High-Priest, but he that said unto him thou art my Son.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, Moreover <hi>hereby the hearts of believers are the more engaged to love the Father, in as much as it appears hereby that the Fathers love and good will to them, was the Original and Spring of their Redemption.</hi> For had not the Father Sealed him such a Commission, he had not come; but now he comes in the Fathers name, and in the Fathers love, as well as his name: and so all men are bound to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54346:53"/>
ascribe equal glory and honour to them both. As it is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.23.</item>
                  <item>Lastly, And Especially, Christ would not come without a Commission, because <hi>else you had no ground for your Faith in him.</hi> How should we have <hi>been satisfied</hi> that this is indeed the true Messiah, except he had opened his Commission to the world, and shew'd his Fathers Seal annexed to it? If he had come without his <hi>Credentials</hi> from heaven, and only told the world that God had sent him; and that they must take his bare word for it: Who could have rested his Faith on that Testimony? And that is the true meaning of that place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.31. <hi>If I bear witness of my self, my witness, is not true. How so?</hi> You will say doth not that contradict what he saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Though I bear record of my self, yet my record is true.</hi> Therefore you must understand truth, not as it is opposed to reality; but the meaning is, if I had only given you my bare word for it, and not brought other evidence from my Father, my Testimony had not been Authentick, and valid, according to humane Laws. But now all doubtings are precluded. Let us next improve this.</item>

You see he hath opened his Commission in the Gospel, shewn the world his Fathers Hand and Seal to it, given as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple satisfaction as reason it self could desire or expect: yet even his own received him not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.11. And he knew it before hand, and therefore complain'd by the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our Report?</hi> &amp;c. Yea, and that he is believed on in the world, is by the Apostle put among the great mysteries of godliness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. A man that well considers with what convincing evidence Christ comes, would rather think it a mysterie that any should not believe. But O the bruitish obstinacy and Devilish enmity that is in nature, to Jesus Christ! Devilish did I say, you must give me that word again, for he compell'd their assent. <hi>We know thee whom thou art.</hi> And it is equally as wonderful to see the facility that is in nature to comply (mean while) with any, even the most foolish im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54346:54"/>
Let a false Christ arise, and he shall deceive many. As it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. Of this Christ complains, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reason, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.43. <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not. If another come in his own name, him will ye receive. q. d.</hi> You are incredulous to none but me. Every deceiver, every pitiful cheat that hath but wit, or rather wickedness, enough to tell you the Lord hath sent him; though you must take his own single word for it: He shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and get Disciples: but though I come in my Fathers name, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a sore plague that lies upon the world, and a wonder that we all are not ingulphed in the same Infidelity.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, Draw out the comfort of Christs Sealing for you. Remember that hereby God stands ingaged, even by his own Seal, to allow and confirm, what ever Christ hath done in the business of your Salvation. And on this ground you may thus plead with God. Lord, thou hast Sealed Christ to this Office, and therefore I depend upon it; that thou allowest all that he hath done, and all that he hath suffered for me, and wilt make good all that he hath promised me. If men will not deny their own Seals, much less wilt thou.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Get your interest in Christ Sealed to you by the Spirit, else you cannot have the comfort of Christs being Sealed for you. Now the Spirit Seals two ways, <hi>Objectively,</hi> and <hi>Effectually</hi>; the first is by working those graces in us, which are the conditions of the promises. The latter is by shining upon his own Work, and helping the Soul to discern it. Which follows the other both in order of nature, and of time. And these Sealings of the Spirit are to be distinguisht both <hi>ex parti Subjecti,</hi> by their Subject, or the quality of the Person Sealed, which always is a Believer, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. For there can be no reflex, till there have been a <hi>Direct Act</hi> of Faith. <hi>Ex parte materiae.</hi> By the matter of which that comfort is made. Which if it be of the Spirit, is ever consonant to the written Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. And partly <hi>ab effectis,</hi> by its

effects, for it commonly produces in the Sealed Soul, great care, and caution to avoid Sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. Great Love to God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.22.

                  </note>This point is a glass, wherein the eye of your Faith may see Jesus Christ preparing himself, to be offered up to God for us. Fitting himself to die. And to keep a clear Method, I shall open these two things in the doctrinal part, first, what his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying himself implys. Secondly, how it respects us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, What is implyed in this phrase <hi>I sanctifie my self.</hi> And there are seven things carried in it.</p>
               <p>First, This phrase, [<hi>I sanctifie my self</hi>] implys <hi>the personal union of the two natures in Christ.</hi> For what is that which he here calls himself, but the same that was consecrated to be a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54346:57"/>
Sacrifice; even his humane nature? This was the sacrifice. And this also was himself. So the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>He through the eternal Spirit, offered up himself to God, without Spot.</hi> So that our nature by that assumption, is become him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Greater honour cannot be done it. Or a greater ground of comfort proposed to us. But having spoken of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the former Sermon, I shall remit the Reader thither.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This sanctifying or consecrating himself to be a Sacrifice for us, <hi>implys the greatness and dreadfulne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of that breach which sin made betwixt God and us.</hi> You see no less Sacrifice than Christ himself, must be sanctified, to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement. Judge of the greatness of the wound, by the breadth of the plaister. <hi>Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for sin, thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me, Heb.</hi> 10.5. All our repentance, could we shed as many tears for Sin, as there have fallen drops of rain, Since the Creation, could not have been our attonement: <hi>but God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.</hi> And had he not sanctified Christ to this end, he would have sanctified himself upon us, in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fury for ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This his sanctifying himself, <hi>implys his free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary undertakement of the Work.</hi> It is not <hi>I am sanctified,</hi> as if he he had been meerly passive in it; as the Lambs that typed him out were,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> when pluckt from the fold: but it's an active verb that he uses here, <hi>I sanctifie my self,</hi> he would have none think that he dyed out of a necessity of compulsion, but out of choice. Therefore he is said to <hi>offer up himself to God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. And in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>I lay down my life of my self, no man takes it from me.</hi> And although it's often said <hi>his Father sent him,</hi> and <hi>gave him</hi>; yet his heart was as much set on that work, as if there had been nothing but glory, ease, and comfort in it. he was under no constraint, but that of his own Love. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as when the Scripture would set forth the willingness of the Father to this work, it saith <hi>God sent his Son,</hi> and <hi>God gave his Son</hi>; so when it would set forth Christs willingness to it: it saith, he <hi>offered up himself, gave himself,</hi> and here in the Text <hi>sanctified himself.</hi> The sacrifice that strugled, and came not without force to the Altar, was reckon'd ominous, and unlucky by the Heathen; our sacrifice dedicated himself. He dyed out of choice. And was a free-will offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54346:58"/>Fourthly, His sanctifying himself implys <hi>his pure and perfect holyness. That he had no Spot or blemish in him.</hi> Those beasts that prefigured him, were to be without blemish. And none else were consecrated to that Service. So, and more than so it behoved Christ to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Such an High-Priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came us as is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from Sinners.</hi> And what it became him to be, he was. Therefore in allusion to the Lambs offered under the Law, the Apostle calls him, <hi>a Lamb without blemish, or Spot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. Every other man hath a double Spot upon him, the heart Spot, and the life Spot. The Spot of original, and the Spots of actual Sins. But Christ was without either. He had not the Spot of original Sin, for he was not by man. He came in a peculiar way into the world, and so escaped that. Not yet of actual sins, for as his nature, so his life was Spotless, and pure, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.9. <hi>He did no iniquity.</hi> And though he was tempted to sin, externally, yet he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defiled in heart, or practice. He came as near it as he could come for our sakes, yet still without sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 15. If he sanctifie himself for a Sacrifice, he must be such as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, pure, and spotless.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His sanctifying himself for our sakes speaks <hi>the strength of his Love, and largeness of his heart to poor sinners, thus to set himself wholly and entirely apart for us.</hi> So that what he did, and suffered, must all of it have a respect and relation to us. He did not (when consecrated for us) live a moment, do an act, or speak a word; but it had some tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the great design of our Salvation. He was only, and wholly, and always doing your work, when consecrated for your sakes. His Incarnation respects you, <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>For us a Child is born, to us a Son is given.</hi> And he would never have been the Son of man, but to make you the Sons and Daughters of God. God would not have come down in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the habit of a man, but to raise up sinful man into the likeness of God. All the miracles he wrought were for you, to confirm your Faith. When he raised up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11.42. <hi>Because of the people which stand by, I said it: that they might believe that thou hast sent me.</hi> While he lived on earth, he lived as one wholly set apart for us. And when he dyed, he dyed for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. He was made a curse for us. When he hanged on that cursed tree he hang'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54346:58"/>
there in our room, and did but fill our place. When he was buried, he was buried for us. For the end of it was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume our Graves, against we come to lie down in them. And when he rose again, it was (as the Apostle saith) <hi>for our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> Rom. 4.25. When he ascended into glory, he protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was about our business. That he went <hi>to prepare places for us.</hi> And if it had not been so, he would have told us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.2. And now he is there, it is for us that he there lives. For <hi>he ever lives to make intercession for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. And when he shall return again to Judge the world, he will come for us too. <hi>He comes</hi> (when ever it be) <hi>to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in them that believe,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.10. He comes to gather his Saints home to himself, that where he is, there they all may be, in Soul, and Body with him for ever. Thus you see how, as his Consecration for us doth speak him set a part for our use; so he did wholly bestow himself, time, life, death, and all upon us. Living, and Dying for no other end, but to accomplish this great work of Salvation for us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His sanctifying himself for us, plainly speaks the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerency of his death, that it was in our room or stead.</hi> When the Priest Consecrated the Sacrifice, it was set apart for the people. So it's said of the scape Goat, <hi>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live Goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the Children of Israel; and all their transgressions, in all their sins: puting them upon the head of the Goat. And shall send him away by the hand of a fit man, into the Wilderness,</hi> Levit. 16.21. Thus <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6.7. He stood in our room, to bear our burden.. And as <hi>Aaron</hi> laid the iniquities of the people upon the Goat, so were ours laid on Christ. It was said to him in that day, on thee be their Pride, their Unbelief, their hardness of heart, their vain thoughts, their earthly mindedness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou art Consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, to be the Sacrifice in their room. His death was in our stead, as well as for our good. And so much his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying himself [for us] imports.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, His sanctifying himself, <hi>imports the extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Person. For it speaks him to be both Priest, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and Altar all in one. A thing unheard of in the world before.</hi> So that his name might well be called wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54346:59"/>
                  <hi>I sanctifie my self.</hi> I sanctifie, according to both natures. My self, that is my humane nature; which was the Sacrifice, upon the Altar of my Divine nature. For 'tis the Altar that sanctifies the gift. As the three offices never met in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before, so these three things never met in one Priest before. The Priests indeed Consecrated the bodies of Beasts for Sacrifice; but never offered up their own Souls, and Bodies as a whole burnt offering, as Christ did. And thus you have the import of this phrase, <hi>I sanctifie my self for their sake.</hi>

For unto us the Scriptures every where refer it. So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Christ our Passover is Sacrificed for us,</hi> Eph. 5.2. He <hi>loved the Church, and gave himself for it.</hi> See <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. This will be made out by a three fold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Christs Death, And
<list>
                     <item>First, Let it he considered, that <hi>he was not offered up to God for his own Sins.</hi> For he was most holy, <hi>Isa</hi> 53.9. No ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was found in him. Indeed the Priests under the Law, offered for themselves as well as the people: But Christ did not do so, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>He need not daily as those High-Priests, to offer up Sacrifice, first for his own Sins, and then for the peoples.</hi> And indeed had he been a sinner, what value or efficacy could have been in his Sacrifice? He could not have been the Sacrifice, but would have needed one. Now if Christ were most holy, and yet put to death, and cruel sufferings: either his Death and sufferings must be an act of injustice, and cruelty: or it must respect others, whose persons and cause he sustained in that suffering capacity. He could never have suffered or dyed by the Fathers hand, had he not been a sinner by imputation. And in that respect (as <hi>Luther</hi> speaks) he was the greatest of sinners. Or as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaketh, all <hi>our sins were made to meet upon him.</hi> Not that he was so intrinsecally, but was made so; <hi>sc.</hi> by imputation. As is clear from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He was made sin for us, that had no sin.</hi> So that hence it's evident, that Christs Death or Sacrifice is wholly a respective, or relative thing.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, It is not to be forgotten here, that the Scriptures frequently call the death of Christ <hi>a price,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>(i. e.) praetium ex ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse respondens.</hi>
                        </note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. And a <hi>ransom, Matth.</hi> 20.28. Or counterprice. To whom then doth it relate, but to them that were and are in bondage and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54346:59"/>
captivity? If it were to redeem any, it must be captives: but Christ himself was never in Captivity. He was always in his Fathers bosom, as you have heard; but we were in cruel bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and thraldom under the Tyranny of sin, and Satan. And it's we only that have the benefit of this ransom.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, Either the death of Christ must relate to believers, or else he must die in vain. As for the Angels, those that stood in their integrity needed no Sacrifice; and those that fell are totally excluded from any benefit by it. He is not a Mediator for them. And among men that have need of it, unbelievers have no share in it. They reject it. Such have no part in it. If then he neither dyed for himself, as I proved before, nor for Angels, nor unbelievers: either his blood must be shed with respect to believers, or which is most absurd, and never to be imagined, shed as water upon the ground, and totally cast away. So that you see by all this it was <hi>for our Sakes</hi> (as the Text speaks) that he sanctified himself. And now we may say Lord, the <hi>Condemnation</hi> was thine, that the <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> might be mine. The <hi>Agony</hi> thine, that the <hi>Victory</hi> might be mine. The <hi>Pain</hi> was thine, and the <hi>Ease</hi> mine. The <hi>Stripes</hi> thine, and the <hi>Healing Balm</hi> issuing from them mine. The <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> was thine, that the <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Sweet</hi> might be mine. The <hi>Curse</hi> was thine, that the <hi>Blessing</hi> might be mine. The <hi>Crown of Thorns</hi> was thine, that the <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> might be mine. The <hi>Death</hi> was thine, the <hi>Life</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by it mine. Thou payedst the <hi>Price,</hi> that I might enjoy the <hi>Inheritance.</hi>

O that all who profess Faith in Christ, could subscribe Cordially to that profession, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. <hi>None of us liveth to himself, and no man dyeth to himself, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to to the Lord: so then whether we live or die, we are the Lords.</hi> This is to be a Christian indeed.

Soul (saith Christ) my person is wonderful, but what I am, I am for thee. My life was spent in labour, and travel; but I lived for thee. And Lord (saith the believer) my person is vile, and not worth thy accepting, but such as it is it's thine, my Soul, with all and every faculty; my body, and every member of it, my gifts, time, and all my Talents are thine.</p>
                  <p>And see that as Christ bequeathed and made over himself to you, so ye in the like manner bestow and make over your selves to him. He lived not, neither dyed (as you hear) for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but you. O that you in like manner would down with self, and up with Christ, in the room of it.

                  <p>He was so wholly given up to your service, that he refused not the worst and hardest part of it; even bleeding, groaning, dying work, his love to you sweetned all this to him: can you say so too? do you <hi>account the reproaches of Christ, greater riches than the Treasures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>as</hi> Moses <hi>did,</hi> Heb. 11.26.</p>
                  <p>He had so intirely devoted himself to your work, that he could not be at rest till it was finished.

The Apostate is said to tread upon the Son of God, as if he were no better than the dirt under his Feet, and to count his Blood an unholy (or common) thing. But woe to them that so do, they shall be counted worthy of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worse then dying without mercy. As the Apostle there speaks.</p>
                  <p>And as this is the Sin of the Apostate, so is it also the Sin of all those that without Faith approach, and so prophane the Table of the Lord, unbeleivingly and unworthily handling those aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things. Such <hi>eat and drink judgement to themselves, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. Whereas the body of Christ was a thing of the deepest sanctification that ever God created. Sanctified (as the Text tells us) to a far more excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious purpose, than ever any Creature in Heaven or Earth was sanctified. It was therefore the great sin of those <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not to discern it; and not to behave themselves towards it, when they saw and handled the signs of it, as so holy a thing.</p>
                  <p>And as it was their great Sin, so God declared his just indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it, in those sore strokes inflicted for it. As they discerned not the Lords body, so neither did the Lord discern their bodies from others, in the judgements that were inflicted. And as one well observes God drew the Model and Plat-form of their punishment, from the structure and proportion of their sin. And truly, if the moral and spiritual Seeds and originals of many of our outward afflictions and sicknesses were but duly sifted out, possibly we might find a great part of them, in the Bowels of this sin.</p>
                  <p>The just and righteous God, will build up the breaches we make upon the honour of his Son, with the ruines of that beauty, strength and honour which he hath given our Bodies. O then,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54346:61"/>
when you draw nigh to God in that ordinance, take heed to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his name, by a spiritual discerning of this most holy, and most deeply sanctified Body of the Lord. Sanctified beyond all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Angels or Men, not only in respect of the Spirit which fill'd him without measure, with inherent holiness; but also in respect of its dedication to such a service as this. It being set apart by him, to such holy solemn ends, and uses: as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>And let it for ever be a warning to such as have lifted up their hands to Christ in an holy profession, that they never lift up their <hi>Heel</hi> against him afterwards by <hi>Apostacy.</hi> The Apostate treads on Gods dear Son, and God will tread upon him for it. <hi>Thou hast troden down all that err from thy Statutes,</hi> Psal. 119.118.</p>

                     <hi>have we here before us</hi>! calling all that are in Christ, to an imitation of him. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give our selves up to their service, as Christ did. Not in the same kind, so none can give himself for them; but as we are capable. You see here how his Heart was affected to them, that he would sanctifie himself as a Sacrifice for them. See to what a height of duty the Apostle improves this example of Christ, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us; and we ought also to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</hi> Some Christians came up fairly to this pattern, in the Primitive times. <hi>Priscila</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> laid down their Necks for <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 16.4. (i. e.) eminently hazarded their lives for him; and even he himself could <hi>rejoyce if he were offered up upon the Sacrifice and service of their Faith,</hi> Phil. 2.17. And in the next times, what more known, even to the Enemies of Christianity, than their fervent love one to another? <hi>Ecce quam mutuò se deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, &amp; mori volunt pro alterutris.</hi> See how they love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are willing to dye one for another.</p>
                  <p>But alas, that Primitive Spirit is almost lost in this degenerate Age. Instead of laying down life, how few will lay down twelve pence for them. I remember it's the observation of a late Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy upon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 95.40. that he is perswaded there is hardly that man to be found this day alive, that fully understands, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes that Scripture.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>God abhors and hates all unholiness</hi>: do ye so also, that you may be like your Father, which is in Heaven. And when the Spirit of holiness runs down thus upon you, a sweeter evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the World cannot give, that Christ was sanctified for you. Holy ones may confidently lay the hand of their Faith, on the head of this great Sacrifice; and say <hi>Christ our Passover, is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us.</hi>

A man that had but seen the heaps of Gold, Silver, and Brass which <hi>David</hi> amassed in his time, for the building of the Temple, might easily conclude before one Stone of it was laid, that it would be a magnificent Structure.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54346:63"/>
work, (which Christ dispatcht in a few years) before the world began; so it will be matter of eternal admiration and praise, when this world shall be dissolved. What this astonishing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work is, this Text will inform you, as to the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it. It is the work of mediation betwixt God, and Man; managed by the sole hand of the man Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>In this Scripture (for I shall not spend time to examine the words in their contexture) you have a description of <hi>Iesus the Mediator,</hi> and he is here described three ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by his work or office, a <hi>Mediator,</hi> by the singularity of his mediation, <hi>one Mediator.</hi> And by the nature and quality of his Person, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in this singular way of Mediation <hi>the man,</hi> and lastly his name's <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, he is described by the work, or office he is imploy'd about,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Mediator, a middle Person. So the word imports a fit, indifferent, and equal Person, that comes between two Persons that be at variance: to take up the difference, and make Peace. Such a middle, equal, indifferent Person is Christ. <hi>A days-man, to lay his hand upon both</hi>; to arbitrate, and award justly: and give God his due, and that without ruine to poor man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is described by the singularity of his mediation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>One Mediator,</hi> and but one, though there be many Mediators of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation among men, and many Intercessors in a petitionary way, betwixt God and Men; yet but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one only Mediator of reconciliation betwixt God and Men, and 'tis as needless, and impious to make more Mediators than one, as to make more Gods than one. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, he is described by the nature and quality of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> a meer man. The latter allow him to be the true God, but on this weak ground affirm, that he performed not the work of mediation as God, but only a man. Thus what the Spirit ordered for our comfort, is wickedly retorted to Christs

dishonour. For I doubt not but he is described by his humane nature in this place, not only because in this nature he paid that ransom; (which he speaks of in the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing) but especially for the drawing of Sinners to him; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is the man Christ Jesus. One that cloathed himself in their own Flesh; and to encourage the Faith of Believers, that he tenderly resents all their wants, and miseries; and that they may safely trust him with all their concerns, as one that will carefully mind them as his own, and will be for them a merciful and faithful High-Priest, in things pertaining to God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, he is described by his names. By his <hi>Appellative name Christ,</hi> and his proper <hi>name Iesus.</hi> The name <hi>Iesus,</hi> notes his <hi>work</hi> about which he came,<note place="margin">

The former some call his <hi>substantial, the</hi> latter his <hi>evergitical</hi> or operative meditation, though I rather conceive that which is call'd his substantial mediation, is but the aptitude of his person to execute the mediatorial function. And that it doth not constitute two kinds of mediation, his being a middle Person, fits and capacitates him to stand in the midst, betwixt God, and us. This I say is the proper sence of the word. Though <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a Mediator be rendred variously. Sometimes an Umpire, or Arbitrator. Sometimes a Messenger, that goes betwixt two Persons. Sometimes an Interpreter, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting the mind of one, to another. Sometimes a Reconciler, or Peace-maker. And in all these sences Christ is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the middle Person, in his mediation of reconciliation, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Both these ways he is the only Mediator, and he manageth this his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>First, As an <hi>Vmpire</hi> or <hi>Arbitrator.</hi> One that layeth his hands upon both Parties,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester, Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Interpreter, Conciliator.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.33. so doth Christ, he layeth his hands (speaking after the manner of men,) upon God, and saith, Father, wilt thou be at peace with them and readmit them into thy favour? If thou wilt, thou shalt be fully satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all that they have done against thee. And then he layeth his hand upon man, and saith, poor sinner, be not discouraged; thou shalt be justified, and saved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As a <hi>Messenger,</hi> or Ambassadour, so he came to impart the mind of God to us, and so he presents our desires to God.

<list>
                     <item>
                        <p>First, At the first sight, <hi>it carries in it a most dreadful breach and jar betwixt God and Men,</hi> else no need of a Mediator of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. There was indeed a sweet League of amity once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, but it was quickly dissolved by sin, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against man, pursuing him to destruction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.5. thou hatest all the works of iniquity. And man was fill'd with unnatural enmity against his God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>haters of God.</hi> This put an end to all friendly commerce, and intercourse between him and God. Reader, say not in thy heart; that it's much one sin, and that seemingly so small, should make such a breach as this: And cause the God of mercy and goodness, so to abhor the works of his hands; and that assoon as he had made man: for it was an hainous, and aggravated evil. It was upright, perfect man; created in the Image of of God, that thus sinned. He sinned when his mind was most bright, clear, and apprehensive. His Conscience pure and active. His Will free, and able to withstand any temptation. His Conscience pure, and undefiled. Yea he was a <hi>Publique,</hi> as as well as perfect man, and well knew that the happiness, or misery of his numberless offspring was involved in him.</p>
                        <p>The condition he was placed in, was exceeding happy. No necessity, or want could arm and edge a temptation. He lived amidst all natural, and spiritual pleasures, and delights; the Lord most delightfully conversing with him. Yea, he sinned while as yet his Creation-mercy was fresh upon him, and in this sin was most horrible ingratitude, yea, a casting off the yoke of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, almost assoon as God had put it on. God now saw the work of his hands spoiled, a race of <hi>Rebels</hi> now to be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54346:65"/>
who in their successive Generations would be fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God. He saw it, and his just indignation sparkled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man, and resolves to pursue him, to the bottom of Hell.</p>

                           </note> founded not upon satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but upon the absolute mercy, goodness, and free-will of God. But conceiving that absolute goodness and mercy of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling sinners to himself, there is a deep silence throughout the Scriptures. And whatever is spoken of it upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is as it works to us, through Christ, <hi>Eph,</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.40. and we cannot imagine, either how God could exercise mercy to the prejudice of his Justice, which must be, if we must be reconcil'd without full satisfaction; or how such a full satisfaction should be made by any other than Christ. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy indeed moved in the Heart of God to poor man, but from his heart, it found no way to vent it self for us, but through the Heart Blood of Jesus Christ. And in him the Justice of God was fully satisfied, and the misery of the Creature fully cured. And so as <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks; God neither lost the severity of his Justice, in the goodness of mercy; nor the goodness of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the exactness of his severity. But if it had been possible God could have found out a way to reconcile us, without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; yet it's past doubt now, that he hath picht and fixt on this way. And for any now to imagine to reconcile themselves to God, by any thing but Faith in the Blood of this Mediator: is not only most vain in it self, and destructive to the Soul; but most insolently derogatory to the wisdom and grace of God.</p>
                        <p>And to such I would say as <hi>Tertullian</hi> to <hi>Marcion</hi> whom he calls the Murtherer of Truth; spare the only hope of the whole world. O thou who destroyest the most necessary glory of our Faith.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parce unicae spei totius orbis, o tu qui destruis necessarium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus fidei</hi> Tertul. lib. de <hi>carne Christi.</hi>
                           </note> All that we hope for, is but a Phantasm without this. Peace of Conscience can be rationally settled on no other Foundation but this. For God having made a Law to govern man, and this Law violated by man; either the penalty must be levyed on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, or satisfaction made by his surety. As good no Law, as no penalty for disobedience; and as good no penalty, as no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He therefore that will be a Mediator of Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54346:66"/>
God and Man, must bring God a price in his hand; and that adequate to the offence, and wrong done him: else he will not treat about Peace, and so did our Mediator.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>Thirdly, Christs being a Mediator of reconciliation and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession implys, <hi>the infinite value of his Blood and sufferings, as that which in it self, was sufficient to stop the course of Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and render him not only placable, but abundantly satisfied, and well pleased; even with those that before were Enemies. And so much is said of it,</hi> Coll. 1.21. <hi>And ye that were sometime alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Enemies in your minds by wicked works; yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his Flesh, through death; to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his sight.</hi> Surely, that which can cause the holy God, justly incensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sinners, to lay aside all his wrath, and take an Enemy into his bosom; and establish such an amity as can never more be broken: but to rest in his love, and to joy over him with singing: as it is <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. this must be a most excellent &amp; efficatious thing.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, Christ being a Mediator of reconciliation, implys <hi>the ardent love, and large pity that filled his Heart towards poor Sinners.</hi> For he doth not not only mediate by way of intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, going betwixt both, and perswading and beging Peace; but he mediates (as you have heard) in the capacity of a surety; by putting himself under an obligation to satisfie our debts. O how compassionately did his Heart work towards us, that when he saw the arm of Justice lifted up to destroy us, would interpose himself, and receive the stroke, though he knew it would smite him dead. Our Mediator like <hi>Ionah</hi> his Type, seeing the stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Sea of Gods wrath working tempestuously, and ready to swallow us up: cast in himself, to appease the storm. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how much that noble Act of <hi>Marcus Curtius</hi> is celebrated in the Roman Story, who being informed by the Oracle, that the great breach made by the Earthquake, could not be closed, except something of worth were cast into it; heated with love to the Commonwealth, he went and cast in himself. This was looked upon as a bold and brave adventure, but what was this to Christ?</item>
                     <item>Fifthly, Christ being a Mediator betwixt God and Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys as <hi>the fitness of his Person, so his authoritative call to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it.</hi> And indeed the Father, who was the wronged Person, call'd him to be the Umpire, and Arbitrator, trusting his honour in his hands. Now Christ was invested with this office and power,

And <hi>actually,</hi> from the time of his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But having discussed this more largely in a former discourse, I shall dismiss it here, and apply my self to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, which is.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, How it appears that Jesus Christ is the true and only Mediator betwixt God, and Men? I reply it's manifest he is so.</p>
               <p>First, because he, <hi>and no other, is revealed to us by God.</hi> And if God reveal him, and no other; we must receive him, and no other as such. Take but two Scriptures at present, that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>the Heathen have many Gods, and many Lords,</hi> (i. e.) many great Gods, supream powers and ultimate objects of of their worship;<note place="margin">

One Sun is sufficient for the whole World. And one Mediator for all men in the world. So that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affirm this is he, and exclude all others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because he and no other is fit for and capable of this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54346:67"/>
Who but he that hath the divine and humane nature united in his single Person, can be a fit Days-man to lay his hand upon both; who but he that was God, could support under such suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as were by divine Justice exacted for satisfaction? take a person of the greatest Spirit, and put him but an hour in the case Christ was in, when he sweat Blood in the Garden, or utter'd that heart rending cry upon the Cross; and he had melted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as a moth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because he is alone sufficient to reconcile the world to God by his Blood, without accessions from any other. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Blood reacht back as far as <hi>Adam,</hi> and reaches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the end of the world: and will be as fresh, vigorous, and efficatious then, as the first moment it was shed.

No other is revealed in Scripture. No other sufficient for it. No other needed beside him.</p>
               <p>The last thing to be explained is, in what a capacity he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his mediatory work?</p>

            <p>HAving in the former Discourses shewn you the solemn preparations both on the Fathers part, and on the Sons part, for the blessed design of reconciling us by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious mediation of Christ: and given you a general prospect of that his mediation in the former Sermon, method now requires, that I proceed to shew how he executes this his mediation, in the discharge of his blessed offices of <hi>Prophet, Priest</hi> and <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>His <hi>Prophetical office</hi> consists of two parts, one <hi>External,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in a true and full Revelation of the will of God to Men; according to that <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.6. <hi>I have manifested thy name to the men thou gavest me.</hi> The other in <hi>illuminating the mind,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Heart to receive and embrace that Doctrine. The

first part is contained in the words before us. <hi>A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which words are an allegation out of <hi>Moses</hi> recorded in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. and here by <hi>Peter</hi> pertinently applyed to Christ; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the incredulous <hi>Iews,</hi> that he is the true, and only Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah; and the great Prophet of the Church; whose Doctrine it was highly dangerous to contemn, though out of the mouths of such (otherwise) contemptible persons as he and <hi>Iohn</hi> were. And it's well observed by <hi>Calvin,</hi> he singles out this Testimony of <hi>Moses</hi> rather than any other; because of the great esteem they had for <hi>Moses,</hi> and his writings beyond any others. Now, in the words themselves are two general parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, Christ according to his Prophetical office, described.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Obedience to him, as such a Prophet strictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, You have here a description of Christ in his Prophetical <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Office. <hi>A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me.</hi> Where Christ is described.</p>
            <p>First, By his Title Prophet and that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Princeps Prophetarum.</hi> The Prince of the Prophets, or the great and chief Shepherd; as he is stiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. It belongs to a Prophet to expound the Law, declare the will of God, and foretel things to come. All these meet, and that in a singular and eminent manner in Christ, our Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.21, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is described by his Type. A Prophet like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> who therein Typified and prefigured him. But is it not said of <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10.<note place="margin">

How ever, in these following particulars Christ was like him. He was a Prophet that went between God, and the people. Carried Gods mind to them, and returned theirs to God: they not being able to bear the voice of God immediately.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> own house, Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6. Again, <hi>Moses</hi> confirmed his Doctrine by miracles, which he wrought in the presence, and to the conviction of gain-sayers. Herein Christ our Prophet is also like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> who wrought many, mighty, and uncontrolled miracles, which could not be denyed; and by them confirmed the Gospel which he Preached. Lastly, <hi>Moses</hi> was that Prophet which brought Gods Israel out of literal Egypt, and Christ his out of spiritual Egypt; whereof that bondage was a figure. Thus he is described by his likeness to <hi>Moses,</hi> his Type.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is described by his Stock and Original, from which according to the flesh, he sprang. <hi>I will raise him up from among thy brethren. Of Israel, as concerning the flesh, Christ came,</hi> Rom. 9.5. And <hi>it's evident that our Lord sprang out of Iudah,</hi> Heb. 7.14. He honoured that Nation by his Nativity. Thus the great Prophet is described.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Here is a strict injunction of obedience to this Prophet. <hi>Him shall ye hear in all things,</hi> &amp;c. By hearing, understand obedience. So words of sence are frequently put in Scripture, to signifie those affections that are moved by, and use to follow those sences. And this obedience is required to be yielded to this Prophet <hi>only universally,</hi> and under great penalties.<note place="margin">

It's true, we are commanded to obey the voice of his Ministers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. But still it's Christ speaking by them, to whom we pay our obedience. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me.</hi> We obey them in the Lord (<hi>i. e.</hi>) commanding or forbidding in Christs name, and authority. So when God said, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. [<hi>thou shalt serve Him</hi>] Christ expounds it exclusively,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54346:71"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Him only shalt thou serve.</hi> He is <hi>the only Lord,</hi> Jude 4. And therefore to him only our obedience is required. And as it's due to him only, so to him universally. <hi>Him shall ye hear in all things.</hi> His commands are to be obeyed, not disputed. A Judgement of <hi>discretion</hi> indeed is allowed to Christians, to Judge whether it be the will of Christ or no. We must <hi>prove what is that holy, good and acceptable will,</hi> Rom. 12.2. <hi>His Sheep hear his voice, and a stranger they will not follow: They know his voice, but know not the voice of strangers,</hi> Joh. 10.4, 5. But when his will is understood and known, we have no liberty of Choice, but are concluded by it, be the Duty commanded never so difficult, or the sin forbidden never so tempting. And this is also required severely, under penalty of being destroyed from among the people. And of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it at our hands, as it is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of revenging himself in the destruction of the disobedient. Hence the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is.</p>

                  </note>First, The natural ignorance and blindness of men, in the things of God. This shewes us that <hi>vain man is born as the wild Asses Colt.</hi>— The world is involved in darkness. The people sit as in the Region and shadow of Death, till Christ arise upon their Souls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. 'Tis true, in the state of innocence, man had a clear apprehension of the will of God without a Mediator; but now that light is quencht in the corruption of nature, and <hi>the natural man receiveth not the things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. These things of God, are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to corrupt carnal reason, but they are also above right reason. Grace indeed useth nature, but nature can do nothing without grace. The mind of a natural man hath not only a native blindness, by reason whereof it cannot discern the things of the Spirit, but also a natural enmity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And hates the light, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19, 20. So that untill the mind be healed, and enlightened by Jesus Christ, the natural faculty can no more discern the things of the spirit, than the sensitive faculty can discern the things of reason. The mysteries of nature may be discovered by the light of nature, but when it comes to the Supernatural mysteries; there <hi>omnis platonicorum caligavit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitas,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> some where speaks, the most subtile, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, penetrating wit and reason, is stalled, and at a loss.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It implys the divinity of Christ. And proves him to be true God; for as much as no other can reveal to the world in all ages the secrets that lay hid in the heart of God, and that with such convincing evidence and authority. He brought his Doctrine from the bosom of his Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The only
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54346:72"/>
begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, him hath he revealed.</hi> The same words which his Father gave him, he hath given us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.8. He spake to us, that which he had seen with his Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.38. What man can tell the bosom counsels and secrets of God? Who but he that eternally lay in that bosom can expound them?</p>
               <p>Besides, Other Prophets had their times assigned them to rise, shine, and set again by Death, <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch.</hi> 1.5, Your Fathers where are they? And do the Prophets live for ever? But Christ is a fixed and perpetual. Sun that gives light in all ages of the world. For he is <hi>the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13.8. Yea and the very beams of his divinity shone with awefulness upon the hearts of them that heard him. So that his very enemies were forced to acknowledge that <hi>never any man spake like him,</hi> Joh. 7.46.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It implys Christ to be the Original and fountain of all that light which is ministerially diffused up and down the world by men. Ministers are but Stars, which shine with a borrowed light from the Sun. So speaks the Apostle, 2 Cor. 4.6, 7. <hi>For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> Those that teach men, must be first taught by Christ. All the Prophets of the Old, and all the Apostles, Pastors, and Teachers of the New Testament, have lighted their Candles at his Torch. 'Twas Christ that <hi>gave them a mouth, and wisdom, Luk.</hi> 21.15. What <hi>Paul</hi> received from the Lord, he delivered to the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Jesus Christ is the chief Shepherd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. And all the under Shepherds receive their gifts and commissions from him. These things are manifestly implyed in Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office.</p>
               <p>We shall next enquire how he executes and discharges this his Office. Or how he enlightens and teacheth men the will of God?</p>
               <p>And this he hath done variously, gradually, plainly, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, sweetly, purely, and fully.</p>
               <p>First, Our great Prophet hath revealed to men the will of God variously. Not holding one even and constant tenour in the manifestations of the Fathers will, but as the Apostle speaks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> at sundry times and in divers manners,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54346:73"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. Sometimes he taught the Church <hi>immediately,</hi> and in his own person, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.20. He declared Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the great congregation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.22. And sometimes <hi>immediately,</hi> by his Ministers and Officers, deputed to that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by him. So he dispensed the knowledge of God to the Church both before his incarnation. It was Christ that in the time, and by the Ministry of <hi>Noah</hi> went and Preached to the Spirits in prison; as it is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. That is to men and women then alive, but now separated from the body, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in Hell for their disobedience. And it was Christ that was with the Church in the wilderness, instructing and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by the Ministry of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Acts</hi> 7.37, 38. And so he hath taught the Church since his ascension. He cannot now be personally with us, having other business to do for us in Heaven; but however, he will not be wanting to teach us by his Officers, whom for that end he hath set and appointed in the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath dispensed his blessed light to the Church gradually. The discoveries of light have been <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, in many parts or parcels, sometimes more obscure and cloudy, as it was to the Old Testament-believers, by Visions, Dreams, Urim, Thumim, vocal Oracles, Types, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which though comparatively it were but a weak glimering light, and had no glory set by that which now shines, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 18. Yet it was sufficient for the instruction, and Salvation of the Elect in those times. But now is light sprung up glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in the Gospel dispensation. <hi>And we all with open face, behold as in a glass, the glory of the Lord.</hi> It is to us not a twy-light, but the light of a perfect day. And still it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in the several ages of the world. I know more (said <hi>Luther</hi>) than blessed <hi>Austin</hi> knew; and they that come after me, will know more than I know.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Jesus Christ our great Prophet hath manifested to us the will of God plainly, and perspicuously. When he was on earth himself, he taught the People by Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and <hi>without a Parable he spake nothing,</hi> Matth. 13. 3, 4. He cloathed Sublime and Spiritual mysteries in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Metaphors, stooping them thereby to the low and dull capacities of men. Speaking so familiarly to the People about them, as if he had been speaking earthly things
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54346:73"/>
to them,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.12. And so (according to his own example) would he have his Ministers Preach, <hi>using great plainness of speech,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.12. And <hi>by manifestation of the truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending themselves to every mans conscience,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2. Yet not allowing them to be rude and careless in expression, pouring out indigested, crude, immethodical words. No, an holy, serious, strict, and grave expression befits the lips of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours. And who ever spake more weightily, more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically, or perswasively than that Apostle, by whose Pen Christ hath admonished us to beware of vain affectation, and swelling words of vanity? But he would have us stoop to the understandings of the meanest. And not give the People a Comment darker than the Text. He would have us rather pierce their consciences, than tickle their phancies. And break their heart, than please their ears. Christ was a very plain Preacher.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Jesus Christ discovered truth powerfully. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>as one having authority and not as the Pharisees,</hi> Matth. 7.29. They were cold and dull Preachers. Their words did even freeze betwixt their lips. But Christ spake with power. There was heat, as well as light in his Doctrine. And so there is still, though it be in the mouth of poor contemptible men, 2 Cor. 10.4.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>ynts and marrow,</hi> Heb. 4.12. The blessed Apostle imitated Christ. And being filled with his Spirit, spake home, and freely to the hearts of men. So many words, so many claps of Thunder: (as one said of him) which made the hearts of sinners shake, and tremble in their breasts. All faithful and able Ministers are not alike gifted in this particular; but surely there is an holy seriousness, a Spiritual grace, and Majesty in their Doctrine, commanding reverence from the hearers.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This Prophet Jesus Christ taught the people the mind of God in a sweet, affectionate, and taking manner. His words made their hearts burn within them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32. It
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54346:74"/>
was Prophesied of him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.2. <hi>He shall not cry, nor life up, nor cause his voice to be heard on high. A bruised reed he shall not break, and smoaking flax be shall not quench.</hi> He knew <hi>how to speak a word in season to the weary Soul,</hi> Esa. 61.1. <hi>He gathered the Lambs with his arms. And gently led those with young,</hi> Esa. 4.11. How sweetly did his words slide to the melting hearts about him! He drew with cords of Love, with the bands of a man. He discouraged none. Upbraided none that were willing to come to him. His familiarity and free condescensions to the most vile and and despiseable sinners, was often made the matter of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Such is his gentle and sweet carriage to his people, that the Church is called <hi>the Lambs Wife,</hi> Rev. 19.7.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He revealed the mind of God purely to men. His Doctrine had not the least dash of errour to debase it. His most enviously observant hearers could find nothing to charge him. He is <hi>the faithful and true witness,</hi> Rev. 1.5. And he hath commanded his Ministers to conserve the simplicity and purity of the Gospel, and not to blend and sophisticate it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and lastly, He revealed the will of God perfectly and fully, keeping back nothing needful to Salvation. So he tells the Disciples, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15.15. <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> He was <hi>faithful as a Son, over his own house,</hi> Heb. 3.6. Thus you have a brief account of what is implyed in this part of Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical office, and how he performed it.</p>

And it's well they are so firmly set and fixed there, for how many adversaries in all ages have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to shake the very office it self: Pretending that it's needless to be taught by men, and wresting such Scriptures as these to countenance their errour, <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall Prophesie,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>They shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the least of them, to the greatest of them.</hi> As to that of <hi>Ioel</hi> it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that if an Old Testament Prophesie, may be understood according to a New Testament interpretation, then that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie doth no way oppose, but confirm the Gospel Ministry. How the Apostle understood the Prophet in that his Prophesie may be seen in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16. When the Spirit was poured out on the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> upon the Apostles. And surely he must be a confident person indeed, that thinks not an <hi>Apostle</hi> to be as good an Expositer of the <hi>Prophet</hi> as himself. And for that in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. we say,

That there is a God. And who is this true God. <hi>They shall no more teach every man his brother saying know the Lord, for they shall all know me.</hi> To conclude, God hath given Ministers to the Church for conversion, and edification work; <hi>till we all come into the unity of the Faith, to a perfect man,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11, 12. So that when all the Elect are converted, and all those Converts become perfect men; when there is no errour in Judgement, or practice; and no seducer to cause it, then,

They take Christ for their pattern in the whole course of their Ministration, and are such as sincerely endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the great Shepherd, in these six particulars following.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, Jesus Christ was a <hi>faithful Minister,</hi> the <hi>faithful, and true witness,</hi> Rev. 1.5. He declared the whole mind of God to men. Of him it was Prophetically said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.10. <hi>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thy faithfulness, and thy Salvation, I have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> To the same sence, and almost in the same words, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> professed in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. <hi>I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 35. <hi>I have shewed you all things.</hi> Not that every faithful Minister doth in the course of his Ministry, anatomize the whole body of truth, and fully expound and apply each particular to the People, no, that is not the meaning, but of those Doctrines which they have opportunity of opening, they do not out of fear, or to accommodate and secure base low ends, withhold the mind of God, or so corrupt and abuse his words, as to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54346:76"/>
subject truth to their own or other mens Lusts. <hi>They Preach not as pleasing men, but God,</hi> 1 Thes. 2.4. For if <hi>we yet please men, we cannot be the servants of Christ,</hi> Gal. 1.10. Truth must be spoken, though the greatest on earth be offended.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Jesus Christ was <hi>a tender hearted Minister.</hi> Full of compassion to souls. He was sent to <hi>bind up the broken in heart,</hi> Isa. 61.1. He was full of bowels to poor sinners. <hi>He grieved at the hardness of mens hearts,</hi> Mark 3.5. He mourned over <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> and said, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how oft would I have gathered thy Children as a Hen gathers her brood under her wings</hi>! Matth. 23.37. His bowels yearned, when he saw the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as Sheep having no Shepherd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.36. These bowels of Christ must be in all the under Shepherds.<note place="margin">In, pro in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star.</note> 
                        <hi>God is my witness (saith one of them) how greatly I long after you all in</hi> (or after the pattern of) <hi>the bowels of Christ Iesus,</hi> Phil. 1.8. He that shews a hard heart, unaffected with the dangers and miseries of souls, can never shew a commission from Christ to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize him, for ministerial work.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, Jesus Christ was <hi>a laborious painful Minister,</hi> he put a necessity on himself to finish his work in his day. A work infinitely great, in a very little time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4. <hi>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> O how much work did Christ do, in a little time on earth! <hi>He went about doing good,</hi> Acts 10.38. He was never idle. When he sits down at <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, to rest himself being weary, presently he falls into his work, Preaching the Gospel to the <hi>Samaritaness.</hi> In this must his Ministers resemble him. <hi>Striving according to his working, that worketh in them mightily,</hi> Col. 1.28, 29. An idle Minister seems to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> as who should say, a dark light.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, <hi>Iesus Christ delighted in nothing more than the success of his Ministry.</hi> To see the work of the Lord prosper in his hand, this was meat and drink to him. When the seventy returned, and reported the success of their first Embassie; <hi>Lord, even the Devils are subject to us through thy name.</hi> Why, saith Christ; <hi>I behold Satan fall as lightning from heaven.</hi> As if he had said, you tell me no news, I saw it when I sent you out at first. I know the Gospel would make work where it came. <hi>And in that hour Iesus rejoyced in Spirit,</hi> Luk. 10.17, 18, 21. And is it not so with those sent by him? Do'nt they value the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54346:77"/>
success of their Ministry at an high rate? it is not (saith one) the expence, but the recoyling of our labours back again upon us, that kills us. Ministers would not die so fast, nor be gray-headed so soon, could they but see the travel of their Souls. <hi>My littlle Children</hi> (saith Paul) <hi>of whom I travel again in birth <gap reason="foreign">

                     <item>Fifthly, <hi>Iesus Christ was a Minister that lived up to his Doctrine.</hi> His Life and Doctrine harmonized in all things. He pressed to holiness in his Doctrine, and was the great Pattern of holiness in his Life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Learn of me, I am meek and lowly.</hi> And such his Ministers desire to approve themselves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. <hi>What ye have heard, and seen in me, that do.</hi> He Preacht to their eyes, as well as ears. His Life was a Comment on his Doctrine. They might see holiness acted in his Life, as well as sounded by his lips. He Preacht the Doctrine, and lived the Application.</item>
                     <item>Sixthly, Lastly; <hi>Iesus Christ was a Minister that minded and maintained sweet, secret communion with God, for all his constant publick labours.</hi> If he had been Preaching and healing all the day, yet he would redeem time from his very sleep to spend in secret Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.23. <hi>When he had sent the multitude away, he went up into a Mountain apart to pray; and was there alone.</hi> O blessed pattern! Let the keepers of the Vineyards, remember they have a Vineyard of their own to keep. A Soul of their own that must be lookt after; as well as other mens. Those that in these things imitate Christ, are surely sent to us from him, and are worthy of double honour. They are a choice blessing to the people.</item>

            <p>KNowledge of Spiritual things is well distinguished into intelectual, and practical. The first hath its seat in the mind, the latter in the heart. This later Divines call a knowledge peculiar to Saints, and in the Apostles Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And indeed there is but little excellency in all those pretty notions which furnish the Lips with discourse, unless by a sweet and powerful influence, they draw the conscience and will to the obedience of Christ. Light in the mind is necessarily ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the sweet and heavenly motions and mountings of the affections. For the farther any man stands from the light of truth, the farther he must needs be from the heat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Heavenly quicknings are begotten in the heart, while the Sun of righteousness spreads the beams of truth into the understanding; and the Soul sits under those its wings. Yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54346:78"/>
all the light of the Gospel spreading and diffusing it self into the mind, can never savingly open and change the heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an other Act of Christ upon it; and what that is, the Text informs you. <hi>Then opened be their understandings, that they might understand the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words we have both an Act of Christ upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples understandings, and the immediate end, and scope of that Act.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, Christs Act upon their understandings. He <hi>opened their understandings.</hi> By understanding is not here meant the mind only, in opposition to the heart, will, and affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but these were opened by and with the mind. The mind is to the heart as the door to the house. What comes into the heart, comes in at the understanding, which is introductive to it, and although truths sometimes goes no farther then the Entry, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver penetrates the hearts, yet here this effect is undoubtedly included.</p>
            <p>Expositers make this expression paralel to that in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Lord opened the heart of</hi> Lydia. And it is well observed that it is one thing to open the Scriptures, that is to expound them, and give the meaning of them; as <hi>Paul</hi> is said to do in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.3. And another thing to open the mind, or heart as it is here.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ipse est qui ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit cor nostrum in lege suâ.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel specil. p. 57.</note> There are as a learned man truly observes two doors of the Soul bard against Christ. The understanding by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the heart by hardness; both these are opened by Christ. The former is opened by the Preaching of the Gospel, the other by the internal operation of the Spirit. The former belongs to the first part of Christs Prophetical office, opened in the former; the later to that special internal part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical office, to be opened in this Sermon.</p>
            <p>And that it was not a naked Act upon their minds only, but that their hearts and minds did work in fellowship, being both touched by this Act of Christ, is evident enough by the effects mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 52.53. <hi>They returned to Ierusalem with great Ioy, and were continually in the Temple praising and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God.</hi> It is confessed that before this time Christ had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts by conversion, and this opening is not to be understood simply, but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> in reference to those particular truths in which till now they were not sufficiently informed and so their hearts could not be duly affected with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54346:78"/>
them. They were very dark in their apprehensions of the death, and resurrection of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently their hearts were sad and dejected about that which had befallen him <hi>vers.</hi> 17. but when he opened the Scriptures, and their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings and heart together, then things appeared with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face, and they return blessing and praising God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is farther to be considered, the design and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> end of this Act upon their understandings.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Neque enim spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Deus suis confert, qui verbi sui usum aboleat; sed potius qui fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualum reddat, quare perperam Fanatici homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes revelatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num praetexta spernendae scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae sibi licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam concedunt.</hi> Calv. in Loc.</note>

But to make their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and duties the more fruitful, beneficial, and effectual to their Souls. Or that they might this way receive the end and blessing of all their duties. God never intended to abolish his word, by giving his Spirit. And they are true Fanaticks (as <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place calls them) that think, or pretend so. By this means he would at once impart more light, and make that they had before more operative and useful to them; especially in such a time of need as this was.

By opening the Gospel, he reveals truth to us, and by opening the heart in us. Now though this cannot be without that, yet it's much more excellent to have truth revealed in us, than to us.

               <p>For Explication of this part of Christs Prophetical office, I shall as in the former, shew what is included in the opening of the understanding. And by what acts Christ performs it.</p>
               <p>Now, to give you a brief account of what is included in this Act of Christ, take it in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>First, It implys the transcendent nature of Spiritual things, far exceeding the highest flight and reach of natural reason. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ must by his Spirit open the understandings of men, or they can never comprehend such mysteries. Some men have strong natural parts, and by improvement of them, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Eagle-eyed in the mysteries of nature. Who more acute than the Heathen sages! yet to them the Gospel seemed foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Austin</hi> confesses that before his conversion, he often felt his Spirit swell with offence, and contempt of the Gospel; and he despising it, said <hi>dedignabar esse parvulus.</hi> He scorned to become a child again. <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> that profound Doctor, learned <hi>usque ad stuporem,</hi> even to a wonder; profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that when he read <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles he contemned them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in them he found not a metaphysical wit. Surely it's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible a man may with <hi>Berengarius,</hi> be able to dispute <hi>de omni scibili.</hi> Of every point of knowledge. To unravel nature, from the Cedar in Lebanon, to the Hysop on the wall; and yet be as blind as a Bat, in the knowledge of Christ. <note n="*" place="margin">The most refined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous sort of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men have nothing in them, which is more Excellent than common grace; and common grace leaves them in the State of nature, under the power of sin, and in the very suburbs of Hell; wholly at the command of Satan; and if any man think otherwise, let him take heed, that very thought doth not nail him fast, to that unregenerate and cursed estate for ever more. <hi>Dr. Cheynelles Divinet Trin. p.</hi> 410. &amp;c.</note> Yea it's
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54346:79"/>
possible a mans understanding may be improved by the Gospel to a great ability in the literal knowledge of it; so as to able to expound the Scriptures orthodoxly, and enlighten others by them; as it is <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.22. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> were well acquainted with the Scriptures of the old Testament; yea, such were their abilities, and esteem among the people for them, that the Apostle stiles them the <hi>Princes of this world.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. And yet notwithstanding Christ truly calls them, <hi>blind guides, Matt.</hi> 23. Till Christ open the heart, we can know nothing of him, or of his will, as we ought to know it. So experimentally true is that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual, Iudgeth all things; yet he himself is Iudged of no man.</hi> The spiritual man can Judge and discern the carnal man, but the carnal man wants a faculty, to Judge of the spiritual man. As a man that carries a dark Lanthorn, can see another by its light; but the other cannot discern him. Such is the difference betwixt persons whose hearts Christ hath, or hath not opened.</p>

                  </note> Christ opening the understanding implys the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of all external means, how excellent so ever they are in themselves; to operate savingly upon men till Christ by his power open the soul, and so makes them effectual. What excellent Preachers were <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to the Jews? the former spake of Christ more like an Evangelist of the new, than a Prophet of the old Testament. The later was a most convictive and pathetical Preacher; yet the one complains <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed!</hi> the other laments the successlesness of his Ministry, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.28. <hi>The bellows are burnt, the lead is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain.</hi> Under the new Testament what people ever enjoyed such choice helps &amp; means, as those that lived under the Ministry of Christ, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? yet how many remained still in darkness? <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.27. <hi>We have piped to you, but ye have not danced; we have mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, but ye have not lamented.</hi> Neither the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ayrs of mercy, nor the doleful ditties of Judgment could affect, or move their hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54346:80"/>And indeed if you search into the reason of it, you will be satisfied; that the choicest means can do nothing upon the heart, till Christ by his spirit open it, because ordinances work not as natural causes do: for then the effect would always follow, unless miraculously hindred, and it would be equally wonderful that all that hear should not be converted, as that the three Children should be in the fiery Furnace so long, and yet not be burned; no, it works not as a natural, but as amoral cause; whose efficacy depends on the gracious and arbitrary concurrence of the spirit. <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth,</hi> Joh. 3.8. The ordinances are like the pool of <hi>Bethesda Iohn</hi> 5.4. At a certain time an Angel came down and troubled the waters, and then they had a healing vertue in them. So the spirit comes down at certain times, in the word; and opens the heart, and then it becomes the power of God to Salvation. So that when you see souls daily sitting under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and choice means, and remain dead still; you may say as <hi>Martha</hi> did to Christ of her Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Lord, if thou hadst been here, they had not remained dead. If thou hadst been in this Sermon, it had not been so in effectual to them.</p>

                  </note>Thirdly, it implys the utter impotency of man to open his own heart, and thereby make the word effectual to his own conversion, and Salvation. He that at first said let there be light, and it was so, must shine into our hearts, or they will never be savingly enlightned. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. A double misery lies upon a great part of mankind <hi>viz. impotency</hi> and <hi>pride.</hi> They have not only lost the true liberty and freedom of their wills, but with it have so far lost their understanding and humility, as not to own it. But alas man is become a most impotent Creature by the fall. So far from being able to open his own heart, that he cannot know the things of the spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Cannot believe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. Cannot obey, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Cannot speak one good word, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.34. Cannot thing one good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Cannot do one good act, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.5. O what a helpless shiftless thing is a poor sinner! suitably to this state of impotence, conversion is in Scripture cal'd regeneration <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. A resurrection from the dead <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. A creation <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. A victory 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. Which doth not only imply man to be purely passive, in his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54346:80"/>
conversion to God, but a renitency, and opposition made to that power which goes forth from God to recover him.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Christ opening the understanding imports his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power,<note n="4" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cathedram in coelis habet, qui corda Docet.</hi>
                  </note> whereby he is able to subdue all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Who but God knows the heart? who but a God can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock and open it at pleasure? no meer Creature, no not the Angels themselves; who for their large understanding are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencies: can command or open the heart. We may stand and knock at mens hearts, till our own ake; but no opening till Christ come. He can fit a key to all the cross wards of the will, and with sweet efficacy open it; and that without any force or violence to it. These things are carried in this part of his office. Consisting in opening the heart. Which was the first thing propounded for explication.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place let us see by what acts Jesus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ performs this work of his, and what way and method he takes to open the heart of Sinners.</p>
               <p>And there are two principal ways by which Christ opens the understandings and hearts of men. <hi>viz.</hi> By
<list>
                     <item>His word</item>
                     <item>And spirit.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First by his word to this end was <hi>Paul</hi> commissionated and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sent to preach the Gospel, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>To open their eyes, and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi> The Lord can if he pleases, accomplish this immediately; but though he can do it, he will not do it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily without means: because he will honour his own insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Therefore you shall observe, that when <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart was to be opened, <hi>there appeared unto Paul a man of Macedonia, who prayed him, saying, come over into Macedonia and help us. Act.</hi> 19.9. God will keep up the reputation of his ordinances among men. And though he hath not tyed himself, yet he hath tyed us to them. <hi>Cornelius</hi> must send for <hi>Peter</hi>; God can make the earth produce corn, as it did at first, without culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and labour; but he that shall now expect it in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of means, may perish for want of bread.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But the ordinances in themselves cannot do it, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I noted before; and therefore Jesus Christ hath sent forth the Spirit, who is his <hi>Pro—Rex,</hi> his vicegerent to carry on this work upon the hearts of his Elect. And when the Spirit comes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54346:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
down upon Souls, in the administration of the ordinances; he effectually opens the heart to receive the Lord Jesus, by the hearing of faith. He breaks in upon the understanding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by powerful convictions, and compunctions; so much that word.<note place="margin">

And yet the door of the heart is not opened, till he have also put forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the will; and by a sweet and secret efficacy overcome all it's reluctations, and the Soul be made willing in the day of his power. When this is done, the heart is opened. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving light now shines in it; and this light set up by the Spirit in the Soul is
<list>
                     <item>First, a <hi>new light,</hi> in which all things appear far otherwise than they did before. The name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi>; the word <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> have an other sound in that mans ears, than formerly they had. When he comes to read the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which possibly he had read an hundred times before, he wonders he should be so blind, as he was, to over look such great, weighty, and concerning things as he now beholds in them: and saith, where were mine eyes, that I could never see these things before?</item>
                     <item>Secondly, It is a very <hi>affecting light.</hi> A light that hath heat and powerful influences in it, which makes deep impressions on the heart. Hence they whose eyes the great Prophet opens, are said to be <hi>brought out of darkness, into his marvelous light.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. The Soul is greatly affected with what it sees. The beams of light are contracted and twisted together in the mind, and being reflected on the heart and affections; soon cause them to smoak, and burn. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us, whilst he talked with us, and opened to us the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Thirdly, And it is a <hi>growing light.</hi> Like the light of the morning which <hi>shines more and more, unto a perfect Day. Prov.</hi> 4.18. When the Spirit first opens the understanding, he doth not give it at once a full sight of all truths, or a full sence of the power, sweetness, and goodness of any truth; but the Soul in the use of means grows up to a greater clearness, day by day. It's knowledge grows <hi>extensively</hi> in measure, and <hi>intensively</hi> in power and efficacy. And thus the Lord Jesus by his Spirit opens the understanding. Now the use of this follows in 5. pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical deductions.</item>

See how dolefully their case is represented, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; whose eyes the God of this world hath blinded; lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</hi> He means a total and final concealment of the saving power of the word from them. Why, what if Jesus Christ withhold it, and will not be a Prophet to them; what is their condition? truly no better than lost men. It is hid <gap reason="foreign">

This blindness like the covering of the face, or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the handkerchief over the eyes; is in order to their turning off into Hell. More particularly, because the point is of deep concernment let us consider,
<list>
                        <item>First, the <hi>Iudgement inflicted,</hi> and that's spiritual blindness. A sore misery indeed. Not anuniversal ignorance of all truths; O, no, in natural, and moral truths they are often times acute, and sharpe sighted men; but in that part of knowledge which wrape up eternal life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.2. there they are utterly blinded. As it's said of the <hi>Iews</hi> upon whom this misery lies, that <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in part is happened to</hi> Israel. They are learned and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons in other matters, but they know not Jesus Christ, there is the grand and sad defect.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, <hi>the subject</hi> of this Judgement, the mind; which is the eye of the soul. If it were but upon the body, it would not be so considerable, this falls immediately upon the soul the noblest part of man, and upon the mind, the highest and noblest faculty of the soul; whereby we understand, think and reason. This in Scripture is called <gap reason="foreign">

thing in the world, always working; and its leading directive power blind; Judge what a sad and dangerous state such a soul is in. Just like a fiery high metled Horse, whose eyes are out, furiously carrying his rider among rocks, pits, and dangerous precipices. I remember <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaking of the loss of a soul saith, that a loss of a member of the body, is nothing to it; for saith he, if a man lose an eye, Ear, Hand, or Foot, there is another to supply its want. <hi>Omnia Deus dedit duplicia.</hi> God hath given us those members double <hi>animam verò unam,</hi> but he hath not given us two souls; that if one be lost, yet the other may be saved.

                        <item>Thirdly, Consider <hi>the indiscernableness of this Iudgement,</hi> to the soul on whom it lies. They know it not; no more than a man knows that he is asleep. Indeed, it's <hi>the spirit of a deep sleep, poured out upon them from the Lord.</hi> Isa. 29.10. Like that which befel <hi>Adam</hi> when God opened his side; and took out a Rib. This renders their misery the more remediless. <hi>Because ye say you see, therefore your sin remaineth,</hi> Joh. 9.41. Once more,</item>
                        <item>Fourthly, Consider <hi>the tendency and effects of it.</hi> What doth this tend to, but eternal ruine? For hereby we are cut off from the only remedy. The soul that's so blinded, can neither see sin, nor a Saviour; but like the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> during the palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sits still; and moves not after its own recovery. And as ruine is that to which it tends, so in order thereto, it renders all the ordinances and duties under which that soul comes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether useless, and ineffectual to its salvation. He comes to the word, and sees others melted by it, but to him it signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. O what a heavy stroke of God is this! most wretched is their case, to whom Jesus Christ will not apply this eye salve; that they may see. Did you but understand the misery of such a state, if Christ should say to you as he did to the blind man, Matth. 20.33. <hi>What wilt thou that I shall do for thee?</hi> you would return, as he did; <hi>Lord that my eyes may be opened.</hi>

O that I might perswade you to set your selves in his way, under the ordinances, and cry to him, <hi>Lord, that my eyes may be opened.</hi> Three things are marvelously incouraging to you so to do.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, <hi>God the Father hath put him into this Office, for the cure of such as you be.</hi> Isa. 49.6. <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maist be my salvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> This may furnish you with an argument to plead for a cure. Why do you not go to God, and say, Lord, didst thou give Jesus Christ a Commission to open the blind eyes? Behold me Lord, such a one am I, a poor, dark, ignorant soul. Didst thou give him to be thy salvation to the ends of the earth? No place, nor people excluded from the benefit of this light; and shall I still remain in the shadow of death? O that unto me he might
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54346:83"/>
be a saving light also. The best and most excellent work that ever thou wroughtest, brings thee no glory, till it come into the light; O let me see and admire it.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, It's incouraging to think, that <hi>Iesus Christ hath actually opened the eyes of them that were as dark and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as you now are.</hi> He hath revealed those things to babes, that have been hid from the wise and prudent. Matth. 11.25. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect making wise the simple.</hi> Psal. 19.7. And if you look among those whom Christ hath enlightned, you will not find <hi>many wise after the flesh, many mighty, or Noble; but the foolish, weak, base, and despised. These are they on whom he hath glorified the riches of his grace.</hi> 1 Cor. 26.27.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, And is it not yet further incouraging to you; that <hi>hitherto he hath mercifully continued you under the means of light?</hi> Why is not the light of the Gospel put out? Why are times and seasons of grace continued to you, if God have no further design of good to your souls? Be not therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged but wait on the Lord in the use of means, that you may yet be healed.</item>

                        <hi>Quest.</hi>
                     </note>If you ask what can we do to put our selves into the way of the spirit, in order to such a cure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Soll.</hi>
                     </note>I say that though you cannot do any thing that can make the Gospel effectual, yet the spirit of God can make those means you are capable of using effectual, if he please to concur with them. And it is a certain truth, that your inability to do what is above your power, doth no way excuse you from doing what is within the compass of your power to do. I know, no act that is saving, can be done without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of special grace, yea, and no act that hath a remote order and tendency thereunto, without a more general concourse of Gods assistance; but herein he is not behind hand with you. Let me therefore advise.</p>
                  <p>First, That you <hi>dilligently attend upon an able, faithful and searching ministry.</hi> Neglect no opportunity God affords you, for how know you but that may be the time of mercy to your souls: If he that lay so many years at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> had been wanting but that hour when the Angel came down and troubled the waters, he had not been healed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:54346:83"/>Secondly, Satisfie not your selves with hearing, but <hi>consider what you hear.</hi> Allow time to reflect upon what God hath spoken to you. What power is there in man more excellent, or more appropriate to the reasonable nature, than its reflexive and self considering power? There is little hope of any good to be done upon your souls, untill you begin to go alone; and become thinking men and women. Here all conversion begins. I know a severer task can hardly be imposed upon a carnal heart. It's a hard thing to bring a man, and himself together, upon this acccount. But this must be, if ever the Lord do your souls good. Psal. 4.4. <hi>Commune with your own hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Labour to see, and ingenuously confess the insufficiency of all your other knowledge to do you good.</hi> What if you had never so much skill and knowledge in other mysteries? What if you be never so well acquainted with the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? What if you had angelical illumination, this can never save thy soul. No, all thy knowledge signifies nothing, till the Lord shew thee by special light, the deplored state of thy own heart; and a saving sight of Jesus Christ thy only remedy.</p>

                  <p>Since then there is a common light, and special saving light which none but Christ can give,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>it's therefore the concernment of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you, to try what your light is. We know</hi> (saith the Apostle) 1 Cor. 8.1. <hi>that we all have knowledge.</hi> O but what, and whence is it? Is it the light of life, springing from Jesus Christ; that bright and morning star? Or only such as the Devils and damned have? These lights differ.</p>
                  <p>First, in their very <hi>kinds,</hi> and <hi>natures.</hi> The one is Heavenly, supernatural, and spiritual: the other earthly, and natural; the effect of a better constitution or education, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.15, 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They differ most apparently in their <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>operations.</hi> The light that comes in a special way from Christ, is humbling, abasing, and soul emptying light. By it a man sees the vileness of his own nature, and practice, which begets self loathing in him: but natural light on the contrary, puffs up, and exalts; makes the heart swell with self conceitedness. 1 Cor. 8.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54346:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Light of Christ is <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>operative,</hi> still urging the soul, yea, lovingly constraining it to obedience. No sooner did it shine into <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, but presently he asks, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9.6. <hi>It brought forth fruit,</hi> in the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians, from the first day it came to them,</hi> Col. 1.6. but the other spends it self in impractical notions, and is detained in unrighteousness. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. The light of Christ is powerfully <hi>transformative</hi> of its subjects changing the man in whom it is, into the same image, from glory to glory. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> but common light leaves the heart as dead, carnal and sensual, as if no light at all were in it.</p>
                  <p>In a word, All saving light <hi>endears</hi> Jesus Christ to the soul, and as it could not value him before it saw him, so when once he appears to the soul in his own light, he is appreciated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared unspeakably: then, none but Christ. All is but dung that he may win Christ. None in Heaven but him, nor on earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable in comparison of him. But no such effect flows from natural common knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They differ in their <hi>Issues.</hi> Natural common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vanisheth, as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. It's but a <hi>May</hi> flower, and dies in its month. <hi>Doth not their excellency that is in them go away?</hi> Job 4.21. But this that springs from Christ, is perfected, not destroyed by death. It springs up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlasting life. The soul in which it is subjected, carrys it away with it into glory. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.2. this light is life eternal. Now turn in, and compare your selves with these rules. Let not false light deceive you.</p>

How many round about you have their eyes closed, and their hearts shut up! How many are in darkness, and there are like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, till they come to the blackness of darkness; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for them?

Rejoyce in your light, but be not proud of it. And beware ye sin not against the best, and highest light in this world. If God were so incensed against the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens for disobeying the light of nature, what is it in you, to sin with eyes clearly illuminated with the purest light that shines in this world? You know God charges it upon <hi>Solomon</hi> in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.9. that he turned from the way of obedience, <hi>after the Lord had appeared unto him twice.</hi> Jesus Christ intended when he opened your eyes, that your eyes should direct your feet.

            <p>SAlvation (as to the actual dispensation of it) is <hi>revealed</hi> by Christ as a <hi>Prophet, procured</hi> by him as a <hi>Priest, applied</hi> by him as a <hi>King</hi>: in vain is it revealed, if not purchased; in vain revealed, and purchased, if not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How it is revealed both to us, and in us, by our great Prophet: hath been declared. And now from the Prophetical Office, we pass on to the Priestly Office of Jesus Christ; who as our <hi>Priest,</hi> purchased our Salvation. In this Office is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the grand relief for a soul distressed by the guilt of sin. When all other reliefs have been essayed, 'tis the blood of this great sacrifice, sprinkled by faith upon the trembling consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that must cool, refresh, and sweetly compose, and settle
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54346:85"/>
it. Now seeing so great a weight hangs upon this Office, the Apostle industriously confirms, and commends it in this Epistle, and more specially in this ninth Chapter. Shewing how it was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured to the world by the Typical blood of the sacrifices, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely excels them all. And as in many other most weighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, so principally in this; that the blood of these Sacrifices did but purifie the Types, or patterns of the Heavenly things; but the blood of this Sacrifice, purified or consecrated the Heavenly things themselves, signified by those Types.</p>

If the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, Mercy-seat, and all things pertaining to the service of the Tabernacle, was to be consecrated by blood; those earthly, but sacred Types, by the blood of Bulls, and Lambs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much more the Heavenly things shadowed by them, ought to be purified or consecrated by better blood, than the blood of beasts. The blood consecrating these, should as much excel the blood that consecrated those; as the Heavenly things themselves, do in their own nature excel those earthly shadows of them. Look what proportion there is betwixt the Type, and Anti-Type; the like proportion also is betwixt the blood that consecrates them. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things with common, Heavenly things with the most excellent blood.</p>
            <p>So then, there are two things to be especially observed here. First, The nature of Christs death and sufferings, it had the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, use, and end of a Sacrifice; and of all Sacrifices the most excellent. Secondly, The necessity of his offering up, it was necessary to correspond with all the Types and prefigurations of it under the Law, but especially it was necessary for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sin, the propitiating of a justly incensed God, and the opening a way for reconciled ones to come to God in. The point I shall give you from it is;</p>

Of this last kind, was the sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ for us. To this Office he was called by God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. in it he was confirmed by the unchangeable oath of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.4. for it he was singularly qualified by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6, 7. and all the ends of it he hath fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12.</p>
               <p>My present design is from this Scripture to open the general nature and absolute necessity of the Priesthood of Christ.

               <p>First then, we will consider what it supposes, and implies. And then, wherein it consists. And there are six things which it either presupposeth or necessary includeth in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">The nature of Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood opened.</note>First, At first sight, <hi>it supposes mans revolt and fall from God</hi>; and a dreadful breach made thereby, betwixt God and him; else no need of an attoning sacrifice. <hi>If one dyed for all, then were all death.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14. dead in Law, under sentence to dye, and that eternally. In all the sacrifices from <hi>Adam</hi> to Christ, this was still preached to the world; that there was a fearful breach betwixt God, and man; and that even so justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired our blood should be shed. And the fire flaming on the Altar which wholy burnt up the sacrifice, was a lively Emblem of that fiery indignation, that should devour the Adversaries. But above all, when Christ that true and great sacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered-up to God, then was the fairest glass that ever was in the world, set before us; to see our sin, and misery by the fall in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>His Priesthood supposes the unalterable purpose of God to take vengeance for sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And beside, the word is gone out of his mouth; that the sinner shall dye.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Priesthood of Christ, presupposeth the utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of man to appease God; and recover his favour by any thing he could do, or suffer.</hi> Surely God would not come down, to assume a body to dye; and be offered up for us; if at any cheaper rate it could have been accomplished. There was no other way to recover man, and satisfie God. Those that deny the satisfaction of Christ, and talk of his dying to confirm the truth; and give us an example of meekness, patience, and self-denyal; affirming these to be the sole ends of his death, do not only therein root up the foundation of their own comfort, peace and pardon; but most boldly impeach, and tax the infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. God could have done all this at a cheaper rate. The suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of a meer creature, are able to attain these ends. The death of the Martyrs did it. But who by dying can satisfie, and reconcile God? What creature can bring him an adequate and proportionable value for sin? Yea, for all the sin that ever was or shall be transmitted to the natures, or committed by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all Gods Elect; from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the last that shall be found alive at the Lords coming? Surely, none, but Christ, can do this.</p>

passion, compassion, and derivation of his righteousness, and holiness to men. Had he not been man, he had had no sacrifice to offer, no soul, or body to suffer in. The Godhead is impatible, immortal, and above all those sufferings and miseries Christ felt for us. Besides, his being man fills him with bowels of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and tender sense of our miseries. This makes him a merciful, and faithful High-Priest. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. And not only fits him to pity, but to sanctifie us also; for <hi>he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified,</hi> are <hi>both of one.</hi> Heb. 2.11, 14, 17. And as necessary it was our High-Priest should be God, since the value and efficacy of of his sacrifice, results from thence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Priesthood of Christ implies the extremity of his sufferings.</hi> In sacrifices, you know, there was a destruction, a kind of Annihilation of the Creature, to the glory of God. The sheding of the creatures blood, and burning its flesh with fire, was but an umbrage, or faint resemblance of what Christ endured, when he made his soul an offering for sin.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Lastly, <hi>It implies the gratious design of God, to reconcile us at a dear rate to himself, in that he called, and confirmed Christ in his Priesthood, by an oath; and thereby laid out a sacrifice of infinite value for the world.</hi> Sins for which no sacrifice is allowed are desperate sins. And the case of such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is helpless. But if God allow, yea and provide a sacrifice himself; how plainly doth it speak his intentions of peace and mercy? These things are manifestly presupposed, or implyed in Christs Priesthood.</p>

                  </note>This Priesthood of Christ is that function wherein he comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in our name, and place; to fulfil the Law, and offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to him a sacrifice of reconciliation, for our sins; and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession to continue and apply the purchase of his blood to them for whom he shed it. All this is contained in that famous Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. or more briefly. The Priesthood of Christ is that whereby he expiated the sins of men, and obtained the favour of God for them. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. But because I shall insist more largely upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts and fruits of this office, it shall here suffice to speak thus much as to its general nature; which was the first thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for explication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:54346:87"/>The necessity of Christs Priesthood comes next to be opened.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Touching which, I affirm, according to the Scriptures; It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in order to our salvation, that such a Priest, should, by such a Sacrifice, appear before God for us.</p>
               <p>The truth of this assertion will be cleared by these two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are evident in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That God stood upon full satisfaction, and would not remit one sin without it. And that fallen man is totally uncapable, of tendring him any such satisfaction. Therefore Christ who only can, must do it; or we perish.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>God stood upon full satisfaction, and would not remit one sin without it.</hi> This will be cleared <hi>from the nature of sin.</hi> And <hi>from the veracity and wisdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, From the <hi>nature of sin,</hi> which deserves that the sinner should suffer for it. Penal evil, in a course of Justice, follows moral evil. Sin and sorrow ought to go together. Betwixt these is a necessary connexion. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of sin is death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>veracity of God requires it.</hi> The word was gone out of his mouth. Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye.</hi>

Now though mans threatnings are often vain, and insignificant things; yet Gods shall surely take place. <hi>Not one tittle of the Law shall fail, till all be fulfilled.</hi> Matth. 5.18. God will be true in his threatnings, though thousands, and millions perish.</p>

For as good no King, as no Laws for government. As good no Law, as no penalty. And as good no penalty, as no execution. To this purpose one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
<q>It's altogether undecent, especially to the wisdom and and righteousness of God, that that which provoketh the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, should procure the abrogation of his Law. That that should supplant and undermine the Law, for the alone prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, the Law was before established.</q>

against sin? So then, God stood upon satisfaction, and would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no treaty of peace, on any other ground.</p>

                  </note>Let none here object, that reconciliation upon this only score of satisfaction, is derogatory to the riches of grace: or that we allow not God, what we do men; <hi>viz.</hi> to forgive an injury freely, without satisfaction.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things inconsistent with each other: as in its proper place, shall be fully cleared to you. And for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that to God, which we allow to men; you must know, that man and man stands on even ground. Man is not capable of being wronged, and injured by man, as God is by man. There is no compare betwixt the nature of the offences.</p>
               <p>To conclude, man only can freely forgive man, in a private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; so far as the wrong concerns himself; but ought not to do so, in a publick capacity, as he is a Judge, and bound to execute justice impartially. God is our Law-giver, and Judge. He will not dispense with violations of the Law, but strictly stands on compleat satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Man can tender to God no satisfaction of his own for the wrong done by his sin. He finds no way to compensate, and make God amends; either by doing, or by suffering his will.</p>
               <p>First, Not by doing. This way is shut up to all the world. None can satisfie God, or reconcile himself to him this way. For its evident our best works are sinful. <hi>All our righteousness as filthy rags,</hi> Isa. 64.6. And it's strange any should imagine, that one sin, should make satisfaction for another: if it be said, not what is sinful in our duties, but what is spiritual pure and good, may ingratiate us with God. It is at hand to reply, that what is good in any of our duties, is a debt we owe to God; yea, we owe him perfect obedience; and it is not imaginable, how we should pay one debt, by another. Quit a Farmer, by contracting a new engagement: if we do any thing that is good, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to grace for it. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. In a word, those that have had as much to plead on that score, as any now living, have quitted, and utterly given up all hopes of appeasing and satisfying the justice of God that way. It's like, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iob</hi> feared God, and eschued evil as much as any of you; yet he saith, Job 9.20, 21. <hi>If I justifie my self, mine own mouth shall
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54346:88"/>
condemn me; if I say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul; I would despise my life.</hi> It may be <hi>David</hi> was a man as much after the heart of God, as you; yet he said, Psal. 143.2. <hi>Enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</hi> It's like <hi>Paul</hi> lived as holy, heavenly, and fruitful a life, as the best of you; and far, far beyond you; yet he saith, 1 Cor. 4.4. <hi>I know</hi> (or am conscious to my self) <hi>of nothing, yet am I not thereby justified.</hi> His sincerity might <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> him, could not <hi>justifie</hi> him. And what need I say more, the Lord hath shut up this way to all the world. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures speak it roundly, and pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ly; Rom. 3.20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law; there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.</hi> Compare <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as man can never reconcile himself to God by <hi>doing,</hi> so neither by <hi>suffering.</hi> That is equally impossible. For no sufferings can satisfie God, but such as are proportionable to the offence we suffer for. And if so, an infinite suffering must be born. I say infinite, for so sin is; an infinite evil, objectively considered, as it wrongs an infinite God. Now sufferings may be said to be infinite, either in respect of their <hi>weight,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all bounds and limits. The letting out the wrath and fury of an infinite God. Or in respect of <hi>duration,</hi> being endless and everlasting. In the first sense, no Creature can bear an infinite wrath. It would swallow us up. In the second, it may be born, as the damned do; but then, ever to be suffering, is never to have satisfied.</p>
               <p>So that no man can be his own Priest, to reconcile himself to God, by what he can do, or suffer. And therefore, one that is able by doing, and suffering to reconcile him, must undertake it, or we perish. Thus you see plainly, and briefly; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature and necessity of Christs Priesthood.</p>
               <p>From both these, several useful Corollarys, or practical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions offer themselves.</p>

Woful is the state of that man, that feels the worm of conscience nibling on the most tender part of the soul, and hath no relief against it.

Hear me, you that slight troubles of conscience; that call them fancies, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly whimsies; if you ever had had but one sick night for sin, if you had ever felt that shame, fear, horror, and despair which are the dismal effects of an accusing, and condemning conscience, you would account it an unspeakable mercy to hear of a way for the discharge of a poor sinner, from that guilt. You would kiss the feet of that messenger, that could bring you tydings of peace. You would call him blessed, that should direct you to an effectual remedy. Now, whoever thou art, that pinest away in thine iniquities; that droopest from day to day under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent wounds, and dismal presages of conscience, know that thy soul and peace can never meet, till thou art perswaded to come to this blood of sprinkling.</p>

of beasts, to God? The blood of all the men in the world, can do nothing in this case. What is our polluted blood worth? No no, it's the blood of God, that must satisfie both thee, and me.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Christs blood is not only the blood of God, but it's blood shed in thy stead, and in thy place and room. Gal. 3.13. <hi>He was made a curse for us.</hi> And so it becomes sin pardoning blood. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26.

eat of the head of any living creature. You must also lay the hand of faith upon Christ your sacrifice, not to imprecate, but apply, and appropriate him to your own souls; he having been made a curse for you.</p>
                  <p>To this, the whole Gospel tends; even to perswade sinners to apply Christ, and his blood to their own souls. To this he invited us, Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden; and I will give you rest.</hi> For this end our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was lifted up upon the Altar. Joh. 3.14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moses <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> The Effects of the Law, not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conscience, filling it with torments, but upon the whole person, bringing death upon it; are here shadowed out by the stingings of fiery Serpents; and Christ by the brazen Serpent which <hi>Moses</hi> exalted for the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that were stun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those that looked not to the Brazen Serpent, died infallibly; so must all that look not to Jesus, our sacrifice, by faith. It's true,<note place="margin">It is a rule, that where there is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause in act; there the effect must needs follow. But if they be partial causes, then the causes which suce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For to the actual remission of sin, and peace of conscience; there must be a co-operation of all the causes of remission, and peace. As there is the grace and love of God, for an efficient, and impulsive cause; and the death of Christ our sacrifice, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cause; so of necessity there must be faith, the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cause. And these concauses do all sweetly meet in their influences, and activities; in our remission, and tranquility of conscience: and are all <hi>(suo genere)</hi> in their kind, and place absolutely necessary, to the procuring and applying of it.</p>
                  <p>What the near that the blood of Christ is shed, if I have no interest in it, no saving influences from it? O be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, this is the end, the business of life. Faith is the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> grace, as Christ is the <hi>Phoenix</hi> mercy. He is <hi>the gift,</hi> Joh. 4.10. And this is <hi>the work</hi> of God <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.29. the death of Christ, the offers and tenders of Christ, never saved one soul in themselves, without believing application. But wo is me, how do I see sinners either not at all toucht with the sense of sin,

and so being whole need not the Physitian; or if any be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

If it be so in spiritual wounds, what need Christ to have left the Fathers bosom, and come down to dye in the quality and nature of a Sacrifice for us? O, if men can but have health, pleasure, riches, honours, and any way make a shift to still a brawling conscience, that it may not check, or interrupt them in these enjoyments: Christ may go where he will, for them.</p>
                  <p>And I am assured till God shew you the face of sin, in the glass of the Law. Make the Scorpions and fiery Serpents, that lurk in the Law, and in your own consciences, to come hissing about you, and smiting you with their deadly stings; till you have had some sick nights, and sorrowful days for sin, you will never go up and down seeking an interest in the blood of this sacrifice, with tears.</p>

            <p>AFter this more general view and consideration of the Priesthood of Christ, method requires that we come to a nearer, and more particular consideration of the parts thereof; which are, his <hi>Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi>; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the double office of the High-Priest, offering the blood of the Sacrifices without the holy place, which Typed out Christs oblation: and then once a year, bringing the blood before the Lord, into the most holy place; presenting it before the Lord, and with it sprinkling the mercy-seat, wherein the intercession of Christ, (the other part, or Act of his Priesthood) was in a lively manner Typified to us.</p>
            <p>My present business is, to open and apply the <hi>Oblation</hi> of Christ. The efficacy, and excellency whereof, is excellently illustrated by a comparison with all other oblations, in the precedent context;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54346:92"/>
and with a singular Encomium commended to us in these words,<note place="margin">

It is but one offering, one, not only <hi>specifically,</hi> but one <hi>numerically</hi> considered. But once offered, and never more to be repeated. For <hi>Christ dieth no more,</hi> Rom. 6.9. He also commends it from the <hi>efficacy</hi> of it. By it he hath perfected, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not only purchased a possibility of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but all that we need to our full perfection. It brings in a most intire, compleat, and perfect righteousness. All that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to make us perfectly happy, is but the full application of the benefits procured by this Oblation, for us. Moreover, it's here commended from the <hi>extensiveness</hi> of it. Not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to a few, but applicable to all the Saints, in all the ages, and places of the world. For this indefinite, <hi>them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> is equivalent to a universal; and is as much as if he had said, to all and every Saint, from the beginning, to the end of the world. Lastly, He commends it from its <hi>perpetuity. It perfects for ever.</hi> That is, it is of everlasting efficacy. It shall abide as fresh, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and powerful to the end of the world, as it was the first moment it was offered up. All runs into this sweet truth,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>DOCT. That the Oblation made unto God,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> by Iesus Christ, is of unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able value, and everlasting efficacy; to perfect all them that are, or shall be Sanctified, to the end of the world.</head>
               <p>Out of this fountain flow all the excellent blessings that believers either have, or hope for. Had it not been for this, there had been no such things <hi>in rerum natura</hi> as Justification, Adoption, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> peace with God, and hopes of glory, pardon of sin, and divine acceptation: These and all other our best mercies, had been but so many <hi>entia rationis,</hi> meer conceits. A man (as one saith) might have haply imagined such things as these, as he may golden Mountains, and Rivers of liquid gold, and rocks of Diamonds: but these things could never have had any real existance <hi>extramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> had not Christ offered up himself a Sacrifice to God for us. It is <hi>the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit, offered up himself without spot to God, that purges the Conscience from dead works.</hi> Heb. 9.14. That is, from the sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation

and death, as it is reflected by Conscience, for our works sake.</p>
               <p>His appearing before God as our Priest, with such an offering for us; is that which removes our guilt, and fear together. <hi>He appeared, to put away sin, by the sacrifice of himself.</hi> Heb. 9.26. Now, for as much as the point before us, is of so great weight in it self, and so fundamental to our safety and comfort; I shall endeavour to give you as distinct and clear an accompt of it, as can consist with that brevity, which I must necessarily use. And therefore Reader, apply thy mind attently to the consideration of this excellent <hi>Priest,</hi> that appears before God; and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he offers; with the properties and adjuncts thereof. The <hi>Person</hi> before whom he brings, and to whom he offers it. The <hi>Persons for whom</hi> he offers, and <hi>the end for which</hi> this Oblation is made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Priest</hi> that appears before God with an Oblation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for us, is Jesus Christ, God-man.

But <hi>he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.</hi> Heb. 7.2. He could stand before God, even in the eye of his Justice, as a Lamb without spot. Though he made his soul an offering for sin, yet <hi>he had done no iniquity, nor was any guile found in his mouth.</hi> Isa. 53.9. And indeed his offering had done us no good, if the least taint of sin had been found on him. They were mortal men, that <hi>continued not by reason of death,</hi> Heb. 7.23.

this use and purpose. Heb. 10.10. <hi>He offered his body</hi>; Yea, not only his body, but <hi>his soul was made an offering for sin.</hi> Isa. 53.10. We had made a forfeiture of our souls and bodies by sin, and it was necessary the Sacrifice of Christ should be answerable to the debt we owed. And when Christ came to offer his Sacrifice, he stood not only in the capacity of a Priest, but also in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a surety; and so his soul stood in the stead of ours, and his body in the stead of our bodies. Now the excellency of this Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will appear in the following adjuncts, and properties of it. This Oblation being for the matter of it the soul and body of Jesus Christ; is therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Invaluably pretious.</hi> So the Apostle stiles it, 1 Pet. 1.19. <hi>Ye were redeemed <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> with the pretious blood of the Son of God.</hi> And such it behoved him to offer. For it being offered as an expiatory Sacrifice, it ought to be aequivalent in its own intrinsick value, to all the souls and bodies that were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by it. And so it was, and more also; for there was a redundancy of value, an overplus of merit, which went to make a purchase for the redeemed; as will be opened in its place. So that as one rich-Diamond, is more worth than a thousand Pebbles; one piece of Gold, than a many Counters; so the soul and body of one Christ, is much more excellent, than all the souls and bodies in the world.</p>
               <p>And yet, I dare not affirm as some do, that by reason of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pretiousness of Christs blood; one drop thereof had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have redeemed the whole world:<note place="margin">

Besides we must remember, that the passions of Christ which were inflicted on him as the curse of the Law; these only are the passions which are sufficient for our redemption from the curse of the Law; now, it was not a drop of blood, but death which was contained in the curse. This therefore was necessary to be inflicted. But surely as none but God can estimate the weight and evil of sin, so none but he can comprehend the worth and pretiousness of the blood of Christ, shed to expiate it.

And so indeed it is said. Eph. 5.2. <hi>He gave himself for us, an offering, and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour.</hi> Not that God took any delight or content in the bitter sufferings of Christ, simply and in themselves considered; but with relation to the end for which he was offered, even our redemption and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Hence arose the delight and pleasure God had in it: this made him take pleasure in bruising him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10. God smelt a savour of rest in this Sacrifice. The meaning is, that as men are offended with a stench, and their stomachs rise at it; and are on the contrary delighted with sweet odors and fragrancies, so
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54346:94"/>
the blessed God speaking after the manner of men, is offended and filled with loathing and abhorrence by our sins; but infinitely pleased and delighted in the offering of Christ for them, which came up as an odor of a sweet smelling savour to him, whereof the costly perfumes under the Law, were Types and shadows. This was the Oblation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Oblation he brings before God, and to him he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it up.

                  </note> In which sense others take those Scriptures that speak so universally of the extent of his death.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The design and end of this Oblation was to attone, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and reconcile God; by giving him a full and adequate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54346:95"/>
or satisfaction for the sins of these his Elect. So speaks the Apostle Col. 1.20. <hi>And having made peace, through the blood of his cross; by him to reconcile all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: by him I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in Heaven.</hi> So 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.</hi> Reconciliation is the making up of that breach caused by sin, between us and God; and restoring us again to his favour and friendship. For this end Christ offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God. I say, not for this end only, but more especially, hence it's called: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a propitiation, and so the Seaventy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that place, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the propitiating Ram.</hi> But here I would not be mistaken, as though the reconciliation were made only between us and God the Father, by the blood of the Cross: for we are reconciled by it to the whole Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Every sin being against the divine Majesty, it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the three persons having the same divine Essence, must be all offended by the commission; and so all reconciled by the expiation, and remission of the same. But reconciliation is said to be with the Father, because though the works of the Trinity <hi>ad extra</hi> be undivided, and what one doth all do; and what is done to one, is done to all; yet by this form and manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression (as a learned man well observes) the Scriptures point out the proper offices of each person.<note place="margin">Zanch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </note> The Father receives us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour, the Son mediates and gives the ransom, which procures it, the Spirit applies and seals this to the persons and hearts of believers. However, being reconciled to the Father, we are also reconciled to the Son and Spirit, as they are one God, in three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And if it be objected, that then Christ offered up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or laid down a price to reconcile us to himself: I shall more fairly and directly meet with and satisfie that objection, when I come to speak of Christs satisfaction, which is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal fruits of this his excellent Oblation.

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:54346:96"/>O the unspeakable efficacy of Christs Sacrifice! which extends to all sins! 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>the blood of Christ cleanseth</hi> from all sins, sins past, and present without exception. And some Divines of good note affirm, all sins to come also, for saith Mr. <hi>Paul Baines</hi> original sin, in which all future sins are, as fruits in the root, is pardoned, and if these were not pardoned, they would void and irritate former pardons. And lastly it would derogate from the most plenary satisfaction of Christ. But the most say, and I think truly, that all the past sins of Believers, are pardoned without <hi>revocation.</hi> All their present sins, without <hi>exception,</hi> but not their sins to come by way of <hi>anticipation:</hi> and yet for them there is a pardon of course, which is applied on their repentance, and application of Christs blood; so that none of them shall make void former pardons. O let these things slide sweetly to thy melting heart.</p>

and sweet incense into the holy place. Levit. 16.12, 13, 14. <hi>And he shall take the censer full of burning coals of fire from off the Altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense, beaten small, and bring it within the vail; and he shall put the incense upon the fire, before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the Testimony, that he die not. And he shall take the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat Eastward,</hi> &amp;c. Christs offering himself on earth answered to the killing of the Sacrifice without; and his entring into Heaven, there to intercede, was that which answered to the Priest going with blood, and his hands full of incense within the vail: So that this is a part, yea, a special part of Christs Priesthood, and so necessary to it; that if he had not done this, all his work on earth had signified nothing, nor had he been a Priest; that is, a compleat and perfect Priest, if he had remained on earth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. Because the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and end of sheding his blood on earth had been frustrated, which was to carry it before the Lord into Heaven. So that this is the principal perfective part of the Priesthood. He acted the first part on earth, in a state of deep abasement, in the form of a servant; but he Acts this in glory, whereinto he is taken up, that he may follow on his design in dying, and give the work of our Salvation its last compleating Act. So much is imported in this Scripture which tells us, by reason hereof he is able to save to the uttermost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> What it is for Christ to be an intercessor for us. To inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede in general, is to go betwixt two parties to intreat, argue, and plead with one, for the other. And of this there are two sorts. First, <hi>ex charitate, ut fratres.</hi> That whereby one Christian prays and pleads with God for another. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. Secondly, <hi>Ex officio, mediatorio,</hi> that whereby Christ, as an act of office, presents himself before God, to request for us. Betwixt these two is this difference; that the former is performed not in our own, but anothers name; we can tender no request to God immediately, or for our own sake, either for our selves, or for others. Joh. 16.23. <hi>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</hi> But the latter which is proper to Christ, is an Intercession with God for us, in his own name, and upon the account of his proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

               <p>And thus to make intercercession, is the peculiar and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable prerogative of Jesus Christ. None but he can go in his own name to God.

               <p>And yet though God hath for ever shut up and bar'd this way to all the children of men, telling us that no man shall ever have access to him in his own name, as Christ the Prince had: How do some notwithstanding, strive to force open the Princes gate?

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54346:100"/>
into Heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</hi> The Apostle manifestly alludes to the High-Priests ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Holy of Holies, which was the figure of Heaven, presenting to the Lord the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> which were on his breast, and shoulders. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.9, 12, 28, 29. to which the Church is supposed to allude, in that request Cant. 8.6. <hi>set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm.</hi> Now the very sight of Christ, our High-Priest in Heaven, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails exceedingly with God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ performs his intercession-work in Heaven, not by a naked appearing in the presence of God only, but also <hi>by presenting his blood, and all his sufferings to God, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plea on our account.</hi>

All these were excellently Typed out by the going in of the High-Priest before the Lord, with the names of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> on his breast; with the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and his hands full of incense, as the Apostle explains them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And that this Intercession of Christ is most potent, successful, and prevalant with God, will be evinced both from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> qualifications of this our Advocate, from his great interest in the Father, from the nature of the pleas he useth with God: and from the relation and interest believers have both in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to whom, and the Son by whom this intercession is made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> our Intercessor in the Heavens is every way able and fit for the work, he is ingaged in there. What ever is desirable in an Advocate, is in him eminently. It is necessary that he who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to plead the cause of another, especially if it be weighty and intricate should be wise, faithful, tender-hearted, and one that concerns himself in the success of his business. Our Advocate Christ wants no wisdom, to manage his work. He is the wisdom of God; yea <hi>only wise,</hi> Jude 25. There's much folly in the best of our duties, we know not how to press an argument home with God; but Christ hath the art of it. Our business is in a wise hand. He is no less <hi>faithful,</hi> than wise; therefore he is called a <hi>faithful High-Priest in things pertaining to God.</hi> Heb. 2.17. He assures us we may safely trust our concerns with him. Joh. 14.2.

                  </note> so it is in the Greek: and on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he might be the better able to sympathize with us, he came as near to our conditions, as the holiness of his nature could permit. He suffered himself to be in all points tempted like as we are, sin only excepted.</p>
               <p>And then for his concernment, and interest in the success of his suit; he not only reckons, but hath really made it his own interest. Yea, more his own, than it is ours. For now by reason of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union, all our wants and troubles are his. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.23. Yea, his own glory and compleatness as mediator, is deeply interessed in it. And therefore we need not doubt but he will use all care, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in that work. If you say so he may, and yet not speed for all that: for it depends on the fathers grant. True, but then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider the great interest he hath in the Father, with whom he so intercedes. Christ is his <hi>dear</hi> Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. the beloved of his soul, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. betwixt him and the Father with whom he intercedes; there is an unity not only of nature, but will; and so he always hears him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.42. Yea, and he said to this his dear Son, when he came first to Heaven; <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee</hi> Psal. 2.8. moreover,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He must needs speed in his suit, if you consider the nature of his intercession, which is Just and reasonable for the matter; urgent and continual for the manner of it: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his request is most equal. What he desires is not desired gratis, or upon terms unbecoming the holiness and righteousness of God to grant. He desires no more, but what he hath deserved,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54346:101"/>
and given a valuable consideration to the Father for. And so the Justice of God doth not only oppose, but furthers and pleads for the granting and fulfilling his requests.</p>
               <p>Here you must remember that the Father is under a covenant-tye, and bond to do what he asks; for Christ having fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the work on his part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mercies he intercedes for are as due, as the hire of the labourer is, when the work is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done. And as the matter is just, so the manner of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession is urgent, and continual. How importunate a suiter he is, may be easily gathered from that specimen or handsel gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. and for the constancy of it, my text tells us, he ever lives to make Intercession. 'Tis his great business in Heaven, and he follows it close. And to close all,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider who they are for whom he makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. The friends of God. The children of God. Those that the Father himself loves, and his heart is propense, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to grant the best and greatest of mercies to; which is the meaning of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.26, 27. the Father himself loveth you. And it must needs be so, for the first corner stone of all these mercies was laid by the Father himself in his most free election: He also delivered his Son for us, and <hi>how shall he not with him, freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.32. So then, there can remain no doubt upon a considering heart; but Christ is a prevalent and successful Intercessor in Heaven. There only remains one thing more to be satisfied, and that is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In what sense he is said to live for ever to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession. Shall he then be always at his work? Imployed in begging new favours for us to eternity? How then shall the people of God be perfect in Heaven, if there be need of Christs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to eternity for them?</p>
               <p>I answer, by distinguishing the <hi>essence,</hi> and <hi>substance</hi> of Christs offices, from the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of Administration. In the first sense it is eternal, for his mediatory Kingdom, as to the essence of it, is to abide for ever. Christ shall never cease to be a Mediator. The Church shall never want an Head. For <hi>of his Kingdom there shall be no end,</hi> Luk. 1.33. However, Christ as Mediator, being employed in a kind of subordinate way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. when he shall have accomplished that design, for which he became a Mediator: <hi>then shall he deliver up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (in the sence we spake before) <hi>to the Father, and so God
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54346:102"/>
shall be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.24. Then shall the divinity of Christ which was so empty and obscured in his undertaking this temporary dispensatory Kingdom, be more gloriously manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the full possession, use and enjoyment of that natural, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, eternal Kingdom, which belongs to all three co-essential, and co-equal persons, reigning with the same Power, Majesty and glory in the unity of the divine essence; and common Acts, in all and over all; infinitely, and immutably for ever.</p>
               <p>And so Christ continues to be our Mediator, and yet that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no argument, that our happiness shall be incompleat: but rather argues the perfection of the Church, which thenceforth shall be governed no more as now it is, nor have any further use of Ordinances; but shall be ruled more immediately, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, triumphantly and ineffably in the world to come. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his mediatorship is not changed, but the manner of the administration only.</p>

The Apostate treads it underfoot. He that is an <hi>intercessor</hi> for some, will be an <hi>accuser</hi> of others. To be guilty of a mans blood, is sad; but to have the blood of Jesus accusing, and crying to God against a soul, is unspeakably terrible. Surely when he shall make inquisition for blood, when the day of his vengeance is come, he will make it appear by the Judgements he will execute, that this is a sin never to be expiated; but vengeance shall pursue the sinner to the bottom of Hell.

                     <hi>and draw encouragement against all the causes and grounds of their fears, and troubles.</hi> For surely this answers them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Hence let them be encouraged against all their <hi>sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> and lamented weaknesses. 'Tis confessed, these are sad things; they grieve the spirit of God, sadden your own hearts, cloud your evidences; but having such an High-Priest in Heaven, can never be your ruine. 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. <hi>My little children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not: And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> [My little children] children, especially little children; when first beginning to take the foot, are apt to stumble at every straw. So are raw, young, and unexperienced Christians; but what if they do? Why though it must be far from them to take incouragement so to do, from Christ and his intercession; yet if by surprizal, they so sin, let them not be utterly discouraged; for we have an <hi>Advocate.</hi> He stops whatever plea may be brought in against us by the Devil, or the Law; and answers all by his satisfaction. He gets out fresh pardons for new sins. And this Advocate is with [the Father] he doth not say with his Father, though that had been a singular support in it self, nor yet with our Father, which is a sweet encouragement singly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with [the Father] which takes in both to make the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement full. Remember ye that are cast down under the sense of sin, that Jesus your friend in the Court above, <hi>is able to save to the uttermost.</hi> Which is as one calls it, a reaching word; and extends it self so far that thou canst not look beyond it.
<q>Let thy soul be set on the highest mount,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Goodwins Triumph.</hi> p. 263.</note> that any creature was ever yet set upon; and inlarged to take in view the most spatious prospect both of sin, and misery, and difficulties of being saved; that ever yet any poor humble soul did cast within it self; yea, joyn to these all the hindrances and objections that the heart of man can invent against it self, and salvation; lift up thine eyes, and look to the utmost thou canst see; and Christ by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession is able to save thee beyond the Horizon and utmost compass of thy thoughts; even to the <hi>utmost.</hi>
                     </q>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence draw abundant encouragement <hi>against all heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straightnings, and deadness of spirit in prayer.</hi> Thou complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy heart is dead, wandring, and contracted in duty. O but remember Christs blood speaks, when thou canst not: it can plead for thee, and that powerfully; when thou art not able to speak a word for thy self: to this sense that Scripture speaks, Can. 3.6. <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness in pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrh, and frankincense, all the powders of the Merchant?</hi> The duties of Christians go up many times as pillars, or clouds of smoke from them, more <hi>smoke,</hi> than fire. Prayers smoked, and sullied with their offensive corruptions: but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christ perfumes them with myrh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he by his intercession, gives them a sweet perfume.</p>

                     <note place="margin">If Jesus be the Media or of the New co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may go with boldness, and look the justice of God in the face; for your debt is satisfied.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christs intercession is a singular relief to all that come unto God by him, <hi>against all sinful damps, and slavish fears from the justice of God.</hi> Nothing more promotes the fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Nothing more suppresseth unbelieving despondencies, and destroys the spirit of bondage. So you find it, Heb. 10.19, 20, 21. <hi>Having therefore brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest, by the blood of Iesus; by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the vail, that is to say his flesh; And having an High-Priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart</hi>

                     </gap>, in full assurance of faith: Or let us come unto God, as a Ship comes with full sayl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Harbour. O what a direct, and full gale of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth this intercession of Christ give, to the poor soul that lay a ground, or was wind-bound before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The intercession of Christ gives admirable satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and encouragement to all that come to God, against the fears of deserting him again by Apostacy. This my friends, this is your principal security against these matters of fear. With this he relieves <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.31.32. <hi>Simon,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy fath fail not. q. d.</hi> Satan will fan thee, not to get out thy chaff, but boult out thy flower. His
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54346:103"/>
temptations are levell'd against thy faith; but fear not, my prayer shall break his designs, and secure thy faith from all his attempt upon it. Upon this powerful intercession of Christ, the Apostle builds his triumph, against all that threatens to bring him, or any of the Saints again into a state of condemnation. And see how he drives on that triumph, from the resurrection, and session of Christ at the Fathers right hand; and especially from the work of intercession, which he lives there to perform. Rom. 8.34, 35. <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it's Christ that died; yea, rather that's risen again: who is even at the right hand of God, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so maketh intercession for us.</hi> Who shall <hi>separate us from the Love of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It gives sweet relief <hi>against the defects and wants that yet are in our sanctification.</hi> We want a great deal of faith, love, heavenly mindedness, mortification, knowledge. We are short, and wanting in all. There are the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the remains, or things wanting, as the Apostle calls them. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.10. Well if grace be but yet in it's weak beginnings, and infancy in thy soul, this may incourage, that by reason of Christs intercession, it shall live, grow, and expatiate it self in thy heart. He is not only the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but the finisher of it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. He is ever begging new and fresh mercies for you, in Heaven; and will never be quiet till all your wants be supplied. He saves <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to the uttermost: (i. e.)</hi> as I told you before, to the last, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, compleating act of salvation. So that this is a fountain of relief against all your fears.</p>

                     <hi>then let those who reap on earth the fruits of that his work in Heaven, draw instruction thence about the following duties, to which it leads them as by the hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">He doth not forget us though he be exalted to his glory, for he is not like the poor silly creature that cannot bear exaltation without being puffed up, and forgeting both themselves, their friends, and their God.

Mr. <hi>Baxters Treatise of Convers. p.</hi> 184.</note> 
                     <hi>Do not forget Christ in an exalted state.</hi> You see though he be in all the glory above, at Gods right hand, an enthron'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54346:104"/>
King, he doth not forget you. He like <hi>Ioseph</hi> remembers his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in all his glory. But alas how oft doth advancement make us forget him? as the Lord complains in Hosea 13.5, 6. <hi>I did know thee in the Wilderness, in the Land of great drought</hi>; but when they came into <hi>Canaan, According to their pastures, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; therefore have they forgotten me.</hi> As if he had said, O my people, you and I were better acquainted in the Wilderness. When you were in a low condition, left to my immediate care; living by daily faith; Oh then you gave me many a sweet visit; but now you are filled, I hear no more of you. Good had it been for some Saints, if they had never known prosperity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let the intercession of Christ in Heaven for you, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to constancy in the good ways of God.</hi> To this duty it sweetly encourages also. Heb. 4.14. <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High-Priest that is passed into the Heavens, Iesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our profession.</hi> Here is incouragement to perseverance on a double account. One is, that Jesus our head is already in Heaven, and if the head be above water, the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drown. The other is from the business he is there imployed about, which is his Priesthood; he is passed into the Heavens, as our great High-Priest to intercede, and therefore we cannot miscarry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let it incourage you to constancy in prayer:</hi> O do not neglect that excellent duty, seing Christ is there, to present all your petitions to God. Yea, to <hi>perfume</hi> as well as <hi>present</hi> them. So the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. infers from Christs intercession. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hence be encouraged to plead for Christ on earth, who continually pleads for you in Heaven.</hi> If any accuse you, he is there to plead for you. And if any dishonour him on earth, see that you plead his interest, and defend his honour. Thus you have heard what his intercession is, and what benefits we receive by it.</p>
                  <trailer>Blessed be God for Iesus Christ.</trailer>

            <p>YOU have seen the general nature, necessity, and parts of Christs Priesthood; <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Intercession.</hi> Before you part from this office, it's necessary you should further take into consideration the principal fruits, and effects of his Priesthood. Which are, compleat <hi>Satisfaction</hi>; and the <hi>Aquisition</hi> or purchase of an eternal inheritance. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, viz. <hi>the satisfaction</hi> made by his blood, is manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this excellent Scripture before us; wherein the <hi>Apostle</hi> (having shewn before, at the tenth verse, that whosoever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues not in all things, written in the Law to do them, is cursed.) declares how notwithstanding the threats of the Law, a Believer comes to be freed from the curse of it. Namely, by Christs bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that curse for him, and so satisfying Gods justice, and discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Believer from all obligations to punishment.</p>
            <p>More particularly, in these words you have the Believers discharge from the curse of the Law, and the way and manner thereof opened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:54346:105"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Believers discharge. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law.</hi> The Law of God hath three parts, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Promises, and Threatnings, or Curses. The Curse of the Law is its condemning sentence, whereby a sinner is bound over to dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, even the death of soul and body. The chains by which it binds him, is the guilt of sin; and from this none can loose the soul, but Christ. This curse of the Law is the most dreadful thing imaginable. It strikes at the life of the sinner. Yea, his best life, the eternal life of the soul. And when it hath condemned, it is inexorable. No cries, nor tears, no reformations, or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can loose the guilty sinner; for it requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s for its reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that which no meer creature can give; even an infinite satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Now from this curse, Christ frees the Believer. That is, he dissolves the obligation to punishment. Cancels the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing. Looses all the bonds and chains of guilt. So that the curse of the Law hath nothing to do with him for ever.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> It is the Act of God-man, no other was capable of giving satisfaction, for an infinite wrong done to God. But by reason of the union of the two natures, in his wonderful person, he could do it, and hath done it for us. The humane nature did what was necessary in its kind; it gave the matter of the Sacrifice: the divine nature stampt the dignity and value upon it, which made it an adequate compensation. So that it was <hi>opus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the act of God-man. Yet so, that each nature retained its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, notwithstanding their joynt influence into the effect. If the Angels in Heaven had laid down their lives; or if the blood of all the men in the world had beeen poured out by Justice; this could never have satisfied; because that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> worth and value which this Sacrifice hath, would have still been wanting. <hi>It was God that redeemed the Church, with his own blood.</hi> Act. 20.28. If God redeem with his own blood, he redeems as God-man, without any dispute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he satisfie God for us, he must present himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as our surety in our <hi>stead,</hi> as well as for our good; else his obedience had signified nothing to us: to this end he was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. comes under the same obligation with us, and that as a surety: For so he is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his obedience and sufferings could be exacted from him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other account. It was not for any thing he had done, that he became a curse. It was prophesied of him, Dan. 9.26. <hi>the Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself:</hi> and beeing dead, the Scriptures plainly assert, it was <hi>for our sins</hi>: and upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. So 1 Cor. 15.3. <hi>Christ dyed for our sins according to the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it's well observed by our Divines, who assert the vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and substitution of Christ in his sufferings; that all those Greek particles which we translate [for] when applied to the sufferings of Christ, do note the meritorious, deserving, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cause of those sufferings.

                  </gap> men that exchanged lives, or gave life for life: staking down their own, to deliver anothers. As <hi>Philumene</hi> did for <hi>Aristides.</hi> And so the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> speaks.</p>

               <p>And indeed this very consideration is that which supports the doctrine of Imputation,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> the imputation of our sins to Christ, and the imputation of Christs righteousness unto us.

Indeed if this had not been he would have been the righteous Lord, but not the <hi>Lord our righteousness,</hi> as he is stiled <hi>Ier.</hi> 33.16. So that it is but a vain distinction, to say it was <hi>for our good,</hi> but not <hi>in our stead.</hi> For had it not been in our stead, we could not have had the good of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The internal moving cause of Christs satisfaction for us, was his obedience to God, and love to us. That it was an act of obedience is plain, from Phil. 2.8. <hi>He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</hi> Now obedience respects a command; and such a command Christ received to dye for us, as himself tells us, Joh. 10.18. <hi>I lay down my life of my self, I have power to lay it down, and power to take it again; this commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> So that it was an act of obedience with respect to God, and yet a most free and spontaneous act with respect to himself. And that he was moved to it out of pity and love to us, himself assures us. Gal. 5.2. <hi>Christ loved us, and gave himself for us, an offering and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God:</hi> upon this <hi>Paul</hi> sweetly reflected, Gal. 2.20. <hi>who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> As the external moving cause was our misery, so the internal was his own love, and pity for us.</p>

It is conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssed the Scripture most frequently mentions his passive obedience, as that which made the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and procures our redemption. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>&amp; alibi,</hi> but his passive obedience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mentioned exclusively, as the sole cause, or matter of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But in those places where it's mentioned by it self, it's put for his whole obedience, both active and passive, by an usual Trope; and in other Scriptures, it is ascribed to both, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. he is said <hi>to be made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> Now his being <hi>made under the Law</hi> to this end, cannot be restrained to his subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ction to the curse of the Law only, but to the commands of it also. So Rom. 5.19. <hi>As by one mans disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one shall many be made righteous.</hi> It were a manifest injury to this text also, to restrain it to the passive obedience of Christ only. To be short this twofold obedience of Christ stands opposed to a twofold obligation that fallen man is under; the one <hi>to do</hi> what God requires: the other <hi>to suffer</hi> what he hath threatned for disobedience.

                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the effect and fruit of this his satisfaction is our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ransom, or deliverance from the wrath and curse due to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54346:107"/>
us for our sins. Such was the dignity, value, and compleatness of Christs satisfaction; that in strict Justice it merited our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and full deliverence. Not only a possibility that we might be redeemed, and pardoned; but a right whereby we ought to be so. As the learned Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> judiciously argues. If he be made a curse for us, we must then be redeemed from the curse, according to justice: so the Apostle argues, Rom. 3.25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood; to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God, to declare I say at this time his righteousness, that God might be just, and the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of him that believeth in Iesus.</hi> Mark the design and end of God in exacting satisfaction from Christ; it was to declare his righteousness, in remission of sin to believers; and lest we should lose the Emphatical word, he doubles it; <hi>to declare I say his righteousness.</hi> Every one can see how his mercy is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in remission; but he would have us take notice that his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Believers is an act of Justice; and that God as he is a just God, cannot condemn the believer, since Christ hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his debts. This attribute seems to be the main bar against remission; but now, it's become the very ground and reason why God remits. Oh how comfortable a text is this! Doth Satan or Conscience set forth thy sin in all its discouraging cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and aggravations? God hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation. Must justice be manifested, satisfied, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? So it is in the death of Christ, ten thousand times more than ever it could be in thy damnation. Thus you have a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the satisfaction made by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shall gather up all that hath been said, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the truth of Christs satisfaction. Proving the reality of it, that it is not an improper, catechristical, fictitious satisfaction; by divine acceptilation, as some have very diminutively called it; but real, proper, and full; and as such accepted by God. For his blood is the blood of a <hi>surety, Heb.</hi> 7.22. who came under the same obligations of the Law with us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and though he had no sin of his own, yet standing before God, as our sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the iniquities of us all, were laid upon him. <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.6. and from him did the Lord with great severity exact satisfaction for our sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. punishing them upon his soul. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. and upon his body, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. and with this obedience
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54346:108"/>
of his Son is fully pleased and satisfied. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. And hath in token thereof raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And for his righteousness sake acquitted and discharged believers, who shall never more come into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 34. All this is plain in Scripture, and our faith in the satisfaction of Christ, is not built on the wisdom of man; but the everlasting sealed truth of God. Yet such is the perverse nature of man, and the pride of his heart; that whilst he should be humbly adoring the grace of God in providing such a surety for us; he is found accusing the justice, and diminishing the mercy of God; and raising all the objections which Satan and his own heart can invent, to overturn that blessed foundation upon which God hath built up his own honour, and his peoples salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the next place therefore, we shall reject those doctrines and remove the principal of those objections that are found militating against the satisfaction of Christ.</p>
               <p>And in the first place, we reject with deep abhorrence that doctrine which ascribes to man any power in whole or in part to satisfie God for his own, or other mens sins. This no meer creature can do, by active obedience, were it so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat that he could never sin in thought, word, or deed any more; but live the most holy life, that ever any lived. For all this would be no more than his duty as a creature, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. and so can be no satisfaction for what he is by nature, or hath done against God as a sinner. Nor yet by <hi>sufferings.</hi> For we have offended an infinite God, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfie him by our finite sufferings.</p>
               <p>We also with like detestation reject that doctrine which makes the satisfaction of Christ either impossible, or fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and inconsistent with grace, in the free pardon of sin. Many are the cavils raised against Christs satisfaction; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal are such as these that follow.</p>

The divine nature dignifies it, and makes it of infinite value. A certain family hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted treason against the King, and are all under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law for it; the Kings Son moved with pity and love, resolves to satisfie the Law, and yet save the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in order whereunto he marries a daughter of the family, whereby her blood becomes Royal blood, and worth the blood of the whole family whence she sprang; this Princess is by her Husband executed in the room of the rest. In this case the King satisfies not himself for the wrong, but is satisfied by the death of another, equivalent in worth to the blood of them all. This similitude answers not to all the particulars, as indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in nature doth or can, but it only shews what it was that satisfied God, and how it became so satisfactory.</p>

It so fell out, that his own Son was brought before him for that crime; hereupon the people interposing, made suit for his pardon. At length, the Father partly overcome by their importunities, and not unwilling to shew what lawful favour he might to his Son; he first put out one of his own eyes, and then one of his Sons; and so shewed himself both a merciful Father, and a just Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.

So tempering mercy with justice, that both the Law was satisfied, and his Son spared.

But Christ did not divide and share in the penalty with us, but bare it all. <hi>Zaleucus</hi> did it for his Son, who was dear to him; Christ did it for enemies, that were fighting and rebelling against him.

For such is the severity of the Law, that when it is once offended, it will never be made amends again, by all that we can do. It will not discharge the sinner for all the sorrow in the world. Indeed if a man be in Christ, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for sin is something; and renewed obedience is something. God looks upon them favourably, and accepts them gratiously in Christ: but out of him they signifie no more than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and cries of a condemned malefactor, to reverse the legal sentence of the Judge. You may toyl all the day of your life, and at night go to bed without a candle. To that sense that Scripture sounds, Isa. 50. ult. <hi>Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that compass your selves about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled; this shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow. By fire,</hi> and the light of it, some understand the sparkling pleasures of this life, and the sensitive joys of the creatures: but generally it's taken for our own natural righteousness, and all acts of duties in order to our own justification by them before God. And so it stands opposed to that faith of recumbency, spoken of in the verse before. By their <hi>compassing themselves about with these sparks,</hi> understand their dependence on these their duties and glorying in them. But see the fatal issue, <hi>ye shall lie down in sorrow.</hi> That shall be your recompence from the hand of the Lord. That's all the thanks, and reward you must expect from him,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54346:111"/>
for slighting Christs, and prefering your own righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his. Reader, be convinced, that one act of faith in the Lord Jesus, pleases God more, than all the obedience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and strivings to obey the Law through thy whole life can do. And thus you have the first special fruit of Christs Priesthood, in the full satisfaction of God for all the sins of Believers.</p>

They agree in this, that both flow from the pleasure, and good will of the Adoptant. And in this, that both confer aright to priviledges, which we have not by nature; but in this they differ. One is an Act imitating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the other transcends nature. The one, was found out for the comfort of them that had no children; the other, for the comfort of them that had no Father. This Divine Adoption, is in Scripture either taken properly for that act, or sentence of God, by which we are made Sons: or for the priviledges with which the Adopted are invested. And so it's taken <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. and in this Scripture now before us.

Here our Divines rightly distinguish betwixt the <hi>substance,</hi> and <hi>accidents</hi> of Christs death and obedience. Consider that Christs suffering as to the substance of it, it was no more than what the Law required. For neither the justice, nor love of the Father would permit, that Christ should suffer more, than what was necessary for him to bear, as our surety: but as to the circumstances, the person of the sufferer, the cause and efficacy of his sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was much more than sufficient. A <hi>super legale meritum,</hi> a merit above and beyond what the Law required. For though the Law required the death of the sinner, who is but a poor contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible creature; it did not require that one perfectly innocent should die. It did not require that God should shed his blood. It did not require blood of such value, and worth as this was. I say none of this the Law required, though God was pleased for the advancement and manifestation of his Justice and Mercy in the highest,<note place="margin">

So that it was rightly determined by holy <hi>Anselme,</hi> no man saith he can pay to God what he owes him; Christ only paid more than he owed him. And by this you see how rich a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54346:113"/>
treasure there lies by Christ, to bestow in a purchase for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and above what he paid to redeem us; even as much as his soul and body was more worth than ours for whom it was sacrificed; and that is so great a sum, that all the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and men on earth can never compute, and sum up, so as to shew us the total of it. And this was that inexhaustible treasure that Christ expended, to procure and purchase the fairest inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Believers. Having seen the treasure that purchased; let us next enquire into the inheritance purchased by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This inheritance is so large, that it cannot be survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by creatures: nor can the boundaries and limits thereof be described;<note place="margin">

               <p>But to be more particular, I shall distribute the Saints inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance purchased by Christ, into three heads. All <hi>Temporal</hi> good things, all <hi>Spiritual</hi> good things, and all <hi>Eternal</hi> good things are theirs.</p>

                  <hi>All Temporal good things.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.7. <hi>He hath given us all things, richly to enjoy.</hi> Not that they have the <hi>possession,</hi> but the comfort and <hi>benefit</hi> of all things. Others have the sting, gall, wormwood, bayts, and snares of the creature; Saints only have the blessing and comfort of it. So that this little which a Righteous man hath, is (in this among other respects) <hi>better than the treasures of many wicked.</hi> Which is the true key to open that dark saying of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet possessing all things. They only possess, others are possessed by the world. The Saints do <hi>uti mundo, &amp; frui Deo,</hi> use the world and enjoy God in the use of it. Others are deceived, defiled, and destroyed by the world, but these are refresht, and furthered by it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>All Spiritual good things</hi> are purchased by the blood of Christ for them. As <hi>justification</hi> which comprizes remission of sins, and acceptation of our persons by God. Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being Iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ. Sanctification</hi> is also purchased for them. Yea,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54346:114"/>
both <hi>initial</hi> and <hi>progressive</hi> sanctification. For of <hi>God he is made unto us not only wisdom and righteousness, but sanctification also.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. These two, <hi>viz.</hi> our Justification and Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are two of the most rich and shining robes in the wardrobe of free-grace. How glorious and lovely do they render the soul that wears them! These are like the Bracelets and Jewels <hi>Isaack</hi> sent to <hi>Rebecca. Adoption</hi> into the family of God is purchased for us by this blood. <hi>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> Gal 3.26. Christ as he is the Son, is <hi>haeres natus,</hi> the heir by nature: as he is <hi>Mediator,</hi> he is <hi>haeres constitutus,</hi> the heir by appointment: <hi>appointed heir of all things</hi>; as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. By this Sonship of Christ, we being united to him by faith, become Sons; and if Sons, then heirs. <hi>O what a manner of love is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this, that we should be called the Sons of God?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. That a poor beggar should be made an heir, yea, an heir of God, and a joynt heir with Christ. Yea, that very <hi>faith,</hi> which is the bond of union, and consequently the ground of all our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ, is the purchase of his blood also. 2 Pet. 1.1. <hi>To them that have obtained like pretious faith with us, through the righteousness of God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi> This most pretious <hi>grace</hi> is the dear purchase of our Lord Jesus Christ. Yea, all that <hi>peace, joy,</hi> and <hi>spiritual comfort,</hi> which are sweet fruits of faith, are with it purchased for us by this blood.</p>
               <p>So speaks the Apostle in Rom. 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Being Iustified by faith, we have peace with God; through our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. moreover <hi>the Spirit</hi> himself who is the Author, Fountain, and Spring of all these graces and comforts, is procured for us by his death, and resurrection. Gal. 3.13, 14. <hi>Christ hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree. That the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles through Iesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the spirit, through faith.</hi> That spirit that at first sanctified, and since hath so often sealed, comforted, directed, resolved, guided, and quickned your souls; had not come to perform any of these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Offices upon your hearts if Christ had not died.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>All Eternal good things</hi> are the purchase of his blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heaven and all the glory thereof is purchased for you that are Believers, with this price. Hence that glory, whatever it be, is called, <hi>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54346:114"/>
not away, reserved in Heaven for you</hi>; to the lively hope whereof ye are begotten again, <hi>by the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3, 4. Not only present mercys are purchased for us, but things to come also. As it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. Man is a prudent and prospecting creature, and is not satisfied that it's well with him for present, unless he have some assurance it shall be well with him for time to come. His mind is taken up about what shall be hereafter, and from the good, or evil things to come, he raiseth up to himself, vast hopes, or fears.</p>
               <p>Therefore to compleat our happiness, and fill up the uttermost capacity of our souls; all the good of eternity is put into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and Inventory of the Saints Estate and Inheritance. This happiness is ineffable. It's usually distinguisht into what is <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential,</hi> and what is <hi>accessory</hi> to it. The <hi>essentials</hi> of it, as we in our embodied state can conceive, is either, the <hi>Objective, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> happiness to be enjoyed in Heaven.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objective</hi> happiness, is God himself. Psal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> If it could be supposed (saith one) that God should withdraw from the Saints in Heaven, and say, take Heaven and divide it among you; but as for me, I will withdraw from you: the Saints would fall a weeping in Heaven, and say, Lord take Heaven, and give it to whom thou wilt; it's no Heaven to us except thou be there. Heaven would be a very <hi>Bokim</hi> to the Saints, without God. In this our glory in Heaven consists, to be ever with the Lord. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.17. God himself is the chief part of a Saints inheritance, in which sence as some will understand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. they are called <hi>heirs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Subjective</hi> glory and happiness is the attemperation and suiting of the soul and body to God. This is begun in sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perfected in glorification. It consists in removing from both, all that is indecent and inconsistent with a state of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat glory and happiness; and in super-induceing and cloathing it with all Heavenly qualities.</p>
               <p>The immunities of the body are its freedom from all natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; which as they come in, so they go out with sin. Thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there shall be no diseases, deformities, pains, flaws, monstro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, their good physitian death hath cured all this. And their vile bodies shall be made like unto Christs glorious body. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. And be made a spiritual body. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. For agility,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54346:115"/>
like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab.</hi> For <hi>Beauty</hi> as the top of <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> for <hi>incorruptibility</hi> as if they were <hi>pure Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Soul</hi> also is discharged and freed from all darkness and ignorance of mind; being now able to discern all truths in God, that Chrystal Ocean of truth. The leaks of the memory stopt for ever. The roving of its fancy perfectly cured. The stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness and reluctancy of the will, for ever subdued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in due, and full subjection to God. So that the Saints in glory shall be free from all that now troubles them. They shall never sin more, nor be once tempted so to do; for no serpent hisses in that paradise. They shall never grieve or groan more, for God shall wipe all tears from their eyes. They shall never be troubled more: for God will then recompense tribulation to their troubles, and to them that are troubled rest. They shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt more, for fruition excludes doubting.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Formal</hi> happiness is the fulness of satisfaction resulting from the blessed sight and enjoyment of God, by a soul so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd to him. Psal. 17.15. <hi>When I awake, I shall be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy likeness.</hi> This sight of God in glory called the beatifical vision, must needs yield ineffable satisfaction to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding soul, in as much as it will be an <hi>intuitive</hi> vision. The intellectual or mental eye shall see God: 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal glorified eye shall see Christ. <hi>Iob</hi> 19.26, 27. What a ravishing vision will this be? And how much will it exceed all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and apprehensions we had here of it! Surely the one half was not told us. It will be a <hi>transformative vision,</hi> it will change the beholder into its own image and likeness. <hi>We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. As Iron put into the fire, becomes all fiery: so the soul by conversing with God, is changed into his very similitude. It will be, an <hi>Appropriative vision, whom I shall see for my self.</hi> Job. 19.26, 27. In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven interest is clear, and undoubted; fear is cast out. No need of marks and signs there; for what a man sees and enjoys, how can he doubt of? It will be a <hi>ravishing vision,</hi> these we have by faith are so, how much more those in glory; How was <hi>Paul</hi> transported, when he was in a visional way wrapt up into the third Heaven, and heard the unutterable things, though he was not admitted into the blessed society, but was with them as the Angels are in our assemblies; a stander by, a looker on. If a spark do so inflame; what is it to lie down like a <hi>Phoenix</hi> in her bed of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54346:115"/>
Spices? Like a <hi>Salamander</hi> to live, and move in the fire of love! It will also be an eternal vision, <hi>vacabimus, &amp; videbimus</hi>: (as <hi>Augustin</hi> said) we shall then be at leisure for this imployment, and have no diversions from it for ever. No evening is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the seaventh days sabbath; no night in the new <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> It will be <hi>a fully satisfying vision</hi>: God will then be all in all. <hi>Etiam ipsa curiositas satietur,</hi> curiosity it self will be satisfied. The blessed soul will feel it self blessed, filled, satisfied, in every part. Ah what an happiness is here! to look, and love; to drink and sing, and drink again at the fountain head of the highest glory. And if at any time its eye be turned from a direct, to a reflex sight upon what it once was; how it was wrought on; how fitted for this glory; how wonderfully distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by special grace, from them that are howling in flames, whilst himself is shouting aloud upon its bed of everlasting rest; all this will enhaunce the glory.</p>
               <p>And so also will the <hi>Accessories</hi> of this blessedness, <hi>The place</hi> where God is enjoyed, the <hi>Empyrean Heaven,</hi> the City of God, wihther Christ ascended.

There will be sweet and full closings also betwixt the Saints; <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> are there agreed: here they could not fully close with one another. And no wonder, for they could not fully close with themselves. But there is perfect harmony and unity. All meeting and closing in God, as lines in the Center.

                  <p>Who can be blamed for desiring to see that fair inheritance which is purchased for him?

What will ye do when at death you shall look back over your shoulder, and see what you have spent your time and strength for, shrinking and vanishing away from you?

                  <p>O therefore, if you have any concernment for your poor souls.

Oh, look to that fair estate you have reserved in Heaven for you, and say, I am hastning home, and when I come thither, all my wants shall be supplied.

            <p>WE now come to the <hi>Regal Office</hi> by which our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mediator executes and dischargeth the undertaken design of our Redemption. Had he not as our <hi>Prophet</hi> opened the way of Life and Salvation to the children of men, they could never have known it; and should they have clearly known it, except as their <hi>Priest</hi> he had offered up himself to impetrate and obtain Redemption for them; they could not have been Redeemed virtually by his blood; and if they had been so Redeemed, yet had he not lived in the capacity of a <hi>King,</hi> to apply this purchase of his blood to them; they could have had no actual personal benefit by his death. For what he revealed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54346:118"/>
as a Prophet, he purchased as a Priest: and what he so revealed and purchased as Prophet and Priest; he applies as King. First, Subduing the souls of his elect to his spiritual government, then ruling them as his subjects; and ordering all things in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of providence for their good.</p>
            <p>So that Christ hath a twofold Kingdom, the one <hi>spiritual,</hi> and <hi>internal</hi>; by which he subdues and rules the hearts of his people. The other <hi>providential,</hi> and <hi>external</hi>; whereby he guides, rules, and orders all things in the world in a blessed subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their eternal Salvation. I am to speak from this text of his Spiritual and internal Kingdom.</p>
            <p>These words are considerable two ways, either <hi>relatively,</hi> or <hi>absolutely.</hi> Considered relatively they are a vindication of the Apostle from the unjust censures of the <hi>Corinthians</hi>; who very unworthily interpreted his gentleness, condescention, and winning affability to be no better than a fawning upon them for self ends: and the authority he excercised, no better than pride, and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.

and takes in those strong holds. Thus Christ spoils Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of his armour in which he trusted, by shewing the sinner that all this can be no defence to his soul against the wrath of God. But that's not all, in the next place,</item>

They do not only lay down their arms and fight no more against Christ with them; but repair to his Camp, and fight for Christ, with those reasons of theirs that were before imployed against him: as it's said of <hi>Ierome,</hi>

But that's not all, he causes Armies of convictions and spiritual troubles to begird and straighten them on every side; so that they know not what to do. These convictions like a shower of Arrows, strike point blanck into their Consciences.

               <p>Now all their weak pleas and defences, from the general mercy of God, the examples of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prove but as paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls to them. These shake their hearts, even to the foundation.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54346:120"/>
And overturn every high thought there, that exalts it self against the Lord. This day in which Christ sits down before the soul, and summons it by such messengers as these, is a day of distress within; yea, such a day of trouble that none is like it. But though it be so: yet Satan hath so deeply intrencht himself in the mind, and will, that the soul yields not at the first summons, till its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions within are spent, and all its Towers of Pride, and Walls of vain confidence be undermined by the Gospel, and shaken down about its ears: and then the soul desires a parley with Christ. O now it would be glad of terms, any terms. If it may but save its life, let all go as a prey to the Conqueror. Now it sends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such messages as these to Christ, who is come now to the very gates of the soul, mercy Lord, mercy; O were I but assured thou wouldst receive, spare and pardon me, I would open to thee the next moment. Thus the soul is <hi>shut up to the faith of Christ,</hi> as it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. and reduced now to the greatest straight and loss imaginable; and now the merciful King, whose only design is to conquer hearts, hangs forth the white flag of mercy before the soul, giving it hopes it shall be spared, pitied and pardoned, though so long in rebellion against him: If yet it will yield it self to Christ: many staggerings, hesitations, irresolutions, doubts, fears, scruples, half-resolves, reasonings for and against there are at the Council-table of mans own heart at this time. Sometimes there is no hope, Christ will slay me, if I go forth to him, and then it trembles. But then, whoever found him so, that tried him? Other souls have yielded, and found mercy beyond all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Oh but I have been a desperate enemy against him. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, yet thou hast the word of a King for it; <hi>let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon him.</hi> Isa. 55.7.</p>
               <p>But the time of mercy is past, I have stood out too long. Yet, if it were so, how is it that Christ hath not made short work and cut me off. Set fire, Hell fire to my soul, and withdrawn the siege? Still he waiteth that he may be gratious, and is exalted that he may have compassion. A thousand such debates there are, till at last the soul considering, if it abide in rebellion, it must needs perish; if it go forth to Christ, it can but perish; and being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what encouraged by the messages of grace sent into the soul at this time, such as that, Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to save to the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54346:120"/>
utmost all that come unto God by him.</hi> And that, Joh. 6.37. <hi>He that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> And that, Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me ye that are weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi> It is at last resolved to open to Christ. And saith, <hi>stand open ye everlasting gates, and be ye opened ye everlasting doors; the King of glory shall come in.</hi> Now the will spontaneously opens to Christ. That fort Royal submits, and yields. And all the affections open to him. The will brings Christ the keys of all the rooms in the soul. Concerning this Triumphant entrance of Christ into the soul, we may say, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically speaks concerning the Triumphant entrance of <hi>Israel</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> Psal. 114.5, 6. <hi>The Mountains skipped like Rams, and the little Hills like Lambs; what ailed thee O thou Sea, that thou fleddest? thou,</hi> Jordan <hi>that thou wast driven back?</hi> So here in a like rhetorical Triumph we may say, the Mountains and Hills skip like Rams, the fixed and obstinate Will, starts from its own basis, and center. The Rocky heart rends in twain. A poor soul comes to the Word full of ignorance, pride, self-love, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hardness, and fixed resolutions to go on in its way. And by an hours discourse, the tide turns; <hi>Iordan</hi> is driven back. What aileth thee thou stout Will, that thou surrendrest to Christ? Thou hard heart, that thou relentest, and the waters gushed out! And thus the soul is won to Christ. He writes down his terms, and the soul willingly subscribes them. Thus it comes in to Christ by free and hearty submission: desiring nothing more than to come under the government of Christ, for time to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us see how Christ rules in the souls of such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> submit to him? And there are six things in which he exerts his Kingly authority over them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>He imposes a new Law upon them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is proper to Christ who rules abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and monarchically over the sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d them by his own au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority. None but Christ can do i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, 1. Because this Authority of Christ is infinite. 2. Because it's the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irty of an Husband, which cannot be communicated to any other. 1. Cor. 9.21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>and enjoyns them to be severe and punctual in their obedience to it.</hi> The soul was a <hi>Belialite</hi> before, and could endure no restraint. It's Lusts gave it Law. <hi>We our selves were sometimes, foolish, disobedient, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divers lusts, and pleasures.</hi> Tit. 3.3. What ever the flesh craved, and the sensual appetite whined after it must have; cost what it would cost: if damnation were the price of it, it would have it, provided it should not be present pay. Now it must not be any longer <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> without Law to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54346:121"/>
God: but under Law to Christ. Those are the articles of peace which the soul willingly signes in the day of its admission to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Matth. 11.29. <hi>Take my yoak upon you, and learn of me.</hi> This <hi>Law of the Spirit of life, which is in Christ Iesus, makes them free from the Law of sin and death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. Here's much strictness, but no bondage. For the Law is not only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Christs Statute-book the Bible, but coppied out by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the hearts of his subjects, in correspondent principles, which makes obedience a pleasure, and self-denial easie. Christs yoak is lined with Love: so that it never galls the necks of his people. 1 Joh. 5.3. <hi>His commandments are not grievous.</hi> The soul that comes under Christs government, must receive Law from Christ; and under Law every thought of the heart must come.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>He rebukes and chastises souls for the violations and trangressions of his Law.</hi> That's another act of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal authority: <hi>whom he loves he rebukes and chastens.</hi> Heb. 12.6, 7. These chastisements of Christ are either by the rod of <hi>providence</hi> upon their <hi>bodies</hi> and outward comforts, or upon their <hi>spirits</hi> and inward comforts. Sometimes his rebukes are smart upon the outward man. 1 Cor. 11.30. <hi>For this cause ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among you are weakly, and sick, and many sleep.</hi> They had not that due regard to his body that became them, and he will make their bodies to smart for it. And he had rather their flesh should smart, than their souls should perish. Sometimes he spares their outward, and afflicts their inner man, which is a much smarter rod. He withdraws peace, and takes away joy from the spirits of his people. The hidings of his face, are sore rebukes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all is for emendation, not for destruction. And it is not the least priviledge of Christs Subjects to have a seasonable and sanctified rod to reduce them from the waies of sin. Psal. 23.3. <hi>thy rod, and thy staff they comfort me.</hi> Others are suffered to go on stubbornly in the way of their own hearts. Christ will not spend a rod upon them for their good. Will not call them to account for any of their transgressions: but will reckon with them for altogether in Hell.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>Another Regal Act of Christ, is the restraining and keeping back his servants from iniquity, and withholding them from those courses which their own hearts would incline and lead them to.</hi> For even in them there is a spirit bent to backsliding,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54346:121"/>
but the Lord in tenderness over them, keeps back their souls from iniquity; and that when they are upon the very brink of sin: <hi>my feet were almost gone; my steps were well nigh slipt,</hi> Psal. 73.2. Then doth the Lord prevent sin, by removing the occasion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially: or by helping them to resist the temptation; grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslyly assisting their spirits in the trial. So that no temptation shall befall them, but a way of escape shall be opened, that they may be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. And thus his people have frequent occasions to bless his name for his preventing goodness, when they are almost in the midst of all evil. And this I take to be the meaning of Gal. 5.16 <hi>This I say then, walk in the spirit; and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.</hi> Tempted by them ye may be, but fulfil them ye shall not. My spirit shall cause the temptation to die, and wither away in the womb, in the embrio of it; so that it shall not come to a full birth.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Christ and all his little ones under his two wings, and in the compass or circle of his arms; is so sure, that Cast him and them in the ground of the Sea; he shall come up again, and not lose one. An odd one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor shall not be lost in the telling.</note> 
                     <hi>He protects them in his waies, and suffers them not to relapse fom him into a state of sin and bondage to Satan any more.</hi> Indeed he is restless in his endeavours to reduce them again to his obedience; he never leaves tempting and soliciting for their return; and where he finds a false professor he prevails: but Christ keeps his that they depart not again. Joh. 17.12. <hi>All that thou hast given me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition.</hi> They are <hi>kept, by the mighty power of God, through faith to salvation.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. Kept as in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison according to the importance of that word. None more <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited,</hi> none more <hi>safe</hi> than the people of God. They are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Christ Iesus.</hi> Jude 1. It is not their own grace that secures them, but Christs care, and continual watchfulness. Our own graces left to themselves, would quickly prove but weights sinking us to our own ruine. As one speaks, this is his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them. Jer. 32.4. <hi>I will put my fear in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and they shall not depart from me.</hi>

They are engaged to take this encouragement with them to every duty, that he whom they seek, is <hi>a bountiful rewarder of such as diligently seek him.</hi> Heb. 11.6. O what a good master do the Saints serve! Hear
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54346:122"/>
how a King expostulates with his Subjects, Jer. 2.31. <hi>Have I been a barren wilderness, on a land of darkness to you? q. d.</hi> Have I been such a hard master to you? Have you any reason to complain of my service? To whomsoever I have been straight-handed, surely I have not been so to you. You have not found the waies or wages of sin like mine.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, <hi>He pacifies all inward troubles, and commands peace when their spirits are tumultuous.</hi>

When the tumultuous affections are up, and in a hurry; when anger, hatred, and revenge begin to rise in the soul, this hushes and stills all. <hi>I will hearken</hi> (saith the Church) <hi>what God the Lord will speak, for he will speak peace to his people and to his Saints,</hi> Psal. 85.8. He that saith to the raging Sea be still, and it obeys him; he only can pacifie the disquieted spirit. They say of Frogs, that if they be croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never so much in the night, bring but a light among them, and they are all quiet. Such a light is the peace of God, among our disordered affections. These are Christs Regal acts. And he puts them forth upon the souls of his people, powerfully, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, suitably.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Powerfully: whether he restrains from sin, or impels to duty he doth it with a soul determining efficacy. For <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not in word, but in power.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.20. And those whom his Spirit leads, go bound in the spirit, to the fulfilling and discharge of their duties. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22. And yet,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He rules not by compulsion, but <hi>most sweetly.</hi> His Law is a Law of Love, written upon their hearts. The Church is the Lambs wife, Rev. 19.7. <hi>A bruised reed he shall not break, and smoaking flax he shall not quench.</hi> Isa. 42.2, 3. <hi>I beseech you by the meekness, and gentleness of Christ,</hi> saith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He rules them suitably to their natures: in a rational way: Hos. 11.4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of Love, (i. e.)</hi> in a way proper to convince their reason and work upon their ingenuity. And thus his internal Kingdom is administred by his Spirit, who is his <hi>prorex</hi> or vicegerent in our hearts.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And Lastly we will open the priviledges pertaining to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all the Subjects of this Spiritual Kingdom. And they are such as follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>Those souls ever whom Christ raigns, are certainly, and fully set free from the curse of the Law. If the Son make you free, then are you free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8.36. I say not they are free from the Law as a rule of life; such a freedom were no priviledge to them at all; but free from the rigorous exactions, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maledictions of it, to hear our liberty proclaimed from this bondage, is the joyful sound indeed. The blessedst voice that ever our ears heard. And this all that are in Christ shall hear; <hi>if we be led by the Spirit, we are not under the Law.</hi> Gal. 5.18. <hi>Blessed are the people that hear this joyful sound,</hi> Psal. 89.15.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another priviledge of Christs Subjects, is <hi>freedom from the dominion of sin.</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Sin shall not raign over them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>for they are not under the Law,</hi> but <hi>under grace.</hi> One Heaven cannot bear two Suns. Nor one soul, two Kings. When Christ takes the throne, sin quits it. It's true, the being of sin is there still. It's defiling and troubling power remains still; but its dominion is abolished. O joyful tydings, O welcome day!</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>Another priviledge of Christs Subjects, is protection in all troubles and dangers to which their souls or bodies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. This man shall be the peace, when the</hi> Assyrian <hi>shall come into our Land, and when he shall tread in our Palaces,</hi> Mica. 5.5. Kings owe protection to their Subjects. None so able, so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in that work, as Christ. All <hi>thou gavest me I have kept, and none is Lost.</hi> Joh. 17.12.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, <hi>Another priviledge of Christs Subjects is a merciful and tender bearing of their burdens and infirmities.</hi> They have a meek and patient King. <hi>Tell the daughter of Syon, thy King cometh meek and lowly.</hi> Matth. 21.5. Matth. 11.29. <hi>Take my yoak, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi> The meek <hi>Moses,</hi> could not bear the provocations of the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.12. but Christ bears them all. <hi>He carries the Lambs in his arms, and gently leads them that be with young.</hi> Esa. 42.11. He is one that can have compassion upon the ignorant, and them that are out of the way.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, Again, <hi>Sweet peace, and tranquility of soul, is the priviledge of the Subjects of this Kingdom.</hi> For this Kingdom
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54346:123"/>
                     <hi>consisteth in Peace and Ioy in the Holy-Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14.17. And till souls come under his Scepter, they shall never find peace. <hi>Come unto me ye that are weary I will give you rest.</hi> Yet, do not mistake, I say not they have all actual peace, at all times. No, they often break that peace by sin; but they have the root of peace: the ground-work and cause of peace. If they have not peace: yet they have that which is convertible into peace, at any time. They also are in a state of peace, Rom. 5.11. <hi>being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> This is feast every day.

Indeed the Kingdom of grace, doth but breed up children for the Kingdom of glory. And to speak as the thing is, it's the Kingdom of Heaven here begun. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them is not <hi>specifical,</hi> but only <hi>gradual,</hi> and therefore this as well as that bears the name of the Kingdom of Heaven.

                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, the work I would now engage thy soul in, is the same that Jesus Christ will throughly and effectually do in the great day. Then will he gather out of his Kingdom every thing that offends, separate the tares, and wheat. Divide the whole world into two ranks, or grand divisions; how many divisions and sub-divisions soever there be in it now. it neerly concerns thee therefore to know who is Lord and King in thy soul. To help thee in this great work make use of the following hints, for I cannot fully prosecute these things as I would.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First,<note place="margin">O how many of us would have Christ divided in two halves, that we might take the half of him only, and take his office, Jesus, and Salvation; but <hi>Lord</hi> is a cumbersom word, and to obey, and work out our own Salvation, and perfect holiness, is the cumbersom, and stormy northside of Christ, and that we eschew and shift off.</note> 
                        <hi>To whom do you yield your obedience? His Subjects and servants ye are to whom ye obey.</hi> Rom. 6.16. It's but a mockery to give Christ the empty titles of Lord and King, whilst ye give your real service to sin, and Satan. What is this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54346:124"/>
but like the Jews to bow the knee to him, and say hail Master and crucifie him? <hi>Then are ye his disciples, if ye do whatsoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you.</hi> Joh. 15.14. He that is Christs servant in <hi>jest,</hi> shall be damned in <hi>earnest.</hi> Christ doth not complement with you. His Pardons, Promises, Salvations are real; O let your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be so too. Let it be sincere, and universal obedience; this will evidence your unfeigned subjection to Christ. Do not dare to enterprize any thing, till you know Christs pleasure and Will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Enquire of Christ, as <hi>David</hi> did of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.9, 10, 11. Lord may I do this, or that, or shall I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear? I beseech thee tell thy Servant.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>Have you the power of godliness, or a form of it only?</hi> There be many that do but trifle in Religion, and play about the skirts and borders of it: spending their time about je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june and barren controversies; but as to the power of Religion and life of Godliness, which consists in communion with God in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ordinances, which promotes holiness; and mortifies their Lusts, they concern not themselves about these things. But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.20. It is not meat and drink, (that is, dry disputes about meats and drinks) <hi>but righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy-Ghost, for he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God; and approved of men.</hi> Rom. 14.17, 18.

                     <item>Thirdly, <hi>Have ye the special saving knowledge of Christ?</hi> All his Subjects are translated out of the Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 13. The Devil that ruleth over you in the daies of your ignorance, is called <hi>the Ruler of the darkness of this world.</hi> His Subjects are all blind: else he could never rule them. Assoon as their eyes be opened, they run out of his Kingdom. And there is no retaining them in subjection to him any longer. O enquire then, whether you are brought out of darkness, into his marvelous light.

misery by sin? Thirsting vehemently after Christ, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness? Striving continually for an heart to believe, and close with Chirst? This will evidence you indeed to be translated out of the Kingdom of darkness, into the Kingdom of Christ.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, <hi>With whom do ye delightfully associate your selves, who are your chosen Companions?</hi> Ye may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the Subjects of one Kingdom, be in another Kings dominions; they love to be together with their own Countrymen; rather than the natives of the place: so do the servants of Christ. They are a company of themselves, as it is said, Act. 4.23. <hi>They went to their own Company.</hi> I know the Subjects of both Kingdoms are here ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and we cannot avoid the company of sinners, except we go out of the world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. But yet all your delights should be in the Saints, and in the excellent of the earth. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3.</item>
                     <item>Fifthly, <hi>Do ye live Holy and Righteous lives?</hi> If not, you may claim interest in Christ as your King; but he will never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your claim. <hi>The Scepter of his Kingdom is a Scepter of Righteousness.</hi> Psal. 45.6. If ye oppress, go beyond, and cheat your brethren, and yet call your selves Christs Subjects; what greater reproach can ye study to cast upon him? What, is Christ the King of Cheats? Doth he patronize such things as these? No, no, pull off your vizards, and fall into your own places; you belong to another Prince, and not to Christ.</item>

This effect of that power that raised their hearts to believe in Christ; is here compared with that other glorious effect of it, even the raising of Christ himself from the dead. Both these owe themselves to the same efficient cause. It raised Christ from a low estate, even from the dead, to an high, a very high and glorious state: to be the head both of the <hi>world,</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi>: the head of the world, by way of dominion; the head of the Church, by way of union, and special influence: ruling the world for the good of his people in it. <hi>He gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>dignity</hi> and authority committed to Christ. <hi>He hath put all things under his feet:</hi> which implies full, ample, and absolute <hi>dominion</hi> in him; and <hi>subjection</hi> in them over whom he raigns.

               <p>Joh. 17.2. <hi>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life, to as many as thou hast given him.</hi> Hence it comes to pass, that <hi>all things work together for good, to them that love God; to them that are the called according to purpose,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
               <p>That Jesus Christ hath a providential influence upon all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this world, is evident both from <hi>Scripture assertions,</hi> and <hi>rational observations,</hi> made upon the actings of things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Chap. of Ezek.</hi> contains an admirable Scheme or draught of providence. There you see how all the wheels, that is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and revolutions here on earth, are guided by the spirit that is in them. And <hi>vers.</hi> 26. it's all run up into the supream cause. There you find one like the son of man, which is Jesus Christ, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the throne, and giving forth orders from thence, for the government of all. And if it were not so, how is it, that there are such strong combinations, and predispositions of persons and things to such ends and issues, without any communications of counsels, or holding of intelligence with one another? as in <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and innumerable more instances have appeared? Certainly if ten men from several places should all meet at one place, and about one business, without any fore-appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themselves; it would argue their motions were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly over-ruled by some invisible Agent. How is it that such marvailous effects are produced in the world, by causes that carry no proportion to them? <hi>Amos</hi> 5.9. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. And as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the most apt and likely means are rendred wholly ineffectual? <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.16. In a word, if Christ have no such providential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux how are his people in all ages preserved in the midst of so many millions of potent and malitious enemies; amongst whom they live, as sheep in the midst of wolves? <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.3. How is it that the bush burns, and yet is not consumed? <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2.</p>

It's a considerable part of Christs glory to have a whole world of creatures oweing their beings and hourly conservations to him. The parts of the world are not coupled and fastned together as the parts of an house, whose beams are pinn'd and nail'd to each other; but rather as several rings of Iron, which hang together by the vertue of a loadstone. This goodly fabrick was raised to the foundation, when sin entred, and had tumbled into everlasting confusion, had not Christ stept in to shore up the reeling world. For the sakes of his redeemed that inhabit it, he doth, and will prop it by his omnipotent power. And when he hath gathered all his Elect out of it, into the Kingdom above; then will he set fire to the four quarters of it, and it shall lye in white ashes. Mean while, he is <hi>given for a Covenant to the people, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the earth.</hi> Isai. 49.8.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He <hi>permits</hi> and suffers the worst of creatures in his dominion to <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> as they do. <hi>The deceived, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver are his.</hi> Job. 12.16. Even those that fight against Christ, and his people, receive both power, and permission from him. Say not that it's unbecoming the most holy, to permit such evils which he could prevent if he pleased. For as he permits no more than he will overrule to his praise; so that very permission of his, is holy, and just. Christs working is not confounded with the creatures. Pure Sun-beams are not tainted by the noisom vapours of the dunghil on which they shine. His holiness hath no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with their iniquities: nor are their transgressions at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by his permissions of them. <hi>He is a rock, his work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>; but <hi>they have corrupted themselves.</hi> Deut. 32.4, 5. This holy permission, is but the withholding of those restraints from their Lusts; and denying those common assistances which he is no

way bound to give them. Acts 14.16. <hi>He suffered all nations to walk in their own waies.</hi> And yet should he permit sinful creatures to act out all the wickedness that is in their hearts, there would neither remain peace, nor order in the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He powerfully <hi>restrains</hi> creatures by the bridle of providence, from the commission of those things to which their hearts are propense enough.<note place="margin">

And truly this is one of the glorious mysteries of providence, which amazes the serious and considerate soul. To see the spirit of a creature fully set to do mischief. Power enough as one would think, in his hand to do it, and a door of opportunity standing open for it; and yet the effect strangely hindred. The strong propensions of the Will are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly checkt, as in the case of <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31.24. or a <hi>diversion</hi> and rub is strangely cast in their way; as in the case of <hi>Senacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi> 2 King. 19.7, 8. So that <hi>their hands cannot perform their enterprises. Iulian</hi> had two great designs before him, one was to conquer the <hi>Persians,</hi> the other to root out the <hi>Galileans</hi>; as he by way of contempt called the Christians: but he will begin with the <hi>Persians</hi> first, and then make a sacrifice of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to his Idols. He doth so, and perishes in the first attempt. O the wisdom of providence!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>limits</hi> the creatures in their acting, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing them their boundaries, and lines of liberty; to which they may, but beyond it cannot go. Rev. 2.10. <hi>Fear none of those things that ye shall suffer, behold the Devil shall cast some of you into prison; and ye shall have tribulation for ten daies.</hi> They would have cast them into their graves, but it shall only be into prisons: they would have stretcht out their hands upon them all, no, but only some of them shall be exposed. They would have kept them there perpetually, no, it must be but for ten daies. Ezek. 22.6. <hi>Behold the Princes of Israel were in thee, every one to their power to shed blood.</hi> They went as far as they had <hi>power</hi> to go, not as far as they had <hi>will</hi> to go. Four hundred and thirty years were determined upon the people of God in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and then, <hi>even in that very night,</hi> God brought them forth; for then <hi>the time of the promise was come,</hi> Acts 7.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:54346:128"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Lord Jesus providentially <hi>protects</hi> his people, amidst a world of enemies, and dangers. It was Christ that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the flaming bush: and preserved it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consumed. The bush signified the people of God in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The fire flaming on it, the exquisite sufferings they there endured. The safety of the bush amidst the flames, the Lords admirable care and protection of his poor suffering ones. None so tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful as Christ. <hi>As birds flying, so he defends</hi> Jerusalem, Isai. 31.5. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as they fly swiftly towards their nests, crying when their young are in danger; so will the Lord preserve his. They are <hi>preserved in Christ Iesus,</hi> Jude 1. as <hi>Noah</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were in the <hi>Ark.</hi> Hear how a Worthy of our own expresses himself upon this point.</p>

                        <hi>Owen</hi> in his indwelling sin. <hi>p.</hi> 200.</note>That we are at peace in our houses, at rest in our beds; that we have any quiet in our enjoyments, is from hence alone. Whose person would not be defiled or destroyed? whose habitation would not be ruined? whose blood almost would not be shed, if wicked men had power to perpetrate all their conceived sin? It may be the ruine of some of us hath been conceived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times. We are beholding to this providence of obstructing sin, for our lives, our families, our estates, our liberties, and whatsoever is or may be dear to us. For may we not say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the Psalmist, Psal. 57.4. <hi>My soul is among Lyons, and I lye even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears, and their tongue a sharp sword.</hi> And how is the deliverance of men contrived from such persons? Psal. 58.6. <hi>God breaks their teeth in their mouths, even the great teeth of the young Lyons.</hi> He keeps this fire from burning, — some he cuts off and destroys. Some he cuts short in their power. Some he deprives of the instruments whereby alone they can work. Some he prevents of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired opportunities, or diverts by other objects for their lusts. And oftentimes causeth them to spend them among themselves, one upon another. We may say therefore with the Psalmist, Psal. 104.24. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works? in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hast thou made them all, the earth is full of thy riches.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He <hi>punishes</hi> the evil doers; and repaies by providence into their own lap the mischief they do, or but intend to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that fear him. <hi>Pharaoh, Senacharib,</hi> both the <hi>Iulians,</hi> and innumerable more are the lasting monuments of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54346:128"/>
retribution. 'Tis true, <hi>a sinner may do evil an hundred times, and his daies be prolonged:</hi> but oft-times God hangs up some eminent sinners in chains, as spectacles, and warnings to others. Many a heavy blow hath providence given the enemies of God, which they were never able to claw off. Christ rules, and that with a rod of Iron, in the midst of his enemies. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly</hi> and Lastly, He <hi>rewards</hi> by providence the services done to him, and his people. Out of this treasure of providence God repays oftentimes those that serve him, and that with an hundred fold reward now in this life. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.29. This active vigilant providence hath its eye upon all the wants, straights and troubles of the creatures; but especially upon such as Religion brings us unto. What huge volumes of experiences might the people of God write upon this subject? And what a pleasant Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would it be to read the strange, constant, wonderful and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected actings of providence for them that have left themselves to its care?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shall next enquire how Jesus Christ administers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this providential Kingdom?</p>
               <p>And here I must take notice of the <hi>means</hi> by which, and the <hi>manner</hi> in which he doth it. The means or instruments he uses in the governing the Providential Kingdom, (for he cannot be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally present with us himself) are either <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Men</hi>; the <hi>Angels</hi> are <hi>ministring creatures sent forth by him for the good of them that shall be heirs of Salvation.</hi> Heb. 1.14. <hi>Luther</hi> tells us they have two offices, <hi>superius canere, &amp; inferius vigilare,</hi> to sing above, and watch beneath. These do us many invisible offices of love. They have dear and tender respects and love for the Saints. To them God as it were puts forth his children to nurse, and they are tenderly careful of them whilst they live, and bring them home in their arms to their Father when they die. And as Angels, so <hi>Men</hi> are the servants of providence: Yea, bad men as well as good. <hi>Cyrus</hi> on that account is called Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: they fulfil his will, whilst they are prosecuting their own lusts. <hi>The earth shall help the woman,</hi> Rev. 12.16. But good men delight to serve providence: they, and the <hi>Angels</hi> are fellow-servants in one house, and to one master. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. Yea, there is not a creature in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell, but Jesus Christ can Providentially use it, and serve his ends, and promote his designs by it. But whatever the Instrument be Christ uses;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54346:129"/>
of this we may be certain, that his Providential working is Holy, Judicious, Soveraign, Profound, Irresistible, Harmonious, and to the Saints peculiar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It's holy. Though he permits, limits, orders, and overrules many unholy persons and actions; yet he still works like himself; most holily, and purely throughout. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</hi> Psal. 145.17. It's easier to separate light from a Sun-beam, than holiness from the works of God. The best of men cannot escape sin in their most holy actions. They cannot touch, but are defiled. But no sin cleaves to God, whatever he hath to do about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christs providential working is not only most pure and holy; but also most wise, and Judicious. Ezek. 1.20. <hi>The wheels are full of eyes:</hi>

                  </note> they are not moved by <hi>a blind impetus,</hi> but in deep counsel and wisdom. And indeed the wisdom of providence manifests it self principally in the choice of such states for the people of God, as shall most effectually promote their eternal happiness. And herein it goes quite beyond our understandings, and comprehensions. It makes that medicinal, and salutiferous, which we judge as destructive to our comfort and good,<note place="margin">

I remember it is a note of <hi>Suarez,</hi> speaking of the felicity of the other world; then (saith he) the blessed shall see in God, all things and circumstances pertaining to them, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently accommodated, and attempered. Then they shall see that the crossing of their desires was the saving of their souls. And that they had, if they had not perished. The most wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence looks beyond us. It eyes the end, and suits all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and not to our fond desires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Providence of Christ is most supream, and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. <hi>Whatsoever he pleaseth, that he doth, in Heaven, and Earth; and in all places.</hi> Psal. 135.6. <hi>He is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi>

The greatest Monarchs on Earth, are but as little bits of clay. As the worms of the earth to him. They all depend on him.

               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:54346:129"/>Fourthly Providence is <hi>profound</hi> and inscrutable. The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ are <hi>as the great deeps, and his footsteps are not known,</hi> Psal. 36 6. There are hard texts in the <hi>works,</hi> as well as in the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The wisest heads have been at a loss, in interpreting some providences. <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Iob.</hi> 21.7. The Angels had the hands of a man under their wings. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.8. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) They wrought secretly, and mysteriously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Per montes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligat arcanum Dei consilium.</hi> Calv.</note> Providence is irresistible in its designs and motions, for all providences are but the fulfillings and accomplishments of Gods immutable decrees, Eph. 1.11. <hi>He works all things according to the counsel of his own will.</hi> Hence <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.1. The Instruments by which God executed his wrath, are called <hi>Chariots coming from betwixt two mountains of brass.</hi>

                  <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the firm and immutable decrees of God. When the <hi>Iews</hi> put Christ to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did but do that <hi>the hand and counsel of God had before determined to be done.</hi> Acts 4.28. So that none can oppose, or resist Providence. I will work, and who shall lett. <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Providences of Christ are <hi>Harmonious.</hi> There are secret chains, and invisible connexions betwixt the works of Christ. We know not how to reconcile promises, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences together: nor yet providences one with another: but certainly they all <hi>work together,</hi> Rom. 8.28. as adjuvant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or con-causes standing under, and working by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the first cause. He doth not do and undo. Destroy by one providence, what he built by another. But look as all seasons of the year, the nipping frosts, as well as halcion days of summer, do all conspire and conduce to the harvest; so it is in providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Lastly, The providences of Christ <hi>work in a special and peculiar way, for the good of the Saints.</hi> His providential, is subordinated to his Spiritual Kingdom. <hi>He is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that believe.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10. These only have the blessing of providence. Things are so laid and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as that their eternal good shall be promoted and secured by all that Christ doth.</p>

                     <hi>Eye Christ in all the events of providence; see his hand in all that befals you, whether it be evil, or good. The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</hi> Psal. 111.2. How much good might we get, by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the good, or evil that befals us throughout our course!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> In all the evils of trouble and affliction that befal you, eye Jesus Christ in it all. And set your hearts to the study of these four things in affliction.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Study <hi>his Soveraignty and Dominion.</hi> For he creates and forms them. They rise not out of the dust: nor do they befal you casually. But, he raises them up, and gives them their commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Jer. 18.11. <hi>Behold I create evil, and</hi> devise a device <hi>against you.</hi> He elects the instrument of your trouble. He makes the rod as afflictive as he pleaseth. He orders the continuance, and end of your troubles. And they will not cease to be afflictive to you, till Christ say leave off, it is enough. The Centurion wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered this, when He told him, Luk. 7.8. <hi>I have souldiers under me, and I say to one go, and he goeth; to another come and he cometh:</hi> meaning, that as his souldiers were at his beck and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, so diseases were at Christs beck, to come, and go, as he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>Study the wisdom of Christ in the contrivance of your troubles.</hi> And his wisdom shines out many waies in them. It's
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54346:132"/>
evident in choosing such <hi>kinds</hi> of troubles for you. This, and not that; because this is more apt to work upon, and purge out the corruption that most predominates in you. In the <hi>decrees</hi> of your troubles. Suffering them to work to such an height, else not reach their end; but no higher, least they overwhelm you.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, <hi>Study the tenderness and compassions of Christ over his afflicted.</hi> O think if the Devil had but the mixing of my cup, how much more bitter would he make it! There would not be one drop of mercy, no, not of sparing mercy in it, which is the lowest of all sorts of mercy. But here is much mercy mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my troubles. There is mercy in this, that it is no worse. Am I afflicted, <hi>it's the Lords mercy, I am not consumed.</hi> Lam. 3.22. it might have been Hell, as well as this. There is mercy in his supports under it. Others have, and I might have been left to sink and perish under my burdens. <hi>Mercy,</hi> in deliverance out of it. This might have been everlasting darkness, that should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had a morning. O the tenderness of Christ over his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted!</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, <hi>Study the love of Christ to thy soul in affliction.</hi> Did he not love thee, he would not sanctifie a rod to humble or reduce thee: but let thee alone to rot and perish in thy sin. Rev. 3.19. <hi>whom I love, I rebuke and chasten.</hi> This is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of love, to recover thee to thy God, and prevent thy ruine. O what an advantage would it be thus to study Christ, in all your evils that befal you.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Eye and study Christ in all the good you receive from the hand of providence.</hi> Turn both sides of your mercies, and view them in all their lovely circumstances.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Eye them in their suitableness.</hi> How conveniently Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath ordered all things for thee. Thou hast a narrow heart, and a small estate, suitable to it. Hadst thou more of the world, it would be like a large sail, to a little boat, which would quickly pull thee under water. Thou hast that which is most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thee, of all conditions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Eye the seasonableness of thy mercies; how they are timed to an hour.</hi> Providence brings forth all its fruits in due season.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eye the peculiar nature of thy mercies.</hi> Others have common, thou special ones. Others have but a single, thou a double sweetness in thy enjoyments: one natural from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54346:132"/>
of it, another spiritual from the way in which, and end for which it comes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Observe the order in which providence sends you your mercies.</hi> See how one is linked strangely to another; and is a door to let in many. Sometimes one mercy is introductive to a thousand.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and Laslty, <hi>Observe the constancy of them; they are new every morning.</hi> Lam. 3.23. How assiduously doth God visit thy soul and body! Think with thy self, if there were but a suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the care of Christ for one hour, that hour would be thy ruine. Thousands of evils stand round about thee, watching when Christ will but remove his eye from thee; that they may rush in, and devour thee.</p>
                  <p>Could we thus study the providence of Christ in all the good, and evil that befalls us in the world; then in every state we should be content, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. Then we should never be stopt, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in our way by all that falls out. Then would our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences swell to great volumes, which we might carry to Heaven with us. And then should we answer all Christs ends in every state he brings us into.

            <p>YOU have heard how Christ was invested with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Prophet, Priest and King, for the carrying on the blessed design of our Redemption; the excution of these Offices necessarily required that he should be both deeply <hi>abased,</hi> and highly <hi>exalted.</hi> He cannot as our <hi>Priest</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up himself a Sacrifice to God for us, except he be humbled, and humbled to death. He cannot as a <hi>King</hi> powerfully apply the vertue of that his Sacrifice, except he be exalted, yea, highly exalted. Had he not stooped to the low estate of a man, he had not as a <hi>Priest</hi> had a Sacrifice of his own to offer; as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> he had not been fit to teach us the will of God, so as that we should be able to bear it: as a <hi>King</hi> he had not been a suitable
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54346:133"/>
head to the Church: And had he not been highly exalted, that Sacrifice had not been carried within the vail, before the Lord. Those discoveries of God could not have been <hi>universal, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual</hi> and <hi>abiding.</hi> The Government of Christ could not have secured, protected and defended the Subjects of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The infinite wisdom prospecting all this, ordered that Christ should first be deeply humbled, then highly exalted: both which states of Christ are presented to us by the Apostle in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
            <p>He that intends to build high, lays the foundation deep, and low. Christ must have a distinct glory in Heaven, transcending that of Angels and men. (For the Saints will know him from all others by his glory, as the Sun is known from the lesser Stars.) And as he must be exalted infinitely above them, so he must first, in order thereunto be humbled and abased as much below them. <hi>His form was mar'd more than any mans, and his visage more than the Sons of men.</hi> The ground colours are a deep sable, which afterward are laid on with all the splendor and glory of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Method requires that we first speak to this state of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Real,</hi> he did not personate a humbled man, nor act the part of one in a debased state, but was really and indeed humbled; and that not only before men, but God. As man he was humbled really, as God in respect of his manifestive glory. And as it was real, so also <hi>voluntary.</hi> It is not said he was humbled, but <hi>he humbled

himself.</hi> He was willing to stoop to this low and abject state, for us. And indeed the voluntariness of his humiliation, made it most acceptable to God, and singularly commends the love of Christ to us.<note place="margin">

It is not such an apparition of Christ in the shape of a man, that is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54346:134"/>
here intended: but his true and real assumption of our nature, which was a special part of his Humiliation: as will appear by the following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Christ was a most wonderful humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of him, in as much as thereby he is brought into the ranck, and order of creatures, who is over all, God blessed for ever. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. This is the astonishing mysterie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. that God should be manifest in the flesh. That the eternal God should truly and properly be called the <hi>man</hi> Christ Jesus. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. It was a wonder to <hi>Solomon</hi> that God would dwell in that stately and magnificent Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> 2 Chron. 6.18. <hi>But will God in very deed, dwell with men on the earth! behold the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built?</hi> But it's a far greater wonder, that God should dwell in a body of flesh, and pitch his Tabernacle with us. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. It would have seemed a rude blasphemy, had not the Scriptures plainly revealed it; to have thought, or spoken of the eternal God, as born in time. The worlds Creator, as a Creature. The Ancient of daies, as an Infant of daies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heathen Chaldeans</hi> told the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> that <hi>the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gods is not with flesh.</hi> Dan. 2.11. But now God not only dwells with flesh, but dwells in flesh. Yea, was made flesh: and dwelt among us.</p>
               <p>For the Sun to fall from its Sphear, and be degraded into a wandring Attom. For an Angel to be turned out of Heaven, and be converted into a silly fly, or worm, had been no such great abasement; for they were but Creatures before, and so they should abide still, though in an inferiour order or species of creatures. The distance betwixt the highest, and lowest species of creatures, is but a finite distance. The Angel and the worm dwell not so far assunder. But for the infinite glorious Creator of all things, to become a creature, is a mystery exceeding all humane understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The distance betwixt God, and the highest order of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is an infinite distance. He is said to <hi>humble himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things that are done in Heaven.</hi> What a humiliation then is it, to behold the things in the lower world! But to be born into it, and become a man! Great indeed is the mysterie of Godliness. Behold (saith the Prophet) Isai. 40.15, 18. <hi>The nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the ballance; he taketh up the Isles as a very little thing.

All nations before him are as nothing, and they are accounted to him less than nothing and vanity.</hi> If indeed this great and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Majesty will himself stoop to the state and condition of a creature, we may easily believe that being once a creature, he would expose himself to hunger, thirst, shame, spetting, death, or any thing, but sin. For that once being man, he should endure any of these things is not so wonderful, as that he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man. This was the low stoop, a deep abasement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was a marvelous humiliation to the Son of God, not only to become a creature, but an inferiour creature, a man, and not an Angel. Had he took the Angelical nature, though it had been a wonderful abasement to him; yet he had staid (if I may so speak) nearer his own home, and been somewhat liker to a God than now he appeared, when he dwelt with us.

                  <hi>equal to the Angels.</hi> Luk. 20.36. As man is nothing to God, so he is much inferiour to the Angels. So much below them, that he is not able to bear the sight of an Angel, though in an humane shape, rendring himself as familiarly as may be to him. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.22. When the <hi>Psalmist</hi> had contemplated the Heavens, and viewed the Coelestial bodies; the glorious Luminaries, the Moon, and Stars which God had made: he cries out Psal. 8.5. <hi>what is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou visitest him!</hi> Take man at his best, when he came a perfect and pure piece out of his Makers hand, in the state of innocency; yet he was inferiour to Angels. They alwaies bare the image of God in a more eminent degree, than man, as being wholly spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual substances, and so more lively representing God, than man could do; whose noble soul is immerst in matter, and closed up in flesh and blood: yet Christ chooseth this inferior order, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of creatures, and passeth by the Angelical nature. Heb. 2.16. <hi>He took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:54346:135"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Moreover, Jesus Christ did not only neglect the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and assume the humane nature; but he also assumed the humane nature, after sin had blotted the original glory of it, and withered up the beauty, and excellency thereof. For he came not in our nature before the fall, whilst as yet its glory was fresh in it; but came as the Apostle speaks, Rom. 8.3. <hi>in the likeness of sinful flesh, (i. e.)</hi> in flesh that had the marks, and miserable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and consequents of sin upon it. I say not that Christ assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sinful flesh, or flesh really defiled by sin. That which was born of the Virgin was an holy thing. For by the power of the highest, (whether by way of manufacture, as some; or the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical command and ordination of the Holy-Ghost, as others; or by his benediction and blessing, I here dispute not) that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the body of Christ was to be formed, was so sanctified that no taint or spot of original pollution remained in it. But yet though it had not intrinsecal native uncleanness in it, it had the effects of sin upon it; yea, it was attended with the whole troop of humane infirmities, that sin at first let into our common nature. Such as hunger, thirst, weariness, pain, mortality, and all those natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weaknesses and evils that clog our miserable natures, and make them groan from day to day under them.</p>
               <p>By reason whereof, though he was not a sinner, yet he looked like one: and they that saw and conversed with him, took him for a sinner, seeing all these effects of sin upon him. In these things he came as near to sin, as his holiness could admit. O what a stoop was this! to be made in the likeness of flesh, though the innocent flesh of <hi>Adam,</hi> hed been much; but to be made in the likeness of sinful flesh, the flesh of sinners, rebels; flesh though not <hi>defiled,</hi> yet miserably <hi>defaced</hi> by sin: Oh what is this! and who can declare it! And indeed, if he will be a Mediator of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, it was necessary it should be so. It behoved him of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the same nature that sinned, to make satisfaction in it. Yea, these senseless infirmities were necessary to be assumed with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for as much as his bearing them was a part of his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and went to make up satisfaction for us. Moreover, by them our high-priest was qualified from his own experience, and filled with tender compassion to us.</p>
               <p>But oh the admirable condescentions of a Saviour, to take such a nature! to put on such a garment when thread-bare and ragged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did this become the Son of God to wear? Oh grace unsearchable!</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And yet more, by this his incarnation he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled, in as much, as this his incarnation so vailed, clouded, and disguised him; that during the time he lived here, he looked not like himself, a God; but as a poor sorry, contemptible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the eyes of the world; they scorned him. <hi>This fellow said,</hi> Matth. 26.61. Hereby <hi>he made himself of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.6. it blotted his honour and reputation. By reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he lost all esteem and honour from those that saw him, Matth. 13.55. <hi>is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> To see a poor man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling up and down the Country, in hunger, thirst, weariness, attended with a company of poor men; one of his company bearing the bag, and that which was put therein. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.29. Who that had seen him, would ever have thought this had been the Creator of the world; the Prince of the Kings of the Earth? <hi>He was despised, and we esteemed him not.</hi> Now which of you is there that would not rather choose to endure much misery as a man, than to be degraded into a contemptible worm, that every body treads upon, and no man regards it? Christ looked so unlike a God in this habit, that he was scarce allowed the name of a man; a <hi>worm</hi> rather than a <hi>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And think with your selves now, was not this astonishing self-denial? that he who from eternity had his Fathers smiles, and honours; he that from the creation was adored, and worshipped by Angels, as their God; must now become a footstool for every Miscreant to tread on; and not to have the respects due to a man! sure this was a deep abasement. It was a black cloud that for so many years darkned, and shut up his manifestative glory that it could not shine out to the world; only some weak raies of the Godhead shone to some few eyes, through the chinks of his humanity, as the clouded Sun sometimes opens a little, and casts some faint beams, and is muffled up again. <hi>We saw his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as of the only begotten Son,</hi> but the world knew him not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. If a Prince walk up and down in a disguise, he must expect no more honour than a mean Subject. This was the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, this disguise made him contemptible, and an object of scorn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Again, Christ was greatly humbled by his incarnation, in as much as thereby he was put at a distance from his Father, and that ineffable joy and pleasure he eternally had with him. Think not Reader, but the Lord Jesus lived at a high and unimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54346:136"/>
rate of communion with God, while he walked here in flesh; but yet to live by faith as Christ here did, is one thing; and to be in the bosom of God, as he was before, is another thing. To have the ineffable delights of God perpetuated and continued to him, without one moments interruption from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is one thing; and to have his soul sometimes filled with the joy of the Lord, and then all overcast with clouds of wrath again; to cry, and God not hear, as he complains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.2. nay, to be reduced to such an ebb of spiritual comforts, as to be forced to cry out so bitterly, as he did, Psal. 22.1. <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> This was a thing Christ was very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, till he was found in habit as a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and Lastly, It was a great stoop and condescention of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Christ, if he would become a man, to take his nature from such obscure parents; and choose such a low and contemptible state in this world, as he did. He will be born, but not of the blood of Nobles, but of a poor woman in <hi>Israel,</hi> espoused to a Carpenter: yea, and that too, under all the disadvantages imaginable. Not in his Mothers house, but an Inn; yea in the stable too. He suited all to that abased state he was designed for: and came among us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the humbling circumstances imaginable. <hi>You know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>how that though he was rich, yet, for our sakes he became poor,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. And thus I have shewn you some few particulars of Christs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in his incarnation. Next we shall infer somethings from it, that are practical.</p>

                  <p>It is not so much to see all the Stars in Heaven overcast, as to see one Sun eclipsed. The greater Christ was, the greater was

                        </gap>, a Saviour, a Saviour; that they made the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavens ring again with their acclamations; and the very Birds fell down astonisht. And all that night the poor <hi>Graecians</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of musick, and songs of praise, danced and sang about his Tent; extolling him as a God that had delivered them. But surely you have more reason to be exalting the Author of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who at a dearer rate hath freed you from a more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bondage. O ye that have escaped the eternal wrath of God, by the humiliation of the Son of God, extol your great Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and for ever celebrate his praises.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, <hi>By acting your faith on him, for whatsoever lies in the promises yet unaccomplished.</hi> In this you see the great and most difficult promise fulfilled, Gen. 3.15. <hi>The seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall break the Serpents head.</hi> Which contained this mercy of Christs incarnation for us in it; I say you see this fulfilled, and seeing that which was most improbable and difficult is come to pass; even Christ come in the flesh: methinks our unbelief should be strangled for ever, and all other promises the more easily believed. It seemed much more improbable, and impossible to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that God should become a man, and stoop to the condition of a creature; than being a man, to perform all that good which his incarnation and death procured. Unbelief usually argues from one of these two grounds, can God do this? or will God do that? It's questioning either his <hi>power,</hi> or his <hi>will</hi>: but after this, let it cease for ever to cavil against either. His power to save should never be questioned by any, that know what sufferings and infinite bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens he supported in our nature. And surely his willingness to save, should never be put to a question, by any that consider how low he was content to stoop for our sakes.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, By <hi>drawing nigh to God with delight through the vail of Christs flesh.</hi> Heb. 10.19.20.

               <p>The Humiliation of Christ was proposed to us under the three general heads or branches, of his Humiliation in his <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> his Humiliation in his <hi>life,</hi> and his Humiliation in his <hi>death.</hi> How he was humbled by Incarnation, hath been opened above, in the eighteenth <hi>Sermon.</hi> How he was humbled in his life, is the design of this Sermon: yet expect not that I should give you here an exact History of the life of Christ. The Scriptures speak but little of the private part of his life; and it is not my design to dilate upon all the memorable passages that the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists (those faithful Narrators of the life of Christ) have preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for us; but only to observe and improve those more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble particulars in his life, wherein especially he was humbled: and such are these that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Lord Jesus was humbled in his very Infancy, by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Circumcision according to the Law. For being of the stock of <hi>Israel,</hi> he was to undergo the Ceremonies, and submit to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances belonging to that people; and thereby to put an end to them; for so it became him, to fulfil all Righteouness. Luk. 2.21. <hi>And when eight daies were accomplished for the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Child, his name was called Iesus.</hi> Hereby the Son of God was greatly humbled, especially in these two respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In that hereby he obliged himself to keep the whole Law, though he were the Law-maker.<note place="margin">

And he that is a debtor in <hi>duty,</hi> to keep the whole Law, quickly becomes a debtor in regard of <hi>penalty,</hi> not being able to keep any part of it. Christ therefore coming as our surety, to pay both those debts; the debt of duty, and the debt of penalty
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54346:141"/>
to the Law; he by his circumcision obliges himself to pay the whole debt of duty, by fulfilling all Righteousness; and though his obedience to it was so exact and perfect, that he contracted no debt of penalty for any transgression of his own: yet he obliges himself to pay that debt of penalty we had contracted; by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the pains due to transgressors. This was that intollerable yoak that none were able to bear but Christ. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. And it was no small abasure of Christ, to bind himself to the Law as a Subject made under it. For he was the Law-giver, above all Law; and herein that Soveraignty of a God, (one of the choice flowers in the Crown of Heaven) was obscured and vailed, by his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hereby he was represented to the world, not only as a <hi>Subject,</hi> but also as a <hi>Sinner.</hi> For though he was pure and holy, yet this ordinance passing upon him, seemed to imply as if corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had indeed been in him; which must be cut off by mortification.

Now this being the end of God in the institution of this ordinance, for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ordinary seed; Christ in his infancy by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, did not only vail his Soveraignty, by subjection: but was also represented as a sinner to the world, though most holy and pure in himself.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ was humbled by persecution, and that in the very morning of his life. He was banisht almost as soon as born. Matth. 2.13. <hi>Flee into</hi> Aegypt (saith the Angel to <hi>Ioseph</hi>) <hi>and be thou there until I bring thee word, for</hi> Herod <hi>will seek the young child to destroy him.</hi> Ungrateful <hi>Herod,</hi> was this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for a Saviour? what, raise the Country against him, as if a <hi>destroyer,</hi> rather than a <hi>Saviour</hi> had landed upon the coast? what, deny him the protection of those Laws under which he was born, and that before he had broken the least punctilio of them?
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54346:141"/>
the child of a beggar may claim the benefit and protection of Law, as his birthright; and must the Son of God be denied it! But herein he fulfilled the Scriptures, whilst venting his own lusts. For so it was foretold, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.15. And this early persecution, was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely hinted, in the title of the 22 <hi>Psalm,</hi> that psalm which looks rather like an <hi>History</hi> of the new, than a prophecy of the old Testament. For as it contains a most exact description of Christs sufferings, so it's fitted with a most suitable Title. <hi>To the chief Musitian Ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And no doubt but where such dogs scent and wind the Spirit of Christ in any; they would pursue them also to destruction, did not a gratious providence rate them off.

A chast woman would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it no common misery to be dog'd up and down and sollicited by some vile Russian, though there were no danger of defilement.</p>
               <p>A man would account it no small unhappiness to be shut up five or six weeks together with the Devil; though appearing in an humane shape, and to hear no language but that of Hell spoken all that time; and the more holy the man is, the more would he be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted to hear such blasphemies malignantly spet upon the holy and reverent name of God; much more to be solicited by the Devil, to joyn with him in it: this I say would be accounted no small misery for a man to undergo. How great an Humiliation then must it be to the great God, to be humbled to this! to see a slave of his house, setting upon himself the Lord. His Jailor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take him prisoner, if he can. A base apostate Spirit, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to attempt such things as these upon him. Surely this was a deep abasement to the Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our blessed Lord Jesus was yet more humbled in his life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> than all this, and that that by his own <hi>sympathy</hi> with others,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54346:143"/>
under all the burdens that made them groan. For he much more than <hi>Paul</hi> could say, <hi>who is afflicted and I burn not?</hi> He lived all his time as it were in an Hospital, among the sick, and wounded. And so tender was his heart, that every groan for sin, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the effects of sin pierced him so, that it was truly said, <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bare our sicknesses, and took our infirmities.</hi> Matth. 8.16, 17. It was spoken upon the occasion of some poor creatures that were possessed by the Devil, and brought to him to be dispossessed. It's said of him, Joh. 11.33. <hi>That when he saw</hi> Mary <hi>weeping, and the</hi> Jews <hi>also weeping which came with her; he groaned in the Spirit, and was troubled.</hi> And verse 35. <hi>Iesus wept</hi>: yes, his heart flowed with pity for them that had not one drop of pity for themselves. Witness his tears spent upon <hi>Ierusalem, Luke</hi> 19.41, 42. He foresaw the misery that was coming, though they neither foresaw, nor feared it. O how it pierced him to think of the calamities hanging over that great City! Yea, he mourned for them, that could not mourn for their own sins. Therefore it's said, Mark 3.5. <hi>He was grieved for the hardness of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts.</hi> So that the commendation of a good Physitian, that he doth as it were die with every patient, was most applicable to our tender-hearted Physitian. This was one of those things that made him a man of sorrows, and acquainted with griefs. For the more holy any is, the more he is grieved and afflicted for the sins of others; and the more tender any man is, the more he is pierced with beholding the miseries that lie upon others. And it is sure, never any heart more holy, or more sensible, tender and compassionate than Christs.</p>

                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Lastly, That which yet helped to humble him lower, was the ungrateful and most base and unworthy entertainment the world gave him. He was not received or treated like a Saviour, but as the vilest of men. One would think that he who came from Heaven, <hi>to give his life a ransom for many.</hi> Matth. 20.28. He that was <hi>not sent to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</hi> Joh. 3.17. He that came <hi>to disolve the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. knock off the chains, <hi>open the prison doors, proclaim liberty to the captives.</hi> Isai. 61.1. I say, when such a Saviour arrived, O with what acclamations of Joy, and demonstrations of thankfulness should he have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? One would have thought they should even kiss the ground he trod upon: but instead of this, he was hated, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.18.

He was <hi>despised</hi> by them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.55. So reproached that he became <hi>the reproach of men,</hi> as who should say, a corner for every one to spet in.

All this was a great abasement to the Son of God, who was not thus treated for a day, or in one place; but all his daies, and in all places. <hi>He endured the contradictions of sinners against himself.</hi> In these particulars I have pointed out to you, something of the humbled life Christ lived in the world.

ones. One adviseth to think seriously on that which is darted sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, and to do by your hearts, as men use to do with young horses, that are apt to start and boggle at every thing in the way; we bring them close to the things they fright at, make them look on them, and smell to them; that time, and better acquaintance with such things, may teach them not to start. Others advise to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions of the thoughts, as much as may be; to think quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. These rules are contrary to one another, and I think signifie but little to the relief of a poor soul, so distressed.</p>
                  <p>The best rule doubtless is that of the Apostle, Eph. 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> Act your faith my friends, upon your tempted Saviour; who passed through Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations before you; and particularly exercise faith on three things in Christs Temptations.</p>

                     </note>This is a different case. True, it is so, and must be so, or else it had signified nothing to your relief. For had Christ been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally defiled, he had not been a fit Mediator for you. Nor could you have had any benefit either by his Temptations or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for you. But he being Tempted, and yet still holy, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burden, and still escaping the defilement of sin, hath not only satisfied for the sins you commit, when tempted; but also got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an experimental sense of the misery of your condition which is in him, (though now in glory) as aspiring of pity and tender compassion to you. Remember, poor Tempted Christian, <hi>the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54346:145"/>
God of peace shall shortly tread Satan under thy feet,</hi> Rom. 16.20. Thou shalt set thy foot on the neck of that enemy. And as soon as both thy feet are over the threshold of glory, thou shalt cast back a smiling look; and say, now Satan do thy worst. Now I am there, where thou canst not come. Mean while, till thou be out of his reach, let me advise thee to go to Jesus Christ, and open the matter to him. Tell him how that base spirit falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee; yea, sets upon thee even in his presence. Intreat him to rebuke and command him off. Beg him to consider thy case, and say, Lord dost not thou remember how thy own heart was once grieved, though not defiled by his assaults. I have grief and guilt together upon me. Ah Lord, I expect pity and help from thee; thou knowest the heart of a stranger, the heart of a poor Tempted one. This is singular relief in this case. O try it.</p>

                  <p>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world; and I come to thee: holy Father, keep through thine own name, those whom thou hast given me; that they may be one, as we are.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE now come to the Last and Lowest step of Christs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, which was in his submitting to Death, even the Death of the Cross. Out of this death of Christ the life of our souls springs up, and in this blood of the Cross, all our mercies swim to us. The blood of Christ runs deep to some eyes. The Judicious Believer sees multitudes, multitudes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable blessings in it. By this Crimson Fountain I resolve to sit down; and concerning the death of Christ, I shall take distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into consideration the <hi>preparations</hi> made for it, the <hi>nature</hi> and quality of it. The <hi>Deportment</hi> and carriage of dying-Jesus. The
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54346:147"/>
               <hi>Funeral-solemnities</hi> with which he was buried. And lastly the <hi>blessed designs, and glorious ends</hi> of his death.</p>
            <p>The preparatives for his death were six. Three on his own part, and three more by his enemies. The preparations made by himself for it, were the solemn <hi>recommendation</hi> of his friends to his Father. The <hi>institution</hi> of a commemorative sign, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate and refresh the memory of his death in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple till he come again. And his <hi>pouring out his soul to God by prayer in the garden,</hi> which was the posture he chose to be found in, when they should apprehend him.</p>
            <p>This Scripture contains the first preparative of Christ for death, whereby he sets his house in order, prays for his people, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses them before he dies. The love of Christ was ever tender and strong to his people, but the greatest manifestations of it were at parting. And this he manifested two waies especially; <hi>viz.</hi> in leaving singular supports, and grounds of comfort with them in his last heavenly Sermon, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.15, 16. and in pouring out his soul most affectionately to the Father for them in this Heavenly Prayer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. In this Prayer he gives them a <hi>Specimen</hi> or Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that his glorious intercession-work, which he was just then going to perform in Heaven for them. Here his heart overflowed, for he was now leaving them, and going to the Father; the last words of a dying man are remarkable, how much more of a dying Saviour? I shall not lanch out into that blessed Ocean of pretious matter contained in this Chapter, but take immediately into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, the words that I have read, wherein I find a weighty petition, strongly followed and set home with many mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We have here <hi>Christs petition,</hi> or request in behalf of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> people. Not only those on the place, but all others that then did, or afterwards should believe on him. And the sum of what he here requests for them is, that his Father would keep them through his name. Where you have both the <hi>mercy,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of attaining it. The <hi>mercy</hi> is to be kept. Keeping implies danger. And there is a double danger obviated in this request; danger in respect of <hi>sin,</hi> and danger in respect of <hi>ruine</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. To both these the people of God lie open in this world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>means</hi> of their preservation from both is the <hi>name, (i. e.)</hi> the power of God. This name of the Lord is that <hi>strange Tower
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54346:148"/>
to which the Righteous flie, and are safe.</hi> Prov. 18.10. Alas, it is not your own strength or wisdom that keeps you, but ye are kept by the mighty power of God. This protecting power of God, doth not however exclude our care and diligence, but implies it; therefore he adds, ye are kept by the mighty power of God, <hi>through faith to Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. God keeps his people, and yet they are to keep themselves in the Love of God, <hi>Iude</hi> 21, to keep their hearts with all diligence. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. This is the sum of the petition.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Arguments with which he urgeth and presses on this request, are drawn partly from <hi>his own condition, I am no more in the world, (i. e.)</hi> I am going to die; within very few hours I shall be separated from them, in regard of my corporal presence. Partly, <hi>from their condition; but these are in the world. (i. e.)</hi> I must leave them in the midst of danger; and partly <hi>from the joint interest that his Father and himself had in them.</hi> Keep those that thou hast given me. With several other most prevalent pleas which in their proper places shall be anon produced, and displaied to illustrate and confirm this pretious truth, which this Scripture affords us.</p>

a prophetical and patriarchical blessing. Not that <hi>Iacob</hi> could bless as God blesses; he could speak the words of blessing, but he knew the effect, the real blessing it self, depended upon God. And though he blessed <hi>authoritatively,</hi> yet not <hi>potestatively, (i. e.)</hi> he could as the mouth of God pronounce blessings, but could not confer them. Thus he blessed his Children, as his Father <hi>Isaack</hi> has also blessed him before he died, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.3. and all these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings were delivered prayerwise.</p>
               <p>Now when Jesus Christ comes to die, he will bless his Children also. And therein will discover how much dear and tender love he had for them: <hi>having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end,</hi> Joh. 13.1. the last Act of Christ in this world, was an act of blessing. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.50, 51.</p>
               <p>To prepare this point for use, I will here open. <hi>First,</hi> The mercies which Christ requested of the Father for them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Arguments used by him to obtain these mercies. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why he thus pleaded for them when he was to die. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and Lastly, How all this gives full evidence of Christs tender care and love to his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We will enquire what those mercies and special favours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> were, which Christ beg'd for his people, when he was to die? And we find among others, these five special mercies desired for them in this context.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The mercy of preservation both from sin and danger: so in the text; <hi>Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me:</hi> which is explained, vers. 15. <hi>I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil.</hi> We in ours, and the Saints that are gone, in their respective generations have reaped the fruit of this prayer. How else comes it to pass, that our souls are persecuted amidst such a world of Temptations; and these assisted and advantaged by our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions? How is it else, that our persons are not ruined, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed amidst such multitudes of potent, and malitious enemies that are set on fire of Hell? Surely the preservation of the burning bush, of the three children amidst the flames, of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the den of Lyons, are not greater wonders, than these our eyes do daily behold. As the fire would have certainly consumed, and the Lyons without doubt have rended and devoured, had not God by the interposition of his own hand stopt and hindered the effect; so would the sin that is in us, and the malice that is in others, quickly
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54346:149"/>
ruine our souls and bodies; were it not that the same hand gard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and keeps us every moment. To that hand into which this prayer of Christ delivered your souls and bodies, do you owe all your mercies, and Salvations, both Temporal and Spiritual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another mercy he prays for, is <hi>the blessing of union among themselves.</hi> This he joins immediately with the first mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of preservation, and prays for it, in the same breath, vers. 11. <hi>that they may be one, as we are.</hi> And well might he joyn them together in one breath, for this union is not only a choise mercy in it self, but a special means of that preservation he had prayed for before. Their union one with another, is a special means to preserve them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A third desirable mercy that Christ earnestly prayed for, was that <hi>his joy might be fulfilled in them,</hi> vers. 13. He would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their joy, even when the hour of his greatest sorrow was at hand. Yea, he would not only obtain joy for them, but a full joy: <hi>that my joy may be fulfilled in them.</hi> It is as if he had said, O my Father, I am to leave these dear ones in a world of troubles and perplexities. I know their hearts will be subject to frequent despondencies. O let me obtain the cordials of divine joy for them, before I go. I would not only have them live, but live joyfully. Provide for their fainting hours, reviving cordials.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And as a continued spring to maintain all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned mercies: He prays <hi>they all may be sanctified through the word of truth,</hi> vers. 17. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> more abundantly sanctified than yet they were, by a deeper radication of gratious habits, and principles in their hearts. This is a singular mercy in it self, to have holiness spreading it self over and through their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uls, as the light of the morning. Nothing is for it self more desirable. And it's also a singular help to their perseverance, union, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al joy, which he had prayed for before; and are all advanced by their increasing Sanctification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Lastly, As the complement and perfection of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable mercies, he prays <hi>that they may be with him, where he is to behold his glory,</hi> vers. 24. This is their best and ultimate priviledge they are capable of. The end of his coming down from Heaven, and returning thither again. All runs into this to bring many Sons and daughters unto glory. You see Christ asks no trifles, no small things for his people. No mercies, but the best that both worlds afford will suffice him on their behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:54346:149"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us see how he follows his requests, and with what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> arguments he pleads with the Father for these things. And among others I shall single out six choice ones, which are urged in this Text, or the immediate context.</p>
               <p>First Argument is drawn from the joint interest that both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and Father, have in the persons for whom he prays. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi> vers. 10. As if he should say, Father, behold and consider the persons I pray for, they are not aliens, but children; yea, they are thy children, as well as mine. The very same on whom thou hast set thy eternal love, and in that love hast given them unto me. So that they are both thine, and mine. Great is our interest in them, and interest draws care, and tenderness. Every one cares for his own, provides for, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his own. Propriety (even amongst creatures) is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to our labour, care and watchfulness. They would not so much prize life, health, estates, or children, if they were not their own. Lord these are thine own, by many ties, and titles: O therefore keep, comfort, sanctifie and save them, for they are thine. What a mighty plea is this? Surely Christians, your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor is skilful in his work, your Advocate wants no eloquence, or ability to plead for you.</p>
               <p>The Second Argument, and that a powerful one, treads as I may say upon the very heel of the former, in the next words: <hi>And I am glorified in them. q. d.</hi> My glory and honour is infinitely dear to thee, I know thy heart is set intently upon the exalting, and glorifying of thy Son; now what glory have I in the world, but what comes from my people? Others neither can, nor will glorifie me. Nay, I am daily blasphemed, and dishonoured by them. These are they from whom my active glory and praise in the world must rise. 'Tis true, both thou and I have glory from other creatures <hi>objectively,</hi> the works that we have made, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest our power, wisdom and goodness upon, do so glorifies us. And honour we have from our very enemies, <hi>accidentally.</hi> Their very wrath shall praise us: but for active and voluntary praise, whence comes this but from the people that were formed for that very purpose. Should these then miscarry and perish where shall my manifestive, and active glory be? And from whom shall I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it? So that here his propriety, and glory are pleaded with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevail for those mercies, and they are both great and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things with God. What dearer, what nearer to the heart of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:54346:150"/>A Third Argument. And yet to make all fast and sure he adds in the beginning of this, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. a third Argument in these words, <hi>And now I am no more in the world.</hi> Where we must consider the sense of it as a proposition, and the force of it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. This proposition I am no more in the world, is not to be taken <hi>simply</hi> and universally as if in no sense Christ should be any more in this world; but only <hi>respectively</hi> as to his corporal presence, this was in a little time to be removed from his people, which had been a sweet spring of comfort to them in all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. But now it might have been said to the pensive disciples, as the sons of the Prophets said to <hi>Elisha</hi> a little before <hi>Eliahs</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; know ye not that your Master shall be taken from your heads to day? This comfortable enjoyment must be taken from them: this is the sense. And here lies the Argument; Father, consider the sadness and trouble I shall leave my poor Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Whilst I was with them, it was a sweet relief to their souls, whatever troubles they met with. In all doubts, fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they could repair to me. In all their straights and wants I still supplied them. They had my counsels to direct them, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs to reduce them, my comfort to support them; yea, the very sight of me was an unspeakable joy and refreshment to their souls: but now the hour is come, and I must be gone. All the comfort and benefit they had from my presence among them is now cut off. And except thou do make up all this to them another way; what will become of these children, when their Father is gone? What will be the case of the poor Sheep, and tender Lambs, when the Shepherd is smitten? Therefore (O my Father) look thou after them. See to them, for they are thine, as well as mine, I am glorified in them, and now leaving them, and removing out of this world from them.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Argument. And yet to move and engage the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers care and love for them, he subjoins another great consideration in the very next words, drawn from the danger he leaves them in. <hi>But these are in the world.</hi> The world is a sinful, infecting, and unquiet place: <hi>it lies in wickedness,</hi> and a hard thing it will be for such poor, weak, imperfect creatures to escape the pollutions of it. Or if they do, yet the troubles, persecutions, and strong oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it they cannot escape. Seeing therefore I must leave thine own dear children as well as mine, and those from whom my glory is to rise; in the midst of a sinful, troublesom, dangerous world,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54346:150"/>
where they can neither move backward nor forward without danger of sin, or ruine: O since the case stands so, look after them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, and take special care for them all. Consider who they are, and where I leave them. They are thy children, to be left in a strange Country. Thy Souldiers, in the Enemies quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Thy Sheep, in the midst of Wolves. Thy pretious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure among Thieves.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Argument. And yet he hath not done, for he resolves to tug for the mercies he had asked, and will not come off with a denial; and therefore adds another Argument in the next words; <hi>And I come to thee.</hi> As his leaving them was an Argument, so his coming to the Father is a mighty Argument also. There is much in these words <hi>I come to thee</hi> [I,] thy beloved Son, in whom thy soul delighteth. I to whom thou never deniedst any any thing. 'Tis not a stranger, but a Son: not an adopted, but the only begotten Son. 'Tis I that [<hi>come.</hi>] I am now coming to thee apace my Father. I come to thee, swiming through a bloody Ocean. I come treading every step of my way to thee in blood, and unspeakable sufferings; and all this for the sake of those dear ones I now pray for. Yea, the design and end of my coming to thee, is for them. I am coming to Heaven in the capacity of an Advocate, to plead with thee for them. And I come to [thee] my Father, and their Father; my God and their God. Now then, since I that am so dear, come through such bitter pangs, to thee so dear, so tender hearted a Father; and all this on their score and account: Since I do but now as it were begin, or give them a little tast of that intercession-work which I shall live for ever to perform for them in Heaven: Father hear, Father grant what I request. O give a comfortable handsel of those good things, which I am coming to thee for, and which I know thou wilt not deny me.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Argument. And to close up all, he tells the Father, how careful he had been to observe, and perform that trust which was committed to him. <hi>Whilst I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me, I have kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition,</hi> ver. 12.</p>
               <p>And thus lies the Argument: Thou committest to me a certain number of elect souls, to be redeemed by me; I undertook the trust, and said, if any of these be lost; at my hand let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. I will answer them every one to thee. In pursuance of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54346:151"/>
which trust, I am now here on the earth, in a body of flesh. I have been faithful to a point. I have redeemed them (for he speaks of that as finished and done, which was now ready to be done) I have kept also, and confirmed them hitherto: and now Father I commit them to thy care. Lo here they are, not one is lost, but the son of perdition, who was never given. With how great care, have I been careful for them! O let them not fail now. Let not one of them perish.</p>
               <p>Thus you see what a nervous, argumentative, pleading prayer Christ poured out to the Father for them at parting.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The next enquiry is, why he thus prayed and pleaded with God for them, when he was to die?</p>
               <p>And certainly it was not because the Father was unwilling to grant the mercies he desired for them. No, they came not off with difficulty, nor were they wrested by meer importunity out of the hand of an unwilling and backward person. For he tells us in Joh. 16.27. <hi>the Father himself loveth you; (i. e.)</hi> he is propense enough of his own accord, to do you good. But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this exceeding importunity are,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> He foresaw a great trial then at hand; yea, and all the after trials of his people as well as that. He knew how much they would be sifted, and put to it in that hour, and power of darkness that was coming. He knew their faith would be shaken, and greatly staggered, by the approaching difficulties, when they should see their Shepherd smitten, and themselves scattered. The Son of man delivered into the hands of Sinners, and the Lord of Life hang dead upon the tree; yea sealed up in the grave. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw what straights his poor people would fall into, betwixt a busie Devil, and a bad heart: therefore he prays, and pleads with such importunity, and ardency for them that they might not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was now entring upon his intercession-work in Heaven, and he was desirous in this prayer to give us a <hi>Specimen,</hi> or sample of that part of his work before he left us; that by this we might understand what he would do for us, when he should be out of our sight. For this being his last on earth, it shews us what affections, and dispositions he carried hence with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and satisfies us that he who was so earnest with God on our behalf, such a mighty pleader here, will not forget us, or neglect our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in the other world. Yet Reader, I would have the alwaies
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54346:151"/>
to remember, that the intercession of Christ in Heaven is carried at a much higher rate than this. It's performed in a way more suitable to that state of honour to which he is now exalted. Here he used prostrations of Body, cries, and tears in his prayers. There it's carried in a more majestick, and with more state, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an exalted Jesus. But yet in this he hath left us a special assistance, to discover much of the frame, temper, and working of his heart now in Heaven towards us.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and Lastly, He would leave this as a standing monument of his Father-like care and love to his people to the end of the world. And for this it is conceived: Christ delivered this prayer so publickly not withdrawing from the Disciples to be private with God, as he did in the Garden; but he delivers it in their presence, <hi>these things I speak in the world</hi>:<note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note> this <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>ircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place [in the world] doth plainly speak it to be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer. And not only was it publickly delivered, but it was also by a singular providence recorded at large by <hi>Iohn,</hi> though omitted by the other <hi>Evangelists:</hi> that so it might stand to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, for a testimony of Christs tender care and Love to his people.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you ask how this gives evidence of Christs tender <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> care and Love to his people? which is the last enquiry. I answer in few words. For the thing is plain and obvious. It appears in these two particulars.
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>First,</hi> His Love and care manifest in the choice of mercies for them. He doth not pray for health, honour, long life, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for their preservation from sin, spiritual joy in God, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and eternal glory. No mercies but the very best in Gods treasure will content him. He was resolved to get all the best mercies for his people, the rest he is content should be dispensed promiscuously by providence. But these he will settle as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage upon his children. O see the Love of Christ; Look over all your spiritual inheritance in Christ, compare it with the richest, fairest, sweetest inheritance on earth; and see what poor things these are to yours. O the care of a dear Father! O the love of a Saviour!</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> Besides what an evidence of his tenderness to you, and great care for you was this, that he should so intently, and so affectionately mind, and plead your concerns with God, at such a time as this was; even when a world of sorrow was heming him
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54346:152"/>
in on every side. A cup of wrath mixed, and ready to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into his hand. At that very time, when the clouds of wrath grew black, a storm coming, and such as he never felt before: when one would have thought, all his care, thoughts, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence should have been imployed on his own account, to mind his own sufferings; no, he doth as it were forget his own sorrows, to mind our peace and comfort.

If Christ undertake to plead the cause of his people with the Father, and use his oratory with him; there is no doubt but he carries it. Every word in this prayer is a chosen shaft, drawn to the head, by a strong and skilful hand: you need not question but it goes home to the white, and hits the mark aimed at. Doth he pray, <hi>Father keep through thine own name, those thou hast given me?</hi> Sure they shall be kept, if all the power in Heaven can keep them.

Though we die, our prayers die not with us They out-live us, and those we leave behind us in the world, may reap the benefit of them, when we are turned to dust.</p>
                  <p>For my own part I must profess before the world that I have a high value for this mercy.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Richard Flavell,</hi> a faithful and laborious Preacher of the Gospel at <hi>Haseler</hi> in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> shire; and afterwards at <hi>Willersay</hi> in <hi>Gloucester</hi> shire: now with God.</note> And do from the bottom of my heart bless the Lord, who gave me a Religious and tender Father: who often poured out his soul to God for me. He was one that was inwardly acquainted with God, and being full of bowels to his children, often carried them before the Lord: prayed and pleaded with God for them: wept and made supplication for them. This stock of prayers and blessings left by him before the Lord, I cannot but esteem above the fairest inheritance on earth. O it is no small mercy to have thousands of fervent prayers lying before the Lord, filed up in Heaven for us. And oh that we would all be faithful to this duty. Surely our love, especially to the souls of our Relations, should not grow cold, when our breath doth. O that we would remember this duty in our lives, and if God give opportunity and ability, fully discharge it when we die: consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Christ did, we shall be no more but they are in this world. In the midst of a defiled, tempting troublesom world. It's the last office of Love that ever we shall do for them. After a little while we shall be no longer sensible how it is with them. (for as the Church speaks, Isai. 63.16. Abraham <hi>is ignorant of us, and</hi> Israel <hi>acknowledgeth us not</hi>) what Temptations, and troubles may befal them we do not know.

                     <hi>Hence ye may see what an high esteem and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious value Christ hath of Believers</hi>; this was the treasure which he could not be quiet, he could not die, till he had secured it in a safe hand. <hi>I come unto thee, holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me.</hi>

O how pretious, how dear should Jesus Christ be to us! were we first and last upon his heart? did he mind us, did he pray for us, did he so wrestle with God about us when the sorrows of death compassed him about? how much are we engaged not only to love him, and esteem him whilst we live; but to be in pangs of love for him, when we feel the pangs of death upon us!

                  <p>—The Lord Iesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it; and said, take eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.

            <p>CHrist had no sooner recommended his dear charge to the Father, but (the time of his death hasting on) he institutes his last Supper to be the lasting memorial of his death in all the Churches, until the second coming: therein graciously providing for the comfort of his people, when he should be removed out of their sight. And this was the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54346:155"/>
               <hi>second preparative act</hi> of Christ in order to his death: he will set his house in order, and then die.</p>
            <p>This his second Act, manifests no less love than the former. It's like the plucking off the ring from his finger, when ready to lay his neck upon the block, and delivering it to his dearest friends, to keep that as a memorial of him. <hi>Take this,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi>

               </gap>, in that same night, that night for ever to be remembred. He gives that night a cordial draught to his Disciples, before the conflict. He settles that night an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Church, for the confirmation and consolation of his people, in all generations to the end of the world. By instituting in that night, he gives abundant evidence of his care for his people, in spending so much of that little, very little time he had left, on their account.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly, The Institution it self,</hi> in which we have, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, significative, instructive signs, and they are Bread and Wine. And the glorious mysteries represented, and shadowed forth by them, <hi>viz.</hi> Jesus Christ crucified; the proper New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nourishment of Believers. Bread and Wine are choice crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and do excellently shadow forth the flesh and blood of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54346:155"/>
crucified Jesus: And that both in their natural usefulness, and manner of preparation. Their usefulness is very great; Bread is a creature necessary to uphold and maintain our natural life. Therefore it's called <hi>the staff of bread,</hi> Isai. 3.1. Because as as a feeble man depends and leans upon his staff, so doth our feeble spirits upon bread. Wine was made to chear the heart of man, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.13. They are both useful and excellent creatures. Their preparations to become so useful to us, is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. The Corn must be ground in the Mill: the Grapes torn and squeesed to pieces in the Wine-prefs, before we can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Bread or Wine. And when all this is done, they must be received into the body, or they nourish not. So that these were very fit creatures, to be set apart for this use and end.</p>
            <p>If any object, it's true, they are good creatures, but not preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to be the signs of such profound, and glorious Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It was worth the creating of a new creature, to be the sign of the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>Let him that thus objects, ask himself, whether nothing be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious without pomp? The pretiousness of these Elements, is not so much from their own natures, as their use and end; and that makes them pretious indeed. A <hi>Loadstone</hi> at Sea, is much more excellent than a <hi>Diamond,</hi> because more useful. A peniworth of wax ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Label of a Deed, and sealed, may in a minute have its value raised to thousands of pounds. These creatures receive their value, and estimation on alike account. Nor should it at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a wonder to thee, why Christ should represent himself by such mean and common things: when thou hast well considered, that the excellency of the picture is in its similitude, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the original; and that Christ was in a low, sad, and very abased state, when this picture of him was drawn; he was then <hi>a man of sorrows.</hi> These then as lively signs shadow forth a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Jesus. Represent him to us in his red garments. This preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ordinance may much more than <hi>Paul,</hi> say to us, <hi>I alwaies bear about in my body, the dying of the Lord Iesus.</hi> That's the thing it signifies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Lastly, Take notice of the use, design, and end of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this institution. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54346:156"/>
of him and of his sufferings, would turn to our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and loss. And therefore doth he appoint a sign to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by, <hi>as oft as ye do this ye shew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> Hence we shall observe, suitable to the design of this discourse,</p>

And it may so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to a thing it hath conversed with before, two waies; <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> and <hi>transciently</hi>; or <hi>affectingly,</hi> and <hi>permanently.</hi> A <hi>speculative remembrance,</hi> is only to call to mind the history of such a person, and his sufferings. That Christ was once put to death in the flesh. An <hi>affectionate remembrance</hi> is when we so call Christ and his death to our minds, as to feel the powerful impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions thereof upon our hearts. Thus, Matth. 26.75. Peter <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the words of the Lord, and went out, and wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> His very heart was melted with that remembrance; his bowels were pained, he could not hold, but went out, and wept abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he saw his brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> whose sight refreshed the memory of former daies, and endearments, was greatly affected, Gen. 43.29, 30. <hi>And he lift up his eyes, and saw his brother</hi> Benjamin, <hi>his mothers Son; and said, is this your younger brother of whom ye spake to me? and he said God be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto thee my Son. And</hi> Joseph <hi>made haste, for his bowels did yearn upon his brother, and he sought where to weep; and he entred into his Chamber and wept there.</hi> Such a remembrance of Christ, is that which is here intended. This is indeed a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious remembrance of Christ, the former hath nothing of grace in it. The time shall come, when <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed him; and the <hi>Iews,</hi> that pierced him, shall hystorically remember what was done, Rev. 1.7. <hi>Behold he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him; and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth, shall wail because of him.</hi> They I say <hi>Iudas</hi> shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, this is he whom I perfidiously betrayed. <hi>Pilate</hi> shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, this is he whom I sentensed to be hanged on the tree, though I was convinced of his innocency. Then the <hi>Souldiers</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, this is that Face we spet upon, that head we crowned with thorns: Lo this is he whose side we pierced, whose hands and Feet we once nailed to the Cross. But this remembrance will be their torment, not their benefit. It is not therefore a bare hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical speculative; but a gratious, affectionate, impressive remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christ, that is here intended: and such a remembrance of Christ, supposes and includes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54346:157"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The saving knowledge of him. We cannot be said to remember what we never knew; nor to remember savingly, what we never knew savingly. There have been many previous, sweet, and gratious transactions, dealings, and intimacies betwixt Christ and his people, from the time of their first happy acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him; much of that sweetness they have had in former considerations of him, and hours of communion with him, are lost, and gone. For nothing is more volatile, hazardous, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant than our Spiritual comforts: but now, at the Table, there our old acquintance is renewed, and the remembrance of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Love refreshed and revived. <hi>We will remember thy Love more than wine, the upright Love thee,</hi> Cant. 1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such a remembrance of Christ includes faith in it. Without discerning Christ at a Sacrament there is no remembrance of him; and without faith, no discerning Christ there. But when the pretious eye of faith, hath espied Christ under that vail; it presently calls up the affections, saying, <hi>come see the Lord.</hi> These are the wounds he received for me. This is he that Loved me, and gave himself for me. This is his flesh, and that his blood; <hi>sic Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos, sic ille Manus,</hi> &amp;c. so his Arms were stretched out upon the Cross, to embrace me. So his blessed Head hung down, to kiss me. Awake my Love, rouze up my Hope, flame out my Desires; come forth O all ye powers and affections of my soul; come see the Lord.</p>
               <p>No sooner doth Christ by his Spirit call to the Believer, but faith hears; and discerning the voice, turns about like <hi>Mary,</hi> saying, <hi>Rabboni,</hi> my Lord, my Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This remembrance of Christ includes suitable impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made upon the affections, by such a sight and remembrance of him. And therein lies the nature of that pretious thing which we call communion with God. Various representations of Christs are made at the Table. Sometimes the soul there calls to mind the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>wisdom,</hi> that so contriv'd and laid the glorious and mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous design, and project of redemption. The effect of this is <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>admiration.</hi> O the manifold wisdom of God! <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. O the depths, the heights, the length, the breadth of this wisdom! I can as easily span the heavens, as take the just demensions of it. Sometimes a representation of the <hi>severity</hi> of God is made to the soul at that Ordinance. O how inflexible and severe is the Justice of God. What no abatements! No sparing mercy!
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54346:157"/>
not to his own Son! this begets a double impression on the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Just and deep <hi>indignation</hi> against sin. Ah cursed sin! 'Twas thou usedst my dear Lord so.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Magna amari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo peccati, quae tantum amaritudinem peperit</hi> Aug.</note> For thy sake he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all this. If thy vileness had not been so great, his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had not been so many. Cursed sin, thou wast the knife that stab'd him. Thou the sword, that pierced him. Ah what revenge it works! I remember it's storied of one of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that hearing his Bishop (as I remember it was <hi>Remigius</hi>) read the Historie of Christs trial and execution, and hearing how barbarously they had used Christ; he was moved with so tragical and pathetical a Historie, to great indignation against <hi>Pilate,</hi> the Jews, and the rude and bloody Souldiers, and could not contain himself; but cried out as the Bishop was reading, O that I had been there with my French-men, I would have cut all their throats, who so barbarously used my Saviour.</p>
               <p>To allude to this: When the Believer considers and remembers that sin put Christ to all that shame and ignominy; that he was wounded for our transgressions; he is filled with hatred of sin, and cries out, O sin, I will revenge the blood of Christ upon thee! thou shalt never live a quiet hour in my heart. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It produces an humble <hi>adoration</hi> of the goodness, and mercy of God; to exact satisfaction for our sins, by such bloody stripes from our surety. Lord, what if this wrath had seised on me, as it did on Christ; what had been my condition then! If these things were done in the green tree, what had been the cafe of the dry tree?</p>
               <p>Sometimes representations (and not common ones) are made of the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ,<note place="margin">

Hom. lib. 3.</note> who assumed a body and soul on purpose to bear the wrath of God for our sins. And when that surpassing Love breaks out in its glory upon the soul, how is the soul <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported,</hi> and ravished with it! crying out, what manner of Love is this! Here's a Love large enough to go round the heavens, and the Heaven of heavens. Who ever loved after this rate, to lay down his life for enemies! O Love unutterable, and unconceivable! How glorious is my Love in his red garments! Sometimes the fruits of his death are there gloriously displaied. Even his <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> for sin, and the <hi>purchase</hi> his blood made of the eternal inheritance. And this begets <hi>thankfulness,</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in the soul. Christ is dead, and his death hath satisfied for my sin. Christ is dead therefore my soul shall never die. Who shall separate me
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54346:158"/>
from the Love of God? These are the fruits, and this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that remembrance of Christ, here spoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What aptitude, or conducency is there in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to bring Christ so to remembrance?</p>
               <p>Much every way. For it is a sign by him appointed to that end; and hath (as Divines well observe) a threefold use and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>viz.</hi> as it is <hi>memorative,</hi> as it is <hi>significative,</hi> and as it is <hi>instructive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>First,</hi> As it is <hi>memorative,</hi> and so it hath the nature and use of a pledge, or token of Love, left by a dying, to a dear surviving friend. And so the Sacrament as was said before, is like a Ring pluckt off from Christs Finger, or a Bracelet from his Arm; or rather his Picture from his Breast, delivered to us with such words as these, <hi>as oft as you look on this, rememember me. Let this help to keep me alive in your remembrance when I am gone, and out of your sight.</hi> It conduces to it also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is a <hi>significative</hi> sign, most aptly signifying both. his bitter sufferings for us, and our strict and intimate union with him. Both which have an excellent usefulness to move the heart, and its deepest affections at the remembrance of it. The breaking of the Bread, and shedding forth the Wine signifies the former; our eating, drinking, and incorporating them, is a lively significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Moreover this Ordinance hath an excellent use, and advantage for this affectionate remembrance of Christ, as it is an <hi>instructive sign.</hi> And it many waies instructs us, and enlightens our mind, particularly in these truths which are very affecting things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That Christ is the Bread on which our souls live: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meat and drink for Believers: the most excellent New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment food. It's said, Psal. 78.25. <hi>man did eat Angels food</hi>: He means the manna, that fell from Heaven. Which was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, that if <hi>Angels</hi> who are the noblest creatures, did live-up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on material food; they would choose this above all to feed on. And yet this was but a Type and weak shadow of Christ, on whom Believers feed. Christ makes a royal feast, of his own flesh and blood. <hi>Isai.</hi> 25.6. all our delicates are in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It instructs us that the New-Testament is now in its full force, and no sustantial alteration can be made in it, since the the Testator is dead; and by his death hath ratified it. So that all
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54346:158"/>
the excellent promises and blessings of it are now fully confirmed to the believing soul. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. All these, and many more choice truths are we instructed in by this sign. And all these waies it remembers us of Christ, and helps powerfully to raise, warm, and affect our hearts with that remembrance of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The last enquiry is, how Christ hath hereby left such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a special mark of his care for, and love to his people. And that will evidently appear, if you consider these five particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> This is a special mark of the care and Love of Christ, in as much as hereby he hath made abundant provision, for the confirmation and establishment of his peoples faith to the end of the world. For this being an evident proof that the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in its full force, (Matth. 26.28. <hi>this is the Cup of the New-Testament in my blood:</hi>) it tends as much to our satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the legal execution of a deed, by which we hold and enjoy our estate. So that when he saith <hi>take, eat,</hi> it is as much as if God should stand before you at the Table with Christ, and all the promises in his hand; and say, <hi>I deliver this to thee as my deed.</hi> What think you, doth this promote and confirm the faith of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? if it do not, what doth?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is a special mark of Christs care and Love, in as much as by this he hath made like abundant provision for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of his peoples joy and comfort. Believers are at this Ordinance, as <hi>Mary</hi> was at the Sepulcher, <hi>with fear, and great joy. Matth.</hi> 28.8. Come Reader, speak thy heart, if thou be one that heartily lovest Jesus Christ, and hast gone many daies, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly years, mourning and lamenting because of the inevidence and cloudiness of thine interest in him: that hast sought him sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in this Ordinance, and in that; in one duty, and another; if at last Christ should take off that mask, that cruel covering (as one calls it) from his face, and be known of thee in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread. Suppose he should by his Spirit whisper thus in thine ear, as thou sittest at his Table, <hi>dost thou indeed so prize, esteem and value me? will nothing but Christ and his Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and satisfie thee? then, as sweet, lovely and desireable as I am, know that I am thine. Take thine own Christ into the arms of thy faith this day.</hi> Would not this breed in thy soul a joy transcendent to all the joys and pleasures in this world? what thinkest thou of it?</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:54346:159"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is a signal mark of Christs care and Love, in as much as this is one of the highest and best helps for the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the corruptions of his people. Nothing tends more to the killing of sin, than this doth. Christs blood as it's food to faith, so it's poyson to our Lusts. O what a Pill is wrapt up in that Bread! what an excellent Potion is in that Cup, to purge the soul? One calls that Table an Altar, on which our corruptions are sacrificed, and slain before the Lord. For how can they that there see what Christ suffered for sin, live any longer therein?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Moreover, his care and Love appear in providing such bellows as these, to excite and blow up his peoples Love into a lively flame. When <hi>Ioseph</hi> made himself known to his Brethren; I am <hi>Ioseph</hi> your Brother, whom ye sold, be not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Oh, what a showr of tears, and dear affections was there? How did they fall upon each others necks! so that the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> wondred at the matter. How doth the soul (if I may so speak) passionately love Jesus Christ at such a time? O what a Christ is my Christ! <hi>the fairest among ten thousand.</hi> What hath he done, what hath he suffered for me! what great things hath my Jesus given, and what great things hath he forgiven me! a world, a thousand worlds, cannot shew such another. Here it's melted down by Love at his feet. It's pain'd with Love.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To conclude, Christs care and Love are farther mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to his people in this Ordinance, as it is one of the strongest bonds of union betwixt themselves, that can bee. 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>We being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that one bread.</hi> And though through our corruptions, it falls out, that that which was intended for a <hi>bond of union,</hi> proves a <hi>bond of contention</hi>; yet in as much as by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how dearly Christ Loved them, for as much also as here they are sealed up to the same inheritance, their dividing corruptions here slain, their Love to Christ, and consequently to each other, here improved; it is certainly one of the strongest ties in the world, to wrap up gratious hearts in a bundle of Love.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And thus I have dispatcht the doctrinal part of this point. The improvement of it is in the following Inferences.</p>

                  <p>Did Christ leave this Ordinance with his Church,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 1.</note> to preserve his remembrance among his people? <hi>then surely Christ foresaw, that notwithstanding what he is, hath done, suffered and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet to do for his people, they will for all this be still apt to forget him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man would think that such a Christ should never be one whole hour together out of his peoples thoughts, and affections. that where ever they go, they should carry him up and down with them, in their thoughts, desires, and delights. That they should let their thoughts work towards Christ, as the longing thoughts of her that is with Child, do work after that she longs for. That they should lie down with Christ in their thoughts at night, and when they awake, be still with him. That their very dreams in the night should be sweet visions of Christ, and all their words sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But O the baseness of these hearts! Here we live and converse in a world of sensible objects, which like a company of thieves, rob us of our Christ; and lay the dead Child in his room. Woe is me, that it should be so with me, who am so obliged to Love him! though he be in the highest glory in Heaven, he doth not forget us; he hath graven us upon the palms of his hands, we are continually before him. He thinks on us, when we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him. The whole honour and glory paid him in Heaven by the Angels, cannot divert his thoughts one moment from us, but every trifle that meets us in the way, is enough to divert our thoughts from him. Why do we not abhor and loath our selves for this? What is it a pain, a burden, to carry Christ in our thoughts about the world? as much a burden if thy heart be spiritual, as a Bird is burdened by carrying his own wings.</p>
                  <p>Will such thoughts intrude unseasonably, and thrust greater things than Christ out of our minds? For shame Christian, for shame, let no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In Heaven nothing else takes up the thoughts of Saints to eternity; and yet there is no tireing, no saciety. O learn to live nearer that heavenly life. Never leave praying, and striving, till thou canst say as it is, Psal. 63.5. <hi>My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise

                  <p>There, hearts that will not yield a tear under other Ordinances, can pour out floods. Zech. 12.10. <hi>They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn.</hi> Yet I dare not affirm, that every one whose heart is broken by the believing sight of Christ there, can evidence that it is so by a dropping eye. No, we may say of tears, as it's said of Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. If some Christians would give all the treasures of their house for them, they cannot be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.

For the support of such, I would distinguish, and have them to do so also, betwixt what is <hi>essential</hi> to spiritual sorrow, and what is <hi>contingent.</hi> Deep displeasure with thy self for sin, hearty resolutions and desires of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat mortification of it; this is essential to all spiritual sorrow; but tears are accidental, and in some constitutions rarely found.

                  <p>And surely, to see who it is that thy sins have pierced. How great how glorious, how wonderful a person that was, that was so humbled, abased, and brought to the dust, for such a wretched thing as thou art, cannot but tenderly affect, the considerating soul.

Other beauties have their prime, and their fading time; but Christs abides eternally. Our delight in creatures is often most at first acquaintance; when we come nearer to them, and see more of them, the edge of our delight is rebated. But the longer you know Christ, and the nearer you come to him, still the more do you see of his glory. Every farther prospect of Christ, entertains the mind with a fresh delight. He is as it were a new Christ every day; and yet the same Christ still.</p>

            <p>THE hour is now almost come, even that hour of sorrow, which Christ had so often spoken of. Yet a little, a very little while, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. He hath affectionately recommended his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to his Father. He hath set his house in order, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a memorial of his death, to be left with his people, as you
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54346:162"/>
have heard. There is but one thing more to do, and then the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedy begins. He recommended us, he must also recommend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by prayer to the Father, and when that is done, he is ready; let <hi>Iudas</hi> with the black guard come when they will.</p>
            <p>This last Act of Christs preparation for his own death, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Scripture: wherein we have an account, <hi>First,</hi> Of his Prayer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the Agony attending it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His relief in that Agony, by an Angel that came and comforted him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Prayer of Christ, in a praying posture he will be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> found when the enemy comes. He will be taken upon his knees. He was pleading hard with God in prayer, for strength to carry him through this heavy trial, when they came to take him. And this prayer was a very remarkable prayer, both for the <hi>solitariness</hi> of it, he withdrew about a stones cast <hi>vers.</hi> 41. from his dearest intimates. No ear but his Fathers shall hear what he had now to say. For the <hi>vehemency</hi> and importunity of it, these were those <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. strong cries, that he poured out to God in the daies of his flesh. And for the <hi>humility</hi> expressed in it, he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, he rolled himself as it were in the dust, at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feet. And in divers other respects it was a very remarkable prayer, as you will hear anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Scripture gives you also an account of the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Christ, as well as of his prayer: and that a most strange one; such as in all respects, never was known before in nature. It was a sweat as it had been blood, which [as] is neither an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole, as some would make it. Nor yet a meer similitude of blood, as others fancy: but a real bloody sweat. For so (as) is sometimes taken, for the very thing it self. As <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have here his relief in this his Agony, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by an Angel, dispatcht post from Heaven to comfort him. The Lord of Angels now needed the comfort of an Angel. It was time to have a little refreshment, when his face and body too, stood as full of drops of blood, as the drops of dew are upon the grass. Hence we note.</p>

               <p>To open and prepare this last act of preparation on Christs part, for our use; I shall at this time speak to these particulars. <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>place</hi> where he prayed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>time</hi> when he prayed, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The matter of his prayer.

This Garden lay very near to the City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The City had twelve gates, five of which were on the east side of it, among which the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable were the <hi>fountain-gate,</hi>

Betwixt this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and the City, ran the brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> which rose from an hill upon the south, and ran upon the east part of the City, between <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the mount of Olives: and over this brook Christ passed into the Garden, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.1. to which the Psalmist alludes in Psal. 110.7. <hi>He shall drink of the brook in the way, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall he lift up the head.</hi> For this brook running through the Valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> that fertile soil, together with the filth of the City, which it washt away, gave the waters a black tincture, and so, fitly resembled those grievous sufferings of Christ, in which he tasted both the wrath of God and men.</p>
               <p>Now Christ went not into this garden to hide or shelter himself from his enemies. No, that was not his end; for if so, it had been the most improper place he could have chosen: it being the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54346:163"/>
accustomed place, where he was wont to pray; and a place well known to <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was now coming to seek him, as you may see, Joh. 18.2. <hi>And</hi> Judas <hi>which betrayed him knew the place, for Iesus oft-times resorted thither, with his Disciples.</hi> So that he repairs thither, not to shun, but to meet the enemy. To offer himself as a prey to the Wolves, which there found him, and laid hold upon him. He also resorted thither for an hour or two of privacy before they came, that he might there freely pour out his soul to God. So much for the circumstance of place where he prayed.</p>

He never spent one moment of the time of his life idely; but these were the last moments he had to live in this world, and here you may see how they were filled up, and imployed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Next let us consider the matter of his prayer, or the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> things about which he poured out his soul to God in the Garden that evening. And <hi>vers.</hi> 42. informs us what that was: He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed saying, <hi>Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</hi> These words are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in many difficulties, as Christ himself was when he uttered them. <hi>By the Cup,</hi> understand that portion of sorrows then to be distributed to him by his Father. Great afflictions, and bitter tryals are frequently expressed in Scripture, under the metaphor of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>up. So that dreadful storm of wrath upon the wicked, in Psal. 11.6. <hi>Vpon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ir
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54346:164"/>
cup. (i. e.)</hi> the punishment allotted to them by God for their wickedness. And an exceeding great misery. By a large, or deep cup. So Ezek. 23.32, 33. <hi>Thou shalt drink of thy Sisters cup deep and large, thou shalt be laughed to scorn, and had in derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it containeth much. Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation; with the cup of thy Sister</hi> Samaria. And when an affliction is compounded of many bitter ingredients, stinging and agravating considerations and circumstances, then it's said to be mixed. <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red.</hi> (noting a bloody trial) <hi>It is full of mixture, and he poureth out the same, but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them: (i. e.)</hi> they shall have the worst part of the Judgement for their share. Thus afflictions, and calamities are exprest by the metaphor of a cup, great calamities, by a deep and large cup. Afflictions compounded of many agravating circumstances, by a mixed cup. And from the effect it hath on them that must drink it, it's called a cup of trembling, Isai. 57.17. <hi>Thou hast drunken at the hand of the Lord, the cup of his fury, the dregs of the cup of trembling.</hi> Such a cup now was Christs cup. A cup of wrath, a large and deep cup, that contained more wrath than ever was drunk by any creature: even the wrath of an infinite God. A mixed cup. Mixed with Gods wrath and mans in the extremity. And all the bitter agravating circumstances that ever could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Great consternation, and amazement, this was the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his cup.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>passing of the cup</hi> from him, understand his exemption from suffering that dreadful and horrid wrath of God, which he foresaw to be now at hand. For as the coming of the cup to a man doth in Scripture phrase note his bearing and suffering of evil, as you find it, Lam. 4.21. <hi>Rejoice and be glad O daughter of</hi> Edom, <hi>that dwellest in the Land of</hi> Uz; <hi>the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and make thy self naked.</hi> Which is an ironical reproof of the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> the Jews deadly enemies, who wickedly insulted over them, when the cup was at their mouths, as if the Lord had said, you have laughed and jear'd at my people, when my hand was on them; you rejoyced to see their calamities. Well, make your selves merry still if you can: the cup shall pass through unto thee. Thy turn is coming: then laugh it thou canst. So on the contrary, the passing away of the cup
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54346:164"/>
notes freedom from, or our escaping of those miseries. And so Christs meaning in this conditional request is, Father, if it be thy will excuse me from this dreadful wrath, my soul is amazed at it. Is there no way to shun it? Cannot I be excused? O if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible spare me. This is the meaning of it. But then here's the difficulty, how Christ who knew God had from everlasting deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined he should drink it, who had compacted and agreeed with him in the covenant of redemption so to do, who came (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledges) for that end into the world. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.37. Who foresaw this hour all along; and professed when he spake of this bloody baptism, with which he was to be baptised; that he was <hi>straightned till it was accomplished,</hi> Luk. 12.50. How (I say) to reconcile all this with such a petition; that now when the cup was delivered to him, it might pass, or he be excused from suffering: this is the knot, this is the difficulty.</p>
               <p>What! Did he now repent of the bargain? Was all he said before but a flourish, before he saw the enemy? Doth he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to wish his bargain dry? and that he had never undertaken such a work, is that the meaning of it? Nothing less. No, no, Christ never repented of his engagement to the Father. Never was willing to let the burden lie on us, rather than on himself. There was not such a thought in his holy and faithful heart: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of this doubt depends upon a double distinction. Which will clear his meaning in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> You must distinguish of prayers. Some are <hi>absolute,</hi> and peremptory; and so to have prayed that the cup might pass, would have been chargeable with such absurdities as were but now mentioned: others are <hi>conditional,</hi> and submissive prayers, <hi>if it may be, if the Lord please.</hi> And such was this, if thou be willing, if not I'le drink it. But you will say Christ knew what was the mind of God in that case. He knew what transactions had of old been betwixt his Father, and him; and therefore though he did not pray absolutely, yet it's strange he would pray conditionally it might pass. Therefore in the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second</hi> place, you must diftinguish of the <hi>natures</hi> according to which Christ acted. He acted sometimes as God, and sometimes as man. Here he acted according to his humane nature. Simply expressing, and manifesting in this request the reluctancy it had at such sufferings. Wherein he shewed himself a true man, in shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which is destructive to his nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:54346:165"/>As Christ had two distinct natures, so two dictinct wills. And (as one well observes) in the life of Christ there was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of power, and weakness: of the divine glory, and humane frailty. At his birth a star shone, but he was laid in a manger. The Devil tempted him in the wilderness, but there Angels mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to him. As man he was deceived in the figtree, but as God he blasted it. He was caught by the Souldiers in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but first made them fall back. So here, as man he feared, and shunned death; but as God-man he willingly submitted to it.</p>
               <p>It was (as <hi>Deodati</hi> well expresses it)
<q>A purely natural desire, meer man,<note place="margin">

And besides that, this desire was but conditional, under the will of God, accepted by Christ: but from the comtemplation of which, he was a while diverted, by the extremity of horrors: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no sin in it, but only a short conflict of nature, pesently overcome by reason, and a firm will. Or a small suspension, quickly overcome by a most strong resolution. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally this sacred deliberation in Jesus was not made simply, or in an instant, but with a short time, and with a counterpoise, which is the natural property of the soul, in its motions and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary actions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, as there was nothing of sin in it, it being a pure, and sinless affection of nature: so there was much good in it, and that both as it was a part of his satisfaction for our sin, to suffer inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such fears, tremblings, and consternations: And as it was a clear evidence that he was in all things made like unto his brethren, except sin.

Nor will he have them with him, possibly left it should discourage them to see and hear, how he groaned, sweat, tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and cried, as one in an agony, to his Father.</p>
                        <p>Reader, there are times, and cases, when a Christian would not be willing the dearest and most intimate friend he hath in the world, should be privy to what passes betwixt him and his God.</p>

                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was an <hi>humble</hi> prayer, that's evident by the postures into which he cast himself. Sometimes kneeling, and sometimes prostrate upon his face. He creeps in the very dust, lower he cannot fall; and his heart was as low as his body. He is meek and lowly indeed.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was a <hi>reiterated</hi> prayer, he prays, and then returns to the Disciples, as a man in extremity turns every way for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; so Christ prays, <hi>Father let the cup pass,</hi> but in that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hears him not: though as to support, he was heard. Being denied deliverance by his Father, he goes and bemoans himself to his pensive friends; and complains bitterly to them, <hi>my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.</hi> He would ease himself a little by opening his condition to them; but alas, they rather increase, than ease his burden. For he finds them asleep, which occasioned that gentle reprehension from him. Matth. 26.40. <hi>What could you not watch with me one hour.</hi> What, not <hi>watch</hi> with <hi>me?</hi> who may expect it from you more than I? could you not <hi>watch,</hi> I am going to <hi>die</hi> for you, and you cannot <hi>watch</hi> with me? what! cannot you watch wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ finds no ease from them, and back again he goes to that sad place, which he had stained and purpled with a bloody sweat: and prays to the same purpose again. O how he returns upon God, over and over, as if he resolved to take no denial! but however considering it must be so, he sweetly falls in with his Fathers will. <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>

                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> and Lastly, It was a prayer accompanied with a strange and wonderful <hi>agony</hi>: so saith vers. 44. <hi>and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground.</hi> Now he was red indeed in

               <p>These are strange and rare instances, and the truth of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the credit of the relator: But certainly for Christ, whose body had the most excellent crasis and temperament, to sweat clotted blood, or globs of blood as some render it; and that in a cold night, when others needed a fire within doors to keep them warm. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.18. I say for him to sweat such streams through his garments, falling to the ground on which he lay, must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a preternatural thing. And indeed, it was not wonderful that such a preternatual sweat should stream from all parts of his body, if you do but consider what an extraordinary load pressed his soul at that time: even such as no meer man ever felt, or was able to stand under. Even the wrath of a great and terrible God, in the extremity of it. <hi>Who</hi> (saith the prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> cap. 1.6.) <hi>can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire; and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi>

               <p>The effects of this wrath, as it fell at this time upon the soul of Christ in the garden, is largely and very emphatically exprest by the several <hi>Evangelists</hi> who wrote this tragedy. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us his soul was <hi>exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,</hi> Matth. 26.38.

And then the company of the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend that is as thine own soul, would not be welcome. <hi>When thou prayest enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret,</hi> Matth. 6.6. It is as much as if Christ had said, see all clear. Be sure to retire in as great privacy as may be. Let no ear but Gods hear what thou hast to say to him. This is at once a good note of sincerity, and a great help to spiritual liberty, and freedom with God.</p>

And he goes a second; he was not answered the second, he goes the third, and last time, yet was not answered in the thing he desired, <hi>viz.</hi> that the cup might pass from him, and yet he hath no hard thoughts of God, but resolves his will into his Fathers. If God deny you in the things you ask, he deals no otherwise with you, than he did with Christ. <hi>O my God</hi> (saith he) <hi>I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not, and in the night, and am not silent.</hi> Yet he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies God, <hi>but thou art holy.</hi> Psal. 22.2. Christ was not heard in the thing he desired, and yet heard in that he feared. Heb 5.7. The cup did not pass as he desired, but God upheld him, and enabled him to drink it. He was heard as to <hi>support,</hi> he was not heard as to <hi>exemption</hi> from sufferings, his will was exprest conditionally,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54346:168"/>
and therefore though he had not the thing he so desired; yet his will was not crossed by the denial. But now when we have a suit depending before the throne of grace, and cry to God once and again, and so answer comes. How do our hands hang down? and our spirits wax feeble!</p>
                  <p>Then we complain with the Church, Lam. 3.8. <hi>When I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer, thou coverest thy self with a cloud, that our prayers cannot pass through.</hi> Then with <hi>Ionah</hi> we conclude <hi>we are cast out of his sight.</hi> Alas! we judge by sence, according to what we see and feel, and cannot live by faith on God, when he seems to hide himself, put us off, and refuse our requests. It calls for an <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, to <hi>believe against hope, giving glory to God.</hi> If we cry, and no answer comes presently, our carnal reason draws a headlong, 'hasty conclusion; sure I must expect no answer. God is angry with my prayers. The seed of prayer hath lain so long under the clods, and it appears not, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it's lost, I shall hear no more of it.</p>
                  <p>Our prayers may be heard, though their answer be for present suspended. As <hi>David</hi> acknowledged when he cooly considered the matter, Psal. 31.22. <hi>I said in my hast, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, when I cried unto thee,</hi> No, no, Christian; a prayer sent up in faith according to the will of God, cannot be lost; though it be delaid. We may say of it as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Sauls</hi> sword, and <hi>Ionathans</hi> bow; that they never return empty.</p>

                  <p>And while he yet spake, lo <hi>Judas</hi> one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief Priests, and Elders of the people.

            <p>THE former Sermons give you an account how Christ improved every moment of his time, with busie diligence, to make himself ready for his death. He hath commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his charge to the Father. Instituted the blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of his death. Poured out his soul to God in the Garden, with respect to the grievous sufferings he should undergo. And now he
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54346:170"/>
is ready, and waits for the coming of the enemies, being first in the field.</p>
            <p>And think you that they were idle on their parts? No, no, their malice made them restless. They had agreed with <hi>Iudas</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him. Under his conduct a band of Souldiers are sent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him. The hour so long expected is come.

            </p>
            <p>These words contain the first preparative act on their part for the death of Christ: even to betray him, and that by one of his own Disciples. Now they execute what they had plotted, <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15. and in this paragraph, you have an account, <hi>First,</hi> Of the Traytor who he was. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the Treason, what he did. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of the Manner of its execution, how it was contrived and affected. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Of the <hi>Time,</hi> when they put this Hellish plot in execution.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> We have here a description of the Traytor: and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, how carefully the several <hi>Evangelists,</hi> have described him, both by his name, sirname and office, <hi>Iudas, Iudas Iscariot, Iudas Iscariot one of the twelve:</hi> that he might not be mistaken for <hi>Iude</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> the <hi>Apostle.</hi> God is tender of the names and reputations of his upright hearted Servants. His office <hi>one of the twelve,</hi> is added, to aggravate the fact; and to shew how that prophesie was accomplished in him. Psal. 41.9. <hi>Yea mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted; which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel against me.</hi> Lo, this was the Traytor, and this was his name and office.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have a description of the Treason, or an account what this man did. He led an armed multitude to the place where Christ was. Gave them a signal to discover him, and encouraged them to lay hands on him, and hold him fast. This was that Hellish design, which the Devil put into his heart, working upon that principle, or lust of covetousness, which was predominant there. What will not a carnal heart attempt, if the Devil suit a temptation to the predominant lust, and God withhold restraining grace!</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have here the way and manner in which this Hellish plot was executed. It was managed both with <hi>force,</hi> and with
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54346:170"/>
               <hi>fraud.</hi> He comes with a multitude, armed with swords and staves, in case he should meet with any resistance. And he comes to him with a <hi>kiss,</hi> which was their signal, lest they should mistake the man. For they aimed neither at small nor great, save only at the King of <hi>Israel.</hi> The King of glory. Here was much ado you see to take a harmless Lamb, that did not once start from them, but freely offered himself to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly, When was this treasonable design execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon Christ? And it was executed upon him while he stood among his Disciples exhorting them to prayer, and watchfulness. Dropping Heavenly, and most seasonable counsels upon them. <hi>While he yet spake, lo</hi> Judas, <hi>and with him a multitude came with swords and stave.</hi> Surely 'tis no better than a <hi>Iudas</hi> trick, to disturb, and afflict the servants of God in the discharge of their duties. This was the Traytor, and his Treason; thus it was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and at this time. Hence we observe.</p>

He that by <hi>profession</hi> had lifted up his <hi>hand</hi> to Christ; now by <hi>treason</hi> lifts up his <hi>heel</hi> against him.

                  <hi>First,</hi> As for the person that did this, he was very eminent by reason of that dignity Christ had raised him to. He was <hi>one of the twelve.</hi> A person retained not in a more general, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: but the nearest, and most intimate and honourable relation and service to Jesus Christ. There were in Christs time several sorts and ranks of persons, that had relation to Christ. There were <hi>secret Disciples</hi>: men that believed, but kept their stations, and abode with their relations in their callings.</p>
               <p>There were the seventy also, whom Christ sent forth; but none of these were so much with Christ, or so eminent in respect of their place as the twelve. They were Christs family; day and night conversant with him: it was the highest dignity that was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon any: and of this number was <hi>Iudas.</hi> The Antients have much extolled the Apostolical dignity. Some stiled these twelve <hi>pedes Christi</hi> the feet of Christ, because they as it were carried Christ up and down the world. Others <hi>oculi Dei,</hi> the very eyes of God; they were his watchmen, that took care for the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his name and Gospel in the world. Others <hi>mammae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi> the breasts of the Church. They fed, and nourisht the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by their doctrine. Now to be one of this number, one of the twelve, what a dignity was this?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Yea, he being one of the twelve, was daily conversant with Christ. Often joined with him in prayer, often sate at his feet hearing the gratious words that came forth of his mouth. It was one of <hi>Austins</hi> three wishes, that he had seen Christ in the flesh, <hi>Iudas</hi> not only saw him, but dwelt with him, travelled with him, eat and drank with him. And during the whole time of his abode with him, all Christs carriages towards him, were very obliging and winning; yea, such was the condescention of Christ to this wretched man; that he washed his feet; and that but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he betrayed him.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) He was a man of unsuspected integrity among the Apostles. When Christ told them one of you shall betray me; none thought on him, but every one rather suspected himself. Lord is it I? saith one, and so said they all. But none pointed at <hi>Iudas,</hi> saying thou art he.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:54346:171"/>(4.) To conclude, in some respect he was preferred to the rest. For he had not only a joint commission with them to preach the Gospel to others; (though poor unhappy wretch, himself became a cast away.) but he had a peculiar office. He bare the bag. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he was <hi>Almoner,</hi> or the Steward of the family, to take care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the necessary accommodations of Christ, and them. Now who could ever have suspected, that such a man as this should have sold the blood of Christ for a little mony? that ever he should have proved a perfidious Traytor to his Lord, who had called him, honoured him, and carried himself so tenderly towards him? and yet so it was, <hi>lo</hi> Judas <hi>one of the twelve came, and with him a multitude:</hi> O whither will not a busie Devil, and a bad heart carry a man!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But what did this man do? And what are the just <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> aggravations of his fact? Why, he most basely and unworthily sold and delivered Christ, into his enemies hands, to be butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and destroyed: and all this for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
               <p>Blush O Heavens, and be astonished O Earth at this! in this fact, most black and horrid aggravations appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Iudas</hi> had seen the majesty of a God on him whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. He had seen the Miracles that Christ wrought, which none but Christ could do. He knew that by the finger of God, he had raised the dead, cast out Devils, healed the sick. He could not choose but observe and see the raies and awful beams of divine Majesty shining in his very face; in his doctrine, and in his life. To betray a man, to sell the blood of the poorest innocent in the world is horrid; but to sell the blood of God, O what's this! here's a wickedness that no epithete can match! yea,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This wickedness he committed after personal warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and praemonitions given him by Christ. He had often told them in general, that one of them should betray him. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.20. He had also denounced a dreadful wo upon him that should do it, vers. 21. <hi>The Son of man goeth indeed, as it is written of him; but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; good had it been for that man, if he had never been born.</hi> This was spoken in <hi>Iudas</hi> his presence. And one would have thought so dreadful a doom as Christ passed upon the man that should attempt this, should have affrighted him far enough from the thoughts of such a wickedness. Nay Christ comes nearer to him than this, and told him he was the man. For when <hi>Iudas</hi> (who was the last
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54346:172"/>
that put the question to Christ) asked him, <hi>Master is it I?</hi> Christs answer imports as much as a plain affirmation, <hi>Thou hast said,</hi> Matth. 26.25. Moreover,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He sells him, and he sells him at a low rate too; which shewed how vile an esteem he had of Christ.

                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He left Christ in most Heavenly and excellent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, when he went to make this soul undoing bargain. For if he went away from the Table as some think, then he left Christ instituting and administring those Heavenly Signs of his body and blood. There he saw, or might have seen the bloody work he was going about; acted as in a figure before him. If he sate out that Ordinance, as others suppose he did. Then he left Christ singing an Heavenly hymn, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to go where <hi>Iudas</hi> was preparing to meet him. When the Lord Jesus was in the most serious and heavenly exercise, the wretch slinked away from him into the City, or else went under pretence to buy some necessaries. But his design was
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54346:172"/>
not to buy, but to sell, whatever his pretences were. Nay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> What he did was not done by the perswasions of any. The High-Priest sent not for him, and without doubt was surprised when he he came to him on such an errand. For it could never enter into any of their hearts, that any of his own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could ever be drawn into a confederacy against him. No, he went as a Voluntier, offering himself to this work: which still heightens the sin; and makes it out of measure sinful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> The manner in which he executes his treasonable design, adds further malignity to the fact. He comes to Christ with fawning words, and carriages: <hi>Hail Master, and kist him.</hi> Here's hony in the tongue, and poyson in the heart.

Satan inspired the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Luk. 22.3, 4. <hi>Then entred Satan into</hi> Judas <hi>sirnamed.</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariot, <hi>and he went his way, &amp;c.</hi> his own Lusts like dry tinder kindled presently: his heart was covetous; there was predispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed matter enough for the Devil to work on, so that it was but touch and take. <hi>Vers.</hi> 25. They covenanted to give him mony, and he promised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy God disposed, and ordered all this to the singular benefit and good of his people, Acts 4.28. they did <hi>whatsoever his hand and counsel had before determined to be done.</hi> And by this determinate counsel of God was he taken and slain. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. Yet this no way excuses the wickedness of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. For what they did, was done from the power of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54346:173"/>
their own lusts most wickedly; what he did, was done in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable depth of his own wisdom, most holy. God knows how to serve his own ends, by the very sins of men, and yet have no communion at all in the sin, he so overrules. If a man let go a Dog out of his hand, in pursuit of a Hare, the Dog hunts meerly for a prey; but he that let him go, uses the sagacity and nimbleness of the Dog to serve his own ends by it. <hi>Iudas</hi> minded nothing but his own advantage to get mony. God permitted that Lust to work; but overruled the issue to his own eternal glory, and the salvation of our souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Lastly, but what was the end and issue of this fact? As to Christ, it was his death; for the hour being come he doth not meditate an escape, nor put forth the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to deliver himself out of their hands. Indeed he shewed what he could do, when he made them go back and stagger with a word. He could obtain more than <hi>twelve legions of Angels,</hi> to have been his life-guard; one of whom had been sufficient to have coped with all the <hi>Roman legions</hi>: but how then should the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures be fulfilled, or our Salvation accomplished? No, he resists not, but <hi>Iudas</hi> delivering him into their hands, at that time, was his death.</p>
               <p>And what got he as a reward of his wickedness? It ended in the ruine both of his soul and body. For immediately a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pang of despair seized his Conscience; which was so intollerable, that he ran to the halter for a remedy. And so falling headlong he burst assunder, and all his bowels gushed out. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.18. And now he that had no bowels for Christ, hath none for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. As for his soul, it went to its <hi>own place,</hi> vers. 25. Even the place appointed for the son of perdition, as Christ calls him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.12. His name retains an odious stench to this day, and shall to all generations. It's a by-word. A Proverb of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. This was his end. We will next improve it.</p>

                  <p>Hence in the first place we learn,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>that the greatest professors had need be jealous of their own hearts, and look well to the grounds and principles of their professions.</hi> One of the Antients would have had this Epitaph engraven upon <hi>Iudas</hi> his Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> let every one that beholds me, learn to be godly indeed; to be sincere in his profession, and love Christ more unfeignedly than I did. O Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors look to your foundation, and build not upon the sand, as this poor creature did.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Debile funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum fallit opus.</hi>
                     </note> That's sound advice indeed which the Apostle gives, 1 Cor. 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinks he he standeth, take heed lest he fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O beware of a loose foundation. If you begin your profession as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, no wonder if it shall end as his did. (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore you hold not the truth in unrighteousness. <hi>Iudas</hi> did so: he knew much, but lived not up to what he knew; for he was still of a worldly spirit, in the height of his profession. His knowledge never had any saving influence upon his heart. He Preacht to others, but he himself was a cast-away. He had much light, but still walked in darkness. He had no knowledge to do himself good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Beware you live not in a course of secret sin. <hi>Iudas</hi> did so, and that was his ruine. He made a profession indeed, and carried it smoothly; but he was a thief, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.6. He made no conscience of committing the sin, so he could but cover and hide it from men. This helped on his ruine, and so it will thine, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if thou be guilty herein. A secret way of sinning, under a covert of profession; will either break out at last to the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, or else slide thee down insensibly to Hell; and leave thee only this comfort, that no body shall know thou art there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beware of hypocritical pretences of Religion, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate self ends. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a man that had notable skill this way. He had a mind to fill his own purse, by the sale of this costly ointment which <hi>Mary</hi> bestowed upon her Saviours feet. And what a neat cover had he fitted for it, to do his business clearly. Why saith he, <hi>this might have been sold for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence, and given to the poor.</hi> Here was Charity to the poor, or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54346:174"/>
rather poor Charity; for they were only a blind to his base self ends. O Christian, be plain hearted: take heed of craft and cunning in matters of Religion. This spoil'd <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Beware of self confidence. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man of himself. <hi>Last of all Iudas said Master is it I?</hi> Matth. 26.25. But he that was <hi>last</hi> in the <hi>suspicion,</hi> was <hi>first</hi> in the <hi>transgression. He that trusteth his own heart is a fool,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 28.26. such a fool was this great Professor. It will be your wisdom to keep a jealous eye upon your own hearts, and still suspect its fairest pretences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If you will not do as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, nor come to such an end as he did; take heed you live not unprofitably under the means of grace. <hi>Iudas</hi> had the best means of grace, that ever man enjoyed. He heard Christ himself Preach, he joyned often with him in prayer; but he was never the better for it all: it was but as the watering of a dead-stick, which will never make it grow, but rot it the sooner. Never was there a rotten branch so richly watered as he was. O 'tis a sad <hi>sin,</hi> and a sad <hi>sign</hi> too; when men and women live under the Gospel from year to year, and never the better. I warn you to beware of these evils, all ye that profess Religion. Let these footsteps by which <hi>Iudas</hi> went down to his own place, terrifie you from following him in them.</p>

Thou shalt deliver him most perfidiously into their hands that seek his life; he would have answered as <hi>Hasael</hi> did to <hi>Elisha, But what is thy servant a Dog that he should do this great thing?</hi> 2 Kings 8.13. His wickedness first discovered it self in murmuring and discontent, taking a pipue at some small matters against Christ, as you may find by comparing <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. from the 60. to the 70. <hi>verse</hi> with <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. from the 3. to the 9. <hi>verse,</hi> but see to what it grows at last. That Lust or Temptation that at first is but a little cloud, as big as a mans hand, may quickly overspread the whole heaven. It is in our engaging in sin, as in the motion of a stone down the hill. <hi>Vires acquirit eundo,</hi> it strengthens it self by going, and the longer it runs, the more violent. Beware of the smallest beginnings of temptations. No wise man will neglect or slight the smallest spark of fire, especially if he see it among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny barrels of gunpouder. You carry gunpouder about you, O take heed of sparks.</p>

but these men cannot sleep till they have his blood, and therefore the preparation of the Passover being come, they resolve in all haste to destroy him; yet lest it should look like a downright mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it shall be formalized with a trial.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Enditement</hi> drawn up against Christ wherein they accuse him of many things; but can prove nothing. They charge him with sedition, and blasphemy, but faulter shamefully in the proof. However<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is wanting in evidence, shall be supplied with clamour and importunity. For saith the Text <hi>they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed:</hi> when they can neither prove the sedition, or blasphemy, they charged him with; then crucifie him crucifie him must serve the turn, instead of all witnesses and proofs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Sentence</hi> pronounced upon him. Pilate <hi>gave sentence that it should be as they required, (i. e.)</hi> he sentenced Christ to be nailed to the Cross, and there to hang till he was dead. From both these we observe these two doctrinal conclusions,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1. First,</hi> That the trial of Christ for his life, was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged most malitiously and illegally against him, by his unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2. Secondly,</hi> Though nothing could be proved against our Lord Iesus Christ worthy of death, or of bonds; yet was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be nailed to the Cross, and there to hang till he died.</p>
            <p>I shall handle these two points distinctly in their order, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the first, namely,</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>DOCT. 1. That the trial of Christ for his life,<note place="margin">Doct. <hi>1.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:54346:178"/>Reader, here thou maist see the Judge of all the world, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to be judged. He that shall judge the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, judged most unrighteously. He that shall one day come to the throne of judgement attended with thousands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Angels and Saints, standing as a prisoner at mans bar, and there denied the common right which a thief or murderer might claim, and is commonly given them.</p>
               <p>To manifest the illegallity of Christs trial, let the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars be heedfully weighed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That he was inhumanely abused both in words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> before the Court met, or any examination had been taken of the fact. For as soon as they had taken him, they forthwith bound him, and led him away to the High-priests house, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.54. and there they that held him, mocked him, and smote him, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded him, stroke him on the face, and bid him prophesie who smote him: and many other things blasphemously spake they against him, <hi>vers.</hi> 63, 64, 65. how illegal and barbarous a thing was this? When they were but binding <hi>Paul</hi> with thongs, he thought himself abused contrary to law, and asked the <hi>Centurion</hi> that stood by, <hi>is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and uncondemned, q. d.</hi> is this legal? What, punish a man first, and judge him afterwards! But Christ was not only bound, but horribly abused by them, all that night, dealing with him as the Lords of the <hi>Philistines</hi> did with <hi>Sampson,</hi> to whom it was a sport to abuse him. No rest had Jesus that night: no more sleep for him now in this world. O it was a sad night to him. And this under <hi>Caiphas</hi>'s own roof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he was inhumanely abused before he was tried; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so he was examined and judged by a Court that had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to try him. Luk. 22.66. <hi>as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the Chief-Priests, and the Scribes came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and led him into their Concil</hi>: This was the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court.</hi> The great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> which according to its first consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, should consist of seventy grave, honourable, and learned men: to whom were to be referred all doubtful matters, too hard for inferiour Courts to decide. And these were to Judge imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and uprightly for God, as men in whom was the Spirit of God. According to Gods counsel to <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 11.16, &amp;c. In this Court the Righteous and innocent might expect relief and protection. And that is conceived to be the meaning of Christs
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54346:179"/>
words, Luk. 13.33. <hi>It cannot be that a Prophet perish out of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem; that is, their Righteousness and Innocency may expect protection. But now, contrary to the first constitution, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of a pack fo malitious Scribes and Pharisees; men full of revenge, malice and all unrighteousness: And over these <hi>Caiphas</hi> (a head fit for such a body) at this time precided. And though there was still some face of a Court among them, yet their power was now abridged by the Romans; that they could not hear and determine, judge, and condemn in Capital matters as formery. For as <hi>Iosephus</hi> their own Historian informs us; <hi>Herod</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reign took away this power from them;<note place="margin">

He also understood him to be a <hi>Galilean,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> being <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and at that time in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he is sent to him; and by him remitted to <hi>Pilate.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As he was at first heard and judged by a Court that had no authority to Judge him; so when he stood at <hi>Pilates</hi> bar, he was accused of perverting the Nation and denying tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> than which nothing was more notoriously false. For as all his Doctrine was pure and heavenly, and malice it self could not find a flaw in it: so he was alwaies observant of the Laws under which he lived, and scrupulous of giving the least just offence to the civil powers. Yea, he not only paid the Tribute himself, though he might have pleaded exemption, but charged it upon others as their duty so to do, Matth. 22.24. <hi>give unto</hi> Caesar, <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars: and yet with such palpable untruths is Christ charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Yea, and what is most abominable, and unparallel'd; to compass their malitious designs, they industriously labour to suborn false witnesses to take away his life: not sticking at the grossest perjury, and manifest injustice, so they might destroy him. So you read, Matth. 25.59. <hi>Now the Chief-Priests and Elders, and all the council sought salse witnesses against Iesus, to put him to death.</hi> Abominable wickedness! For such men, and so many, to complot to shed the blood of the innocent, by known and studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perjury! What will not malice against Christ transport men to?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Moreover, the carriage of the Court was most inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and base towards him during the trial. For whilst he stood
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:54346:179"/>
before them as a prisoner yet uncondemned; sometimes they are angry at him for his silence, and when he speaks, and that perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the point; they smite him on the mouth for speaking, and scoff at what he speaks. To some of their light frivolous and ensnaring questions he is silent, not for want of an answer, but because he heard nothing worthy of an answer. And to fulfil what the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> had long before predicted of him:<note place="margin">

                  </note> Under him, saith <hi>Eusebius, Pilate</hi> killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He was a man not very friendly or benevolent to the Jewish nation, but still suspicious of their rebellions and insurrections, this jealous humour, the Priests and Scribes observed, and wrought upon it, to compass their design against Christ. Therefore they tell him so often, of Christs sedition, and stirring up the people; and that if he let him go, he is none of <hi>Caesars</hi> friend; which were the very considerations that prevailed with him to do what he did. But how durst he attempt such a wickedness as this, however he had stood in the opinion of <hi>Caesar?</hi> What I give Judgement against the Son of God; for 'tis evident by many circumstances in this trial that he had many inward fears, and convictions upon him,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54346:181"/>
that he was the Son of God. By these he was scared and sought to release him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.8, 12. the fear of a Deity fell upon him; his mind was greatly perplext, and dubious about this prisoner, whether he was a God or a man. And yet the fear of <hi>Caesar</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed more than the fear of a Deity, he proceeds to give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Pilate</hi> wast thou not afraid to Judge and Sentence an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, a known Innocent, and one whom thou thy self suspectedst at least to be more than man? But see in this predominancy of self-interest, what men will not attempt and perpetrate to secure and accommodate self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> against whom doth <hi>Pilate</hi> give Sentence? against a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Malefactor? No, his own mouth once and again acknowledged him innocent. Against a common prisoner? No, but one whose same no doubt had often reached <hi>Pilates</hi> ears, even the wonderful things wrought by him, which none but God could do. One that stood before him as the picture, or rather as the body of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and meekness. Ye have condemned, and killed the Just, and he resisteth you not, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.6. now was that word made good, Psal. 94.21. <hi>They gather themselves together, against the soul of the Righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But what was the sentence that <hi>Pilate</hi> gave? We have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it not in the form in which it was delivered. But the sum of it was, that it should be as they required. Now what did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires why, crucifie him, crucifie him. So that in what forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities soever it was delivered, this was the substance and effect of it, <hi>I adjudge Iesus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>to be nailed to the Cross, and there to hang til he be dead.</hi> Which sentence against Christ was,
<list>
                     <item>First, <hi>A most unjust, and unrighteous sentence,</hi> the greatest perversion of Judgement and Equity that was ever known to the civilized world, since seats of Judicature were first set up. What! to condemn him, before one accusation was proved against him? And if what they accused him of (that he said he was the Son of God) had been proved, it had been no crime, for he really was so; and therefore no blasphemy in him to say he was. <hi>Pilate</hi> should rather have come down from his seat of Judgement and adore him, that sit there to judge him. Oh it was the highest piece of injustice that ever our ears heard of.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was an unrighteous sentence, so it was a <hi>cruel sentence,</hi> delivering up Christ to their wills. This was that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54346:182"/>
which <hi>David</hi> so earnestly deprecated, Psal. 27.12. <hi>O deliver me not over to the will of mine enemies.</hi> But <hi>Pilate</hi> delivers Christ over to the will of his enemies; men full of enmity, rage, and malice: whose greatest pleasure it was, to glut themselves with his blood, and satiate their revengeful hearts with such a spectacle of misery. For lo, as soon as these Wolves had griped their prey, they were not satisfied with that cursed, cruel and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death of the Cross, to which <hi>Pilate</hi> had adjudged him; but they are resolved he shall die over and over: they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive many deaths in one: Now they say as a Tyrant did once, <hi>moriatur, ut sentiat se mori,</hi> let him die so as he may feel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to die, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> let him die by inch-meal. To this end they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently strip him naked, scourge him cruelly, array him in scarlet, and mock him: Crown him with a bush of platted thorns: fasten that Crown upon his head by a blow with a cane, which set them deep into his sacred Temples: Sceptered him with a reed: spet in his face: strip off his mock-robes again: put the Cross upon his back, and compel him to bear it. All this, and much more they express their cruelty by; as soon as they had him delivered over to their will. So that this was a cruel sentence.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it was a cruel, so it was a <hi>rash</hi> and hasty sentence. The Jews are all in haste: consulting all night, and early up by the break of day in the morning to get him to his trial. They spur on <hi>Pilate</hi> with all the arguments they can to give sentence. His trial took up but one morning, and a great part of that was spent in sending him from <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and then back again to <hi>Pilate</hi>: so that it was a hasty and headlong sentence that <hi>Pilate</hi> gave. He did not sift and examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but handles it very slightly. The trial of many a mean man hath taken up ten times more debates and time, than was spent about Christ.<note place="margin">

                        </note> They that look but slightly into the cause, easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and give sentence. But that which was then done in haste, they have had time enough to repent for since.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As it was a rash and hasty, so it was an <hi>extorted forced sentence.</hi> They squeeze it out of <hi>Pilate</hi> by meer clamor, importunity, and suggestions of danger. In Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, such arguments should signifie but little:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Minaciter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torquent ab eo, ut Christum damnet.</hi> Calv.</note> not importunity, but proof should carry it: but timorous <hi>Pilate</hi> bends like a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at this breath of the people. He had neither such a sence of Justice, nor spirit of Courage to withstand it.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="321" facs="tcp:54346:182"/>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As it was an extorted, so it was an <hi>Hypocritical</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; masking horrid murder under a pretence and formality of Law. It must look like a legal procedure to paliate the business. Loth he was to condemn him, lest innocent blood should clamor in his Conscience; but since he must do it, he will transfer the guilt upon them, and they take it: <hi>His blood be on us and on our children for ever,</hi> say they. <hi>Pilate</hi> calls for water, washes his hands before them, and tells them <hi>I am free from the blood of this just person.</hi> But stay, free from his blood, and yet condemn a known innocent person. Free from his blood, because he washt his hands in water. No, no, he could never be free, except his soul had been washed in that blood he shed. O the hypocrisie of <hi>Pilate</hi>! Such juggling as this will not serve his turn, when he shall stand as a prisoner before him, who now stood arraigned at his Bar.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Sixthly</hi> and Lastly, As it was an Hypocritical, so it was an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revoked</hi> sentence. It admitted not of a reprieve, no, not for a day; nor doth Christ appeal to any other Judicature, or once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the least delay of the execution. But away he is hurried in haste to the execution.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Blush, O ye heavens! and tremble, O earth, at such a sentence as this! Now is Christ dead in Law; now he knows whither he must be carried, and that presently. His soul and body must feel that, the very sight of which put him into an Agony but the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> and Lastly, In what manner did Christ receive this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and unrighteous sentence? He received it like himself, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable meekness and patience. He doth as it were wrap him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up in his own innocency, and obedience to his Fathers will: and stands at the Bar with invincible patience, and meek submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He doth not once desire the Judge to defer the sentence, much less fall down and beg for his life, as other prisoners use to do at such times. No but as a sheep he goes to the slaughter, not opening his mouth. Some apply that expression to Christ, Jam. 5.6. <hi>Ye have condemned, and killed the just, and he resisteth you not.</hi> From the time that <hi>Pilate</hi> gave sentence, till he was nailed to the Cross, we do not read that ever he said any thing, save only to the women that followed him out of the City to <hi>Golgotha:</hi> and what he said there, rather manifested his pity to them, than any discontent at what was now come upon him. <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jerusalem

                  <p>O 'tis a singular mercy to live under good Laws, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the innocent from injury.

                     <hi>here you see how Conscience may be over-born, and run down by a fleshly interest. Pilates</hi> Conscience bid him beware, and forbear; his interest bid him act: his fear of <hi>Caesar,</hi> was more than the fear of God. But oh! what a dreadful thing is it for Conscience to be ensnared by the fear of man? <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. To guard thy soul, Reader, against this mischief, let such considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these be ever with thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Consider how dear those profits or pleasures cost, which are purchased with the loss of inward peace! there is nothing in this word good enough to recompence such a loss; or ballance the misery of a tormenting Conscience. If you violate it, and prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it for a fleshly lust, it will <hi>remember</hi> the injury you did it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>Iob.</hi> 13.26. It will not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the memory of what you did, but it will <hi>accuse</hi> you for it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.4. It will not fear to tell you that plainly which others dare not whisper. It will not only accuse, but it will also <hi>condemn</hi> you for what you have done. This condemning voice of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a very terrible voice.</p>
                  <p>You may see the horror of it in <hi>Cain</hi>; the vigor of it in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>; the doleful <hi>effects</hi> of it in <hi>Spira.</hi> It will from all these its offices produce <hi>shame, fear,</hi> and <hi>despair,</hi> if God give not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to life. The <hi>shame</hi> it works will so confound you, that you will not be able to look up. <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.5. The <hi>fear</hi> it
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54346:184"/>
works will make you wish for a hole in the rock to hide you: <hi>Isai.</hi> 2.9, 10, 15, 19. And its <hi>despair</hi> is a death pang. The cutting off of hope is the greatest cut in the world. O who can stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a load as this? <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider the nature of your present actions; they are seed sown for eternity, and will spring up again in suitable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, rewards or punishments; when you that did them are turned to dust. Gal. 6.7. <hi>what a man sows, that shall he reap</hi>: and as sure as the harvest follows the seed time, so sure shall shame, fear, and horror follow sin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. What <hi>Zeuxis</hi> the famous Limner said of his work, may much more truly be said of ours, <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitati pingo,</hi> I paint for eternity said he, when one asked him why he was so curious in his work. Ah, how bitter will those things be in the account and reckoning, which were pleasant in the acting and committing! 'Tis true our actions physically considered are transient; how soon is a word or action spoken or done, and there is an end of it: but <hi>morally</hi> considered, they are permanent, being put upon Gods book of account. O therefore take heed what you do. So speak, and so act, as they that must give an account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider how by these things men do but prepare for their own torment in a dying hour. There's bitterness enough in death; you need not add more gall and wormwood, to add to the bitterness of it. What is the violencing, and wounding of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now, but the sticking so many pins or needles in your death-bed, against you come to lie down on it: this makes death bitter indeed. How many have wisht in a dying hour they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lived poor and low all their daies, than to have strained their Consciences for the world? Ah how is the face, and aspect of things altered in such an hour!</p>
                  <p>No such considerations as these had any place in <hi>Pilates</hi> heart; for if so, he would never have been courted, or scared into such an act as this.</p>

<q>It's well observed by a judicious Author, that the Tragical story of some great and noble personage, full of hero'cal vertue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity (yet inhumanely and ungratefully used) will thus work upon ingenious spirits who read or hear of it — which when it reaches no higher is so far from being faith, that it is but a carnal and fleshly devotion, springing from fancy, which is pleased with such a story and the principles of ingenuity stirred towards one, who is of a Noble Spirit and yet abused. Such stories use to stir up a principle of humanity in men unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate love, which Christ himself at his suffering found fault with, as being not spiritual nor raised enough in those women that went weeping to see the Messiah so handled. Weep not for me (saith he) that is, weep not so much for this to see me so unworthily handled by those for whom I die.</q>
This is the principle from which some conceive these tears to flow.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us consider Christs reply to them; <hi>Weep not for me ye Daughters of</hi> Jerusalem, &amp;c. Strange, that Christ should forbid them to weep for him, yea for him under such unparalell'd sufferings and miseries. If ever there was a heart-melting object in the world, it was here. O who could hold, whose heart was not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, and more obdure than the senseless rocks! This reply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Christ undergoes a double sence, and interpretation, suitable to the different construction of their sorrows. Those that look upon their sorrows as meerly natural, take Christs reply in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative sense, prohibiting such tears as those. They that expound their sorrows as the fruit of faith, tell us though the form of Christs expression be negative, yet the sense is comparative, as Matth. 9.13. <hi>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, (i. e.)</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy rather than sacrifice. So here weep rather upon your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than mine. Reserve your sorrows for the calamities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon your selves and your children. You are greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I see with the misery that is upon me; but mine will be quickly over, yours will lie long. In which he shews his merciful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate disposition, who was still more mindful of others troubles and burdens than of his own.</p>
            <p>And indeed the days of calamity coming upon them and their children, were doleful days. What direful and unpresidented mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series befel them, at the breaking up and devastation of the City, who hath not read or heard? And who can refrain from tears that hears or reads it?</p>
            <p>Now, if we take the words in the first sense, as a prohibition of their meerly natural and carnal affections, expressed in Tears and Lamentations for him; no otherwise than they would have been upon any other like Tragical story: then the observation from it, will be this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:54346:186"/>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That melting affections and sorrows, even from the sense and consideration of the sufferings of Christ; are no infallible signs of grace.</p>
            <p>If you take it in the latter sense, as the fruit of their faith, as tears flowing from a gratious principle: then the observation will be this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> That the believing meditation of what Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, is of great force and efficacy to melt and break the heart.</p>

                  <hi>Actual sorrow</hi> is the expression and manifestation of that its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, upon just occasions, and it's expressed two ways, either by the <hi>internal</hi> effects of it; which are the heaviness, shame, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, resolution, and holy revenge begotten in the soul upon the account of sin: or also by more <hi>external</hi> and visible effects, as sighs, groans, tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The former is <hi>essential</hi> to godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the latter <hi>contingent,</hi> and accidental.

               <p>
                  <hi>Natural</hi> and common meltings, are nothing else but the effects of a better temper; the fruit of a more ingenious spirit, and easier constitution, which shews it self on any other, as well as upon spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual occasions.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Austin</hi> said, he could weep plentifully, when he read the story of <hi>Dido.</hi> The history of Christ is a very tragical and pathetical history, and may melt an ingenious nature, where there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed principle at all. So that,</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our affections may be melted, even upon the score and account of Christ; and yet that is no infallible evidence of a gratious heart. And the reasons for it are,
<list>
                     <item>The first <hi>Reason,</hi> because we find all sorts of affections acted and vented, by such as have been no better than temporary believers. The stony ground hearers in Matth. 13.20. <hi>received the word with joy</hi>: and so did <hi>Iohn</hi>'s hearers also, who <hi>for a season re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oyced in his light,</hi> Joh. 3.35. Now if the affection of joy under the word may be exercised, why not of sorrow also? If the comfortable things revealed in the Gospel may stir up the one, by a parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the sad things it reveals, may answerably work upon the other. Even those <hi>Israelites</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> told that they should fall by the sword, and not prosper, for the Lord would not be with them; because they were turned away from the Lord; yet when <hi>Moses</hi> rehearsed the message of the Lord in their ears, they mourned greatly. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.39. I know the Lord pardoned too many of them their iniquites, though he took vengeance on their inventions; and yet it's as true, that with many of them God was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. Many instances of their weeping and mourning before the Lord, we find in the sacred story: and yet their hearts were not stedfast with God.</item>

                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:54346:187"/>
                        <p>The second Reason is, because though the objects, about which our affections and passions are moved, may be spiritual; yet the motives and principles that set them on work, may be but carnal, and natural ones. When I see a person affected in the hearing of the word, or prayer; even unto tears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, surely this is the effect of grace. For it's possible the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Whilst <hi>Austin</hi> was a <hi>Manichee,</hi> he sometimes heard <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and saith he, I was greatly affected in hearing him even unto tears, many times; howbeit, it was not the Heavenly nature of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but the abilities and rare parts of the speaker that so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him. And this was the case of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. Again,</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>The third Reason is, these motions of the affections, may rather be a <hi>fit</hi> and mood, than the very <hi>frame</hi> and temper of the soul. Now there is a vast difference betwixt these.<note place="margin">

                        </note> There are times and seasons when the roughest, and most obdure hearts may be pensive and tender; but that is not its temper and frame, but only a fit, a pang, a transient passion: so the Lord complains of them. Hos. 6.4. <hi>O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what shall I do unto thee, O</hi> Judah, <hi>what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew, it goeth away:</hi> and so he complains, Psal. 78.34, 35, 36. <hi>When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned, and enquired early after God. And they remembred that God was their rock, and the most high God their Redeemer; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless they did flatter him with their lips, and lyed unto him with their tongues.</hi> For had this been the gratious temper of their souls, it would have continued with them: they would not have been up and down, off and on, hot and cold with God, as they were. Therefore we conclude that we cannot infer a work of grace upon the heart, simply and meerly from the meltings and thaws that are sometimes upon it. And hence for your use I shall Infer that.</item>

utter overthrow, and undoing of multitudes of Professors.</p>
                  <p>Now, there is nothing more apt to beget and breed this vain soul undoing confidence, than the stirrings and meltings of our affections about spiritual things, whilst the heart remains unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the while.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>An. Burg.</hi>
                     </note> For (as a grave Divine hath well observed) such a man seems to have all that is required of a Christian, and herein to have attained the very end of all knowledge; which is operation and influence upon the heart and affections.</p>
                  <p>Indeed (thinks such a poor deluded soul,) if I did hear, read, or pray without any inward affections, with a dead, cold, and unconcerned heart: or if I did make shew of Zeal, and affection in dutys, and had it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well might I suspect my self to be a self-cozening Hypocrite: but its not so with me. I feel my heart really melted many times, when I read the sufferings of Christ. I feel my heart raised, and ravished with strange Joys and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, when I hear the glory of Heaven opened in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if it were not so with me, I might doubt the root of the matter is wanting. But if to my knowledge, affection be added. A melting heart, matched with a knowing head; now I may be confident all is well. I have often heard Ministers cautioning and warning their people, not to rest satisfied with idle and unpractical notions in their understandings; but to labour for impressions upon their hearts, this I have attained; and therefore what danger of me?</p>
                  <p>I have often heard it given as the mark of an Hypocrite, that he hath light in his head; but it sheds not down its influences upon the heart. Whereas in those that are sincere, it works on their hearts and affections. So I find it with me, therfore I am in a most safe estate.</p>
                  <p>O Soul, of all the false signs of grace, none more dangerous, than those that most resemble true ones. And never doth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil more surely and incurably destroy, than when transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angel of light. What if these meltings of thy heart, be but a flower of nature? What if thou art more beholding to a good temper of body, than a gratious change of spirit for these things? Well, so it may be. Therefore be not secure, but fear and watch. Possibly if thou wouldst but search thine own heart in this matter, thou maist find, that any other pathetical moving story, will have the like effects upon thee. Possibly too, thou maist find that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all thy raptures and joys at the hearing of Heaven,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54346:189"/>
and its glory; yet after that pang is over, thy heart is habitually earthly, and thy conversation is not there.</p>
                  <p>For all thou canst mourn at the relations of Christs Sufferings, thou art not so affected with sin, that was the meritorious cause of the sufferings of Christ; as to crucifie one corruption, or deny the next temptation, or part with any way of sin that is gainful, or pleasurable to thee for his sake.</p>
                  <p>Why now, Reader, if it be so with thee, what art thou the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dost think in earnest, that Christ hath the better thoughts of thee; because thou canst shed tears for him; when notwithstanding thou every day piercest and woundest him? O be not deceived. Nay for ought I know, thou maist find upon a narrow search; that thou puttest thy tears in the room of Christs blood, and givest the confidence, and dependance of thy soul to them; and if so, they shall never do thee any good.</p>
                  <p>Oh therefore search thy heart, Reader, be not too confident; take not up too easily, upon such poor weak grounds as these, a soul undoing confidence. Always remember, the Wheat and Tares r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the <hi>measure</hi> or degree of that sorrow, caused by a believing view of Christ. To express which, two of the fullest instances of grief we read of, are borrowed. That of a tender Father, mourning over a dear and only Son. That of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> mourning over <hi>Iosiah</hi> that peerless Prince, in the valley of <hi>Megiddo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to shew you how the believing meditation of Christ, and his suffering, comes kindly and savingly to break and melt down the gracious heart; I shall propound these four considerations of the heart breaking efficacy of Faith, eyeing a Crucified Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The very <hi>reallizing</hi> of Christ and his sufferings by Faith, is a most affecting and melting thing. Faith is a true Glass <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that represents all those his sufferings, and agonies to the Life. It presents them not as a fiction, or idle tale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as a true and faithful Narative. This (saith Faith) is a true and faithful saying, that Christ was not only cloathed in our flesh. He that is over all, God blessed for ever; the only Lord, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth become a man; but it is also most certain, that in this body of his flesh, he grappled with the infinite wrath of God. Which fill'd his soul with horror, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That the Lord of Life, did hang dead upon the Tree. That he went as a Lamb to the slaughter. And was as a Sheep dumb before the Shearer. That he endured all this, and more than
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54346:190"/>
any finite understanding can comprehend in my room and stead. For my sake he there groaned and bled. For my Pride, Earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Lust, Unbelief, hardness of Heart, he endured all this. I say to <hi>reallize</hi> the sufferings of Christ thus, is of great power to affect the coldest, dullest heart. You cannot imagine the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is in presenting things as realities, with convincing and satisfying evidences; and our looking on them as a fiction or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But Faith can <hi>apply,</hi> as well as reallize, and if it do so, it must needs overcome the heart.</p>
               <p>Ah, Christian, canst thou look upon Jesus as standing in thy room; to bear the wrath of a Deity for thee? Canst thou think on it, and not melt? That when thou like <hi>Isaac</hi> wast bound to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to be offered up to Justice; Christ like the <hi>Ram,</hi> was caught in the Thicket; and offered in thy room. When thy sins had raised a fearful tempest, that threatned every moment to entomb thee in a Sea of wrath; <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was thrown over to appease that storm. Say, Reader, can thy heart dwell one hour upon such a Subject as this? Canst thou with Faith present Christ to thy self, as he was taken down from the Cross; drencht in his own blood, and say, these were the wounds that he received for me. This is he that loved me, and gave himself for me. Out of these wounds comes that balm that heals my soul. Out of these stripes, my peace. When we hang'd upon the Cross, he bore my name upon his breast, like the high Priest. It was love, pure love, strong love to my poor soul, to the soul of an enemy, that drew him down from Heaven; and all the glory he had there, to endure these sorrows in soul and body for me.</p>
               <p>Oh you cannot hold up your hearts long to the piercing thoughts of this; but your bowels will be pained, and like <hi>Ioseph,</hi> you will seek a place to vent your hearts in.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith cannot only reallize and apply Christ and his death,, but it can <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>conclude</hi> such things from his death, as will fill the soul with affection to him, and break the heart in pieces in his presence. When it views Christ as Dead, it Infers; is Christ dead for me, then was I dead in Law. Sentenced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die eternally, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>If one die for all, then were all dead.</hi> How woful was my case, when the Law had past, Sentence on me? I could not be sure when I lay down, but that it might be executed before I rose. Nothing but a puff of breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my soul and Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:54346:190"/>Again, is Christ dead for me, then I shall never die. If he be condemned, I am acquitted. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It's God that justifieth, it's Christ that died,</hi> Rom. 8.34. My soul is escaped as a Bird out of the snare of the Fowler. I was condemned, but am now cleared. I was dead, but am now alive. O the unsearchable riches of grace! O Love past finding out!</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui misit fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, immisit spiritum, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> vultum; quid tandem denegabit?</hi> Prosp.</note> did God give Christ to such miseries and sufferings for me, how shall he withhold any thing now from me? He that spared not his own Son, will doubtless with him freely give me all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Now I may rest upon him for pardon, peace, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and glory for my soul. Now I may relie upon him safely, for provision, protection, and all supplies for my body. Christ is the root of all these mercys. He is more than all these, he is nearer and dearer to God, than any other gift. Oh what a blessed, happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comfortable state hath he now brought my soul into!</p>
               <p>To conclude, did Christ endure all these things for me, then it's past doubt he will never leave, nor forsake me. It cannot be that after he hath endured all this, he will cast off the souls for whom he endured it. Here the soul is Evangelically broken by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of the mercys which emerge and flow to it, out of the Sea of Christs blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly, Faith cannot only reallize, apply, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Infer, but it can also <hi>compare</hi> the love of Christ in all this, both with his dealings with others, and with the souls dealing with Christ, who so loved it. To compare Christs dealings with others, is most affected. He hath not dealt with every one, as with me. Nay, few there are that can speak of such mercies as I have from him. How many are there that have no part, nor portion in his blood? That must bear that wrath in their own persons, that he bare himself for me! He hath kissed me, over other mens shoulders. He hath reached a pardon to me, over other mens heads. He espied me out, and singled me forth to be the object of his love, leaving thousands and millions, still unreconciled. Not that I was better than they, for I was the greatest of sinners. Far from righteousness. As unlikely as any to be the object of such grace and love. My companions in sin are left, and I taken. Now the soul is full. The heart grows big, too big to contain it self.</p>

Love suitable to such love? Hast thou prized, valued, and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Christ, according to his own worth in himself, or his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to thee? Ah no, I have grieved, pierced, wounded his heart, a thousand times since that, by my ingratitude. I have suffered every trifle to justle him out of my heart. I have neglected him a thousand times, and made him say, is this thy kindness to thy friend? Is this the reward I shall have for all that I have done, and suffered for thee? Wretch that I am, how have I requited the Lord! this shames, humbles, and breakes the heart.</p>
               <p>And when from such sights of faith, and considerations as these, the heart is thus affected; it affords a good argument indeed, that thou art gone beyond all the attainments of temporary believers. Flesh and blood hath not revealed this.</p>

As if all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and tenderness were dried up. Our ears are so accustomed to the sounds of Christ, and his blood; than now they are become as common things. If a child die we can mourn over our dead; but who mourns for Christ as for an only Son? We may say of faith, when men and women sit so unaffected under the Gospel, as <hi>Martha</hi> said of Christ, concerning her brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> if thou (pretious faith) hadst been here, so many hearts had not been dead this day, and in this duty. Faith is that burning-glass which contracts the beams of the grace, and love, and wisdom, and power of Jesus Christ together; reflects these on the heart, and makes it burn; but without it, we feel nothing savingly.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> For as much as an heart so affected and melted, is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by any natural or unrenewed person. If they would give all they have in the world, it cannot purchase one such tear, or groan over Christ. Mark what characters of special grace it bears in the description that's made of it, in that forementioned place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10.

And sure the hearts of parents are not untouched, when they behold such sights.</p>

                     <hi>Nature</hi> is not the principle of it, but faith; For it's there said, they shall look on me, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> believe and mourn. <hi>Self</hi> is not the end and center of these sorrows. It is not so much for damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves, as for piercing Christ: <hi>they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and shall mourn,</hi> so that this is sorrow after God, and not a flash of nature, as was discoursed from the former point.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it's the right, so it is the choisest and most preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gift that can be given you; for it's rancked among the prime mercies of the new Covenant. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. This shall be the Covenant. <hi>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</hi> What wouldst thou have given sometimes for such an heart as now thou hast, though it be not yet as thou wouldst have it? And however you value and esteem it, God himself sets no common value on it: for mark what he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One groan, one tear, flowing from faith, and the spirit of Adoption, is more to him, than the Cattle upon a thousand hills. And to the same sense he speaks again, Isai. 66.1, 2. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build to me? and where is the place of my rest? — but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at my word; q. d.</hi> all the magnificent Temples, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious structures in the world, give me no pleasure in comparison of such a broken heart as this.</p>
                  <p>Oh then, for ever bless the Lord, that hath done that for you, which none else could do. And what he hath done but for few besides you.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> The kind and nature of the death Christ died, which is here described more generally, as a violent death. <hi>Ye have slain him:</hi> and more particularly, as a most ignominious, cursed, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable death; <hi>ye have crucified him.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The causes of it are here likewise expressed: and that both principal and instrumental. The principal cause, permitting, ordering, and disposing all things about it, was the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. There was not an action or circumstance, but came under this most wise and holy counsel, and determination of God.</p>
            <p>The Instruments effecting it, were their wicked hands. This foreknowledge and counsel of God,<note place="margin">

And it cannot excuse their action from one circumstance of sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because Gods end and manner of acting was one thing; their end and manner of acting another. His most pure and holy; theirs most malitious, and daringly wicked. <hi>Idem quod duo faciunt, non est idem.</hi> To this purpose a grave Divine will expresses it.</p>
            <p>In respect of God,<note place="margin">Morning exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise at <hi>Giles</hi>'s. p. 289.</note> Christs death was Justice and Mercy.

               <head>DOCT. That our Lord Iesus Christ was not only put to death,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> but to the worst of deaths, even the death of the Cross.</head>
               <p>To this the Apostle gives a plain testimony, Phil. 2.8. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient to death, even the death of the Cross:</hi> where his humiliation is both specified; he was humbled to death; and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by a most emphatical reduplication, even the death of the Cross. So Act. 5.30. <hi>Iesus whom ye slew, and hanged upon a tree, q. d.</hi> it did not suffice you to put him to a violent, but you also put him to the most base, vile, and ignominious death: you <hi>hanged him on a tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this point we will discuss these three particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> the nature, or kind; the <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>reasons</hi> of Christs death upon the tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I shall open the <hi>kind</hi> or nature of this death, by shewing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you that it was a <hi>violent, painful, shameful, cursed, slow,</hi> and <hi>succourless</hi> death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It was a <hi>violent</hi> death, that Christ died. <hi>Violent</hi> in it self, though <hi>voluntary</hi> on his part. <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living,</hi> Isai. 53.8. And yet <hi>he laid down his life of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; no man took it from him,</hi> Joh. 10.17. I call his death vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, because he died not a natural death, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he lived not till nature was consumed with age, as it is in many who live till their <hi>balsamum radicale</hi> radical moisture, like the oyl in the Lamp, be quite consumed, and then go out like an expiring Lamp. It was not so with Christ. For he was but in the very flower and prime of his time when he died. And indeed he must either die a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, or not die at all; partly because there was no sin in him, to open a door to natural death; as it doth in all others. Partly because else his death had not been a sacrifice acceptable and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to God for us. That which died of it self, was never offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to God; but that which was slain when it was in its full strength and health.<note place="margin">Joh. 2.19.</note> The Temple was a Type of the body of Christ. Now, when the Temple was destroyed, it did not drop down as an antient structure decayed by time; but was pulled down by violence, when it was standing in its full strength. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The death of the Cross was a most <hi>painful</hi> death. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this death were many deaths contrived in one. The Cross was a Rack, as well as a Gibber. The pains Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Cross, are by the Apostle emphatically stiled <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The death of the Cross, was a <hi>shameful</hi> death.

                        </gap>tur. Sis</hi> Bonfierius.</note> doth not at all mitigate, but rather aggravates this curse: speaking the person to be so abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that as he is lifted up into the air, and hanging between heaven and earth, as unworthy ever to set foot more upon the earth; so when dead, they were to hasten to bury him; that such an abominable sight might be removed assoon as might be, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of men. And that the earth might not be defiled, by his lying on the surface of it, when taken down.</p>
               <p>However, as the Learned <hi>Iunius</hi> hath Judiciously observed, that this curse is only a Ceremonial curse. For otherwise it's neither in it self, nor by the Law of nature, or by civil Law, more exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable than any other death. And the main reason why the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law affixed the curse to this rather than any other death, was principally with respect to the death Christ was to die. And therefore, Reader, see and admire the providence of God, that Christ should die by a <hi>Roman</hi> and not by a <hi>Iudaick</hi> Law. For Crucifying, or Hanging on the Tree; was a <hi>Roman</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not in use among the Jews. But the Scriptures cannot be broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The death of the Cross was a very <hi>slow,</hi> and lingering death. They died leisurably. Which still increaseth, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth the misery of it. If a man must die a violent death, it's a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be dispatcht. As they that are pressed to death, beg for more weight. And it's a favour to those that are hanged, to be smitten on the breast, or plucked by the heels, by their friends. On the contrary to hang long in the midst of tortures, to have death coming upon us with a slow pace, that we may feel every tread of it, as it comes on, is a misery.</p>
               <p>The Tyrant that heard the poor Martyr was dead under his first torments, said as one disappointed, <hi>Evasit.</hi> He hath escaped me.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54346:195"/>
For he intended to have kept him much longer under torments. And it was the cruel counsel of another to his executioner; <hi>Let him die so,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moriatur, ut sentiat se mori.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as he may feel himself how he dies.</hi> And surely in this respect it was worse for Christ, than any other that was ever nailed to the Tree. For all the while he hanged there, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full of life, and acute sence. His life departed not gradually, but was whole in him to the last. Other men die gradually, and towards their end their sence of pain is much blunted. They faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fumble, and expire by degrees; but Christ stood under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It was a <hi>succourless</hi> and helpless death to Christ. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they gave to malefactors amidst their torments, Vinegar, and Myrh to blunt, dull, and stupifie their Sences. And if they hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, would break their bones, to dispatch them out of their pains. Christ had none of this favour. Instead of Vinegar and Myrh, they gave him Vinegar and Gall to drink, to aggravate his torments. And for the breaking of his bones, he prevented it, by dying before they come to break his legs. For the Scriptures must be fulfilled, which saith, <hi>not a bone of him shall be broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This now was the kind and nature of that death he died. Even the violent, painful, shameful, cursed, slow, and succourless death of the Cross. An Ancient punishment both among the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But in honour of Christ, who died this death, <hi>Constantine</hi> the great abrogated it by Law,<note place="margin">Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note> ordaining that none should ever be Crucified any more, because Christ died that Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the manner of the execution. They that were condemned to the death of the Cross,<note place="margin">Godwins An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. lib 3. Sect. 3. p. 192.</note> (saith a Learned Antiquary of our own,) bare their Cross upon their own shoulders, to the place of execution. Then was stript of all their cloaths, for they suffered naked. And then were fastned to the Cross with nails.</p>
               <p>The manner how that was done, one gives us in these words, They stretch him out (meaning Christ) like another <hi>Isaac</hi> upon his own burden,<note place="margin">

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54346:195"/>
the true length of his body; yet how strictly do they take it longer than the truth. Thereby at once to Crucifie, and rack him. Then being nailed, like as <hi>Moses</hi> lifted up the Serpent, so was the Son of man lifted up. And when the Cross, with the Lord fastned on it, fell into its socket, or basis; it Jerked the whole, and every part of his sacred body. And the whole weight hanging on his nailed hands, the wounds by degrees grew wider and wider: till at last he expired in the midst of those tortures.</p>
               <p>And that the equity of their proceedings might the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to the people; the cause of the punishment was written in Capital Letters, and fixed to the Tree over the head of the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Of this appendant to this kind of death, I shall speak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly in the next Sermon, before I come to handle the manner of his death: there being so much of providence in that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as invites us to spend more than a few transient thoughts upon it. Mean while in the next place</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We will enquire briefly into the reasons why Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> died this, rather than any other kind of death. And amongst others, these three are obvious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because Christ must bear the curse in his death,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Potissima causa mal dictionis hujus est quia Christus i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterio praesigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur.</hi> Masius.</note> and a curse by Law affixed to no other kind of death, as it was to this. The Learned <hi>Masius</hi> upon <hi>Iosuah</hi> 2.29. Commenting upon the death of the King of Ai, who was hanged on the Tree, until evening, tells us that the principal reason of the malediction and execrableness of this death was, because the death of Christ was prefigured in that mysterie. Christ came to take away the curse from us, by this death; and so must be made a curse. On him must all the curses of the Moral Law lie, which were due to us. And that nothing might be wanting to make it a full curse; the very death he died, must also have a Ceremonial curse upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ died this, rather than any other kind of death; to fulfil the Types, and prefigurations that of old were made with respect to it. All the Sacrifices were lifted up from the earth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar. But especially the brassen Serpent prefigured this death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Moses</hi> made a Serpent of Brass and put it upon a pole. And saith Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>As</hi> Moses <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</hi> that so he might correspond with that lively Type, made of him in the wilderness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:54346:196"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ died this, rather than any other death, because it was predicted of him, and in him must all the predictions, as well as Types be fully accomplished. The Psalmist spake in the person of Christ, of this death, as plainly as if he had rather been writing the History of what was done, than a Prophesie of what was to be done, so many years afterwards, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.16, 17. For dogs have compassed me about, the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me; they pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones, they look and stare upon me. Which hath a manifest reference to the dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntion of all his members upon the Tree, which was as a rack to him. So <hi>Zech</hi> 12.10. They shall look upon me, whom they have pierced. Yea, Christ himself had foretold the death he should die, in the forecited, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14. Saying, he must be lifted up, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> hanged between heaven and earth. And the Scriptures must be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Thus you have a brief account both of the kind, manner, and reasons of this death of Christ. The improvement of it, you have in the following Inferences of truth, diducible from it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pardon for he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of sinners.</note> 
                     <hi>and plenteous redemption for the greatest of Sinners; that by Faith apply the blood of the Cross, to their poor guilty Souls.</hi> So speaks the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.</hi> And 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.</hi> Two things will make this demonstrable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That there is <hi>sufficient efficacy</hi> in this blood of the Cross, to expiate the greatest Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the efficacy of it <hi>is designed</hi> and intended by God for believing sinners. How clearly do both these propositions lie in the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That there is sufficient efficacy in the blood of the Cross, to expiate and wash away the greatest sins. This is manifest, for it is <hi>pretious blood,</hi> as it's call'd, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold; but with the pretious blood of the Son of God.</hi> This pretiousness of the blood of Christ rises from the union it hath with that person, who is over all God
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54346:196"/>
blessed for ever. And on that account is stiled the blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. And so it becomes Royal, Princely blood. Yea, such for the dignity, and efficacy of it, as never was created, or shall ever run in any other veins, but his. The blood of all the creatures in the world, even a Sea of humane blood; bears no more proportion to the pretious and excellent blood of Christ, than a dish of common water, to a Riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r of liquid Gold. On the account of its invaluable pretiousness, it becomes satisfying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling blood to God. So the Apostle speaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And (having made peace through the Blood of his Cross,) by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</hi> The same blood which is <hi>Redemption</hi> to them that dwell on earth, is <hi>Confirmation</hi> to them that dwell in Heaven. Before the efficacy of this blood guilt vanishes, and shrinks away; as the the shadows before the glorious Sun. Every drop of it hath a voice, and speaks to the soul that sits trembling under its guilt, better things, than the blood of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.24. It sprinkles us from an evil, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> an unquiet, and accusing conscience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. For having enough in it to satisfie God, it must needs have enough in it to satisfie conscience.</p>
                  <p>Conscience can demand no more for its satisfaction, nor will it take less, than God demands for his satisfaction. And in this blood is enough to give both satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As there is sufficient Efficacy in this blood, to expiate the greatest guilt; so it's as manifest, that the vertue and efficacy of it, is intended and designed by God for the Use of believing sinners. Such blood as this was shed without doubt for some weighty end. That some might be the better for it. Who they are for whom it is intended, is plain enough from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>And by him all that believe, are justified from all things; from which they could not be justified by the Law of</hi> Moses.</p>
                  <p>That the remission of the sins of believers was the great thing designed in the pouring out of this pretious blood of Christ, appears from all the Sacrifices that figured it to the ancient Church. The sheding of that Typical blood, spake a design of pardon. And the putting of their hands upon the head of the Sacrifice, spake the way and Method of believing, by which that blood was then applyed to them in that way: and is still applyed to us in a more excellent way. Had no pardon been intended, no Sacrifices had been appointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:54346:197"/>Moreover, let it be considered; this blood of the Cross is the blood of a surety; that came under the same obligations with us, and in our name or stead shed it: and so of course frees and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the principal offender, or debtor. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Can God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act satisfaction from the blood and death of his own Son, the sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Believers; and yet still demand it from Believers? It cannot be. <hi>Who</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that Iustifieth. Who shall condemn? It is Christ that died,</hi> Rom. 8.33, 34. And why are faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prescribed as the <hi>means</hi> of pardon? Why doth God every where in his word, call upon sinners to repent, and believe in this blood? Encouraging them so to do, by so many pretious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of remission: and declaring the inevitable and eternal ruine of all impenitent and unbelieving ones, who despise and reject this blood? What I say, doth all this speak, but the possibility of a pardon for the greatest of sinners; and the certainty of a free, full, and final pardon, for all believing sinners? O what a Joyful sound is this? What ravishing voices of peace, pardon, grace, and acceptance come to our ears, from the blood of the Cross!</p>
                  <p>The greatest guilt that ever was contracted upon a trembling sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Conscience, can stand before the efficacy of the blood of Christ, no more, than the sinner himself can stand before the Justice of the Lord, with all the guilt upon him.</p>
                  <p>Reader, The word assures thee; what ever thou hast been, or art; that sins of as deep a die as thine, have been washt away in this blood. <hi>I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, in urious; but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. but it may be thou wilt object: this was a rare and singular instance, and it's a great questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether any other sinner shall find the like grace, that he did. No question of it at all, if you believe in Christ, as he did: for he tells us vers. 16. <hi>For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Iesus Christ might shew forth all long suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter belief on him, to life everlasting.</hi> So that upon the same grounds he obtained mercy, you may obtain it also.</p>
                  <p>Those very men who had an hand in the sheding of Christs blood, had the benefit of that blood afterwards pardoning them. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. There is nothing but unbelief and impenitency of heart, bars thy soul from the blessings of this blood.</p>

                     <hi>then though there may be much of pain, there is nothing of curse in the death of the Saints.</hi> It still wears its dart, by which it strikes; but hath lost its sting by which it hurts and destroys. A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that hath no sting, may hiss and affright; but we may take him in our hand without danger. Death poured out all its poison, and lost its sting in Christs side, when he became a curse for us.</p>
                  <p>But what speak I of the innocency and harmlesness of death to believers. It is certainly their friend, and great benefactor. As there is no curse, so there are many blessings in it. <hi>Death is yours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22. Yours as a special priviledge and favour. Christ hath not only conquered it, but is more than a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; for he hath made it beneficial, and very serviceable to the saints. When Christ was nailed to the tree, then he said as it were to death which came to grapple with him there; <hi>O death I will be thy plagues, O grave I will be thy destruction</hi>; And so he was: for he swallowed up death in victory. Spoiled it of its power. So that it drives but a poor trade now among believers; frighting some weak ones among them, though it cannot hurt them at all.</p>

'Tis true, Christ and his Cross are not separable in this life, how be it, Christ and his Cross part at Heavens door. For there is no house-room for crosses in Heaven. One tear, one sigh, one sad heart, one fear, one loss, one thought of trouble, cannot find lodging there.</q>
— Sorrow and the saints are not married together; or suppose it were so, Heaven shall make a divorce. Life is but short, and therefore crosses cannot be long. Our sufferings are but for a while. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. They are but the sufferings of the present time. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we shall carry the Cross of Christ but a little way, so Christ himself bears the heaviest end of it. There is a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in sufferings, betwixt Christ and his saints. And as one hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily expresses, he saith of their crosses <hi>half mine.</hi> He divideth sufferings with them and takes the largest share to himself.
<q>O how sweet a sight (saith one sweetly) is it to see a cross betwixt Christ and us. To hear our Redeemer say, at every sigh, at every blow, and every loss of a Believer <hi>half mine.</hi> For they are called the sufferings of Christ, and the reproach of Christ. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. As when two are partners and owners of a Ship, half of the gain and half of the loss belongeth to either of the two. So Christ in our sufferings, is half gainer and half loser with us: yea, the heaviest end of the black tree

lyeth on your Lord. It falleth first upon him, and but rebounds from him upon you: <hi>the reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me.</hi>
                     </q>
Psal. 69.9. Nay to speak as the thing is, Christ doth not only bear half, or the better part; but the whole of our cross and burden. Yea, he bears all, and more than all; for he bears us, and our burden too; or else we should quickly sink, and faint under it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As we have not far to carry it, and Christ carries the haviest part; yea, all the burden for us; yea, us, and our burden too: So in the last place it's reviving to think what an innumerable multitude of blessings and mercies are the fruit and off-spring of a sanctified cross. Since that tree was so richly watered with the blood of Christ; what store of choice, and rich fruits doth it bear to believers?</p>
                  <p>Our sufferings (saith one) are washed in the blood of Christ, as well as our souls.
<q>For Christs merits bought a blessing to the crosses of the sons of God. Our troubles owe us a free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through him. Devils, and men, and crosses are our deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and death, and all storms are our debtors, to blow our poor tossed bark over the water fraught-free: and to set the Travellers in their own known ground. Therefore we shall die, and yet live. — I know no man hath a velvet cross, but the cross is made of what God will have it; but verily, how be it, it be no warrantable market to buy a cross, yet I dare not say, O that I had liberty to sell Christs cross, lest therewith also I should sell joy, comfort, sence of love, patience, and the kind visits of a Bridegroom. — I have but small experience of sufferings for Christ, but let my Judge and witness in Heaven, lay my soul in the ballance of Justice; If I find not a young Heaven, and a little Paradise of glorious comforts, and soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting love kisses of Christ, in suffering for him and his truth. — My prison is my palace, my sorrow is with child of Joy. My losses are rich losses, my pain easie pain, my heavy days are holy days, and happy days. I may tell a new tale of Christ to my friends. — Oh what owe I to the file, and to the hammer, and to the furnace of my Lord Jesus! who hath now let me see how good the wheat of Christ is, that goes through his mill, and his oven; to be made bread for his own Table. Grace tried, is better than grace, and more than grace; It's glory in the Infancy.</q>

               <p>And indeed unto this the providence of God had a special eye, to make it notorious and evident to all the world. For even so all things design'd, for publick view, and knowledge were written.

                  <hi>It is a wickedness for strangers to enter into the holy place.</hi> So the Souldiers of <hi>Gordian</hi> the third Emperour, when he was slain upon the borders of <hi>Persia,</hi> they raised a Monument for him, and engraved his memorial upon it, in <hi>Greek, Latine, Persick, Iudaick,</hi> and <hi>Egyptick</hi> Letters; that all people might read the same. And as it was written in three Learned Languages, so it was exposed to view in a publick place; and at that time, when multitudes of <hi>strangers,</hi> as well as <hi>Iews</hi> were at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: it was at the time of the Passover. So that all things concurred to spread and divulge the innocency of Christ, vindicated in this Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it was a publick, so it was an <hi>honourable</hi> Title. Such was the nature of it,<note place="margin">Bucer. in Loc.</note> saith <hi>Bucer</hi>; that in the midst of death Christ began to Triumph by it. And by reason thereof the Cross began to change its own nature, and instead of a rack, or Engine of torture, it became a Throne of Majesty. Yea, it might be called now, as the Church it self is, <hi>the Pillar and ground of Truth</hi>; for it held out much of the Gospel, much of the glory of Christ; as that Pillar doth, to which a Royal Proclamation is affixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It was a <hi>vindicating</hi> Title. It clear'd up the honour, dignity, and innocency of Christ, against all the false imputations, calumnies, and blasphemies, which were cast upon him before, by the wicked tongues, both of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had called him a deceiver, a usurper, a blasphemer, they rent their cloaths in token of their detestation of his blasphemy; because he made himself the Son of God, and King of <hi>Israel.</hi> But now in this they acknowledged him to be, both Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Not a mock King, as they had made him before. So that herein the honour of Christ was fully vindicated.</p>

Evidently foreshewing, the propagation of Christs Kingdom; and the spreading of his name and glory, among all kindreds, Nations, Tongues, and Languages. As Christ hath a right to enter into all the Kingdoms of the earth by his Gospel, and set up his Throne in every Nation: so it was presaged by this Title, that he should do so. And that both Hebrews, Greeks, and Latines, should be called to the knowledge of him. Nor is it a wonder that this should be predicted by wicked <hi>Pilate,</hi> when <hi>Caiaphas</hi> himself, a
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54346:202"/>
man every way as wicked as he; had Prophesied to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.51, 52. For being High Priest that year, he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And Lastly, it was an immutable Title. The Jews endeavoured, but could not perswade <hi>Pilate</hi> to alter it. To all their importunities he returns this resolue answer, <hi>What I have written I have written</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Haec</hi> Pilati <hi>constantia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae tribuenda est.</hi> Calv.</note> as if he should say, urge me no more, I have written his Title, I cannot, I will not alter a Letter, a Point thereof. Surely the constancy of <hi>Pilate</hi> at this time, can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to nothing, but divine special Providence. Most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he, who before was as unconstant, as a reed shaken by the wind, is now as fixed as a Pillar of Brass.</p>
               <p>And yet more wonderful that he should write down that very particular in the Title of Christ, <hi>This is the King of the Iews,</hi> which was the very thing, that so scared him but a little before, and was the very consideration that moved him to give Sentence. What was now become of the fear of <hi>Caesar?</hi> that <hi>Pilate</hi> dares to be Christs Herald, and publickly to proclaim him <hi>The King of the Iews.</hi> This was the Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shall next enquire what hand the divine providence had in this business.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the providence of God in this hour acted gloriously, and wonderfully these five ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> In over ruling the heart and hand of <hi>Pilate,</hi> in that draught and stile of it, and the contrary to his own inclination. I doubt not but <hi>Pilate</hi> himself was ignorant of, and far enough from design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which the wisdom of Providence aimed at,<note place="margin">

Yet this is he that proclaimed him, to be <hi>Iesus, King of the Iews.</hi> It so over ruled his Pen, that he could not write what was in his own heart and intention, but the quite contrary; even a fair and publick Testimony to the Kingly office of the Son of God, <hi>This is the King of the Iews.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Herein the wisdom of providence was gloriously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied, in applying a present, proper, publick remedy, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54346:202"/>
and blasphemies which Christ had then newly received, in his name and honour. The superstitious <hi>Iews</hi> wound him, and Heathen <hi>Pilate</hi> prepares a plaister to heal him. They reproach, he vindicates. They throw the dirt, he washes it off. O, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and inscrutable wisdom of providence!</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Morever, providence eminently appear'd at this time, in keeping so timerous a person, a man of so base a spirit, that would not stick at any thing to please the people, from receding, or giving ground in the least to their importunities. Is <hi>Pilate</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man of such resolution and constancy? Whence is this? But from the God of the Spirits of all flesh. Who now flowed in so powerfully upon his Spirit, that he could not chuse but write: and when he had written, had no more power to alter what he had written, that he had to refuse to write it.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Herein also much of the wisdom of providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, in casting the ignominy of the death of Christ upon those very men who ought to bear it. <hi>Pilate</hi> was moved by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, at once to clear Christ, and accuse them. For it is, as if he had said you have moved me to Crucifie your King, I have Crucified him, and now let the ignominy of his death rest upon your heads, who have extorted this from me. He is righteous, the crime is not his but yours.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And lastly, the providence of God wonderfully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it self, (as before was noted) in fixing this Title to the Cross of Christ, when there was so great a confluence of all sorts of people, to take notice of it. So that it could never have been more advantagiously published, than it was at this time. So that we may say, how wonderful are the works of God! His ways are in the Sea, his paths in the great deeps; his footsteps are not known. His providence hath a prospect beyond the understandings of all Creatures.</item>

The Jews thought when they Crowned Christ with Thorns, bowed the knee, and mocked him; led him to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and crucified him; that now they had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispoiled him of all his Kingly dignities: and yet even there, he is proclaimed a King. Thus the dispersion of the Jews upon the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> spread the Gospel far and near, <hi>For they went every where Preaching the Word,</hi> Acts 8.4. Thus <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds for the Gospel, fell out to the furtherance of the Gospel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12.

He did that for Christ that not one of his own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at that time durst do, and yet this service was not accepted of God; because he did it not designedly for his glory, but from the meer over rulings of providence.</p>
                  <p>If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted, according to what a man hath, saith the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. The eye of God is first and mainly upon the will; if that be sincere and right for God, small things will be accepted; and if not, the greatest shall be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

If I do this thing, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> (Preach the Gospel) willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me, <hi>q. d.</hi> If I upon pure principles of Faith and Love, from my heart, designing the glory of God, and delighting to promote it by my ministry, do chearfully and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply my self to the Preaching of the Gospel, I shall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and reward with God: but if my work be a burden to me, and the service of God esteemed as a bondage; why then provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may use me for the dispensing of the Gospel to others, but
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54346:203"/>
I my self shall lose both reward and comfort. As it doth not excuse my sin, that God can bring glory to himself out of it: so neither doth it justifie an action, that God hath praise and honour acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally by it. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that even the strife and envy in which some Preached Christ, should turn to his salvation; and yet he was not at all beholding to them for promoting his salvation that way. So <hi>Pilate</hi> here promotes the honour of Jesus Christ to whom he had no Love, and whose glory he did not at all design in this thing; and therefore hath neither acceptance nor reward with God.</p>
                  <p>O, therefore what ever you do for Christ do it heartily, design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, for his glory. Of a ready and willing mind. With pure and sincere aims at his glory.

them. To be called out to suffer for Christ, is a great honour. Yea, an honour peculiar to the saints. The damned suffer from Christ, the wicked suffer for their sins.

                  <p>And as there is a great deal of honour in being called forth to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on Christs account; so Christ will confer special honour upon his suffering saints, in the day of their reward.

            <p>IN the former Sermons, we have opened the nature and kind of the death Christ died; even the cursed death of the Cross. Wherein, nevertheless his innocency was vindicated, by that honourable Title providentially affixed to his Cross. Method now requires that we take into consideration the manner in which he endured the Cross, and that was <hi>solitarily, meekly,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:54346:207"/>His solitude in suffering is plainly expressed in this Scripture now before us. It cannot be doubted, but the Prophet in this place speaks of Christ if you consider, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31. Where you shall find these words applyed to Christ by his own accommodation of them. <hi>Then said Iesus unto them, all ye shall be offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of me this might, for it is written I will smite the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</hi> Besides the Title here given [Gods Fellow] is too big for any creature in Heaven or Earth beside Christ.</p>
            <p>In these words we have four things particularly to consider. <hi>First,</hi> the Commission given to the Sword by the Lord of Hosts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the person against whom it is Commissionated. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the dismal effect of that stroke. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and lastly, the gracious mitigation of it.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> The Commission given to the Sword by the Lord of Hosts, <hi>Awake, O Sword and smite, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> The Lord of Hosts, at whose beck and command all the Creatures are. Who with a word of his mouth can open all the Armories in the World, and command what weapons, and instruments of death he pleaseth. Calls here for the Sword. Not the Rod, gently to chasten. But the Sword to destroy. The Rod breaks no bones, but the Sword opens the door to death and destruction. The Strokes and thrusts of the Sword are mortal.<note place="margin">

So the same word is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.29. Yea, he commands it to awake and <hi>smite.</hi> And it is as if the Lord had said come forth of thy Scabbard oh Sword of Justice, thou hast been hid there a long time, thou hast as it were been asleep in thy Scabbard, now awake and glitter, thou shalt Drink Royal Blood, such as thou never shedst before.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have here the dismal consequent of this deadly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> stroke upon the Shepherd. And that is the scattering of the Sheep. By the Sheep understand here that little flock the Disciples which followed this Shepherd till he was smitten <hi>(i. e.)</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by his enemies, and then they were scattered, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, they all forsook him and fled. And so Christ was left alone amidst his enemies. Not one durst make a stand for him, or owne him in that hour of his danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, here is a gracious mitigation of this sad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> dispersion, <hi>I will turn my hand upon the little ones.</hi> By little ones he means the same that before he called Sheep; but the expression is designedly varied to shew their feebleness and weakness which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their relapse from Christ. And by turning his hand upon them, understand Gods gracious reduction and gathering of them again after their sad dispersion, so that they shall not be lost though scattered for the present. For after the Lord was risen, he went before them into <hi>Galilee,</hi> as he promised, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31. And ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd them again by a gracious hand, so that not one of them was lost but the Son of perdition.</p>

                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:54346:208"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, what was the Issue and event of it?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Who were these Sheep, that were dispersed and scattered from their Shepherd when he was smitten. It's evident they were those pretious Elect Souls that he had gathered to himself, who had long followed him, and dearly Loved him, and were dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of him. They were persons that had left all and followed him, and till that time faithfully continued with him in his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.28. And were all resolved so to do, though they should die with him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.35. These were the persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But were they as good as their word, did they indeed stick faithfully to him? No, they all forsook him and fled. These Sheep were scattered. This was not indeed a Total and final Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, that's the fall proper to the Hypocrite the Temporary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who like a Comet expires when that earthly matter is spent that maintain'd the blaze for a time.</p>
               <p>These were Stars fixed in their Orb, though clouded and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast for a time. This was but a mist or fog which overspreads the earth in the morning till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Sun be risen, and then it clears up and proves a fair day. But though it was not a total and final Apostacy: yet it was a very sinful and sad relapse from Jesus Christ, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by considering the following aggravations, and circumstances of it. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This relapse of theirs was against the very Articles of agreement which they had sealed to Christ at their first admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his service, he had told them in the beginning what they must resolve upon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 27. If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannnot be my Disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his Cross and come after me, cannot be my Disciple. Accordingly, they submitted to these terms and told him, they had left all and followed him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.28. Against this ingagement made to Christ they now sin. Here was unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was against the very terms of their admission, so it was against the very principles of Grace implanted by Christ in their hearts. They were holy sanctified persons in whom dwelt the love and fear of God. By these they were strongly inclined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Christ in the time of his sufferings, as appears by those honest resolves they had made in the case. Their Grace strongly inclined them to their Duty, their corruptions sway'd them the contrary
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54346:208"/>
way. Grace bid them stand, corruption bid them fly. Grace told them it was their Duty to share in the sufferings as well as in the glory of Christ. Corruption represented these sufferings as intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and bid them shift for themselves whilst they might. So that here must needs be a force and violence offer'd to their light, and the loving constraints thereof, which is no small evil.</p>
               <p>For though I grant it was a suddain surprizing temptation, yet it cannot be imagined that this fact was wholly indeliberate, nor that for so long time they were without any debates or reasonings about their Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it was against their own principles, so it was much against the honour of their Lord and Master. By this their sinful flight they exposed the Lord Jesus to the contempt and scorn of his enemies. This some conceive is imported in that question which the High Priest asked him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.19. <hi>The High Priest then asked Iesus of his Disciples, and of his Doctrine.</hi> He asked him of his Disciples, how many he had, and what was become of them now? And what was the reason they forsook their Master, and left him to shift for himself when danger appeared? But to those questions Christ made no reply. He would not accuse them to their enemies, though they had deferted him. But doubtless it did not a little reflect upon Christ, that there was not one of all his friends that durst owne their relation to him, in a time of danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As it was against Christs honour, so it was against their own solemn promise made to him before his apprehension, to live and die with him. They had past their word, and given their promise that they would not flinch from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.35. <hi>Peter said to him, though I should dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the Disciples.</hi> This made it a perfidious relapse. Here they brake promise with Christ, who never did so with them. He might have told them when he met them afterwards in <hi>Gallilee.</hi> As the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier told his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral when he refused his petition after the war was ended, I did not serve you so at the Battle of <hi>Acteum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As it was against their solemn promise to Christ, so it was against Christs heart melting expostulations with them; which should have abode upon their hearts while they lived. For when others that followed him, went back, and walked no more with him, Jesus said to these very men that now forsook him at last, <hi>Will ye also go away?</hi> There is an Emphasis in [Ye] <hi>q. d.</hi> What
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54346:209"/>
ye that from eternity were given to me. Ye whom I have called, loved and honoured above others, for whose sakes I am ready and resolved to die. Will <hi>ye</hi> also forsake me? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.67. What ever others do, I expect other things from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As it was against Christs heart melting expostulations with them, so it was against a late direful example presented to them in the fall of <hi>Iudas.</hi> In him as in a Glass they might see how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing it is to apostatize from Christ. They had heard Christs dreadful threats against him. They were present when he call'd him the Son of perdition, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.11. They had heard Christ to say of him, <hi>good had it been if he had never been born.</hi> An expression able to scare the deadest heart. They saw he had left Christ the evening before. And that very day in which they fled, he hang'd himself. And yet they fly. For all this they forsake Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> As it was against the dreadful warning given them in the fall of <hi>Iudas,</hi> so it was against the Law of Love, which should have knit them closer to Christ and one another.</p>
               <p>If to avoid the present shock of persecution they had fled, yet surely they should have kept together praying, watching, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, and stengthening one another. This had made it a lesser evil: but as they all forsook Christ, so they forsook one another also; For it's said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.32. <hi>They should go every man to his own, and leave Christ alone</hi> (i. e.) saith <hi>Beza,</hi> every man to his own house, and to his own business. They forsook each other, as well as Christ. O what an hour of temptation was this!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> And lastly, this their departure from Christ was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with some offence at Christ. For so he tells them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31.<note place="margin">

                  </gap> you shall be scandalized, at me, or in me. Some think the scandal they took at Christ was this, that when they saw he was fallen into his enemies hands, and could no longer defend himself; they then began to question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were the Christ or no, since he could not defend himself from his enemies. Others more rightly understand it of their shameful flight from Christ, seeing it was not now safe to abide longer with him. That seeing he gave himself into their hands, they thought it advisable to provide as well as they could for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and some where or other to take refuge from the present storm, which had over taken him. This was the nature and quality of the fact. We enquire</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:54346:209"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Into the grounds and reasons of it. Which were three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Gods suspending wonted influences and aids of grace from them. They were not wont to do so. They never did so after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. They would not have done so now, had there been influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Power, Zeal, and Love from Heaven upon them. But how then should Christ have born the heat and burden of the day? How should he tread the Wine Press alone. How should his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows have been extream, unmixed and succourless (as it behoved them to be) if they had stuck faithfully to him in his troubles. No, no, it must not be. Christ must not have the least relief or comfort from any creature, and therefore that he might be left alone, to grapple hand to hand with the wrath of God, and of men; the Lord for a time withholds his incouraging, strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences from them, and then like <hi>Sampson</hi> when he had lost his locks, they were weak as other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. If that be withheld, our resolutions, and purposes melt away before a temptation, as Snow before the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God permitted it, and withheld usual aid from them; so the efficacy of that Temptation was great, yea, much greater than ordinary. As they were weaker than they were used to be, so the temptation was stronger than any they had yet met withal. It's call'd, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.53. <hi>Their hour, and the power of darkness.</hi> A sisting <hi>winnowing hour,</hi> vers. 46. O it was a black and cloudy day. Never had the Disciples met with such a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, such a furious storm before. The Devil desired but to have the winnowing of them in that day, and so would have sifted and winnowed them, that their faith had utterly failed, had not Christ secured it by his Prayer for them. So that it was an extraordinary tryal that was upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And lastly, that which concurred to their shameful relapse, as a special cause of it was the remaining corruptions that were in their hearts yet unmortified. Their knowledge was but little. And their faith not much. Upon the account of their weakness in grace, they were called <hi>little ones</hi> in the Text. And as their graces were weak, so their corruptions were strong. Their Unbelief and carnal fears grew powerfully upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:54346:210"/>Do not censure them, Reader, in thy thoughts, nor despise them for this their weakness. Neither say in thy heart, had I been there as they were, I would never have done as they did. They thought as little of doing what they did, as you or any of the Saints do, and as much did their souls detest and abhor it: but here thou maist see whither a soul that fears God may be carried, if his corruptions be irritated by strong temptations, and God withholds usual influences.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly, Let us view the issue of this sad aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theirs. And you shall find it ended far better than it began. Though these Sheep were scattered for a time, yet the Lord made good his promise, in turning his hand upon these little ones to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them. The morning was overcast, but the evening was clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> repents of his perfidious denial of Christ, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him more. All the rest likewise returned to Christ, and never forsook him any more. He that was afraid at the the voice of a Damsel, afterwards feared not the frowns of the mighty. And they that durst not own Christ now, afterward confessed him openly before Councils, and rejoyced that they were counted worthy to suffer for his sake, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. They that were now as timerous at Hares, and started at every sound, afterwards became as bold as Lyons, and feared not any danger, but sealed their confession of Christ with their blood. For though at this time they forsook him, it was not voluntarily, but by surprizal. Though they forsook, him, they still loved him; though they fled from him, there still remained a gratious principle in them, the root of the matter still was in them, which recovered them again.</p>
               <p>To conclude, though they forsook Christ, yet Christ never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook them; he loved them still: <hi>go tell the Disciples, and tell</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>that he goeth before you into</hi> Galilee, Mark 16.7. <hi>q. d.</hi> let them not think that I so remember their unkindness, as to own them no more: no I love them still.</p>
               <p>The use of this is contained in the following Inferences.</p>

                  <p>Little reason have the best of Saints to depend upon their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace, let their stock be as large as it will. The Angels left to themselves, quickly left their own habitation, <hi>Iude</hi> 6. upon which one well observes, that the best of created perfections are of themselves defectible. Every excellency without the prop of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preservation, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ienkin</hi> in Loc.</note> is but a weight, which tends to a fall. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in their innocency were but frail, without Gods sustentation; even grace it self is but a creature, and therefore purely dependent. 'Tis not from its being and nature, but from the assistance of some thing without it, that it's kept from annihilation. What becomes of the stream, if the fountain supply it not? What continuance hath the reflection in the glass, if the man that looks into it turn away his face? The constant supplies of the spirit of Jesus Christ, are the food, and fewel of all our graces. The best men, will shew themselves but men, if God leave them. He who hath set them up, must also keep them up. It's safer to be humble with one Talent, than proud with ten. Yea, better to be a humble worm, than a proud Angel. <hi>Adam</hi> had more advantage to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his station, than any of you. For though he were left to the liberty of his own mutable and self-determining will, yet he was created upright, and had no inherent corruption to endanger him, yet fell.</p>
                  <p>And shall we be self-confident after such instances of humane frailty! Alas, Christian! what match art thou for principalites and powers, and spiritual wickedness!

What refreshments had Christ in this world, but such as came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from his Father, or those holy ones now scattered from him? In one day he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> seth both heavenly, and earthly comforts. Now as God dealt by Christ, he may at one time or other deal with his people. You have your comforts from Heaven; so had Christ, in a fuller measure than ever you had, or can have. He had comforts from his little flock, you have your comforts from the society of the Saints, the Ordinances of God, comfortable Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet none of these are so firmly setled upon you, but you may be left destitute of them all in one day. God did take all comfort from Christ, both outward, and inward; and are you greater than he? God sometimes takes outward, and leaves inward comfort; sometimes he takes inward, and leaves outward comfort: but time may come when God may strip you of both.</p>
                  <p>This was the case of <hi>Iob,</hi> a favorite of God, who was blessed with outward, and inward comforts. Yet a time came when God stript him of all, and made him poor to a Proverb, as to all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and the venom of his arrows drank up his spirit, and the inward comforts thereof.</p>

                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Therefore did this befall Jesus Christ before you, that the like condition might be sanctified to you, when you shall be brought into it. For therefore did Jesus Christ pass through such varieties of conditions; on purpose that he might take away the curse, and leave a blessing in those conditions, against the time that you should come into them. Moreover,</item>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though inward comforts and outward comforts were both removed from Christ in one day, yet he wanted not support in the absence of both.

               <p>It is a true observation, that meekness inviteth injury, but all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to its own cost. And it was evidently verified in the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ. Christs meekness triumphed over the affronts and injuries of his enemies, much more than they triumphed over him.

               <p>The Meekness and Patience of his Spirit amidst injuries and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, is excellently set forth in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Who did no Sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.

                  <hi>First,</hi> The burden of sufferings and provocations which Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> supported was very great. For on him met all sorts and kinds of trouble at once, and those in their highest degrees and fullest strength. Troubles in his soul, and these were the soul of his troubles.

               <p>Now all this, and much more than this; meeting at once upon an innocent, and dignified person. One that was greater than all. That lay in the bosom of God. And from eternity had his smiles and honours.

It is our passive fortitude, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strengthened with all might, according to the glorious power, unto all patience, and long suffering with Ioyfulness,</hi> (i. e.) strengthened with a might or power, corresponding to the glorious power of God himself.

Hence it's observed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.10. That the loss or breaking of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under adversity argues a decay of strength in the soul. <hi>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.</hi>

God hath
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54346:216"/>
several sorts of burdens to impose upon his people. Some heavier, others lighter. Some to be carried but a few hours, others many days. Others all our days. Some more spiritual bearing upon the Soul. Some more external, touching or punishing the flesh ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly; and the spirit by way of Sympathy. And sometimes both sorts are laid on together. So they were at this time on Christ. His Soul burdened as deep as it could swim. Full of the sence, the bitter sence and apprehension of the wrath of God. His Body fill'd with tortures. In every member, and sence, grief took up his lodging. Here was the highest exercise of Patience.</p>
               <p>It's a power to bear hard and heavy things <hi>according to the Will of God.</hi> The involving of that respect differs patience the Christian grace, from patience the Moral Vertue. So the Apostle describes it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Let them that suffer according to the will of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> who exercise patience gratiously, as God would have them.</p>
               <p>And then our patience is, (as Christs most exactly was) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, when it is as <hi>extensive,</hi> as <hi>intensive,</hi> and as <hi>protensive</hi> as God requires it to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When it is as <hi>extensive</hi> as God would have it. So was Christs patience. It was a patience that stretched, and extended it self to all and every trouble and affliction, that came upon him. Troubles came upon him in troops, in multitudes. It's said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compassed me about.</hi> Yet he found patience enough to receive them all. It is not so with us. Our patience is often worn out. And like fick people we fancy if we were in another Chamber, or Bed it would be better. If it were any other trouble than this, we could bear it. Christ had no exceptions at any burden his Father would lay on. His patience was as large as his trouble, and that was large indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's then according to the will of God when it is as <hi>intensive</hi> as God reuqires it to be, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in the Apostles phrase, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.4. When it hath it's <hi>perfect work,</hi> or exercise, when it's not only extended to all kinds of troubles; but when it works in the highest and most perfect degree. And then may patience be said to be perfect (as it was in Christ) when it is <hi>plenum sui, &amp; prohibens alieni,</hi> full of it self, and exclusive of its opposites. Christs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience was full of its self, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) it included all that belonged to it. It was full of submission, peace, and serenity, full of obedience and complacency in his Fathers Will. He was in a perfect calm.

And as it included all that belonged to it, so his perfect patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all its opposites.

                  </gap>roubles did not out-live his patience. He indeed was strengthened with all might unto all patience, and long-suffering. This was the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ our perfect pattern. He had not only patience, but Longanimity,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the last place let us inquire into the grounds and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reasons of this his most perfect patience. And if you do so, you shall find perfect Holiness, Wisdom Foreknowledge, Faith, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindedness, and obedience at the root of this his perfect Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This admirable patience and meekness of Christ, was the fruit and off-spring of his <hi>perfect Holiness.</hi> His nature was free from those corruptions, that ours groan and labour under; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could never have carryed it at this rate. Take the meek <hi>Moses,</hi> who excell'd all others in that grace; and let him be tryed in that very grace, wherein he excells, and see how <hi>unadvisedly he may speak with his Lips,</hi> Psal. 106.33. Take a <hi>Iob,</hi> whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous patience is trumpeted, and resounded over all the world; <hi>ye have heard of the patience of Iob.</hi> And let him be tryed by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and inward troubles meeting upon him in one day; and even a <hi>Iob</hi> may curse the day when he was born. Envy, revenge, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, despondencies, are weeds naturally springing up in the corrupt soil of our sinful natures.

The principles of all these evils being in our natures, they will shew themselves in time of Tryal. The old man is fretful and passionate. But it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with Christ. His nature was like a pure Christal Glass full
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54346:217"/>
of pure Fountain water; which though shaken and agitated never so much, cannot shew, because it hath no dregs. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nought in me,</hi> Joh. 14.30. No principle of corruption, for a handle to temptation. Our High Priest was holy, harmless, undefil'd, separate from sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Meekness and Patience of Christ proceeded from the <hi>infinite wisdom</hi> with which he was filled. The wiser any man is, the more patient he is. Hence meekness the fruit, is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from patience, the root that bears it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.13. <hi>The meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of wisdom.</hi> And anger is lodged in folly, as its proper cause, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</hi>

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> would allow no place for passion in a wise mans breast. Wise men use to ponder, consider and weigh things deliberately, in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before they suffer their affections and passions to be stirred and engaged. Hence comes the constancy and serenity of their Spirits. As wise <hi>Solomon</hi> hath observed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.27. <hi>A man of understanding is of an excellent</hi> (or as the Hebrew is) <hi>a cool Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now wisdom filled the soul of Christ. He is wisdom in the abstract, <hi>Pov.</hi> 8. In him are hid all the treasures of wisdom, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. Hence it was that he was no otherwise moved with the revilings and abuses of his enemies, than a wise Physitian is with the impertinencies of his distempered and crazy patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And as his patience flowed from that his perfect wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge, so also from his <hi>foreknowledge.</hi> He had a perfect prospect of all those things from eternity, which befell him afterwards. They came not upon him by way of surprizal. And therefore he wondered not at them when they came, as if some strange thing had happened. He foresaw all these things long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.31. <hi>And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the Elders, and chief Priests, and Scribes, and be killed.</hi> Yea, he had compacted and agreed with his Father to endure all this for our sakes, before he assum'd our flesh. Hence <hi>Isay</hi> 50.6. I gave my back to the siniters, and my cheeks to them that pulled off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</p>
               <p>Now look as Christ in <hi>Iob.</hi> 16.4. obviates all future offences his Disciples might take at sufferings for his sake, by telling them before hand, what they must expect. <hi>These things</hi> (saith he) <hi>I
<pb facs="tcp:54346:218"/>
told you, that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you of them.</hi> So he foreknowing what himself must suffer, and had agreed so to do, he bare those sufferings with singular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. <hi>Iesus therefore knowing all things that should come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, went forth and said unto them, whom seek ye?</hi> Joh. 18.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As his patience sprang from his foreknowledge of his sufferings; so from his <hi>Faith</hi> which he exercised under all that he suffered in this world. His Faith looked through all those black and dismal clouds, to the joy proposed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. He knew that though <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned, God would Justifie him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And he set one over against the other. He ballanced the glory into which he was to enter, with the sufferings through which he was to enter into it. He acted Faith upon God for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine support and assistance under sufferings; as well as for glory the fruit and reward of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>I have set</hi> (or as the Apostle varies it) <hi>I foresaw the Lord always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth.</hi> There's Faith acted by Christ for strength to carry him through. And then it follows, <hi>My flesh also shall rest in hope, for thou wilt not leave my soul in Hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt shew me the path of Life. In thy presence is fullness of Ioy, at thy right hand there are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for ever more.</hi> There's his Faith acting upon the glory into which he was to enter, after he had suffered these things. This fill'd him with peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As his Faith eyeing the glory into which he was passing, made him endure all things; so <hi>the Heavenliness</hi> of his Spirit also fill'd him with a Heavenly tranquility, and calmness of Spirit under all his abuses, and injuries. It's a certain truth, that the more heavenly any mans spirit is, the more sedate, composed, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:54346:218"/>Certainly that heart which is sweetned frequently with heavenly delightful communion with God, is not very apt to be imbittered with wrath or soured with revenge against men. The peace of God doth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now, never was there such a heavenly soul on earth, since man inhabited it, as Christ was. He had most sweet and wonderful communion with God. He had meat to eat, which others, yea, and those his greatest intimates, knew not of. The Son of Man was in heaven upon earth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. Even in respect of that blessed heavenly communion he had with God, as well as in respect of his immense Deity. And that his heart was in heaven, when he so patiently endured and digested the pain and shame of the Cross; is evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>For the Ioy set before him, he endured the Cross, despised the shame.</hi> See where his eye and heart was, when he went as a Lamb to the slaughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And lastly, as his meekness and patience sprang from the heavenliness and sublimity of his spirit: so, from the compleat and absolute <hi>obedience</hi> of it to his Fathers will and pleasure. He could most quietly submit to all the will of God, and never regret at any part of the work assign'd him by his Father. For you must know that Christs death in him was an act of obedience, he all along eyeing his Fathers command and counsel in what he suffered, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. Now look as the eyeing and considering of the hand of God in an affliction, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently becalms and quiets a gracious soul; as you see in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Let him alone, it may be God hath bid him curse</hi> David: so much more it quieted Jesus Christ, who was privy to the design and end of his Father, with whose will he all along complyed; looking on Jews, and Gentiles but as the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ignorantly fulfilling Gods pleasure, and serving that great design of his Father. This was his patience, and these the grounds of it.</p>

                  <p>I might variously improve this point but the direct and main Use of it is to press us to a Christ-like patience in all our sufferings, and troubles. And seeing in nothing we are more generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:54346:219"/>
and that defects of Christians herein, are so prejudicial to Religion, and uncomfortable to themselves: I resolve to wave all other Uses, and spend the remaining time wholly upon this branch. Even a <hi>perswasive</hi> to Christians unto all patience, in tribulations. To imitate their Lamb-like Saviour. Unto this (Christians) you are expresly call'd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.22. <hi>Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example; that we should follow his steps. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when be suffered he threatned not; but committed himself to him that Iudgeth righteously.</hi> Here's your pattern. A perfect pattern. A lovely and excellent pattern. Will you be perswaded to the imitation of Christ herein? Methinks I should perswade you to it. Yea every thing about you perswades to patience in your sufferings, as well as I. Look which way you will, upward or downward, inward or outward, backward or forward, to the right hand or to the left; You shall find all things perswading and urging the Doctrine of Patience upon you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, Look upward,</hi> when tribulations come upon you. Look to that Soveraign Lord, that commissionates and sends them upon you. You know troubles do not rise out of the dust, nor spring out of the ground, but are framed in heaven, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Behold I frame evil, and devise a device against you.</hi> Troubles and afflictions are of the Lords framing, and devising to reduce his wandering people to himself. Much like that device of <hi>Absalom</hi> in setting <hi>Ioabs</hi> field of Corn on fire to bring <hi>Ioab</hi> to him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.30. in the frame of your afflictions you may observe much of divine wisdom in the <hi>choice, measure,</hi> and <hi>season</hi> of your troubles. Soveraignty in electing the instruments of your affliction. In making them as afflictive as he pleaseth. And in making them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient both to his call in coming, and going when he pleaseth. Now could you in times of trouble look up to this Soveraign hand, in which your souls, bodies, and all their comforts and mercies are; how quiet would your hearts be! <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth because it is thy doing,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</hi> O when we have to do with men, and look no higher; how do our Spirits swell and rise with revenge, and impatiency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if you once come to fee that man as a Rod in your Fathers hand, you will be quiet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Be still, and know that I am God,</hi> q. d.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54346:219"/>
consider with whom you have to do. Not with your fellow, but with your God, who can puff you to destruction, with one blast of his mouth. In whose hand you are, as the clay in the potters hand. It is for want of looking up to God in our troubles, that we fret, murmur, and despond at the rate we do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Look downward,</hi> and see what is below you, as well as up to that which is above you. You are afflicted, and you cannot bear it. Oh! no trouble like your trouble! Never man in such a case as you are. Well, well, cast the eye of your mind downward, and see who lie much lower than you. Can you see none on earth in a more miserable state than your selves? Are you at the very bottom, and not a man below you? Sure there be thousands in a sadder case than you on earth. What is your affliction? Have you lost a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Others have lost all. Have you lost an Estate, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor? Well, but there be some you read of, <hi>Iob</hi> 30.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Who cut up Mallows by the bushes, and Iuniper roots for their meat. They are driven forth from among men, they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after them as after a Thief. They dwell in the cliffs of the Vallies, in caves of the earth, and in the Rocks. Among the bushes they brayed, under the Nettles they were gather'd together.</hi> What difference as to manner of Life, do you find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the persons here described, and the wild beasts, that herd together in desolate places? Are you persecuted and afflicted for Christs sake? What think you of their sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37. <hi>Who had trial of cruel mockings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonments; they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the Sword, they wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi> And are you better than they? I know not what you are, but I am sure these were such of <hi>whom the World was not worthy,</hi> vers. 38.</p>
                  <p>Or are your afflictions more spiritual, and inward? Say not the Lord never dealt more bitterly with the soul of any, than he hath with yours. What think you of the case of <hi>David, Heman, Iob, Asaph</hi> whose doleful crys by reason of the terrors of the Almighty, are able to melt the stoniest heart that reads their stories? The Almighty was a terror to them. The Arrows of God were <hi>within</hi> them. They roared by reason of the disquietness of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:54346:220"/>Or are your afflictions outward, and inward together? An af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted soul, in an afflicted body? Are you fallen like the Ship in which <hi>Paul</hi> sailed, into a place where two Seas meet? Well, so it was with <hi>Paul, Iob,</hi> and many other of those worthies gone before you. Sure you may see many on earth, who have been, or are in far lower and sadder states than your selves.</p>
                  <p>Or if not on earth, doubtless you will yield there are many in Hell, who would be glad to exchange conditions with you, as bad as you think yours to be. And were not all these moulded out of the same Lump with you? Surely if you can see any creature below you, especially any reasonable being; you have no reason to return so ungratefully upon your God, and accuse your maker of severity; or charge God foolishly. Look down, and you shall see grounds enough to be quiet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Look inward,</hi> you discontented Spirits, and see if you can find nothing there that may quiet you. Cast your eye into your own hearts. Consider either the <hi>corruptions,</hi> or the <hi>graces</hi> that are there. Cannot you find weeds enough there, that need such winter weather as this to rot them? Hath not that proud heart need enough of all this to humble it? That carnal heart need of such things as these, to mortifie it? That backsliding, wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart need of all this, to reduce, and recover it to its God? <hi>If need be, ye are in heaviness,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6. Oh Christian, didst thou not see need of this before thou camest into trouble? Or hath not God shewn thee the need of it since thou wast under the Rod? It's much thou shouldst not see it: but be assured, if thou dost not, thy God doth. He knows thou wouldst be ruined for ever, if he should not take this course with thee.</p>
                  <p>Thy corruptions require all this to kill them. Thy Lusts will take all this, it may be more than this; and all little enough. And as your corruptions call for it, so do your <hi>Graces</hi> too. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think ye the Lord planted the principles of Faith, Humility, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in your Souls? What, were they put there for nothing? Did the Lord intend they should lie sleeping in their drowsy habits? Or were they not planted there in order to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise? And how shall they be exercised without tribulations, can you tell? Doth not <hi>tribulation work patience, and patience experience; and experience hope!</hi> Rom. 5.3, 4. Is not <hi>the trial of your Faith much more pretious, than of Gold that perishes?</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. O look inward, and you will be quiet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:54346:220"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Look outward,</hi> and see who stands by, and observes your carriage under trouble. Are there not many eyes upon you? Yea, many envious observers round about you? It was <hi>Davids</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Lead me O Lord in thy righteousness, because of mine Enemies</hi>; or as the Hebrew word there might be rendred, because of mine observers, or watchers. There's many an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye upon you. To the wicked there can scarcely be an higher gratification and pleasure, than to see your carriage under trouble, so like their own. For hereby they are confirmed in their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices against Religion, and in their good opinion of themselves. These may talk and profess more than we, but when they are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put to it; it appears plainly enough, their Religion enables them to do no more than we do. They talk of Heavens glory, and their future expectancies; but it is but talk, for it's apparent enough their hopes cannot ballance a small affliction, with all the happiness they talk of. Oh how do you dishonour Christ before his enemies! when you make them think all your Religion lies in talking of it. Consider who looks on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly, Look, backward,</hi> and see if there be nothing behind you that may hush and quiet your impatient Spirits. Consult the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of experiences past, and gone. Both your own, and others. Is this the first straight that ever you were in? if so, you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be quiet, yea, to bless God that hath spared you so long, when others have had their days fill'd up with sorrow. But if you have been in troubles formerly, and the Lord hath helped you; if you have past through the fire, and not been burnt. Through the waters, and not drowned. If God hath stood by you, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto helped you. O what cause have you to be quiet now, and patiently wait for the salvation of God? Did he help you then, and cannot he do so now? Did he give waters, and cannot he give bread also? Is he the God of the Hills only, and not the God of the Vallies also? O call to mind the days of old, the years of the right hand of the most high, <hi>These things I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope,</hi> Lam. 3.21.

                     </gap>, by a glance back upon your past experiences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly, Look forward,</hi> to the end of your troubles; yea look to a double end of them, the end of their <hi>duration,</hi> and the end of their <hi>operation.</hi> Look ye to the end of their duration, and that's fast by you. They shall not be everlasting troubles, if you be such as fear the Lord. <hi>The God of all Grace, who hath call'd us into his eternal glory, by Iesus Christ, after that ye have [suffered a while,] make you perfect,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>These light afflictions are but for a moment,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. It is no more comparatively with that vast eternity that is before you. Alas, what are a few days and nights of sorrows, when they are past? Are they not swallow'd up as a spoonful of water in the vast Ocean? But more especially look to <hi>the end of their operation.</hi> What do all these afflictions tend to, and effect? Do they not work out an exceeding weight of Glory? Are you not by them <hi>made partakers of his holiness?</hi> Heb. 12. Is not this all the fruit to take away your sins? What, and be impatient at this! Fret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine because God is this way perfecting your happiness? O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful soul! Is this a due requital of that love, that disdains not to stoop to so Low an imployment, as to scoure and clense your souls; that they might be shining vessels of honour, to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!</p>
                  <p>O look forward to the end of your troubles. The end of their duration, and operation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Look to the right hand, and see how you are shamed, convinced, and silenced by other Christians; and it may be such too as never made that profession you have done; and yet can not only patiently bear the afflicting hand of God; but are blessing, praising, and admiring God under their troubles; whilst you are sinning against, and dishonouring him under smaller ones. It may be you will find some poor Christians that know not where to have their next bread, and yet are speaking of the bounty of their God; while you are repining in the midst of plenty. Ah, if there be any ingenuity in you, let this shame you. If this will not then</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly, Look to your left hand,</hi> and there you shall see a sad sight, and what one would think should quiet you. There you may see a company of wicked, graceless wretches, carrying themselves under their troubles, but too like your selves. What

do they more, than fret and murmur, despond and sink; mix sin with their afflictions, when the Rod of God is upon them?</p>
                  <p>It's time for thee to leave off, when thou seest how near thou art come to them, whom thou hopest thou shalt never be ranked and numbred with. Reader, such considerations as these I am perswaded would be of singular use to thy soul at such a time, but above all, thine eyeing the great pattern of patience, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; whose Lamb-like carriage under a trial with which thine is not to be named the same day, is here recommended to thee.

            <p>These seven words of Christ upon the Cross are his last words, with which he breathed out his Soul. The last words of a dying man are remarkable, the Scripture puts a remark upon them,

2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Now these be the last words of David.</hi> How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then are the last words of Christ?</p>
            <p>These words are seven in number; three directed to his Father, and four more to those about him. Of the former sort this is one, <hi>Father forgive them,</hi> &amp;c. In which we have, <hi>first, the mercy desired by Christ,</hi> and that is forgiveness. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the persons for whom it is desired [<hi>Them</hi>] that is, those cruel and wicked persons that were now in brewing their hands in his blood.

But it was a respective particular ignorance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Blindness in part, is happened to Israel.</hi> They knew many other truths, but did not know Jesus Christ. In that their eyes were held. Natural light they had. Yea, and Scripture light they had. But in this particular, that <hi>this was the Son of God,</hi> the Saviour of the world; therein they were blind and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:54346:223"/>But how could that be? Had they not heard at least of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> works? Did they not see how his Birth, Life, and Death squar'd with the Prophesies both in time, place, and manner? Whence should this their ignorance be, when they saw or at least might have seen the Scriptures fulfill'd in him, and that he came among them in a time when they were big with expectations of the Messiah!</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, they knew the Scriptures, and it cannot but be supposed the fame of his mighty works had reacht their ears; but yet,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Though they had the Scriptures among them, they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood them; and did not rightly measure Christ by that right rule. You find <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.52. How they reason with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> against Christ, <hi>Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see; for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet.</hi> Here is a double mistake. <hi>First,</hi> they supposed Christ to arise out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> whereas he was of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> though much conversant in the parts of <hi>Galilee.</hi> And <hi>secondly,</hi> they thought because they could find no Prophet had arisen out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> therefore none should.</p>
               <p>Another mistake that blinded them about Christ, was from their conceit that Christ should not die, but live for ever, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.34. <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is the Son of man?</hi> That Scripture which probably they urge against the mortality of Christ, is <hi>Esa,</hi> 9.7. <hi>Of the increase of his Government and peace there shall be no end, upon the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.27. We find them in another mistake, <hi>We know this man whence he is, but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</hi> This likely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from their misunderstanding of <hi>Mica.</hi> 5.2. <hi>His going forth have been from of old, from everlasting.</hi> Thus were they blinded about the person of Christ by misinterpretations of Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing occasioning their mistake of Christ was the <hi>outward meanness,</hi> and despisableness of his condition. They expected a pompous Messiah, one that should come with State, and Glory becoming the King of <hi>Israel.</hi> But when they saw him in the form of a Servant, coming in poverty, not to be ministred unto, but to minister: they utterly rejected him, <hi>We hid as it were our faces from him, he was despised, and we esteemed him not, Isa.</hi> 53.3.

<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Ignorance disposes men to enmity and opposition to Christ, by removing those hinderances that would otherwise keep them from it. As checks and rebukes of conscience, by which they are restrain'd from evil; but conscience binding and reproving in the Authority and vertue of the Law of God; where that Law is not known, there can be no reproofs, and therefore we truly say, that ignorance is virtually every sin.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ignorance enslaves and subjects the soul to the Lusts of Satan; he is the <hi>Ruler of the darkness of this world,</hi> Eph. 6.12. There is no work so base and vile, but an ignorant man will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nay, which is more, if a man be ignorant of Christ, his truths, or people; he will not only oppose and persecute; but he will also do it conscientiously, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he will look upon it as his duty so to do, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.3. Before the Lord open'd <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, <hi>he verily thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Christ.</hi> Thus you have a brief account what, and whence their ignorance was, and how it disposed and prepar'd them for this dreadful work. Hence we learn,</item>

               <p>If all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men, then this as well as others. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. We are not with <hi>Theophilact</hi> to understand that place of the <hi>certainty</hi> of pardon: much less with <hi>Origen</hi> of the <hi>desert</hi> of it: nor yet with <hi>Iansenius</hi> of the <hi>facility</hi> of it, but rather of the <hi>possibility</hi> of forgiveness. It shall be so to some, it may be so to you: even those whose wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands had crucified Christ, receive remission by that blood they shed. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23, 38. <hi>compared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have two things here to do, <hi>First,</hi> To open the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, and shew you what it is. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To evince the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it, for such as mistakingly oppose Christ.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>First, Forgiveness is Gods gracious discharge of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> penitent sinner, from the guilt of all his sin, for Christs sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's Gods discharge:</hi> There is indeed a <hi>fraternal</hi> forgiveness, by which one man forgives another; so far as he is interessed in the wrong, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.37. there is also <hi>a ministerial</hi> forgiveness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the minister of Christ as his mouth, and in his name declares the pardon, or ministerially applies the promises of pardon to peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent offenders, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. but none can absolutely, and properly forgive sin, but God only: <hi>Mark</hi> 2.7. the primary and principal wrong is done to him: <hi>Psalm</hi> 51.4. <hi>Against thee, thee only, (i. e.)</hi> thee mainly or especially, <hi>I have sinned.</hi> Hence sins are <hi>metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically</hi> called debts, debts to God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. not that we owe them to God, or ought to sin against him; but as a pecuniary debt obliges him that owes it, to the penalty, if he satisfie not for it; so do our sins. And who can discharge the Debtor, but the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's a gratious act or discharge. 1, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgression for mine own name sake,</hi> Isai. 43.25. And yet sin is not so forgiven, as that God expects no satisfaction at all; but as expecting none from us, because God hath provided a surety for us, from whom he is satisfied. Eph. 1.7. <hi>In whom we have
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54346:226"/>
Redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's a gratious discharge from the guilt of sin.</hi> Guilt is that which pardon properly deals with. Guilt is an obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Pardon is the dissolving of that obligation. Guilt is a chain with which sinners are bound and fettered by the Law: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is that <hi>aqua-fortis</hi> that eats it asunder, and makes the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a free-man. The pardoned soul is a discharged soul. Rom. 8.33. <hi>Who shall lay anything to the charge of Gods Elect? It's God that justifieth, who shall condemn? It's Christ that died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's Gods discharge of a believing penitent sinner.</hi> Infidelity and impenitency are not only sins in themselves, but such sins as bind fast all other sins upon the soul. <hi>By him all that believe are justified from all things,</hi> Act. 10.43. So Act. 3.19. <hi>Repent therefore, that your sins may be blotted out.</hi> This is the method in which God dispenseth pardon to sinners. Lastly,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is for Christs sake</hi> we are discharged; he is the meritorious cause of our remission. <hi>As God for Christs sake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.32. It's his blood alone that meritoriously procures our discharge.</p>
               <p>This is a brief, and true account of the nature of forgiveness.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Now to evince the possibility of forgiveness, for such as ignorantly oppose Christ. Let these things be weighed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Why should any poor soul that is now humbled for its enmity to Christ in the daies of ignorance, question the possibility of forgiveness: when <hi>this effect doth not exceed the power of the cause; nay when there is more efficacy in the blood of Christ the meritorious cause, than is in the effect of it.</hi> There's power enough in that blood not only to pardon thy sins, but the sins of the whole world, were it actually applied. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. There is not only a sufficiency, but also a redundancy of merit, in that pretious blood. Surely then thy enmity to Christ, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou knewest him, may not look like an unpardonable iniquity in thine eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as this sin exceeds not the power of the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause of forgiveness; <hi>so neither is it any where excluded from pardon, by any word of God.</hi> Nay, such is the extensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the promise to believing penitents, that this case is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly included, and forgiveness tendered to thee in the promises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Isai. 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54346:226"/>
man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Many such extensive promises there are in the Scriptures. And there is not one parenthesis in all those blessed pages, in which this case is excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And it is yet more satisfactory, <hi>that God hath already actually forgiven such sinners, and that which he hath done, he may again do.</hi> Yea, therefore he hath done it to some, and those eminent for their enmity to Christ, that others may be incouraged to hope for the same mercy when they also shall be in the same manner humbled for it. Take one famous instance of many; it's that of <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 Tim. 1.13, 16. <hi>Who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief — howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Iesus Christ might shew forth all long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to everlasting life.</hi> It's no small incouragement to a sick man, to hear of some that have been recovered out of the same disease, and that prevailing in an higher degree, than in himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Moreover, It is encouraging to consider <hi>that when God hath cut off others in the way of their sin, he hath hitherto spared thee.</hi> What speaks this but a purpose of mercy to thy soul? Thou shouldst <hi>account the long suffering of God thy Salvation,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.15. Had he smitten thee in the way of thy sin and enmity to Christ, what hope had remained? But in that he hath not only spared thee, but also given thee a heart ingenuously ashamed, and humbled for thy evils; doth not this speak mercy for thee? Surely it looks like a gratious design of love to thy soul.</p>

                  </note> and beg forgiveness for them, is the true character and property of the Christian spirit.</head>
               <p>Thus did Christ, <hi>Father, forgive them.</hi> And thus did <hi>Stephen</hi> in imitation of Christ. Act. 7.59, 60. <hi>And they stoned</hi> Stephen <hi>calling upon God, and saying, Lord Iesus, receive my spirit: and he kneeled down, and cryed with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</hi> This suits with the rule of Christ, Matth. 5.44, 45. <hi>But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>spightfully use you and persecute you: That ye may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I shall first open the nature of this duty, and shew you what a forgiving spirit is; and then the excellency of it: how well it becomes all that call themselves Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let us enquire what this Christian forgiveness is. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the nature of it may the better appear, I shall shew you both what it is not, and what it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It consists not in a <hi>stoical insensibility of wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</hi> God hath not made men as insensible stupid blocks, that have no sence or feeling of what is done to them. Nor hath he made a Law inconsistent with their very natures that are to be governed by it. But allows us a tender sense of natural evils, though he will not allow us to revenge them by moral evils. Nay, the more deep and tender our resentments of wrongs and injuries are, the more excellent is our forgiveness of them: so that a forgiving spirit doth not exclude sense of injuries, but the sense of injuries graces the forgiveness of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:54346:228"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christian forgiveness is not <hi>a politick concealment of our wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and revenge, because it will be a reproach to discover it; or because we want opportunity to vent it.</hi> This is carnal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, not Christian meekness. So far from being the mark of a grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us spirit, that it's apparently the sign of a vile nature. It is not Christianity to repose, but depose injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Nor is it that moral vertue, for which we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an easier and better nature, and the help of moral rules and documents.</hi> There are certain vertues attainable without the change of nature, which they call <hi>Homilitical vertues,</hi> because they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorn and beautifie nature; such as temperance, patience, justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these are of singular use to conserve peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the world. And without them (as one aptly speaks) the world would soon break up, and its civil scocieties disband. But yet though these are the ornaments of nature, they do not argue the change of nature. All graces in the exercise of them, involve a respect to God. And for the being of them, they are not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural acquisition, but supernatural infusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly, Christian forgiveness is <hi>not an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>injurious giving up of our rights and properties, to the Lusts of every one that hath a mind to invade them.</hi> No: these we may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and preserve, and are bound so to do; though if we cannot defend them legally, we must not avenge our wrongs unchristianly. This is not Christian forgiveness. But then positively;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a Christian lenity, or gentleness of mind; not retaining, but freely passing by the injuries done to us: in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a lenity,</hi> or gentleness of mind. The grace of God demulces the angry stomach; calms the tumultuous passions; new-moulds our sowr spirits, and makes them benign, gentle and easie to be intreated. Gal. 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This gratious lenity <hi>inclines the Christian to pass by injuries: so to pass them by, as neither to retain them revengefully in the mind, or requite them when we have opportunity with the hand.</hi> Yea, and that <hi>freely,</hi> not by constraint, because we cannot avenge our selves but willingly. We abhor to do it when we can. So that as a carnal heart thinks revenge its glory, the gratious heart is content that forgiveness should be his glory. I will be even with him saith nature. I will be above him, saith grace. It is
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:54346:228"/>
his glory to pass over transgression. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11.</p>
               <p>And <hi>this it doth in obedience to the command of God:</hi> their own nature inclines them another way. <hi>The spirit that is in us lusteth to envy, but he giveth more grace,</hi> James 4.5. It lusteth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but the fear of God represses those motions. Such consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as these, God hath forbidden me. Yea, and God hath forgiven me, as well as forbidden me, prevail upon him, when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture urges to revenge the wrong. <hi>Be kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake, hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.32. This is forgiveness in a Christian sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And that this is excellent, and singularly becoming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the profession of Christ, is evident. In as much as,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This speaks your Religion excellent,</hi> that can mould your hearts into that heavenly frame to which they are so averse, yea contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily disposed by nature. It is the glory of Pagan morality that it can <hi>abscondere vitia,</hi> hide and cover mens lusts, and passions. But the glory of Christianity lies in this, that it can <hi>abscind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would Christians but live up to the excellent principles of their Religion, Christianity shall be no more out-vied by heathenish morality. The greatest Christian shall be no more challenged to imitate <hi>Socrates,</hi>

                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:54346:229"/>But now Christianity teaches, and some Christians have attained it, to receive evil, and return good. 1 Cor. 4.12, 13. <hi>Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, we bless, being persecuted, we suffer it, being defamed, we intreat.</hi> This certainly is that meekness wrought in us by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is from above, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>This makes a man sit sure in the Consciences of others, who with <hi>Saul</hi> must acknowledge, when they see themselves so out-done; <hi>thou art more righteous than I,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.16, 17. had we been so injured, and had such opportunities to revenge them, we should never have passed them by, as these men did.</p>
               <p>This impresses and stamps the very image of God upon the Creature, and makes us like our heavenly Father who doth good to his enemies, and sends down showrs of outward blessings upon them, that pour out floods of wickedness daily to provoke him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44, 45. In a word, this Christian temper of spirit gives a man the true possession, and enjoyment of himself. So that our breasts shall be as the pacifique Sea, smooth and pleasant, when others are as the raging Sea, foaming, and casting up mire and dirt.</p>

            <p>WE now pass to the consideration of the second memorable and instructive Word of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the Cross, contain'd in this Scripture. Wherein he hath left us an excellent pattern for the discharge of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Dutys. It may be well said, the Gospel makes the best Husbands and Wives, the best Parents and Children, the best Masters and Servants in the world; seeing it furnishes them with the most excellent <hi>precepts,</hi> and proposes the best <hi>patterns.</hi> Here we have the pattern of Jesus Christ presented to all gratious Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their imitation, teaching them how to acquit themselves towards their Parents, according to the Laws of Nature, and Grace. Christ was not only subject and obedient to his Parents whilst he lived, but manifested his tender care even whilst he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in the torments of Death upon the Cross. <hi>Then saith he to the Disciple, Behold thy Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words contain an affectionate recommendation of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Mother, to the care of a dear Disciple, a bosom friend, wherein let us consider the design, manner, and season of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> The design and end of it, which doubtless was to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his tender respects and care for his Mother, who was now in a most distressed comfortless state. For now was <hi>Simeons</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.35. fulfilled in the trouble and anguish that fill'd her soul. Yea, a sword also shall pierce through thine own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. Her soul was pierced for him, both as she was his Mother, and as she was a Mystical member of him, her head, her Lord. And therefore he commends her to the beloved Disciple that lay in his bosom, saying, <hi>Behold thy Mother,</hi> (i. e.) let her be to thee as thine own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The manner of his recommending her is both affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, and mutual. It's very affectionate and moving, <hi>Behold thy Mother,</hi> q. d. <hi>Iohn,</hi> I am now dying; leaving all humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and relations. And entring into a new State, where neither the dutys of natural relations are exercised, nor the pleasures and comforts of them enjoyed. It's a state of dominion over Angels and men, not of subjection and obedience, this I now leave to thee. Upon thee do I devolve both the honour aud duty of being in my stead and room to her as to all dear and tender care over her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn, Behold thy Mother</hi>; and as it's affectionate, so it's mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>verse</hi> 26. And to his Mother he said, <hi>Woman, behold thy Son</hi>; not Mother, but Woman, intimating not only the change of state and condition with him, but also the bequest he was making of her to the Disciple with whom she was to live as a Mother with a Son.</p>
            <p>And all this he designs as a pattern to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The season or time when his care for his Mother so eminently manifested it self, was when his departure was at hand, and he could no longer be a comfort to her by his bodily presence; yea, his love and care then manifested themselves, when he was full of anguish to the very brim, both in his soul and body, yet all this makes him not in the least unmindful of so dear a relation. Hence the Doctrinal Note is.</p>

               <p>It was anciently a Proverb among the Heathen, <hi>in sola Sparta, expedit senescere,</hi> It's good to be an old man or woman only in <hi>Sparta,</hi> The ground of it was the strict Laws that were among the <hi>Spartans</hi> to punish the rebellions and disobedience of Children to their aged Parents. And shall it not be good to be an old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother in <hi>England,</hi> where the Gospel of Christ is Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and such an argument as this now set before you urged; an argument which the Heathen world was never acquainted with?

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:54346:232"/>
their own Feathers. Or as a Tree rived in pieces by the wedges that were made of its own body? God forbid.</p>
               <p>To prevent such sad occasions of Complaints as these, I desire all that sustain the relation of Children into whose hands providence shall cast this discourse, seriously to ponder this example of Christ, proposed for their imitation in this point. Wherein we shall first consider what dutys belong to the relation of Children, secondly, how Christs example enforces those dutys, and then sutably apply it</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let us examine what dutys pertain to the relation of Children. And they are as truly as commonly branched out into the following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Fear and Reverence</hi> are due from Children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by the express command of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.3. Ye shall fear every man his Mother, and his Father. The Holy Ghost pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely inverts the order, and puts the Mother first, because she by reason of her blandishments, and fond indulgence is most subject to the irreverence and contempt of Children. God hath cloathed Parents with his authority. They are instrusted by God with, and are accountable to him for the souls and bodys of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And he expects that you reverence them, although in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of outward estate, or honour you be never so much above them. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> though Lord of <hi>Egypt,</hi> bowed down before his aged Father, with his face to the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.12. <hi>Solomon,</hi> the most magnificent and glorious King that ever sway'd a Scepter when his Mother came to speak with him for <hi>Adonijah,</hi> he rose up to meet her and bowed himself to her, and caused a seat to be set for the Kings Mother, and set her upon his right hand, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Dear and tender Love,</hi> is due from Children to their Parents. And to shew how strong and dear that love ought to be, it's joined with the Love you have for your own lives. As appears in that injunction to deny both for Christs sake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. The bonds of nature are strong and strict betwixt Parents and Children. What is a Child but a piece of the Parent wrapt up in another Skin? O the care, the cost, the pity, the tenderness, the pains, the fears they have exprest for you. It's worse than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish ingratitude, not to return Love for Love. This filial Love is not only in it self a duty, but to be the root or spring of all your other dutys to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:54346:232"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Obedience</hi> to their commands is due to them, by the Lords strict and special command, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord for this is right; Honour thy Father, and thy Mother, which is the first Commandment with promise.</hi> Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obedience, is not only founded upon the positive Law of God, but also upon the Law of nature. For though the subjection of Servants to Masters came in by sin, yet the subjection of Children to Parents is due to them by natural right, therefore saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle this is right, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> right both according to natural, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law. However, this subjection and obedience is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and universal. God hath not devested himself of his own authority, to cloath a Parent with it. Your obedience to them must be <hi>in the Lord,</hi> (i. e.) in such things as they require you to do in the Lords authority. In things consonant to that divine and holy will to which they as well as you must be subject; and therein you must obey them. Yea, even the wickedness of a Parent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts not from obedience,<note place="margin">
                     <p>

                     </p>
                  </note> where his command is not so. Nor on the other side must the holiness of a Parent sway you, where his Commands and Gods are opposite. In the former case, the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> have determined, that the command must be distinguisht from the person. In the latter, it's a good rule. My Parents must be loved, but my God must be preferred.</p>
               <p>Yield your selves therefore chearfully to obey all that which they lawfully enjoin, and take heed that black character fixed on the Heathens who know not God, be not found upon you, <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Parents,</hi> Rom. 1.30. Remember your disobedience to their just commands rises higher, much higher, than an affront to their persons, and authority; it's disobedience to God himself whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands second, and strengthen theirs upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Submission to their Discipline,</hi> and rebukes is also your duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>We had Fathers of our flesh that correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and we gave them reverence.</hi> Parents ought not to abuse their authority.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>e monstrum.</hi>
                  </note> Cruelty in them is a great sin, but wrath and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in a Child, against his Parents, is monstrous. It's storied of <hi>Aelian,</hi> that having been abroad, at his return, his Father asked him what he had Learned since he went from him; he answered, you will know shortly. I have learned to bear your anger quietly, and submit to what you please to inflict. Two considerations should especially mould others into the like frame, especially to their godly Parents. The <hi>end</hi> for which, and the manner in which
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:54346:233"/>
they manifest their anger to their Children. Their end is to save your souls from Hell. They judge it better for you to hear the voice of their anger, than the terrible voice of the wrath of God. To feel their hand than his. They know if you fall into the hands of the living God; you will be handled in another manner.</p>
               <p>And for the manner, in which they rebuke and chasten, it is with grief in their hearts, and tears in their eyes. Alas, it's no delight to them to cross, vex, or afflict you. Were it not meer conscience of their duty to God, and tender love to your souls, they would neither chide, nor smite. And when they do, how do they afflict themselves, in afflicting you! When their faces are full of anger, their bowels are full of compassion for you, and you have no more reason to blame them for what they do, than if they cry out, and violently snatch at you, when they see you ready to fall from the top of a Rock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Faithfulness</hi> to all their interests is due to them by the natural and positive Law of God. What in you lies, you are bound to promote, not waste and scatter their substance. To <hi>assist</hi> not to <hi>defraud</hi> them. Who so robbeth his Father, or Mother, and saith it is no transgression, the same is the companion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.24. This, saith one, as far excells your wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another as parricide is a greater crime than man-slaughter, or as <hi>Reubens</hi> incest, was beyond common fornication. God never meant you should grow up about your Parents as suckers about a Tree to impoverish the root.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Filius ante di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em patrios in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quierit in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</hi>
                  </note> But for a Child out of a covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness after what his Parents have, secretly to wish their death, is a sin so monstrous, as should not be once named, much less found, among persons professing Christianity. To desire their death from whom you had your life, is unnatural wickedness, to dispose of their Goods, much more of your selves without their consent is (ordinarily) the greatest injustice to them. Children are obliged to defend the Estates and persons of their Parents with the hazard of their own. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are Children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemy in the gates, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And more especially, <hi>requital</hi> of all that love, care, and pains they have been at for you, is your duty so far as God enables you, and those things are requitable, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Let them learn to shew piety at home, and to requite their Parents.</hi> The

                  </note> It was both the comfort and honour of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> that God made him an instrument of so much succour and comfort to his aged Father, and distressed family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.13. And you are also to know, that what you do for them, is not in the way of an alms, or common Charity. For the Apostle saith; it is but your requiting them, and that's Justice not Charity. And it can never be a full requital. Indeed the Apostle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. That Parents lay up for their Children, and not Children for the Parents, and so they ought, but sure, if providence blast them, and bless you, an honourable maintenance is their due. Even Christ himself took care for his Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have had a brief account of the duties of this Relation, next let us consider how Christs Example, who was so subject to them in his life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.51. and so careful to provide at his death, enforces all those duties upon Children, especially upon gratious Children. And this it doth two ways, both as it hath the obliging power of a Law; and as he himself will one day sit in Judgement to take an account how we have imitated him in these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Christs example in this hath the force and power of a Law, yea, a Law of Love, or a Law lovingly constraining you to an imitation of him. If Christ himself will be your pattern. If God will be pleased to take Relations like yours, and go before you in the discharge of relative Duties; Oh how much are you obliged to imitate him, and tread in all his footsteps! This was by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a president or pattern to facilitate and direct your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He will come to take an account how you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the pattern of obedience, and tender care he set before you
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:54346:234"/>
in the days of his flesh. What will the disobedient plead in that day? He that heard the groans of an afflicted Father or Mother, will now come to reckon with the disobedient Child for them. And the glorious example of Christs own obedience and tenderness for his Relations, will in that day condemn and aggravate, silence and shame such wretched Children, as shall stand guilty before his Bar.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> Query, Have you not been guilty of slighting your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by irreverent words or carriages; the old man, or woman. To such I commend the consideration of that Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. Which methinks should be to them as the hand writing that appear'd upon the plaister of the Wall, to <hi>Belteshazar. The eye that mocketh at his Father, and despiseth to obey his Mother: The Ravens of the Valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it.</hi> That is they shall be brought to an untimely end, and the Birds of the air shall eat that eye, that had never seen but for that Parent that was despised by it.</p>
                  <p>It may be you are vigorous and young, they decayed, and wrinkled with Age. But saith the Holy Ghost, <hi>despise not thy Mother when she is old,</hi> Prov. 23.22. Or when she is wrinkled, as the Hebrew signifies.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>
                     </note> It may be you are rich, they poor; owne and honour them in their poverty, and despise them not. God will requite it with his hand if you do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> Query, Have you not been disobedient to the commands of Parents? A Son of <hi>Belial</hi> is a Son of wrath, if God give not Repentance to life. Is not this the black brand set upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. Have not many repented this upon a Ladder, with an halter about their necks? Woe to him that makes a Father or Mother complain as the Tree in the Fable, that they are cloven
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:54346:234"/>
assunder with the wedges that are cut out of their own bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> Query, Have you not risen up rebelliously against, and hated your Parents for chastening your bodies, to save your souls from Hell? Some Children (saith one) will not take that from a Parent, which Beasts, yea, and salvage Beasts too; Bears, and Lions will take from their keepers. What is this but to resist an Ordinance of God for your good? And in rebelling against them to rebell against the Lord? Well, if they do not, God will take the Rod into his own hand; and him you shall not resist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourth</hi> Query, Have you not been unjust to your Parents, and defrauded them? First help to make them poor, and then dispise them because they are poor. O horrid wickedness! What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated evil is this! Thou art in the Language of Scripture a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with destroyers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.24. This is the worst of theft in Gods account. You think you may make bold with them, but how bold do you make with conscience, and the command of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifth</hi> Query, Are you not, or have you not been ungrateful to Parents? Leaving them to shift for themselves in those straights that you have helpt to bring them into. Oh consider it, Children, this is an evil which God will surely avenge, except ye repent. What to be hardned against thine own flesh! To be cruel to thine own Parents, that with so much tenderness fed thee, when else thou hadst perished! I remember <hi>Luther</hi> gives us a story of one (and oh that it might be a warning to all that hear it) who having made over all he had to his Son, reserving only a maintenance for himself; at last his Son depised him, and grudged him the very meat he eat, and one day the Father coming in when the Son and his Wife were at dinner upon a Goose, they shuffled the meat under the Table; but see the remarkable vengeance of God, upon this ungracious, unnatural Son; the Goose was turned into a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Toad which seiz'd upon this vile wretch and kill'd him. If any of you be guilty of these evils, to humble you for them, and reclaim you from them, I desire these six Considerations may be lay'd to heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the effects of your obedience, or disobedience will stick upon you and yours to many generations. If you be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Children in the Lord, both you and yours, may reap the fruits of that your obedience in multitudes of sweet mercies for many generations. So runs the Promise, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Honour thy Father
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:54346:235"/>
and Mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou maist live long on the earth.</hi> You know what an eye of favour God cast upon the <hi>Recabites</hi> for this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 35.8. <hi>from the</hi> 14. <hi>to the</hi> 20. <hi>verse:</hi> and as his blessings are by promise entailed on the obedient, so his curse upon the disobedient, Prov. 20.20. <hi>Whoso curseth his Father or his Mother; his Lamp shall be put out in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure darkness, (i. e.)</hi> the Lamp of his life quencht by death, yea say others, and his soul also by the blackness of darkness in Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though other sins do, this sin seldom escapes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary punishment, even in this world. Our English Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells us of a Yeoman of <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> who had made over all he had to his Son, to prefer him in marriage, reserving only a bare maintenance at his Sons Table. Afterward upon some discontent, the Son bid his Father get out of his House. The next day Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> the Minister of the Parish meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young man, walking about his ground, asked him how he did, he answered, very well; but before the Minister was gone far from him, his bowels fell out, which he carried in his hands, got to his house, sent for Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewailed his sin against his Father, and so died. And Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> in his great exemplar tells us of another, that upon discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his Father, wisht the House might be on fire, if ever he came any more into his Fathers House. Afterwards coming in, it was fired indeed, and this wicked Son only consumed. I could multiply instances of this nature, (for indeed the Righteous Judgement of God hath multiplied them). But this only for a taste.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Heathens will rise up in Judgement against you, and condemn you. They never had such precepts, nor presidents as you, and yet some of the better natured Heathens would have rather chosen death, than to do as you do. You remember the story of <hi>Croesus</hi> his dumb son, whose dear affections could make him speak when he saw <hi>Croesus</hi> in danger; though he never spake before, yet then he could cry out, <hi>O do not kill my Father:</hi> But what speak I of Heathens, the Stork in the heavens, yea, the Beasts of the earth will condemn the disobedience of Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:54346:235"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These are sins inconsistent with the true fear of God, in whomsoever they are found. That a man is indeed, which he is in his family, and among his relations. He that is a bad child, can never be a good Christian. Either bring testimonials of your godliness from your relations, or it may be well suspected to be no better than counterfeit. Never talk of your obedience to God, whilst your disobedience to the just commands of Parents, gives you the lie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A parting time is coming, when death will break up the family, and when that time comes, Oh how bitter will the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of these things be! When you shall see a Father or a Mother lying by the wall, what a cut will it be to remember your miscarriages, and evils. They are gone out of your reach, you cannot now if you would give them any satisfaction for what you have done against them; but oh how bitter will the remembrance of these things be, at such a time! Surely this will be more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to you than their death, if the Lord open your eyes, and give you repentance, and if not, then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> What a terrible thing will it be to have a Father, or Mother come in as witnesses against you at Christs Bar? As well as they loved you, and as dear as you were to them in this world; they must give evidence against you then. Now what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing is it for you but to imagine your Parents to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and say, Lord, I have given this child many hundred reproofs for sin; I have counselled, perswaded, and used all means to reclaim him, but in vain; he was a child of disobedience, nothing could work upon him? What think you of this?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> If your Parents be <hi>godly,</hi> O beware of grieving them by any unbecoming carriage. Art thou a Christian indeed, thou wilt

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they be <hi>carnal,</hi> walk circumspectly, in the most precise and punctual discharge of your Duties: for how knowest thou, O Child, but hereby thou maist win thy Parents? Wouldst thou but humbly and seriously intreat, and perswade them to mind the waies of holiness; speaking to them at fit seasons, with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable humility and reverence: Insinuating your advice to duties, or trouble for their evils rather by relating some pertinent History, or proposing some excellent example; leaving their own Consciences to draw the conclusion, and make applica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>How many have no Children at all, but are as a dry tree! And how many have such as are worse than none? The very reproaches, and break-hearts of their Parents; that bring down their hoary heads with sorrow to the grave?</p>
                  <p>If God have given you the blessing of godly Children, you can never be sufficiently sensible of, or thankful for such a favour. O that ever God should honour you to bring forth Children for Heaven! What a comfort must this be to you, what ever other troubles you meet with abroad; when you come home among godly relations, that are careful to sweeten your own family to you by their obedience?

when you are gone. Take heed of discouraging, or damping such Children from whom so much glory is like to rise to God, and so much comfort to your selves.

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Scripture you have <hi>the third</hi> excellent saying of Christ upon the Cross, expressing the riches of free grace to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Thief. A man that had spent his life in wickedness, and for his wickedness was now to lose his life. His practice had been vile, and profane; but now his heart was broken for it; he proves a Convert, yea, the first fruits of the blood of the Cross. In the former verse he manifests his faith, <hi>Lord, remember me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</hi> In this Christ manifests his pardon, and gratious acceptance of him; verily I say unto thee, <hi>to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi> In which Promise are considerable, the Matter of it, the Person to whom it is made, the Time set for its Performance, and the Confirmation of it for his full Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:54346:237"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Matter or Substance of the Promise made by Christ,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>viz,</hi> that he <hi>shall be with him in Praradise.</hi> By Paradise he means Heaven it self, which is here shadowed to us by a place of delight and pleasure. This is the receptacle of gratious souls when separated from their bodies. And that Paradise signifies Heaven it self, and not a third place, as some of the Fathers fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined, is evident from, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 4. where the Apostle calls the same place by the names of the third Heaven, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. This is the place of blessedness, designed for the people of God: so you find Rev. 2.7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God: (i. e.)</hi> to have the fullest and most intimate communion with Jesus Christ in Heaven. And this is the substance of Christs promise to the Thief. Thou <hi>(i. e.)</hi> thou in spirit, or thou in thy noblest part, thy soul; which here bears the name of the whole person; thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Person to whom Christ makes this excellent and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> glorious promise. It was to one that had lived lewdly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely; a very vile and wretched man in all the former part of his time, and for his wickedness now justly under condemnation. Yea, to one that had reviled Christ, after that sentence was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him. However, now at last the Lord gave him a penitent believing heart. Now, almost at last gasp, he is soundly in an extraordinary way converted, and being converted, he owns and professes Christ amidst all the shame and reproach of his death. Vindicates his innocency, and humbly supplicates for mercy; <hi>Lord, remember me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The set time for the performance of this gratious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to him. To day: this very day shalt thou be with me in glory. Not after the resurrection, but immediately from the time of thy dissolution thou shalt enjoy blessedness And here I cannot but detect the cheat of those that deny an immediate state of glory to believers after death. Who to the end this Scripture (might not stand in full opposition to their as uncomfortable, as unsound opinion) loose the whole frame of it, by drawing one pin; yea, by transposing but a comma, putting it at the word <hi>day,</hi> which should be at the word <hi>thee,</hi> and so reading it thus, verily I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee to day, referring the word day to the time that Christ made the promise, and not to the time of its performance. But if such a liberty as this be yielded, what may not men make the Scriptures
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54346:238"/>
speak? There can be no doubt, but Christ in this expression, fixes the time for his happiness: <hi>To day shalt thou be with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly, You have here the Confirmation and Seal of this most comfortable Promise to him, with Christs solemn asseveration: <hi>verily I say unto thee.</hi> Higher security cannot be given. I that am able to perform what I promise, and have not out promised my self; for Heaven and the glory thereof are mine. I that am faithful and true to my promises, and never crackt or strained my credit with any; I say it, I solemnly confirm it; <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I say unto thee, to day shalt thou with me in Paradise.</hi> Hence we have three plain obvious truths, for our instruction and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That there is a future eternal state, into which souls pass at death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> That all Believers are at their death, immediatly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a state of glory, and eternal happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 3.</hi> That God may, though he seldom doth, prepare men for this glory, immediately before their dissolution by death.</p>
            <p>These are the useful truths resulting from this remarkable word of Christ, to the penitent Thief. We will consider and inprove them in the order proposed.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>DOCT. 1. That there is a future eternal state,<note place="margin">Doct. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> into which souls pass at death.</head>
               <p>This is a principal foundation-stone to the hopes, and happiness of souls. And seeing our hopes must needs be as their foundation, and ground work is; I shall briefly establish this truth by these five Arguments. The beeing of a God evinces it; the Scriptures of truth plainly reveal it; the Consciences of all men have resentments of it; the incarnation, and death of Christ is but a vanity without it; And the immortality of humane souls plainly discovers it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:54346:238"/>Arg. 1. <hi>The being of a God undeniably evinces a future state for humane souls after this life.</hi> For if there be a God who rules the world which he hath made, he must rule it by rewards, and punishments, equally, and righteously distributed to good, and bad. Putting a difference betwixt the obedient, and disobedient. The Righteous, and the wicked. To make a species of creatures ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of moral government, and not to rule them at all; is to make them in vain, and inconsistent with his glory who is the last end of all things. To rule them, but not suitably to their natures; consists not with that infinite wisdom from which their beings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and by which their workings are ruled and ordered. To rule them in a way suitable to their natures, <hi>viz.</hi> by rewards and punishments, and not to perform, or execute them at all, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incongruous with the veracity and truth of him that cannot lie. This were to impose the greatest cheat in the world upon men; and can never proceed from the holy and true God. So then, as he hath made a rational sort of creatures, capable of moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by rewards and punishments; so he rules them in that way which is suitable to their natures, promising <hi>it shall be well with the righteous, and ill with wicked.</hi> These promises and threatnings can be no cheat, meerly intended to scare and fright, where there is no danger; or encourage, where there is no real benefit: but what he promises, or threatens, must be accomplished, and every word of God take place, and be fulfilled. But it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that no such distinction is made by the providence of God, (at least ordinarily, and generally) in this life: but <hi>all things come alike to all: and as with the righteous so with the wicked.</hi> Yea, here it goes ill with them that fear God, they are oppressed. They receive their evil things, and wicked men their good. Therefore we conclude, the righteous Judge of the whole earth, will in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, recompence to every one according as his work shall be.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as the very being of God evinces it, so <hi>the Scriptures of truth plainly reveal it.</hi> These Scriptures are the <hi>Pandect,</hi> or <hi>System</hi> of the Laws, for the goverment of men; which the wise and holy Ruler of the world, hath enacted and ordained for that purpose. And in them we find promises made to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, of a full reward for all their obedience, patience and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:54346:239"/>
in the next life, or coming world. And threatnings made against the wicked, of eternal wrath and anguish, as the Just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their sin, in Hell for ever. Rom. 2.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Thou treasurest up to thy self wrath, against the day of wrath; and revelation of the righteous Iudgement of God. Who shall render to every man according to his deeds. To them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality eternal life: but unto them that are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness; indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doth evil,</hi> &amp;c. So 2 Thes. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>So that we our selves glory in you, in the Churches of God, for your patience, and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, that ye endure. Which is [a manifest token] of the righteous Iudgement of God. That ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer. Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Iesus shall be revealed from Heaven, in flaming fire,</hi> &amp;c. To these plain testimonies, multitudes more might be added, if it were needful. Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but these words shall never pass away.</p>
               <p>Arg. 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the Scriptures reveal it, so <hi>the Consciences of all men, have some resentments of it.</hi> Where is the man whose Conscience never felt any impressions of hope, or fear from a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world? If it be said these may be but the effects and force of discourse, or education; we have read such things in the Scriptures, or have heard it by Preachers; and so raise up to our selves hopes, and fears about it. I demand, how the Consciences of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who have neither Scriptures nor Preachers came to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest with these things. Doth not the Apostle tells us, Rom. 2.15. <hi>That their Consciences in the mean while work upon these things?</hi> Their thoughts with reference to a future state <hi>accuse,</hi> or <hi>else ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, (i. e.)</hi> their hearts are cheared and encouraged by the good they do, and terrified with fears about the evils they commit. Whereas if there were no such things, Conscience would neither accuse, or excuse for good, or evil done in this world.</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. Fourthly, <hi>The incarnation and death of Christ, is but a vanity without it.</hi> What did he propose to himself, or what
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54346:239"/>
benefit have we by his coming; if there be no such future state? Did he take our nature, and suffer such terrible things in it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? If you say, Christians have much comfort from it in this Life. I answer the comforts they have are raised by faith and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the happiness to be enjoyed as the purchase of his blood in Heaven. And if there be no such heaven to which they are appointed. No Hell from which they are redeemed, they do but comfort themselves with a Fable, and bless themselves in a thing of nought. Their comfort is no greater than the comfort of a Beggar, that dreams he is a King, and when he awakes, finds himself a Beggar still. Surely the ends of Christs death were to deliver us from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.10. Not from an imaginary, but a real Hell, to bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. To be the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</p>
               <p>Arg. 5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and lastly, <hi>The immortality of humane souls puts it beyond all doubt.</hi> The soul of a man, vastly differs from that of a Beast; which is but a material form, and so wholly depending on, must needs perish with the matter. But it is not so with us. Ours are reasonable spirits, that can live and act in a separated state from the body, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of a Beast that goeth downward to the earth.</hi> So that look as if a man dispute whether man be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, that his very disputing it, proves him to be so; so our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, hopes, fears, and apprehensions of eternity, prove our souls immortal, and capable of that state.</p>

                  </gap>uture state of happiness and misery for souls, but that they pass not into it immediatly upon death and separation from the body, but shall sleep till the Resurrection and then awake and enter into it. But is not that soul asleep, or worse, that dreams of a sleeping soul till the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Are souls so wounded and prejudiced by their separation from the body, that they cannot subsist or act separate from it? Or have they found any such conceit in the Scriptures? Not at all. The Scriptures take notice of no such interval; but plainly enough denies it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>We are confident I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.</hi> Mark it, no sooner parted from the body, but present with the Lord. So <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is far better.</hi> If his soul was to sleep till the Resurrection, how was it far better to be dissolved, than to live? Sure <hi>Pauls</hi> state in the body had-been far better, than his state after death, if this were so; for here he enjoyed much sweet communion with God by Faith, but then he should enjoy nothing.</p>
               <p>To confirm this dream, they urge <hi>Ioh</hi> 14.3. <hi>If I go my way, I will come again and receive you to my self.</hi> As if the time of Christs receiving his people to himself should not come, until his second coming at the end of the world. But though he will then
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:54346:241"/>
collect all believers into one body, and present them solemnly to his Father: yet that hinders not, but he may, as indeed he doth receive every particular believing soul to himself at death, by the Ministry of Angels. And if not, how is it that when Christ comes to judgement, he is attended with ten thousands of his Saints, that shall follow him when he comes from heaven? <hi>Iude</hi> 14. you see then the Scriptures put no interval betwixt the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Saint, and his glorification. It speaks of the Saints that are dead, as already with the Lord. And the wicked that are dead, as already in Hell, calling them <hi>Spirits in Prison,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. assuring us that <hi>Iudas</hi> went presently to his <hi>own place, Acts</hi> 1.25. and to that sence is the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16.22.</p>
               <p>But let us weigh these four things more particularly, for our full satisfaction in this point.</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>First,</hi> Why should the happiness of believers be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, since they are immediatly capable of enjoying it, assoon as separated from the body? Alas, the soul is so far from being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the body, (as it is now) for the enjoyment of God; that it's rather clog'd and hindred by it; so speaks the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 8. <hi>Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord, (i. e.)</hi> our bodies prejudice our souls, obstruct and hinder the fulness and freedom of their communion. When we part from the body, we go home to the Lord. Then the soul is escaped as a Bird out of the Cage or Snare. Here I am prevented by an excellent Pen, which hath judiciously opened this point. To whose excellent observations I only add this,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Shaw</hi> in his Farewel to Life.</note> that if the intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, snares, and prejudices of the soul are so great and many in its embodied estate, that it cannot so freely dilate it self and take in the comforts of God, by communion with him, then surely the laying aside of that clog, or the freeing of the soul from that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, can be no bar to its greater happiness, which it enjoys in its separated state.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why should the happiness and glory of the soul be deferred, unless God had some farther preparative work to do upon it; before it be fit to be admitted into glory? But surely there is no such work wrought upon it after its separation by death. All that is done of that kind, is done here. When the <hi>compositum</hi> is dissolved, all means, duties, and ordinances are ceased. The
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54346:241"/>
working day is then ended, and night come, when no man can work, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.3. To that purpose are those words of <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no wisdom, nor knowledge, nor devise in the Grave whither thou goest.</hi> So that our glorification is not deferred, in order to our fuller preparation for glory. If we are not fit when we die, we can never be fit. All is done upon us that ever was intended to be done. For they are called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. The Spirits of the Just made perfect.</p>
               <p>Arg. 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Again, why should our Salvation slumber, when the damnation of the wicked doth not slumber? God defers not their misery, and surely he will not defer our glory. If he be quick with his enemies, he will not be slow and dilatory with his friends. It cannot be imagined but he is as much inclined to acts of favour to his Children, as to acts of Justice to his enemies; these are presently damned, <hi>Iud.</hi> 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. and what reason why believers, all believers as well as this in the Text, should not be that very day in which they die, with Christ in Glory?</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, how do such delays consist with Christs ardent desires to have his people with him where he is? And with the vehement longings of their souls to be with Christ? You may see those reflected flames of Love and desire of mutual enjoyment betwixt the Bridegroom and his Spouse in <hi>Revel</hi> 22.17, 20. Delays make their hearts sick. The expectation and Faith in which the Saints die, is to be satisfied then; and surely God will not deceive them. I deny not but their glory will be more compleat when the body their absent friend is reunited, and made to share with them in their happiness. Yet that hinders not, but mean while the soul may enjoy its glory, whilst the body takes its rest, and sleeps in the Dust.</p>

This hour on earth, the next in the third heavens. Now viewing this world, and anon standing among an innumerable company of Angels, and the Spirits of the Just made perfect. O what a change is this! What! but wink and see God! Commend thy soul to Christ, and be transferred in the arms of Angels into the invisible world, the world of Spirits! To live as the Angels of God! To live without eating, drinking, sleeping. To be lifted up from a bed of sickness to a Throne of Glory! To leave a sinful troublesom world, a sick and pained body, and be in a moment perfectly cured, and feel thy self perfectly well, and free from all troubles and distempers! You cannot think what this will be. Who can tell what sights, what apprehensions, what thoughts, what frames believing souls have before the bodies they left, are removed from the eyes of their dear surviving friends!</p>

               <p>There is one <hi>parable,</hi> and no more, that speaks of some that were called at the last hour. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.9, 10. And there is this one instance in the text, and no more; that gives us an account of a person so called. We acknowledge God may do it, his grace is his own. He may dispense it how, and where he pleaseth. We must always salve divine prerogative. Who shall fix bonds, or put li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to free grace, but God himself, whose it is? If he do not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily shew such mercies to dying sinners, (as indeed it doth not) yet it is not because he cannot, but because he will not. Not because their hearts are so hardned by long custom in sin, that his grace cannot break them; but because he most justly withholds that grace from them. When blessed Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> the martyr, heard a Minister preaching thus. O thou old sinner, that hast lain these fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years rotting in thy sin, dost thou think now to be saved? That the blood of Christ shall save thee? O said Mr. <hi>Bilney,</hi> what preaching of Christ is this! If I had heard no other preaching than this, what had become of me? No, no old sinners, or young sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, great, or small sinners are not to be beaten off from Christ, but encouraged to repentance, and faith. For who knows but the bowels of mercy may yearn at last upon one that hath all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it. This thief was as unlikely ever to have received mercy but a few hours before he died, as any person in the world could be.</p>
               <p>But surely this is no encouragement to neglect the present seasons of mercy, because God may shew mercy hereafter. To neglect the ordinary, because God sometimes manifests his grace in ways extraordinary. Many I know have hardened themselves in ways of sin by this example of mercy. But what God did at this time, for this man, cannot be expected to be done ordinarily for us. And the reasons thereof are,
<list>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:54346:243"/>
                     <item>Reason 1. <hi>First,</hi> Because God hath vouchsafed us the ordinary and standing means of grace, which he had not; and therefore we cannot expect such extraordinary and unusual conversions as he had. This poor creature never heard in all likelihood one Sermon preached by Christ, or any of the Apostles. He lived the life of a Highway man, and concerned not himself about Religion; but we have Christ preached freely and constantly in our Assemblies. We have line upon line, and precept upon precept. And when God affords the ordinary preaching of the Gospel, he doth not use to work wonders. When <hi>Israel</hi> was in the Wilderness, then God baked their bread in Heaven, and clave the Rocks to give them drink; but when they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they had the ordinary means of subsistance, the manna ceased.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>Reason 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such a conversion as this may not be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily expected by any man, because such a time as that will never come again. It's possible if Christ were to die again, and thou to be crucified with him, thou mightest receive thy conversion in such a miraculous and extraordinary way: but Christ dies no more. Such a day as that will never come again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> in his excellent discourse upon this point, tells us that as this was an extraordinary time, Christ being now to be installed in his Kingdom, and Crowned with glory and honour: so extraordinary things were now done; as when Kings are Crowned; the Streets are richly hanged; the Conduits run with wine; great Malefactors are then pardoned; for then they shew their munificence and bounty; it is the day of the gladness of their hearts. But let a man come at another time to the Conduits, he shall find no wine, but ordinary water there. Let a man be in the Goal at another time, and he may be hanged; yea, and hath no reason but to expect and prepare for it. What Christ did now for this man, was at an extraordinary time.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>Reason 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such a conversion as this may not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be expected, for as such a time will never come again, so there will never be the like reason for such a conversion any more. Christ converted him upon the Cross, to give an instance of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power at that time when it was almost wholy clouded. Look as in that day the divinity of Christ brake forth in several miracles,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54346:244"/>
as the preternatural eclipse of the Sun. The great earthquake, the rending of the Rocks, and vail of the Temple. So in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of this man in such an extraordinary way; and all to give evidence of the divinity of Christ, and prove him to be the Son of God whom they crucified. But that is now sufficiently confirmed, and there will be no more occasion for miracles to evidence it.</item>
                     <item>Reason 4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> None hath reason to expect the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, that enjoys the ordinary means; because though in this convert we have a pattern of what free grace can do, yet as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines pertinently observe, it's a pattern without a promise. God hath not added any promise to it, that ever he will do so for any other. And where we have not a promise to encourage our hope, our hope can signifie but little to us.</item>

The forementioned reverend Author tells us of one <hi>Marcus Cajus Victorius</hi> a very aged man in the primitive times, who was converted from Heathenism to Christianity in his old age. This man came to <hi>Simplicianus</hi> a Minister, and told him he hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned and embraced the Christian faith. But neither he nor the Church would trust him for a long time. And the reason was the unusualness and strangeness of a conversion at such an age. But after he had given them good evidence of the reallity thereof, there were acclamations and singing of Psalms, the people every where crying <hi>Marcus Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh if God have wrought such wondrous salvations for any of you, what cause have you to do more for him than others! What, to pluck you out of Hell when one foot was in!

                     <hi>First,</hi> Oh set to the business of Religion now, because <hi>this is the moulding age.</hi> Now your hearts are tender, and your affections flowing. Now is the time when you are most likely to be wrought upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Now, because this is <hi>the freest part of your time.</hi> It is in the morning of your life, as in the morning of the day.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Now, because <hi>your life is immediately uncertain.</hi> You are not certain that ever you shall attain the years of your Fathers.

It is the voice of the Son of God in an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The time when it was uttered; <hi>about the ninth hour, (i. e.)</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> about three of the clock after noon. For as the Jews divided the night into four quarters, or watches: so they divided the day in like
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:54346:246"/>
manner into four quarters, or greater hours. Which had their names from that hour of the day that closed the quarter. So that beginning their account of their lesser hours from six in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which with them was the first, their ninth hour answered to our third after noon. And this is heedfully marked by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists on purpose to shew us how long Christ hanged in distress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, both in soul and body, which at least was three full hours. Towards the end whereof his soul was so filled, distressed, and overwhelmed; that this doleful cry brake from his soul, in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anguish. <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The matter of the complaint. It is not of the cruel tortures he felt in his body, nor of the scoffs and reproaches of his name; he mentions not a word of these, they were all swallowed up in the sufferings within, as the River is swallowed up in the Sea, or the lesser flame in the greater. He seems to neglect all these, and only complains of what was more burdensom than ten thousand Crosses. Even his Fathers deserting him, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> It is a more inward trouble that burdens him, darkness upon his spirit, the hidings of Gods face from him, an affliction he was totally a stranger to, till now. Here he lays his hand in this complaint. This was the pained place, to which he points in this dolorous out-cry.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The manner in which he utters his sad complaint, and that was with a remarkable <hi>vehemency, he cried with a loud voice,</hi> not like a dying man, in whom nature was spent, but as one full of vigor, life and sence. He gathered all his spirits together, stirred up the whole power of nature when he made this grievous out-cry. There is in it also an <hi>emphatical reduplication</hi> which shews with what vehemency it was uttered. Not singly, my God, but he doubles it, <hi>my God, my God,</hi> as distressed persons use to do. So <hi>Elisha,</hi> when <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah</hi> was separated from him by the Chariots and Horses of fire, cries out, <hi>my Father, my Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, moreover, to encrease the force and vehemency of this complaint, here is an <hi>affectionate interrogation: Why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me?</hi> Questions, especially such as this, are full of spirits. It is as if he were surprised by the strangeness of this affliction: and rouzing up himself with an unusual vehemency, turns himself to his Father, and cries, why so, my Father; O what dost thou mean by this? What, hide that face from me that never was hid before! What, and hide it from me now, in the depth of my other torments
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:54346:246"/>
and troubles! O what new, what strange things are these! Lastly, here is an <hi>observable variation</hi> of the language in which this asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing complaint was uttered. For he speaks both <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> in one breath, <hi>Eli, Eli, lama,</hi> are all Hebrew, <hi>Sabachtani</hi> is a <hi>Syriack</hi> word, used here for emphasis sake. Hance we observe.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>DOCT. That God in design to heighten the sufferings of Christ to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> forsook him in the time of his greatest distress; to the unspeakable affliction, and anguish of his soul.</head>
               <p>This proposition shall be considered in three parts. The <hi>desertion</hi> it self. The <hi>design</hi> or end of it. The <hi>effect</hi> and influence it had on Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The desertion it self. Divine desertion generally conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is Gods withdrawing himself from any, not as to his Essence, that fills Heaven and Earth, and constantly remains the same. But it's the withdrawment of his favour, grace and love. When these are gone, God is said to be gone. And this is done two ways, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>absolutely,</hi> and wholly,, or <hi>respectively</hi> and only as to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation. In the first sense Devils are forsaken of God. They once were in his favour and love, but they have utterly and finally lost it. God is so withdrawn from them, as that he will never take them into favour any more. In the other sense he sometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes his dearest Children, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he removes all sweet manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his favour and love for a time, and carries it to them as a stranger; though his love be still the same.</p>
               <p>And this kind of desertion which is respective, temporary, and only in regard of manifestation, is justly distinguished from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ends and designs of it, into <hi>probational, cautional, castigato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>poenal. Probational</hi> desertions are only for the proof and trial of grace. <hi>Cautional</hi> desertions are designed to prevent sin. <hi>Castigatory</hi> desertions are Gods rods to chastize his people for sin. <hi>Poenal</hi> desertions are such as are inflicted as the just reward of sin, for the reparation of that wrong sinners have done by their sins. Of this sort was Christs desertion. A part of the curse, and a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part. And his bearing it was no small part of the reparation, or satisfaction he made for our sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:54346:247"/>More particularly, to open the nature of this desertion of Christ by his Father, there being much of intricacy and difficulty in it. I shall proceed in the explication of it <hi>Negatively,</hi> and <hi>Positively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Negatively,</hi> when Christ cries out of Gods forsaking him, he doth not mean that he had <hi>dissolved the personal union</hi> of the two natures. Not as if the marriage knot which united our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the person of Christ was loosed, or a divorce made betwixt them. No, for when he was forsaken of God, he was still true and real <hi>Godman</hi> in one person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When Christ bewails the Fathers forsaking him, he doth not mean that he <hi>pulled away the prop of divine support</hi> from him, by which he had till then endured the tortures and sufferings that oppressed him. No, though the Father deserted, yet he still supported him. And so much is intimated in these words of Christ <hi>Eli, Eli,</hi> which signifies my strong one, my strong one. God was with him by way of support, when withdrawn as to manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love and favour. In respect of Gods supporting presence which was with Christ at this time; it's said, Isai. 42.1. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold,</hi> and Joh. 16.32. <hi>I am not alone, but the Father is with me.</hi> So that this cannot be the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Much less is it his meaning <hi>that God had left him, as to inherent grace and sanctification.</hi> Recalling that spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which had anointed him above his fellows. No, no: when he was forsaken he remained as holy as ever. He had indeed less comfort, but not less holiness than before. Such a desertion had irritated and made void the very end of his death. And his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could never have yielded such a fragrant odor to God as it did, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The love of God was not so withdrawn from Christ, as that <hi>the Father had now no love for him,</hi> nor delight in him. That's impossible, he can no more cease to love Christ, than to love himself. His love was not turned into wrath. Though his wrath only was now manifested to him as our surety; and his love hid from him, as his beloved Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Nor was Christ <hi>forsaken by his Father finally,</hi> upon what account soever it was that he was forsaken. No, it was but for a few hours that the dark cloud dwelt over his soul. It soon past away. And the bright and glorious face of God shone forth again, as bright as ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1.24. compared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:54346:247"/>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And lastly, It was <hi>not a mutual desertion,</hi> or a desertion on both parts; the Father forsook him, but he forsook not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When God withdrew, he followed him, crying <hi>my God, my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet to speak positively of it; though it did not dissolve the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union, nor cutting off divine supports, nor remove his inherent grace, nor turn his Fathers love into hatred, nor continue for ever, nor yet was it on both parts, Christs forsaking God, as well as God forsaking Christ; yet I say it was
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First, A very sad desertion,</hi> the like unto which in all respects never was experienced by any, nor can be to the end of the world. All his other troubles were but small things to this; they bare upon his body, these upon his soul. They came from the hands of vile men, this from the hand of a dear Father. He suffered both in body and soul; but the sufferings of his soul, were the very soul of his sufferings. Under all his other sufferings he opened not his mouth, but this toucht the quick, that he could not but cry out, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was a sad, so <hi>it was a poenal desertion,</hi> inflicted on him for satisfaction for those sins of ours, which deserved that God should forsake us for ever, as the damned are forsaken by him. So that this cry (as one observes) was like the <hi>perpetual shriek</hi> of them that are cast away for ever. This was that Hell, and the torments of it which Christ our surety suffered for us. For look as there lies a twofold misery upon the damned in Hell, <hi>viz. pain of sence,</hi> and <hi>pain of loss.</hi> So upon Christ answerably there was not only an <hi>impression</hi> of wrath, but also a <hi>Substraction,</hi> or withdrawment of all sensible favour, and love. Hence it's said by himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.27. And now my soul <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is troubled. The word signifies troubled as they that are in Hell are troubled. Though God did not leave his soul in Hell, as others are; he having enough to pay the debt which they have not, yet in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof at this time he was. Yea, in sufferings at this time in his soul, equivalent to all that which our souls should have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered there, to all Eternity.</item>

him; but the thing was so indeed. The God-head restrained and kept back for this time, all its joys, comforts, and sence of love from the man-hood: yielding it nothing but support. This bitter doleful out-cry of Christ gives evidence enough of the reality of it. He did not <hi>feign</hi> but <hi>feel</hi> the burdensomness of it.</item>

When men yea the best of men stood afar off, and none but barbarous enemies were about him. When pains and shame, and all miseries even weighed him down, then even then to compleat and fill up his sufferings, God stands afar off too.</item>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And lastly, <hi>It was such a desertion, as left him only to the supports of his Faith.</hi> He had nothing else now but his Fathers covenant and promise to hang upon.

               <p>For though all comfortable sights of God and sence of love were obstructed, yet you see <hi>his soul cleaves fiducially to God for all that. My God,</hi> &amp;c. Though sense and feeling spake as well as Faith; Yet <hi>Faith speaks first, my God,</hi> before sence speaks a word of his forsaking. His Faith prevented the complaint of sence and though sence comes in afterward with a word of complaint, yet <hi>here are two words of Faith, to one of Sence.</hi> It is, <hi>my God, my God,</hi> and but one word of forsaking. As his Faith spake first, so it spake twice when sence and feeling spake but once. Yea, and as Faith spake first, and twice as much as sence, so <hi>it spake more confidently than Sence did.</hi> He lays a confident claim to God as his God; <hi>my God, my God,</hi> and only Queries about his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of him; <hi>why hast thou forsaken me</hi>? This is spoken more dubiously, the former most confidently.</p>

My strong one I lean upon thee. To these supports and refuges of Faith this desertion shut up Christ. By these things he stood
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:54346:248"/>
when all other visible and sensible comforts shrunk away both from his soul and body. This is the true though brief account of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of Christs desertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the next place let us consider the <hi>designs,</hi> and <hi>ends</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of it; which were principally <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Sanctification. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for those sins of ours which deserved that we should be totally and everlastingly forsaken of God.</hi> This is the desert of every sin, and the damned do feel it, and shall to all Eternity. God is gone from them for ever, not essentially, the just God is with them still, the God of power is still with them, the avenging God is ever with them; but the merciful God is gone, and gone for ever. And thus would he have withdrawn himself from every soul that sinned, had not Christ born that punishment for us, in his own soul; if he had not cryed, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> we must have howled out this hideous complaint in the lowest Hell for ever, O righteous God, O dreadful, O terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, thou hast for ever forsaken me.</p>
               <p>And as satisfaction was design'd in this desertion of Christ, so also was the <hi>Sanctification of all the desertions of the Saints designed in it.</hi> For he having been forsaken <hi>before</hi> us, and <hi>for</hi> us; when ever God forsakes us, that very forsaking of his is sanctified, and thereby turned into a mercy to believers. Hence are all the pretious fruits and effects of our desertions. Such are the earnest excitation of the soul to Prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 88.1, 9. The antidoting the tempted soul against sin. The reviving of antient experiences, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.5. Enhaunsing the value of the divine presence with the soul, and teaching it to hold Christ faster than ever before, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These and many more are the pretious effects of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed desertion? but how many or how good so ever these effects are, they do all owe themselves to Jesus Christ, as to the Author of them. Who for our sakes would pass through this dark and sad state, that we might find those blessings in it. So then, the God-heads suspending of all the effects of joy and comfort from the humanity of Christ at this time, which had not ceased to flow into it in an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable measure, and manner till now, must needs be both a special part of Christs satisfaction for us, and consequently that which makes all our temporary desertions rather mercies and blessings, than curses to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us in the next place consider the Effect and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this desertion had upon the Spirit of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:54346:249"/>And though it did not drive him to despair as the Papists falsely charge Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> to have affirmed; yet it even amazed him, and almost swallowed up his soul in the deeps of trouble and conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This cry is a cry from the deeps; from a soul op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed even to death. Never was the Lord Jesus so put to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is a most astonishing out-cry.</p>
               <p>Let but five particulars be weighed, and you will say never was there any darkness like this. No sorrow like Christs sorrow in his deserted state. For,

And surely as it was to Christ, so it. is to all gratious souls the saddest stroke, the heaviest burden that ever they felt. When <hi>David</hi> forbad <hi>Absolom</hi> to come to <hi>jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to see his Father, he complains in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (said he) <hi>am I come from</hi> Geshur, <hi>if I may not see the Kings face?</hi> So doth the gratious soul bemcan it self, wherefore am I redeemed, called, and reconciled; if I may not see the face of my God?</p>

And is it strange that a poor deserted believer should mourn every time he looks heaven ward? Say, Christian, did the tears never tricle down thy cheeks when thou lookedst towards heaven, and couldst not see the face of thy God as at other times? If two dear friends cannot part, though it be but for a season, but that parting must be in a shower: blame not the Saints if they sigh and mourn bitterly when the Lord, who is the life of their life departs; though but for a season from them; for if God depart, their sweetest enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on earth, the very crown of all their comforts is gone, and what will a King take in exchange for his crown? what can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to a Saint, the loss of his God!

Pity is a due debt to the distressed, and the world shews not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter distress than this.

For he was forsaken for you. And Gods forsaking him. though but for a few hours, is equivalent to his forsaking you for ever. It is every way as much for the dear Son of God, the darling delight of his soul, to be forsaken of God for a time; as if such a poor inconsiderable thing as thou art, shouldst be cast off to eternity. Now this being equivalent and born in thy room, must needs give thee the highest security in the world, that God will never finally withdraw from the.

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Though God deserted Christ, yet at the same time he powerfully supported him. His omnipotent arms were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, though his pleased face was hid from him. He had not indeed his smiles, but he had his supportations. So (Christan)
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:54346:251"/>
just so shall it be with thee. Thy God may turn away his face, he will not pluck away his arm. When one asked of holy Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> how the case stood with his soul, he answered; <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> I have, though <hi>suavities I want.</hi> Our Father in this deals with us, as we our selves sometimes do with a Child that is stubborn and rebellious. We turn him out of doors, and bid him be gone our of our sight; and there sighs and weeps, but how ever, for the humbling of him will not presently take him into house and favour; yet we order, at least permit the servants to carry him meat and drink. Here is fatherly care, and support; though no former smiles, or manifested de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though God deserted Christ, yet he deserted not God. His Father forsook him, but he could not forsake his Father, but followed him with this cry, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is it not even so with you? God goes off from your souls, but you cannot go off from him. No, your hearts are mourning after the Lord. Seeking him carefully with tears. Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his absence as the greatest evil in this world. This is Christ like. So it was with the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2. Her beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone; but was she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with him so? No such thing. <hi>By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loveth, I sought him but I found him not, I will arise now, and go about the City,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though God forsook Christ, yet he returned to him again. It was but for a time, not for ever. In this also doth his desertion parallel yours. God may for several wise and holy reasons hide his face from you, but not so as it's hid from the damned; who shall never see it again. This cloud will pass away. This night shall have a bright morning. <hi>For</hi> (saith thy God) <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</hi> As if he should say, I may contend with him for a time, to humble him; but not for ever, left instead of a sad child, I should have a dead child. Oh the tenderness even of a displeased Father!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though God forsook Christ, yet at that time he could justifie God. So you read <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.2, 3. <hi>O my God,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I cry in the day time; but thou hearest not, and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:54346:251"/>
in the night season, and am not silent; but thou art holy.</hi> Is not thy spirit according to thy measure, framed like Christs in this? Canst thou not say even when he writes bitter things against thee, he is a holy, faithful, and good God for all this. I am deserted, but not wronged. There is not one drop of injustice, in all the Sea of my sorrows. Though he condemn me, I must and will Justifie him. This also is Christ-like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Though God took from Christ all visible and sensible comforts, inward, as well as outward; yet Christ subsisted by faith in the absence of them all. His desertion put him upon the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his faith. <hi>My God, my God,</hi> are words of faith. The words of one that rolls upon his God. And is it not so with you too? Sence of love is gone, sweet sights of God shut up in a dark cloud; well what then? Must thy hands presently hang down, and thy soul give up all its hopes? What! is there no faith to relieve in this case? Yes, yes, and blessed be God for faith. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light; let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay himself upon his God,</hi> Isai. 50.10. To conclude,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Christ was deserted, a little before the glorious morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of light and joy dawned upon him. It was a little, a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, after this sad cry, before he triumphed gloriously. And so it may be with you. Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy and gladness will come in the morning. You know how Mr. <hi>Glover</hi> was trasported with joy, and cryed out, as a man in a Rapture. O <hi>Austin,</hi> he is come, he is come, he is come, meaning the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who for some time had been absent from his soul.</p>

                  <p>Admonition 1. First, <hi>Exercise the faith of adherence, when you have lost the faith of evidence.</hi> When God takes away that he leaves this.

your God. Direct acts are noble acts of faith, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive ones. Yea, and in some respects to be preferred to them. For,
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First,</hi> As your comfort depends on the evidencing acts of faith, so your salvation upon the adhering act of faith. Evidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but affiance saves you. And sure salvation is more than comfort.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your faith of evidence hath more sensible sweetness, but your faith of adherence is of more constancy, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The former is as a flower in its mouth, the latter sticks by you all the year.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith of evidence brings more joy to you, but faith of adherence, brings more glory to God. For thereby you trust him when you cannot see him. Yea, you beleive not only without, but against sence and feeling. And doubtless that which brings glory to God, is better than that which brings comfort to you. O then, exercise this, when you have lost that.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Admonition 2. Secondly, <hi>Take the right method to recover the sweet light which you have sinned away from your souls.</hi> Do not go about from one, to another complaining; nor yet sit down desponding under your burden. But,
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Search diligently after the cause of Gods withdrawment. Urge him hard by prayer to tell thee wherefore he contends with thee, <hi>Iob.</hi> 10.2. Say, Lord, what have I done that so offends thy spirit? what evil is it which thou so rebukest? I beseech thee shew me the cause of thine anger? Have I grieved thy spirit in this thing, or in that? Was it my neglect of duty, or my formality in duties? Was I not thankful for the sense of thy love, when it was shed abroad in my heart? O Lord, why is it thus with me?</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Humble your souls before the Lord for every evil you shall be convinced of. Tell him it pierces your hearts that you have so displeased him. And that it shall be a caution to you whilst you live, never to return again to folly. Invite him again to your souls, and mourn after the Lord till you have found him. If <hi>you</hi> seek him, <hi>he will be found of you,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. It may be you shall have a thousand Comforters come about your sad souls in such a time to comfor them. This will be to you instead of God, and that will repair your loss of Christ. Despise them all, and say,

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The affliction or suffering he complains of; and that is <hi>Thirst.</hi> There are two sorts of thirst. One natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, another spiritual and figurative.<note place="margin">

His soul thirsted in vehement desires and longings to accomplish and finish that great and difficult work he was now about. And his body thirsted by reason of those unparalleled agonies it laboured under, for the accomplishing hereof. But it was the proper natural thirst he here intends, when he said, <hi>I thirst.</hi> Now this natural thirst of which he complains, is the raging of the appetite for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid nourishment, arising from the scorching up of the parts of the body for want of moisture. And amongst all the pains and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body, there can scarcely be named a greater, and more intolerable one than extream thirst. The most mighty and valiant have stooped under it. Mighty <hi>Sampson</hi> after all his conquests and victories, complains thus, Judg. 15.18. <hi>And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said, thou hast given this great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance into the hand of thy servant, and now shall I die for thirst? and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised.</hi> Great <hi>Darius</hi> drank filthy water,<note place="margin">

Thirst is put to express the most afflicted state. <hi>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none; and their tongue faileth for thirst: I the Lord will hear them, (i. e.)</hi> when my people are in extream necessities under any extraordinary pressures and distresses; I will be with them, to supply and relieve them. Thirst causes a most painful compression of the heart, when the body like a sponge sucks and draws for moisture, and there is none. And this may be occasioned either by long abstinence from drink, or by the labouring and expence of the spirits under grievous agonies, and extream tortures; which like a fire within soon sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now though we find not, that Christ tasted a drop of liquor since he sate with the Disciples at the Table, after that no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments for him in this world: yet that was not the cause of this raging thirst; but it is to be ascribed to the extream sufferings which he so long had conflicted with, both in his soul, and body. These preyed upon him and drank up his very spirits. Hence came this sad complaint <hi>I thirst.</hi>

               <pb n="465" facs="tcp:54346:254"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us consider the time when he thus complained.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>When all things were now accomplished,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> when all things were even ready to be accomplished in his death. A little, a very little while before his expiration. When the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing throws of death began to be strong upon him. And so it was both a sign of death at hand, and of his love to us: which was stronger than death; that would not complain sooner, because he would admit of no relief, nor take the lest refreshment till he had done his work.</p>

               <p>Here we are to enquire into and consider the extremities and agonies Christ laboured under upon the Cross, which occasioned this sad complaint of thirst. And then make application of it in the several inferences of truth diducible from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:54346:255"/>Now the sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the Cross were twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> his Corporeal, and Spiritual sufferings.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> His Corporeal and more external sufferings were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, acute, and extream sufferings. For they were sharp, universal, continual, and unrelieved by any inward comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>First,</hi> They were <hi>sharp sufferings.</hi> For his body was racked or digged in those parts where sence more eminently dwells. In the hands and feet the veins and sinews meet, and there pain and anguish meet with them. Psal. 22.16. <hi>They digged my hands, and my feet.</hi> Now Christ by reason of his exact and excellent temper of body had doubtless more quick, tender and delicate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses than other men. His body was so formed that it might be a capacious vessel to take in more sufferings than any other body can. Sense is in some more delicate and tender, and in others dull, and blunt according to the temperment, and vivacity of the body and spirits. But in none as it was in Christ, whose body was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously formed on purpose to suffer unparalelled miseries and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in. A body hast thou fitted me. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. Neither sin, nor sickness had any way enfeebled, or dulled it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As his pains were sharp, so they were <hi>universal,</hi> not affecting one but every part. They seized every member. From head to foot no member was free from torture. For as his head was wounded with thorns, his back with bloody lashes, his side with a spear, his hands and feet with nails. So every other part was stretched and distended beyond its natural length, by hanging upon that cruel engine of torment the Cross. And as every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, so every particular sence was afflicted, his sight with vile wretches, cruel murderers that stood about him. His hearing with horrid blasphemies, belcht out against him. His tast with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and gall, which they gave to aggravate his misery: his smell, with that filthy <hi>Golgotha</hi> where he was crucified, and his feeling with exquisite pains in every part. So that he was not only sharply, but universally tormented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These universal pains were <hi>continual,</hi> not by fits, but without any intermission. He had not a moments ease by the cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pains. Wave came upon wave, one grief driving on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:54346:255"/>
till all Gods waves and billows had gone over him. To be in extremity of pain, and that without a moments intermission, will quickly pull down the stoutest nature in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, as his pains were sharp, universal, and continual; so they were altogether unrelieved by his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part. If a man have sweet comforts flowing into his soul from God, they will sweetly demulce and allay the pains of the body. This made the Martyrs shout amidst the flames. Yea even inferiour comforts and delights of the mind will greatly relieve the oppressed body.</p>

               <p>But now Christ had no relief this way in the least. Not a drop of comfort came from heaven into his soul to relieve it, and the body by it. But on the contrary his soul was filled up with grief, and had an heavier burden of its own to bear than that of the body. So that instead of relieving, it increased unspeakably the burden of his outward man. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us consider these inward sufferings of his soul,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how great they were, and how quickly spent his natural strength, and turned his moisture into the drought of Summer. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> His soul felt <hi>the wrath of an angry God,</hi> which was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly imprest upon it. The wrath of a King is as the roaring of a Lion, but what is that to the wrath of a Deity? See what a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given of it in <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Who can stand before his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? And who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi> Had not the strength that supported Christ been greater than that of Rocks, this wrath had certainly overwhelmed, and ground him to powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was the wrath of God that lay upon his soul, so it was the <hi>pure wrath</hi> of God, without any allay or mixture. Not one drop of comfort came from heaven or earth. All the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in his cup were bitter ones. There was wrath without mercy; yea, wrath without the least degree of sparing mercy; for God <hi>spared not his own Son,</hi> Rom. 8.32. Had Christ been abated or spared, we had not. If our mercies must be pure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:54346:256"/>
and our glory in Heaven, pure and unmixed glory; then the wrath which he suffered, must be pure unmixed wrath. Yea,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the wrath, the pure unmixed wrath of God lay upon his soul, so <hi>all the wrath of God</hi> was poured out upon him; even to the last drop. So that there is not one drop reserved, for the Elect to feel. Christs cup was deep and large, it contained all the fury and wrath of an infinite God in it. And yet he drank it up. He bare it all; so that to believing souls, who come to make peace with God through Christ; he saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi> In all the chastisements God inflicts upon his people, there is no vindictive wrath. Christ bare it all in his own soul, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the Tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As it was all the wrath of God that lay upon Christ, so <hi>it was wrath aggravated in divers respects, beyond that which the damned themselves do suffer.</hi> That's strange you will say, can there be any sufferings worse than those the damned suffer, upon whom the wrath of an infinite God is immediatly transacted! Who holds them up with the arm of his power, while the arm of his justice lies on eternally. Can any sorrows be greater than these? Yes, Christs sufferings were beyond theirs in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> None of the damned were ever so near and dear to God, as Christ was. They were estranged from the womb: but Christ lay in his bosom. When he smote Christ, he smote <hi>the man that was his fellow,</hi> Zech. 13.7. But in smiting them, he smites his enemies. When he had to do in a way of satisfaction with Christ, he is said not to spare his own Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Never was the fury of God poured out upon such a person before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> None of the damned had ever so large a capacity to take in the full sence of the wrath of God, as Christ had. The larger any ones capacity is, to understand and weigh his troubles fully; the more grievous and heavy is his burden. If a man cast vessels of greater and lesser quantity into the Sea, though all will be full, yet the greater the vessel is, the more water it contains. Now Christ had a capacity beyond all meer creatures, to take in the wrath of his Father. And what deep and large apprehensions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e had of it, may be judged by the bloody sweat in the garden, which was the effect of his meer apprehensions of the wrath of God. Christ was a large vessel indeed. As he is capable of more glory, so of more sence and misery than any other person in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:54346:256"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The damned suffer not so innocently as Christ suffered, they suffer the just demerit, and recompence of their sin. They have deserved all that wrath of God which they feel, and must feel for ever. It is but that recompence which was meet. But Christ was altogether innocent. He had done no iniquity, neither was guile found in his mouth, yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. When Christ suffered, he suffered not for what we had done; but his sufferings were the sufferings of a surety, paying the debts of others. <hi>The Messiah was cut off, but not for himself,</hi> Dan. 9.26. Thus you see what his external sufferings in his body, and his internal sufferings in his soul were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the last place it is evident that such extream suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as these, meeting together upon him, must needs exhaust his very spirits, and make make him cry, <hi>I thirst.</hi> For let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What meer external pains, and outward afflictions can do. These prey upon, and consume our spirits. So <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.11.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sicut enim uter fumo maceratur, &amp; torrefit; ita animus assiduis doloribus &amp; continuo malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aesta ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauritur &amp; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nsumitur.</hi> Moller. in Loc.</note> 
                  <hi>When thou with rebukes, correctest man for iniquity; thou makest his beauty to consume away as a Moth,</hi> (i. e.) look as a Moth frets and consumes the most strong and well wrought garment, and makes it seary and rotten without any noise, so afflictions wast, and wear out the strongest bodies. They make bodies of the firmest constitution, like an old rotten garment. They shrivel and dry up the most vigorous and flourishing body, and make it like a bottle in the smoke, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.83.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider what meer internal troubles of the soul, can do upon the stongest body. These quickly spend it's strength, and devour the Spirits. So <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.22. <hi>A broken Spirit drieth the bones,</hi> (i. e.) it consumes the very marrow with which they are moistned. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.3, 4. <hi>My bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy on me; my moisture</hi> (or chief sap) <hi>is turned into the drought of Summer.</hi> What a spectacle of pity was <hi>Francis Spira</hi> become, meerly through the anguish of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? A spirit sharpned with such troubles, like a keen knife, cuts through the sheath. Certainly who ever hath had any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with troubles of soul, knows by sad experience, how like an internal flame it feeds and preys upon the very spirits; so that the strongest stoop, and quail under it. But</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:54346:257"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When outward bodily pains, shall meet with inward spiritual troubles; and both in extremity shall come in one day; how soon must the firmest body fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wast away like a candle lighted at both ends! Now streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h fails a pace, and nature must fall flat under this load. When the Ship in which <hi>Paul</hi> sailed, fell into a place where two Seas met, it was quickly wrackt, and so will the best constituted body in the world, if it fall under both these troubles together. The soul and body sympathize with each other under trouble, and mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ually relieve each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her.</p>
               <p>If the body be sick and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull of pain, the spirit supports, chears, and relieves it by reason and resolution all that it can. And if the spirit be afflicted, the body sympathizes, and helps to bear up the spirit. But now, if the one be over-laid with strong pains, more than it can bear, and calls for aid from the other, and the other be oppressed with intolerable anguish, and cries out under a burden greater than it can bear, so that it can contribute no help, but instead thereof adds to its burden which before was above strength to bear. Now nature must needs fail, and the friendly union betwixt soul and body, suffer a dissolution by such an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming pressure as this. So it was with Christ, when outward and inward sorrows met in one day in their extremity upon him. Hence the bitter cry, I thirst.</p>

                     <hi>I thirst, then believers shall never thirst eternally. Their thirst shall be certainly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a three fold thirst, <hi>gracious, natural,</hi> and <hi>penal.</hi> The gracious thirst, is the vehement desire of a spiritual heart after God. Of this <hi>David</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God; when shall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:54346:259"/>
before God?</hi> And this is indeed a vehement thirst, it makes the soul break with the longings it hath after God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. It's a thirst proper to believers, who have tasted that the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Natural thirst</hi> is (as before was noted) a desire of refreshment by humid nourishment, and it's common both to believers and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in this world. Gods dear Saints have been driven to such extremities in this life, that their tongues have even failed for thirst. <hi>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst,</hi> Isa. 41.17. And of the people of God in their Captivity it's said, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst. The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. They that feed delicatly are desolate in the streets, they that were brought up in scarlet, embrace dunghills.</hi> To this many that fear the Lord have been reduced. A <hi>penal thirst</hi> is Gods just denying of all refreshment, or relief to sinners in their extremities, and that as a due punishment for their sin. This believers shall never feel, because when Christ thirsted upon the Cross he made full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God in their room. These sufferings of Christ as they were ordained for them, so the benefits of them are truly imputed to them. And for the natural thirst, that shall be satisfied. For in heaven we shall live without these necessities, and dependencies upon the creature.<note place="margin">

For with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light, shall we see light.</hi> There they shall drink, and praise, and praise and drink for evermore. All their thirsty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires shall be filled with compleat satisfaction. O how desirable a state is heaven upon this account! And how should we be restless till we come thither; as the thirsty traveller is until he meet that cool refreshing spring he wants, and seeks for. This present state is a state of thirsting, that to come of refreshment and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some drops indeed come from that fountain by faith, but they
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:54346:259"/>
quench not the believers thirst. Rather like water sprinkled on fire, they make it burn the more; but there the thirsty soul hath enough.</p>
                  <p>O bless God that Jesus Christ thirsted under the heat of his wrath once, that you might not be scorched with it for ever. If he had not cryed, <hi>I thirst,</hi> you must have cryed out of thirst eternally, and never be satisfied.</p>

                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 6.</note> Did Christ in the extremity of his sufferings, cry, <hi>I thirst. Then how great beyond all compare is the love of God to Sinners. Who for their sakes exposed the Son of his love to such extream sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three considerations marvelously heighten that love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> His putting the Lord Jesus into such a condition. There is none of us would endure to see a Child of our own lie panting, and thirsting in the extremity of torments, for the fairest inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on earth. Much less to have the soul of a child conflicting with the wrath of God, and making such heart-rending complaints as Christ made upon the Cross; if we might have the largest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the world for it: yet such was the strength of the love of God to us, that he willingly gave Jesus Christ to all this misery and torture for us. What shall we call this love! O the height, length, depth, and bredth of that love which passeth knowledge! The love of God to Jesus Christ was infinitly beyond all the love we have to our children, as the Sea is more than a spoonful of water: and yet as dearly as he loved him, he was content to expose him to all this; rather than we should perish eternally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God the Father was content to expose Christ to this extremity; so in that extremity to hear his bitter cries, and dolorous complaints; and yet not relieve him with the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment till he fainted, and died under it. He heard the cries of his Son. That voice, <hi>I thirst,</hi> pierced heaven, and reacht the Fathers ear; but yet he will not refresh him in his agonies, nor abate him any thing of the debt he was now paying, and all this for the love he had to poor sinners. Had Christ been relieved in his sufferings and spared, then God could not have pitied or spared us. The extremity of Christs sufferings was an act of Justice to
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:54346:260"/>
him; and the greatest mercy to us that ever could be manifested. Nor indeed, (though Christ so bitterly complains of his thirst) was he willing to be relieved, till he had finished his work. O love unspeakable! He doth not complain, that he might be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to manifest how great that sorrow was, which his soul now felt upon our account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And it should never be forgotten, that Jesus Christ was exposed to these extremities of sorrow, for sinners, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of sinners; who deserved not one drop of mercy from God. This commends the love of God singularly to us, in that <hi>whilst we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. Thus the Love of God in Jesus Christ still rises higher and higher in every discovery of it. Admire, adore, and be ravished with the thoughts of this Love.</p>

And doubtless as this is in it self a truth, so it's such a truth as may not be excluded, as alien to the true scope and sense of this place.</p>
            <p>And though it be objected that many Types and Prefigurations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at this time unsatisfied, even all that looked to the actual death of Christ, his continuance in the state of the dead, and his resurrection; yet it's easily removed, by considering that they are said to be finished,<note place="margin">

            <p>It is now but bow the head and the work is done, and all the Types therein fulfilled. So that this cannot exclude the fulfilling of the Types in the death of Christ from their just claim to the sense of this place. But yet though we cannot here exclude this sense, we cannot allow it to be the whole, or principal sense. For loe a far greater truth is contained herein, even the finishing or comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole design and project of our Redemption, and therein of all the Types that prefigured it.

               <p>To this great truth the Apostle gives a full testimony, Heb. 10.14. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever, them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> And to the same purpose speaks Joh. 17.4. <hi>I have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thee on earth; I have finished the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou gavest me to do.</hi> Concerning this work and the finishing thereof by Jesus Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross; we shall enquire, what this work was, how Christ finished it; and what evidence can be produced for the finishing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What was the work which Christ finished by his death?</p>
               <p>It was the fulfilling the whole Law of God in our room, and for our Redemption as a Sponsor, or surety for us. The Law is a glorious thing. The holiness of God, that fiery attribute, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven or stampt upon every part of it. Deut. 33.2. <hi>From his right hand went a fiery Law.</hi> The jealousie of the Lord watched over every point and tittle of it, for his dreadful and glorious name was upon it. It cursed every one that continued not in all things contained therein, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Two things therefore were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily required in him that should perfectly fulfil it, and both found in our surety, and in him only; <hi>viz.</hi> a subjective and effective per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A <hi>subjective perfection.</hi> He that wanted this, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver say <hi>it is finished.</hi> Perfect <hi>working,</hi> always follows a perfect <hi>being.</hi> That he might therefore fini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h this great work of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therein the glorious design of our Redemption; loe, in what shining and perfect holiness was he produced? Luk. 1.35. <hi>That holy thing that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God:</hi> and indeed, <hi>such an High-Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. So that the Law could have no exception against his person. Nay it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so honoured since its first promulgation, as it was by having such a perfect and excellent person as Christ, to stand at its Bar; and give it due reparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:54346:262"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There must be also an <hi>effective perfection,</hi> or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of working, and obeying, before it could be said, <hi>it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</hi> This Christ had; for he continued in all things, written in the Law, to do them. <hi>He fulfilled all righteousness,</hi> as it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to do. Matth. 3.15. He did all that was required to be done. And suffered all that was requisite to be suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. He did and suffered all that was commanded, or threatned; in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of obedience, both active and passive, that the pure eye of divine Justice could not find a flaw in it. And so finished the work his Father gave him to do. And this work finished by our Lord Jesus Christ, was both a <hi>necessary, difficult,</hi> and <hi>pretious</hi> work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It was a <hi>necessary work,</hi> which Christ finished upon the Cross. Necessary upon a threefold account.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Opus necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ex parte Patris.</hi>
                  </note>It was necessary on the Fathers account. I do not mean, that God was under any necessity from his nature of redeeming us this, or any other way. For our Redemption is <hi>opus liberi consilii,</hi> an effect of the free counsel of God; but when God had once decreed, and determined to redeem and save poor sinners by Jesus Christ; then it became necessary that the counsel of God should be fulfilled. Act. 4.28. <hi>To do whatsoever thy hand, and counsel had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex parte Filii.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was necessary with respect to Christ. Upon the account of that previous compact that was betwixt the Father and him about it. Therefore it's said by Christ himself, Luk. 22.22. <hi>Truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined, (i. e.)</hi> as it was fore-agreed, and covenanted under the necessity of fulfilling his engagement to the Father, he came into the world; and being come, he still minds his engagement, Joh. 9.3. <hi>I must work the works of him that sent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex parte nostri.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Yea, and it was no less necessary upon our account that this work should be finished. For had not Christ finished this work, sin had quickly finished all our lives, comforts and hopes. Without the finishing this work, not a Son or Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> could ever have seen the face of God. Therefore it's said, Joh. 3.14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moses <hi>lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so [must] the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> On all these accounts the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of this work was necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was <hi>necessary</hi> this work should be finished, so the finishing of it, <hi>was exceeding difficult.</hi> It cost many a cry, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:54346:262"/>
a groan, many a tear, many a hard tug, before Christ could say <hi>it is finished.</hi> All the Angels in Heaven were not able by their united strength to lift that burden one inch from the ground, which Christ bare upon his shoulders, yea, and bare it away. But how heavy a burden this was, may in part appear, by his propassion in the Garden, and the bitter out-crys he made upon the Cross, which in their proper places have been opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and Lastly, It was a most <hi>pretious</hi> work which Christ finished by his death. That work was dispatched, and finished in few hours, which will be the matter of everlasting songs and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs to the Angels and Saints to all eternity. O it was a pretious work. The mercies that now flow out of this fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> Justification, Sanctification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not to be valued. Besides the endless happiness and glory of the coming-world, which cannot enter into the heart of man to conceive. If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels sang when the foundation stone was laid, what shouts, what triumphs, should there be among the Saints when this voice is heard, <hi>It is finished?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us next inform our selves how, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Jesus Christ finished this glorious work. And if you search the Scriptures upon that account, you will find, that he finished it, <hi>obedientially, freely, diligently</hi> and <hi>fully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This blessed work was finished by Jesus Christ most <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</hi> Phil. 2.8.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>He became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross.</hi> His obedience was the obedience of a servant, though not servile obedience. So it was foretold of him, before he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this work. Isai. 50.5. <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back, (i. e.)</hi> my Father told me the very worst of it. He told me what hard and heavy things I must undergo, if ever I finished this design of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and I was not rebellious, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> I heartily submitted to, and accepted all those difficulties. For there is a <hi>Meiosis</hi> in the words. I was content to stoop to the hardest and most ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious part of it, rather than not finish it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Christ finished it <hi>obediently,</hi> so he <hi>finished it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Freedom and obedience in acting are not at all opposite to, or exclusive of each other. <hi>Moses</hi> his Mother nursed him in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the command of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, yet most freely, with respect to her own delight, and contentment in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> work. So it's said of Christ, and that by his own mouth. Joh. 10.17, 18.
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:54346:263"/>
                  <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this commandment have I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of my Father.</hi> He liked the work for the ends sake. When he had a prospect of it from eternity, then were his delights with the Sons of men. Then he rejoyced in the habitable parts of the earth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30, 31. And when he came into the world about it, with what a full and free consent did his heart eccho to the voice of his Father calling him to it? Just as you shall sometimes hear an eccho, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering your voice two or three times over. Psal. 40. <hi>Lo, I come; I delight to do thy will; thy Law is within my heart.</hi> He finished the work freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As he finished it freely, so <hi>he finished it diligently.</hi> He wrought hard from the morning of his life to the end of it; he was never idle whereever he was, but <hi>went about doing good,</hi> Act. 10.38. Sometimes he was so intent upon his work, that <hi>he forgat to eat bread,</hi> Joh. 4.30, 31. As the life of some men is but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version from one trifle to another, from one pleasure to another; so the whole life of Christ was spent and eaten up betwixt one work or another. Never was a life so filled up with labour. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moments of his time, were all imployed for God, to finish this work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly, <hi>he finished it</hi> compleatly <hi>and fully.</hi> All that was to be done by way of impetration,<note place="margin">

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a sinner needs, is perfectly obtained, and purchased. Nothing can be added to what Christ hath done. He put the last hand to it, when he said, <hi>it is finished.</hi> Thus you see what the work was, and how Christ finished it.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Last place let us consider what assurance, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have that Christ hath so finished redemption-work. And if you pursue that enquiry, you will find these, among other plain evidences of it.</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When Christ died, redemption-work must needs be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, in as much as the obedience and blood of Christ, was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value and efficacy, sufficiently able to accomplish all the ends
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:54346:263"/>
for which it was shed. And that not by divine acceptation, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of its proper value. This effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the finishing redemption-work meritoriously by Christ, doth not exceed the power of the cause to which we assign it; <hi>viz.</hi> the death of Christ. And if there be a sole sufficient cause in act, what hinders but the effect should follow? There was certainly enough in Christs blood, to satisfie the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>most demand of Justice: when that therefore is actually shed, justice is fully paid, and consequently the souls for whom, and in whose names it's paid, fully redeemed from the curse by the merit thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's apparent that Christ finished the work, by the discharge or acquittance God the Father gave him, when he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand. If Christ the sinners Surety be as such, discharged by God the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; then the debt is fully paid. Now Christ was justified, and cleared at his resurrection, from all charges and demands of Justice. Therefore it's sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. that he was <hi>Iustified in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (i. e.)</hi> openly discharged, by that very act of the Godhead, his raising him from the dead. For when the grave was opened and Christ rose, it was to him as the opening of the Prison doors, and setting a Surety at liberty, who was clapt up for another mans debt. To the same sense Christ speaks of his ascention, Joh. 16.10. <hi>The spirit</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall convince the world of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (i. e.)</hi> of a compleat and perfect righteousness in me, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to sinners for their perfect Justification; and whereby shall he convince and satisfie them that it is so, why, by this, <hi>because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more.</hi> There's a great deal of force and weight in those words, <hi>because you see me no more.</hi> For it amounts to this much, by this you shall be satisfied I have fully and compleatly performed all Righteousness, and that by my active and passive obedience I have so fully satisfied God for you, as that you shall never be charged or condemned; because when I go to Heaven, I shall abide there in glory with my Father, and not be sent back again, as I should, if any thing had been omitted by me. And this the Apostle gives you also in so many plain words. Heb. 10.12, 13, 14. <hi>After he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sate down on the right hand of God.</hi> And what doth he infer from that but the very truth before us, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. that <hi>by one offering he hath perfected for ever, them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:54346:264"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's evident Christ hath finished the work, by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed effects of it, upon all that believe in him. For by vertue of the compleatness of Christs work finished by his death; their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are now rationally pacified, and their souls at death actually received into glory. Neither of which could be, if Christ had not in this world finished the work. If Christ had done his work imperfectly, he could not have given rest and tranquillity to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and burdened souls that come to him, as now he doth. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. Conscience would still be hesitating, trembling, and unsatisfied. And had he not finished his work, we could not have entrance through the vail of his flesh, into Heaven; as all that believe in him have. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. If he had but <hi>almost</hi> done that work, we had been but <hi>almost saved,</hi> that is certainly damned. And thus you see briefly the evidences, that the work is finished.</p>

Oh there is much emptiness, and vanity in the best of our duties: but here's the grand relief, and that which answers to all the grounds of our doubts and fears upon that account, Jesus Christ hath finished all his work, though we can finish none of ours. And so, though we be defective, poor, imperfect creatures in our selves; yet notwithstanding, we are <hi>compleat in him,</hi> Col. 2.9, 10. though we cannot perfectly obey, or fulfil one command of the Law, yet is <hi>the righteousness of the Law fulfilled in us that believe,</hi> Rom. 8.4.

                  <p>It is true, we ought to be humbled for our defects, and troubled for every failing in obedience; but we should not be discouraged, though multitudes of weaknesses be upon us; and many infirmities compass us about in every duty we put our hand to. Though we

But we would fain be sharing with him in this honour, which he will never endure. Did he finish the work by himself, and will he ever divide the glory and praise of it with us? No, no, Christ is no half Saviour. O it's an hard thing to bring these proud hearts to live upon Christ for righteousness. We would fain add our penny to make up Christs Sum.

And of this the Apostle saith he is confident. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. Jesus Christ is not only called the <hi>Author,</hi> but also the <hi>Finisher</hi> of our faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. If he begin it, no doubt but he will finish it. And indeed the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of his own work of <hi>redemption</hi> without us, gives full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he will finish his work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> within us. And that because these two works of Christ, have a respect, and relation to each other: and such a relation, that the work he finished by his own death, resurrection, and ascension, would be in vain to us, if the work of sanctification in us should not in like manner be finished. Therefore as he presented a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sacrifice to God, and finished redemption-work; so will he present every man perfect and compleat, for whom he here offered up himself. For he will not loose the end of all his sufferings at last. To what purpose would his meritorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration be, without compleat and full application? Be not therefore discouraged at the defects and imperfections of your inherent grace. Be humbled for them, but be not dejected by them. This is Christs work, as well as that. That work is finished, and so will this.</p>

                        </gap>ught upon the shortness of his time, and wrought hard because he knew his working time would be but little. So you find it, Joh. 9.4. <hi>I most work the works of him that sent me whilst it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work.</hi> O in this be like Christ. Rouze your hearts to diligence with this consideration. If a man have much to write, and be almost come to the end of his paper; he will write close, and pack much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in a little room.</item>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He did much work for God, and made little noise. He wrought hard, but did not spoil his work when he had wrought it, by vain ostentation. When he had exprest his Charity in acts of mercy and bounty to men, he would humbly seal up the glory of it, with this charge; <hi>see ye tell no man of it,</hi> Matth. 8.4. he affected not popular air. All the Angels in Heaven could not do what Christ did, and yet he called himself a <hi>worm,</hi> for all that. Psal. 22.6. O imitate your pattern. Work hard for God, and let not pride blow upon it when you have done. It's hard for a man to do much, and not value himself for it too much.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Christ carried on his work for God resolvedly. No discouragements would beat him off, though never any work met with more from first to last. How did Scribes and Pharisees, Jews, Gentiles, yea Devils, set upon him, by persecutions, and reproaches, violent oppositions and subtil temptations; but yet, on he goes with his Fathers work for all that. He is deaf to all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So it was foretold of him, Isai. 42.4. <hi>He shall not fail, nor be discouraged.</hi> O that more of this spirit of Christ, were in his people.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Saevior ab obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ibit.</hi>
                        </note> O that in the strength of love to Christ, and zeal for the glory of God; you would pour out your hearts in service, and like a River sweep down all discouragements before you.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He continued working, whilst he continued living. His life, and labour ended together. He fainted not in his work. Nay, the greatest work he did in this world, was his last work. O be like Christ in this, be not weary of well doing. Give not over the work of God, while you can move hand or tongue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it. And see that your last works, be more than your first. O let the motions of your soul after God, be as all natural motions are,<note place="margin">

finished, when your time is so. O work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling: and that I may perswade you to it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you lay these considerations close to heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> If your work be not done, before you die, it can never be done, when you are dead. <hi>There's no work, nor knowledge, nor device in the grave whither thou goest,</hi> Eccles. 9.5, 10. They that go down to the pit, cannot celebrate the name of God, <hi>Isai.</hi> 38.18. Death binds up the hand from working any more; strikes dumb the tongue, that it can speak no more: for then the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is dissolved. The body which is the souls tool to work by, is broken, and thrown aside. The soul it self presented immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Lord, to give an account of all its works. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing the night cometh, when no man can work, as Christ speaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4. make haste and finish your work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you finish not your work, as the season of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so the season of mercy will be over at death. Do not think you that have neglected Christ all your lives, you that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be perswaded to a laborious holy life, that ever your cries and entreaties shall prevail with God for mercy, when your sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is past. No, no, it's too late. <hi>Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?</hi> Job. 27.9. The season of mercy is then over; <hi>as the tree falls so it lies.</hi> Then he that is holy shall be holy still, and he that is filthy shall be filthy still. Alas, poor souls, you come too late. <hi>The Master of the house is risen up, and the doors are shut,</hi> Luk. 19.42. the season is over. Happy had it been, if ye had known the day of your visitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> If your work be not finished when you come to die, you can never finish your lives with comfort. He that hath not finished his <hi>work</hi> with <hi>care,</hi> can never finish his <hi>course</hi> with joy. Oh what a dismal case is that soul in, that finds it self surprized by death in an unready posture! To lie shivering upon the brink of the grave, saying, Lord, what will become of me! O I cannot I dare not die. For the poor soul to shrink back into the body, and cry; <hi>Oh it were better for me to do any thing than die.</hi> Why what's the matter? Oh, I am in a Christless state, and dare not go before that awful Judgement-seat. If I had in season made Christ sure, I could then die with peace. Lord, what shall I do? How dost thou like this, Reader? Will this be a comfortable close? When one asked a Christian that constantly spent six hours every day in prayer, why he did so? He answered, <hi>O I must die, I must die.</hi> Well then, look it that ye finish your work as Christ also did his.</p>

Nothing but God can please it in this world, and nothing but God can give it content when it goes hence. It is not the amoenity of the place, whither the gratious soul is going, but the bosom of the blessed God who dwells there, that it so vehemently pants after. Not the Fathers house, but the Fathers arms and bosom. <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit. Whom have I in heaven but thee? And o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It also implies <hi>the great value believers have for their souls.</hi> That's the pretious treasure. And their main solicitude and chief care is to see it secured in a sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That it may be safe, what ever becomes of the vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. A believer when he comes nigh to death, spends but few thoughts about his body; where it shall be laid, or how it shall be disposed of: he trusts that in the hands of friends; but as his great
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:54346:269"/>
care all along was for his soul, so he expresses it in these his very last breathings, in which he commends it into the hands of God. It is not Lord Jesus receive my body, take care of my dust, but <hi>receive my spirit.</hi> Lord, secure the Jewel, when the Casket is broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These words implie <hi>the deep sense that dying believers have of the great change that is coming upon them by death; when all visible and sensible things are shrinking away from them, and failing.</hi> They feel the world, and the best comforts in it failing. Every creature and creature comfort failing. For at death we are said to fail, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. Hereupon the soul clasps the closer about its God, clings more close than ever to him. <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> Not that a meer necessity puts the soul upon God. Or that it cleaves to God, because it hath then nothing else to take hold on. No, no, it chose God for its portion when it was in the midst of all its outword enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had as good security as other men have for the long enjoyment of them; but my meaning is, that although gratious souls have chosen God for their portion, and do truly prefer him, to the best of their comforts; yet in this compounded state, it lives not wholly upon its God; but partly by faith, and partly by sense. Partly upon things seen, and partly upon things not seen. The creatures had some interest in their hearts, alas, too much: but now all these are vanishing and it sees they are so. I shall see man no more, with the inhabitants of the world, (said sick <hi>Hezecki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>) hereupon it turns it self from them all, and casts it self upon God for all its subsistance. Expecting now to live upon its God intirely, as the blessed Angels do. And so in faith they throw themselves into his arms. <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, It implies the attonement of God, and his full recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to believer, by the blood of the great sacrifice.</hi> Else they durst never commit their souls into his hands. For <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> Heb. 12.29. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of an absolute God a God unattoned by the offering up of Christ. The soul dare no more cast it self into the hands of God without such an attoning sacrifice, than it dares approach to a devouring fire. And indeed the reconciliation of God by Jesus Christ, as it is the ground of all our acceptance with God; for we are <hi>made accepted in the beloved.</hi> So it's plainly carried in the order or manner of the reconciled souls committing it self to him;
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:54346:270"/>
for it first casts it self into the hands of Christ, then into the hands of God by him. So <hi>Stephen</hi> when dying, <hi>Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.</hi> And by that hand, it would be put into the Fathershand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And lastly, <hi>It implies both the efficacy, and excellency of Faith in supporting and relieving the soul at a time when nothing else is able to do it.</hi> Faith is its conduct, when it is at the greatest loss, and distress that ever it met with. It secures the soul when it is turned out of the body. When heart and flesh fail, this leads it to the rock that fails not. It sticks by that soul till it see it safe through all the territories of Satan, and safe Landed upon the shore of Glory; and then is swallowed up in vision. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a favour it hath shewn the soul while it dwelt in its body. The great service it did for the soul was in the time of its espousals to Christ. This is the marriage knot. The blessed bond of union betwixt the soul and Christ. Many a relieving sight, secret and sweet support it hath received from its faith since that; but surely its first and last works are its most glorious works. By faith it first ventured it self upon Christ. Threw it self upon him in the deepest sense of its own vileness, and utter unworthiness, when sense, reason, and multitudes of temptations stood by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and discouraging the soul. By faith it now casts it self into his arms, when it's lanching out into vast eternity.</p>
               <p>They are both noble acts of Faith, but the first no doubt is the greatest and most difficult. For when once the soul is interessed in Christ, it's no such difficulty to commit it self into his hands, as when it had no interest at all in him. It's easier for a child to cast himself into the arms of its own Father in distress, than for one that hath been both a stranger and enemy to Christ, to cast it self upon him, that he may be a Father, and a friend to it.</p>
               <p>And this brings us upon the second enquiry I promised to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, <hi>sc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What warrant, or incouragement have gratious souls to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> themselves at death, into the hands of God? I answer, much every way: all things encourage and warrant its so doing. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This God upon whom the believer rolls himself at death, is <hi>its Creator.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Haustus ex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igine.</hi>
                  </note> The Father of its being. He created, and inspired it, and so it hath relation of a creature to a Creator, yea, of a creature now in distress, to a faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing; as to a [faithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.]</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:54346:270"/>
It's very true, this single relation in it self gives little ground of encouragement; unless the creature had conserved that integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in which it was originally created. And they that have no more to plead with God for acceptance, but their relation to him as creatures, to a Creator; will doubtless find that word made good to their little comfort, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.11. <hi>It is a people of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will shew them no favour.</hi> But now, grace brings that relation into repute. Holiness ingratiates us again, and revives the remembrance of this relation. So that believers only can plead this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the gratious soul is his creature, so <hi>it is his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creature.</hi> One that he hath bought, and that with a great price. Even with the pretious blood of Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. This greatly encourages the departing soul, to commit it self into the hands of God, so you find, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Into thy hands I commend my Spirit, thou hast redeemed it, O Lord God of truth.</hi> Surely this is mighty encouragement, to put it self upon God in a dying hour. Lord, I am not only thy creature, but thy redeemed creature. One that thou hast bought with a great price. O I have cost thee dear. For my sake Christ came from thy bosom, and is it imaginable that after thou hast in such a costly way, even by the expence of the pretious blood of Christ redeemed me; thou shouldst at last exclude me. Shall the ends both of Creation, and Redemption of this soul be lost together? Will God form such an excellent creature as my soul is, in which are so many wonders of the wisdom and power of its Creator? Will he be content when sin had marr'd the frame, and defaced the glory of it, to recover it to himself again by the death of his own dear Son, and after all this cast it away, as if there were nothing in all this? <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> I know thou wilt have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the work of thy hands. Especially to a redeemed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon which thou hast been out so great sums of Love; which thou hast bought at so dear a rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nay that's not all; the gratious soul may confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and securely commit it self into the hands of God when it parts with its body at death; not only because it is his creature, his redeemed creature, but because it is his <hi>renewed creature also.</hi> And this lays a firm ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the believers confidence of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a, not that it is the proper cause or reason of its acceptance,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:54346:271"/>
but as it is the souls best <hi>evidence</hi> that it is accepted with God, and shall not be refused by him, when it comes to him at death. For in such a soul there is a double workmanship of God, both glorious pieces, though the last exceeds in glory. A <hi>natural workmanship,</hi> in the excellent frame of that noble creature the soul. And a <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious workmanship</hi> upon that again. A new creation upon the old. Glory upon Glory. <hi>We are his workmanship, created in Christ Iesus,</hi> Eph. 2.10. The Holy Ghost came down from heaven on purpose to create this new workmanship. To frame this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And indeed it is the Top and glory of all Gods works of wonder in this world. And must needs give the believer encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to commit it self to God whether at such a time, it shall reflect either upon the end of the <hi>work,</hi> or upon the end of the <hi>workman</hi>; both which meet in the salvation of the soul so wrought upon the end of the work in our glory. By this <hi>we are made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. It is also the design and end of him that wrought it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 55. <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is God.</hi> Had he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed thy soul for glory, the spirit should never have come upon such a sanctifying design as this. Surely it shall not sail of a reception into glory, when it's cast out this Tabernacle. Such a work was not wrought in vain, neither can it ever perish. When once sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation comes upon a soul, it so roots it self in the soul, that where the soul goes, it goes. Gifts indeed, they die. All natural excellency and beauty, that goes away at death, <hi>Iob</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> But grace ascends with the soul. It is a sanctified, when a separate soul. And can God shut the door of Glory upon such a soul, that by grace is made meet for the inheritance? O it cannot be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As the gracious soul is a renewed soul, so it is also a <hi>Sealed Soul.</hi> God hath sealed it in this world for that glory, into which it is now to enter at death. All gracious souls are sealed <hi>objectively,</hi> (i. e.) they have those works of grace wrought on their souls, which do (as but now is said) ascertain and evidence their Title to glory. And many are sealed <hi>formally.</hi> That is the spirit helps them clearly to discern their interest in Christ, and all the promises. This both secures heaven to the soul in it self, and becomes also an earnest or pledge of the glory in the unspeakable joys and comforts that it breeds in the soul. So you find, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> Gods sealing us gives high security. His <hi>objective</hi>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:54346:271"/>
seal makes it sure in it self, his formal seal makes it so to us. But if over and above all this, he will please as a fruit of that his seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to give us those heavenly unexpressible joys and comforts which are the fruit of his formal sealing work, to be an earnest, a foretast and hansel of that glory how can the soul that hath found all this, doubt in the least of a rejection by its God, when at death it comes to him? surely if God have sealed, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse you. If he have given you his earnest, he will not shut you out. Gods earnest is not given in Jest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Moreover, every gratious soul may confidently cast it self into the arms of its God when it goes hence, with <hi>Father, into thy hands I commit my Spirit.</hi> For as much as every grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous soul is <hi>a soul in Covenant with God,</hi> and God stands obliged by his Covenant and Promise to such not to cast them out when they come unto him. As soon as ever thy soul became his by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Promise became its own, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will never leave you, nor forsake you.</hi> And will he leave the soul now at a pinch, when it never had more need of a God to stand by it than it hath then: every gratious soul is entitled to that Promise, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.3. <hi>I will come again and receive you to my self.</hi> And will he fail to make it good, when the time of the Promise is come, as at death it is? It cannot be. Multitudes of Promises, the whole Covenant of Promises give security to the soul against the fears of rejection, or neglect by God. And the souls dependance upon God, and hanging upon a promise, its every rolling it self upon God from the incouragement the word gives it, adds to the ingagement upon God. When he sees a poor soul that he hath made, redeemed, sanctified, sealed, and by solemn Promise engaged himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, coming to him at death, rolling it self upon his faithfulness that promised, saying as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Though,</hi> Lord, <hi>there</hi> be many defects in me, <hi>yet thou hast made a Covenant with me, well order'd in all things and sure; and this is all my salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all my hope.</hi> Lord, I am resolved to send out my soul in an act of Faith. I will venture it upon the credit of thy Promise. How can God refuse such a soul? How can he put it off when it so puts it self upon him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> But this is not all, <hi>the gratious soul sustains many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and dear relations to that God into whose hands it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it self at death.</hi> It's his <hi>Spouse,</hi> and the consideration of such a day of Espousals may well encourage it to cast it self into
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:54346:272"/>
the bosom of Christ, its head and husband. It is a <hi>member</hi> of his body, flesh and bones, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. It is his <hi>child</hi> he its everlasting Father, <hi>Isai.</hi> 9.6. It's his <hi>friend. Hence forth saith Christ I call you not servants, but friends,</hi> Joh. 15.15. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence may these and all other the dear relations Christ owns to the renewed soul beget in such an hour as this is. What husband can throw off the dear wife of his bosom, who in distresses casts her self into his arms! What Father can shut the door upon a dear child that comes to him for refuge, saying, Father, into thy hands I commit my self!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and Lastly, The unchangableness of Gods love to his people gives confidence they shall in no wise be cast out. They know Christ is the same to them at last, he was at first. The same in the pangs of death, as he was in the comforts of life. Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1. He doth not love as the world loves, only in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But they are as dear to him when their beauty and strength is gone, as when it was in the greatest flowrish. If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live, or die; we are the Lords, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. take in all these things and weigh them both apart, and together and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they amount not to a full evidence of the truth of this point, that dying believers are both warranted and incouraged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their souls into the hands of God. Whether they have not every one of them cause to say as the Apostle did, 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and am perswaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.</hi> The improvements of all this you have in the following practical Didu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

                     <hi>Are dying believers only warranted and encouraged thus to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their souls into the hands of God. What a sad straight then must all dying unbelievers be in about their souls?</hi> Such souls will fall into the hands of God, but that's their misery, not their prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. They are not put by faith into the hands of <hi>mercy,</hi> but fall by sin into the hands of <hi>justice.</hi> Not God, but the Devil is their Father, <hi>Iob.</hi> 8.44. Whither should the child go, but to its own Father? They have not one of those forementioned encouragements
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:54346:272"/>
to cast themselves into the hands of God, except the naked relation they have to God as their Creator, and that's as good as none, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the new creation. If they have nothing but this to plead for their salvation, the Devil hath as much to plead as they. It's the new creature that brings the first creation into repute again with God.</p>
                  <p>O dismal! O deplorable case! A pool soul is turning out of house and home and knows not where to go. It departs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately falls into the hands of justice. The Devil stands by waiting for such a soul whom God will throw to him, as a Dog for a crust. Little, ah little do the friends of such a one think whilst they are honouring his dust by a splendid and honourable funeral, what a case that poor soul is in that lately dwelt there; and what fearful straights, and extremities it is now exposed to. They will cry indeed, Lord, Lord, open to us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. But to how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpose are their vain cries. Will God hear him when he cries <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.9.

I know it is objected that God hath made over temporal things to his people upon conditional promises, and an absolute faith can never be grounded upon conditional promises. But what means this objection? Let your faith be but suitable to these conditional promises, that is, believe they shall be made good to you, so far as God sees them good for you. Do you but labour to come up to those conditions required in you, and thereby God will have more glory, and you more comfort.

                  </p>
                  <p>All the graces have done excellently, but faith excels them all. Faith is the <hi>Phoenix grace,</hi> the Queen of graces. Deservedly is it stiled <hi>pretious faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. The benefits and priviledges of it in this life are unspeakable; and as there is no comfortable living, so no comfortable dying without it.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> While we live and converse here in the world, all our comfort and safety is from it, for all our union with Christ the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of mercies and blessings is by faith. Eph. 3.17. <hi>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> No faith, no Christ. All our communion with Christ is by it. He that cometh to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. The souls life is wrapt up in this communion with God; and that communion in faith. <hi>All communications</hi> from Christ depend upon faith; for look as all communion is founded in union, so from our union and communion, are all our communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All communications of quicknings, comforts, joy, strength, and whatsoever serves to the well-being of the life of grace are all through that faith which first knit us to Christ, and still maintains our communion with Christ, believing we rejoyce. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. The inner man is renewed whilst we look to the things that are not seen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as our life and all the supports and comforts of it here are dependent on faith; so you see our death as to the safety and comfort of our souls then depends upon our faith. He that hath no faith cannot commit his soul to God, but rather shrinks from God. Faith can do many sweet offices for your souls upon a death bed, when the light of this world is gone, and all joy ceases on earth. It can give us sights of things invisible in the other world, and those sights will breathe life into your souls amidst the very pangs of death.</p>
                  <p>Reader, do but think what a comfortable foresight of God and the joys of salvation, will be to thee, when thine eye-strings are breaking. Faith cannot only see that beyond the grave which will comfort, but it can cling about its God, and clasp Christ in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise when it feels the ground of all sensible comforts trembling and sinking under thy feet. My heart and my flesh faileth, but God is the strength (or rock) of my heart and my portion for ever. Reeds fail, but the rock is firm footing. Yea, and when the soul can no longer tabernacle here it can carry the soul to God, cast it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, with Father into thy hands I commend my spirit. O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faith!</p>

Heb. 12.24. <hi>He that hath this hope,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to see God) <hi>purifieth himself even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3.

Will you put an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean filthy defiled thing into the pure hand of the most holy God? O see they be holy, and already accepted in the beloved, or wo to them when they take their leaves of those tabernacles they now dwell in.

               </gap>neral. Such a funeral as never was since Graves were first digged. Come see the place where the Lord lay. There are six remarkable particulars about this funeral in these three verses.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The preparations that were made for it, and that was mainly in two particulars <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>begging</hi> and <hi>perfuming</hi> of the body. His body could not be buried, till by begging his friends had obtain'd it is as a favour from his Judge. The dead body was by Law in the power of <hi>Pilate</hi> who adjudged it to death, as the bodies of those that are hanged, are in the power of the Judge to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of them as he pleases. And when they had gotten it from <hi>Pilate,</hi> they winde it in fine linen cloaths with Spices. But what need of Spices to perfume that blessed body. His own Love was perfume enough, to keep it sweet in the remembrance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all generations. However by this they will manifest as they are able, the dear affection they have for him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>bearers</hi> that carried his body to its Grave, <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> two secret Disciples. They were both men of estate and honour. None could imagine that these would have appeared at a time of so much danger, with such boldness for Christ. That ever they would have gone openly and boldly to manifest their love to Christ when dead, who were afraid to come to him (except by night) when he was living. But now a spirit of Zeal and courage is come upon them, when those that made greater and more open confessions of him are gone.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>attendants</hi> who followed the Hearse, were the women that followed him out of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Among whom the two <hi>Marys,</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Zebedes</hi> children (whom <hi>Mark</hi> calls <hi>Salome</hi>) are only named.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Grave or Sepulcher where they laid him. It was in <hi>Iosephs</hi> new Tomb, which he had prepared in the garden near unto <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where our Lord died. Two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable about this Tomb. It was anothers Tomb, and it was a new Tomb. It was anothers. For as he had not an house of his own wherein to lay his head whilst he lived, so he had not a Tomb of his own, to lay his body in when dead. As he lived in other mens houses, so he lay in another mans Tomb. And it was a <hi>new Tomb</hi> wherein never man was yet laid. Doubtless there was much of providence in this, for had any other been laid there before
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:54346:275"/>
him, it might have proved an occasion both to shake the Credit, and slur the glory of his Resurrection, by pretending it was some former body, and not the Lords, that rose out of it. In this also divine providence had a respect to that Prophesie, <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.9. Which was to be fulfill'd at this funeral. <hi>He made his Grave with the rich, because he had done no violence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The disposition of the body in that Tomb. 'Tis true,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> there is no mention made of the groans and tears with which they laid him in his Sepulcher, yet we may well presume they were not wanting in plentiful expressions of their sorrow that way. For as they wept, and smote their breasts when he dyed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.48. So do doubt they laid him with melting hearts, and flowing eyes in his Tomb, when dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And lastly, the last remarkable particular in the Text <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is the solemnity with which his funeral rites were performed, and they were all suitable to his humbled state. It was indeed a funeral as decently order'd as the straights of time and state of things would then permit: but there was nothing of pomp or outward state at all observed. Few marks of honour set by men upon it. Only the heavens adorned it with diverse miraculous works, which in their proper place will be spoken to. Thus was he laid in his Grave where he continued for three incompleat daies and nights in the territories of Death, in the Land of darkness and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Partly to correspond with <hi>Ionah</hi> his Type, and partly to ascertain the world of the reality of his Death. Whence our observation is</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>DOCT. That the dead Body of our Lord Iesus Christ was decently interr'd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </note> by a small number of his own Disciples; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the state of the dead for a time.</head>
               <p>This Observation containing matter of fact, and that so plainly and faithfully delivered to us by the Pens of the several Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists; we need do no more to prepare it for our use, than to satisfie these two inquiries, why had Christ any funeral at all, since his Resurrection was so soon to follow his Death? And what manner of funeral Christ had?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:54346:276"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Why had Christ any funeral at all, since he was to rise again from the dead within that space of time that other men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly have to lie by the wall, before their interment; and had it continued longer unburied, it could see no corruption, having never been tainted by sin. Why, though there was no need of it at all upon that account that a funeral is needful for other bodies; yet there were these four weighty ends and Reasons of it.</p>
               <p>Reason 1. <hi>First,</hi> It was necessary Christ should be buried, <hi>to ascertain his death,</hi> else it might have been looked upon as a Cheat. For as they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re ready enough to impose so gross a Cheat upon the world at his Resurrection, <hi>That the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sciples came by night and stole him away:</hi> much more would they have denied at once the reality both of his death and Resurrection, had he not been so perfumed and interred: but this cut off all pretentions. For in this kind of embalming his mouth, ears, nostrils were all filled with their Spices and odours. Bound up in Linen, and laid long enough in the Tomb to give full assurance to the world of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of of his death. So that there could be no latent principle of life in him. Now since our eternal life is wrapt up in Christs death, it can never be too firmly established. To this therefore we may well suppose providence had special respect in his burial, and the manner of it.</p>
               <p>Reason 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He must be buried <hi>to fulfill the Types, and Prophesies that went before.</hi> His abode in the Grave was prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Ionahs</hi> abode three daies and nights in the belly of the Whale, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40. So must the Son of man be three daies, and threee nights in the heart of the earth. Yea, the Prophet had described the very manner of his funeral, and long before he was born foretold in what kind of Tomb his body should be laid, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.9. <hi>He made his Grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death.</hi> Pointing by that expression at this Tomb of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who was a rich man, and the Scriptures cannot be broken.</p>
               <p>Reason 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He must be buried <hi>to compleat his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; this being the lowest step he could possibly descend in his abased state. <hi>They have brought me to the dust of Death.</hi> Lower he could not be laid, and so low he must lay his blessed head; else he had not been humbled to the lowest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:54346:276"/>Reason 4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But the great end and reason of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was <hi>the conquering of Death</hi> in its own dominion, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; which victory over the Grave furnisheth the Saints with that triumphant <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> song of deliverance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting!</hi> O Grave, where is thy De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>truction! Our Graves would not be so sweet and comfortable to us, when we come to lie down in them; if Jesus had not layen there before us, and for us. Death is a Dragon, the Grave its Den; a place of dread and terror: but Christs goes into its Den, there grapples with it, and for ever overcomes it. Disarms it of all its terror, and not only makes it cease to be <hi>enemical,</hi> but to become exceeding <hi>beneficial</hi> to the Saints. A bed of rest and a perfumed bed. They do but go into Christs bed, where he lay before them. For these ends he must be buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Next let us inquire what manner of funeral Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> had.</p>
               <p>And if we intently observe it, we shall find many remarkable properties in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We shall find it to be a very obscure and private funeral. Here was no external pomp or gallantry. Christ affected it not in his life, and it was no way suitable to the ends and manner of his death. Humiliation was designed in his death. And state is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with such an end. Besides he dyed upon the Tree, and persons so dying don't use to have much ceremony and state at their funerals. Three things shew it to be a very humble and obscure funeral, as to what concerned outward glory, with which the great ones of the earth are usually interred. For

                        <hi>First,</hi> The dead body of the Lord was not brought from his own house, as other mens commonly are; but from the Tree. They beg'd it of his Judge. As who should say <hi>go bring the Corps from Tyburn.</hi> Had they not obtained this favour from <hi>Pilate,</hi> it must have been buried in <hi>Golgotha.</hi> It had been tumbled into a pit, digged under the Cross.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was first beg'd, then buried; so it was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a very poor train.

                  <hi>First,</hi> There was that extraordinary and preternatural Eclipse of the Sun. Such an Eclipse as was never seen since it first shone in heaven. The Sun fainted at the sight of such a ruful specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and cloathed the whole heaven in black. The sight of this caused a great Philosopher, who was then far from the place where this unparallel'd Tragedy was acting, to cry out upon the sight of it,<note place="margin">

What thinkest thou (saith he) of the Eclipse when Christ was Crucified? Were we not both of us then at <hi>Heliopolis</hi>? and standing in the same place, did we not see the Moon in a new manner following the Sun;<note place="margin">

Didst thou not then being greatly terrified say unto me, O my <hi>Dionysius,</hi> what strange commutations of the heavenly bodies are these!</p>
               <p>Such a preternatural Eclipse is remembred in no other History. For it was not in time of conjunction, but opposition; the Moon being then at full. From the sixth, to the ninth hour the Sun and Moon were together in the midst of heaven; but in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she appeared in the East, her own place, opposite to the Sun. And then miraculously returning from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> did not pass by the Sun and set in the West before it; but kept it company for the space of three hours, and then returned to the East again.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:54346:277"/>
And whereas in all other natural Eclipses, the Eclipse alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins on the western part of the body of the Sun, and that part is also first cleared; it was quite contrary in this; for though the Moon were opposite to the Sun, and distant from it the whole breadth of heaven; yet with a miraculous swiftness it overtook the Sun, and darkned first the Eastern part of it; and soon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over its whole body. Which caused darkness over all the the Land, that is say some over the whole Earth, or as others, over the whole Land of <hi>Iewry.</hi> Or as others, over the whole <hi>Horizon,</hi> and all places of the same altitude, and latitude. Which is most probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as Christs funeral was adorned with such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Eclipse, which put the heavens and earth into a mourning; so <hi>the rocks did rend,</hi> the vail of the Temple rent in twain from top to bottom. The graves opened, and the dead bodies of many Saints arose and went into the holy City and were seen of many. <hi>The rending of the Rocks</hi> was a sign of Gods fierce indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.6. And a discovery of the greatness of his power; shewing them what they deserved, and what he could do to them that had committed this horrid fact; though he rather chose at this time to shew the dreadful effects of it upon inanimate Rocks, than Rocky hearted sinners. But especially it served to convince the world that it was none other but the Son of God that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which was farther manifested by these concomitant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>rending in twain of the vail.</hi> It was a notable Miracle, plainly shewing that all ceremonies were now accomplished, and abolished. No more vails now. As also that believers have now most free access into heaven. At that very instant when the vail rent, the <hi>High Priest</hi> was officiating in the most holy place, and the vail which hid him from the people, being rent; they might freely see him about his work in the holy of holies. A lively Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of our <hi>High Priest,</hi> whom now we see by faith in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, there performing his intercession work for us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>opening of the Graves,</hi> plainly shew'd the design and end of Christs going into it. That it might not have dominion over the bodies of the Saints, but being vanquisht and destroyed by Christ, lets go all that are his, whom he ransomed from the Grave as a prey out of its paws. A <hi>Specimen</hi> whereof was given in those holy ones that rose at that time, and appeared to many in

                  <p>Who ever weighed Christ in a pair of ballances (saith another) who hath seen the foldings and plyes, the heights, and depths of that glory which is in him?

                  <p>Thus have his enamoured friends faintly expressed his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and if they have therein done any thing, they have shewn the impossibility of his due praises.</p>

This
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:54346:280"/>
consideration that Jesus Christ hath layen in the Grave himself, gives manifold encouragement to the people of God, against the terrors of the Grave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Grave <hi>received,</hi> but could not <hi>destroy</hi> Jesus Christ. Death swallow'd him, as the Whale did <hi>Ionah</hi> his Type; but could not digest him, when it had swallow'd him but quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up again. Now Christ lying in the Grave, as the common head and representative of believers, what comfort should this inspire into their hearts. For as it fared with Christs personal, so it shall with Christs mystical. It could not retain him, it shall not for ever retain them. This Resurrection of Christ out of his, is the very ground of our hope for a Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of our Graves. <hi>Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the union betwixt the body of Christ and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature was not dissolved; when that body was laid in the Grave; so the union betwixt Christ and believers is not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dissolved when their bodies shall be laid in their Graves. It's true the natural union betwixt his soul and body was dissolved for a time, but the <hi>Hypostatical</hi> union was not dissolved, no, not for a moment. That body was the body of the Son of God when it was in the Sepulchre. In like manner, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural union betwixt our souls and bodies is dissolved by death, but the mystical union betwixt us and Christ, yea betwixt our very dust and Christ, can never be dissolved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As Christs body when it was in the Grave, did there rest in hope, and was assuredly a partaker of that hope. So it shall fare with the dead bodies of the Saints, when they lay them down also in the dust. <hi>My flesh also shall rest in hope,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.9, 10, 11. In like manner, the Saints commit their bodies to the dust in hope. <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death,</hi> Pro. 14.32. And as Christs hope was not a vain hope, so neither shall their hope be in vain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, Christs lying in the Grave before us, hath quite changed and altered the nature of the Grave. So that it is not what it was. It was once a part of the Curse, <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,</hi> was a part of the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening and curse for sin. The Grave had the nature and use of a prison, to keep the bodies of sinners against the great Assizes; and then deliver them up into the hands of a great and terrible
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:54346:280"/>
God. But now it's no prison, but a bed of rest. Yea, and a perfumed bed, where Christ lay before us. Which is a sweet consideration of the Grave indeed. <hi>They shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their beds,</hi> Isa. 57.2. O then let not believers stand in fear of the Grave. He that hath one foot in heaven, need not fear to put the other into the Grave. <hi>Though I go down to the valley of the shadow of Death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me,</hi> Psal. 23.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the Grave is a terrible place to them that are out of Christ. Death is the Lords Serjeant to arrest them. The Grave is the Lords Prison to secure them. When death draws them into the Grave, it draws them thither as a Lion doth his prey into the den to devour it. So you read <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.14. <hi>Death shall feed</hi> (or prey) <hi>upon them.</hi> Death there raigns over them in its full power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. And though at last it shall render them again to God, yet it were better for them to lie everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly where they were, than to rise to such an end. For they are brought out of their Graves, as a condemned Prisoner out of the Prison, to go to execution. But the case of the Saints is not so. The Grave (thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ) is a priviledged place to them while they sleep there, and when they awake, it will be with sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When they awake, they shall be satisfied with his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                  <p>It was an ancient custom of the Jews to put rich treasures into the Graves, with their friends, as well as to bestow much upon their Sepulchers. It's said <hi>Hircanus</hi> opened <hi>Davids</hi> Sepulchre, and took cut of it three thousand Talents of Gold and Silver. And to this sence many interpret that act of the <hi>Chaldeans, Ier.</hi> 8.1. <hi>At that time saith the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the Kings of Iudah, and the bones of his Princes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And shall spread them before the Sun and Moon,</hi> &amp;c. This is rather conceiv'd to be an act of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> than <hi>Cruelty.</hi> They
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:54346:281"/>
shall ransack their Graves for the treasure that is hid there among their bones. It's possible the case so stands with many of you, that you have no great matter to bestow upon your funerals, nor are they like to be splendid; no stately monuments, no hidden treasures, but if Christ be yours, you carry that with you to your Graves, which is better than all the Gold and Silver in the world. What would you be the better if your Coffin were made of beaten Gold, or your Grave-stone set thick with glittering Diamonds? But if you die in the Lord, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> interested in, and united to the Lord; you shall carry six grounds of Comfort with you to your Graves, the least of which is not to be purchased with the wealth of both <hi>Indies.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The first ground of comfort which a believer carries with him to the Grave is, that the Covenant of God holds firmly with his very dust, all the daies of its appointed time in the Grave. So much Christ tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and of Iacob. God is not the God of the Dead, but the God of the Living,</hi> q. d. <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> are naturally dead, but in as much as God long after their deaths, proclaimed himself their God still; therefore they are all alive, <hi>foederally</hi> alive to God. They live, that is, their Covenant relation lives still. <hi>Whether we live, or whether we die</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we are the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.7, 8, 9. Now what an encouragement is here! I am as much the Lords in the state of the dead, as I was in the state of the living. Death puts an end to all other relations and bonds, but the bond of the Covenant rots not in the Grave. That dust is still the Lords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Gods Covenant with our very bodies is indissolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so Gods love to our very dust is inseparable. I am the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God looks down from heaven into the Graves of his Saints with delight, and looks on that pile of dust with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, which those that once loved it, cannot behold without loathing. The Apostle is express, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. That death sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not the believer from the love of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d. As at first it was not our natural comliness or beauty that drew or engaged his love to us, so neither will he cease to love us, when that beauty is gone, and we become objects of loathing to all flesh. When a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band cannot endure to see a Wife, or a Wife her Husband; but saith of them that were once dear and pleasant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> of his beloved <hi>Rachel, bury my dead out of my sight.</hi> Yet then
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:54346:281"/>
the Lord delights in it as much as ever. The Gold-Smith doth not value the dust of his Gold, as Gold values the dust of his Saints, for all these pretious particles are united to Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As Gods love will be with you in the Grave, so Gods providence shall take order about your Graves. When it shall be dig'd for you. And be sure he will not dig your Graves, till you are fit to be put into them. He will bring you thither in the best time, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.26. <hi>Thou shalt come to thy Grave as a Shock of Corn in its season.</hi> You shall be ripe and ready before God house you there. It's said of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>after he had served his generation by the will of God, he fell asleep,</hi> Acts 13.36. O what a holy and wise will is that will of God, that so orders our death? And how equal is it that our will should be concluded by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you be in Christ, as Gods Covenant holds with you in the Grave, his love is inseparable from your dust, his providence shall give order when it shall be digged for you; so in the next place, his pardons have loosed all the bonds of guilt from you, before you lie down in the Grave. So that you shall not die in your sins. Ah friends, what a comfort is this? That you are the Lords Free-men in the Grave? Sin is a bad bed-fellow, and a worse Grave-fellow. It's a grievous threatning, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.24. <hi>You shall die in your sins.</hi> Better be cast alive into a pit among Dragons and Serpents, than dead into your Graves among your Sins. O what a terrible word is that, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.11. <hi>His bones are full of the sins of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</hi> But from the company of sin in the Grave, all the Saints are delivered. Gods full, free, and final pardons have shut guilt out of your Graves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When ever you come to your Graves, you shall find the enmity of the Grave slain by Christ. It is no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; nay you will find it friendly, a priviledged place to you. It will be as sweet to you that are in Christ, as a so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To conclude, if in Christ, know this for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that your own Lord Jesus Christ keeps the Keys of all the Chambers of Death, and as he unlocks the door of Death, when he lets you in; so he will open it again for you, when you awake to let you out; and from the time he opens to let you in till the time he opens to let you out; he himself wakes and watches by you while you sleep there. <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>have the Keys of Death.</hi> O it's comfortable to hear the Keys gingle in his hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. O then as you expect peace or rest in the Chambers of Death, get Union with Christ. A Grave with Christ is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable place.</p>

And as it is full in respect of <hi>Time,</hi> so likewise in respect of <hi>Degrees.</hi> He died not to procure a mitigation or abatement of the rigor or severity of the sentence, but to rescue his people fully from all degrees of wrath.

All the wrath of God to the last drop, was squeezed out into that bitter cup which Christ drank off, and wrung out the very dregs thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This deliverance obtained for us by the death of Christ, is a <hi>special</hi> and distinguishing deliverance. Not common to all, but peculiar to some; and they by nature no better than those that are left under wrath. Yea, as to natural disposition, moral qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and external endowments often times far inferiour to them that perish. How often do we find a moral righteousness, an harmless innocencie, a pretty ingenuity a readiness to all offices of love; in them that are notwithstanding less under the dominion of other Lusts, and under the damning sentence of the Law; whilst on the other side, proud, peevish, sensual, morose, and unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht natures, are chosen to be the subjects of this Salvation. <hi>You see your calling, brethren,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, it is a <hi>wonderful</hi> salvation. It would wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the arm of an Angel to write down all the wonders that are in this salvation. That ever such a Design should be laid, such a project of grace contrived in the heart of God; who might have suffered the whole species to perish; That it should only concern man, and not the Angels, by nature more excellent than us; that Christ should be pitcht upon to go forth upon this glorious Design. That he should effect it in such a way, by taking our nature and suffering the penalty of the Law therein. That our deliverance should be wrought out and finisht when the Redeemer and his design seem'd both to be lost and perished. These with many more are such wonders as will take up eternity it self to search, admire, and adore them.</p>

                     <hi>how little comfort can any man take in his present enjoyments and accommodations in the world, whilst it remains a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him whether he be deliver'd from the wrath to come!</hi> It's well for present, but will it be so still? Man is a prospecting creature, and it will not satisfie him that his present condition is comfortable, except he have some hope it shall be so hereafter. It can afford a man little content that all is easie and pleasant about him now; whilst such passages and terrible hints of <hi>wrath to come</hi> are given him by his own conscience daily. Oh methinks such a thought as this, <hi>what if I am reserved for the wrath to come</hi>? Should be to him as the fingers appearing upon the plaister of the wall were to <hi>Belteshazzar</hi> in the height of a frollick.

They apparel him gorgeously, and feed him with all the dainty meats that may be had; affording him all the pleasure that can be devised: when he hath past certain months in all these pleasures, and like a Capon is made fat with delicate fare, they assemble themselves upon some festival day, and in great pomp bring him to the place of execution where they kill, and eat him.</p>
                  <p>Such are all the pleasures and enjoyments of the wicked, which feed them for the day of slaughter. How little stomach can a man have to those dainties that understands the end and meaning of them. Give not sleep therefore to thine eyes, Reader, till thou

have got good evidence that thou art of that number whom <hi>Iesus hath delivered from wrath to come.</hi> Till thou canst say he is a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to thee. This may be made out to thy satisfaction three waies.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>If Iesus have delivered thee from sin the cause of wrath, thou maist conclude he hath delivered thee from wrath, the effect and fruit of sin.</hi> Upon this account the sweet name of <hi>Iesus</hi> was imposed upon him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou shalt call his name Iesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.</hi> Whilst a man lies under the dominion and guilt of sin, he lies exposed to <hi>wrath to come</hi>; and when he is delivered from the guilt and power of sin, he is certainly delivered from the danger of this coming wrath. Where sin is not imputed, wrath is not threatened.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If thy soul do set an inestimable value on Iesus Christ, and be endeared to him upon the account of that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible grace manifested in this deliverance, it's a good sign thy soul hath a share in it.</hi> Mark what an Epithite the Saints give Christ upon this account, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>Giving thanks to the Father who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of his [Dear] Son.</hi> Christ is therefore <hi>Dear</hi> and dear beyond all compare to his saved ones. I remember it's storied of the poor enthralled <hi>Grecians,</hi> that when <hi>Titus Flamminius</hi> had restored their ancient liberties; and proclamation was to be made in the Market place by an <hi>Herald.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     </gap>, a Saviour, a Saviour: and all the following night they continued dancing and singing about his Pavilion.</p>
                  <p>If such a deliverance so indeared them to <hi>Titus.</hi> How should the great deliverance from wrath to come endear all the Redeemed to love their dear <hi>Iesus.</hi> This is the native effect of mercy on the soul that hath felt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To conclude, <hi>a disposition and readiness of mind to do, or endure any thing for Christs sake upon the account of this deliverance from the wrath to come; is a good evidence you are so delivered,</hi> Col. 1.10, 11. <hi>That we may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work.</hi> There's readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>do</hi> for Christ. <hi>Strengthened with all might according to his

glorious power, unto all patience and long suffering with Ioyfulness</hi>; There's a chearful readiness to <hi>endure</hi> any thing for Christ. And how both these flow from the sence of this great deliverance from wrath, the 12. <hi>vers.</hi> will inform you, which was but now cited. Oh then be serious and assiduous in the resolution of this grand case. Till this be resolved, nothing can be pleasant to thy Soul.</p>

                     </note> The word imports both. And the true meaning is, that by the blood of the Bullock, all whose efficacy stood in its relation to the blood of Christ signified and shadowed by it; the people for whom it was shed, should be reconciled to God by the expiation and remission of their sins.

                  <p>Reconciliation of the Elect to God, is therefore another of those beautiful births which Christ travailed for. So you find it expresly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> This [if,] is not a word of doubting but argumentation. The Apostle supposes it as a known truth, or principle yielded by all Christians; that the death of Christ was to reconcile the Elect to God. And again he affirms it with like clearness, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And having made peace by the blood of his Cross, by him to reconcile all things.</hi> And that this was a main and principal end designed both by the Father and Son in the humiliation of Christ is plain from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> God filled the humanity with grace and authority. The Spirit of God was in him to qualifie him. The authority of God was in him by Commission,<note place="margin">

Now, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> or attonement is nothing else but the making up of the ancient friendship betwixt God and men which sin had dissolved, and so to reduce these enemies into a state of concord and sweet agreement. And the means by which this blessed design was

effectually compassed, was by the death of Christ which made compleat satisfact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that which Christ designed as the end of his dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h was to reconcile God and man. Not the whole <hi>species,</hi> but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>number</hi> whose names were given to Christ. Here I must briefly open. <hi>First,</hi> how Christs death Reconciles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> why this Reconciliation is brought about by his death, rather than any other way. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what are the Articles according to which it's made. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> what manner of Reconciliation this is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>First, How Christ Reconciles God and men by his death.</hi> And it must needs be by the satisfaction his Death made to the Justice of God for our sins. And so, reparation being made, the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ceases. Hence it's said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes are we healed.</hi> That is (as our <hi>English</hi> Annotators well sense it) He was chastized to procure our peace by removal of our sins that set God and us as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, the guilt thereof being discharged with the price of his blood.</p>
                  <p>Now this Reconciliation is made and continued betwixt God and us three waies, namely, by the <hi>oblation</hi> of Christ which was the price that procured it, and so we were <hi>virtually</hi> or meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reconciled. By the <hi>application</hi> of Christ and his benefits to us through faith, and so we are <hi>actually</hi> reconciled. And by the virtual <hi>continuation</hi> of the sacrifice of Christ in heaven, by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and eternal <hi>intercession,</hi> and so our state of reconciliation is <hi>confirmed,</hi> and all future breaches prevented. But all depends as you see, upon the death of Christ. For had not Christ died, his death could never be applied to us, nor pleaded in heaven for us. How the death of Christ meritoriously procures our reconciliation is evident from that forecited Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, (i. e.)</hi> Christs death did meritoriously or virtually reconcile us to God, who as to our state were enemies, long after that reconciliation was made. That the <hi>application</hi> of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to us by faith, makes that virtual reconciliation to become actual is plain enough from <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16.17. <hi>And that he might reconcile both unto God in
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54346:287"/>
one body by the Cross, having slain the enmity thereby. And came and Preached peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh. Now therefore</hi> (<hi>as it is added</hi> vers. 19.) <hi>Ye are no more strangers and foraigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. And that this state of friendship is still <hi>continued</hi> by Christs intercession within the vail, so that there can be no breaches made upon the state of our peace notwithstanding all the daily provocations we give God by our sins; is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truth which the Apostle plainly asserts, after he had given a necessary caution to prevent the abuse of it, in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>My little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father; Iesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation,</hi> &amp;c. Thus Christ reconciles us to God, by his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And if you enquire why this reconciliation was made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by the death of Christ, rather than any other way. Satisfaction is at hand in these two answers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That we can imagine no other way by which it could be compassed. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God could have <hi>Reconciled</hi> us as much by another way, yet he could not have <hi>Obliged</hi> us so much by doing it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as he hath by doing it this way. Surely none but he that was God manifest in our flesh, could offer a sacrifice of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient value to make God amends for the wrong done him by one sin, much less for all the sins of the Elect. And how God should (especially after a peremptory threatening of death for sin) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit us into favour without full satisfaction, cannot be imagined. He is indeed inclin'd to acts of mercy, but none must suppose him to exercise one attribute, in prejudice to another. That his <hi>Iustice</hi> must be <hi>Eclipsed,</hi> whilst his <hi>mercy shines.</hi> But allow the infinite wisdom could have found out another means of reconciling us as much, can you imagine that in any other way he could oblige us as much, as he hath done by reconciling us to himself by the death of his own Son? It cannot be thought possible. This therefore was the most effectual just, honourable and obliging way to make up the peace betwixt him and us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This reconciliation purchased by the blood of Christ, is offered unto men by the Gospel upon certain <hi>Articles</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; upon the performance whereof it actually becomes theirs; and without which, notwithstanding all that Christ hath
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:54346:288"/>
done and suffered, the breach still continues betwixt them and God. And let no man think this a derogation from the freeness and riches of Grace, for these things serve singularly to illustrate and commend the grace of God to sinners.</p>
                  <p>As he consulted his own glory, in the terms on which he offers us our peace with him; so 'tis his grace which brings up souls to those terms of reconciliation. And surely he hath not suspended the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our reconciliation upon unreasonable or impossible conditions. He hath not said, if you will do as much for me, as you have done against me I will be at peace with you: But the two grand Articles of peace with God are <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>faith.</hi> In the first we lay down arms against God, and it's meet it should be so, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit us into a state of peace, and favour: in the other we accept Christ and pardon through him with a thankful heart, yielding up our selves to his government. Which is equally reasonable.</p>
                  <p>These are the terms on which we are actually reconciled to God. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> So Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> And surely it would not become the holy God to own as his friend and favorite a man that goes on perversely and impenitently in the way of sin; not so much as acknowledging or once bewailing the wrong he hath done him, purposeing to do so no more; or to receive into amity one that slights and rejects the Lord Jesus, whose pretious blood was shed to procure and purchase peace and pardon for sinners.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any poor soul that saith in his heart, it repents me for sinning against God, and is sincerely willing to come to Christ upon Gospel terms, he shall have peace. And that peace,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Is no common peace. The reconciliation which the Lord Jesus died to procure for broken hearted believers it is,

As trade flowrishes, and riches come in when peace is made betwixt States and Kingdoms: so all spiritual and temporal mercies flow into our bosoms, when once we are reconciled to God. What the comfort of such a peace will be in a day of straights and dangers, and what it will be valued at in a dying day, who but he that feels it can declare? And yet such a one cannot fully declare it, for it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses all understanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. We shall now make some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this, and pass on to the third end of the death of Christ.</item>

                     <pb n="535" facs="tcp:54346:289"/>Now there is a twofold evil in sin, the <hi>guilt</hi> of it and the <hi>polution</hi> of it. Justification properly cures the former, Sanctification the latter; but both Justification and Sanctification flow unto sinners out of the death of Christ. And though it's proper to say the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit sanctifies, yet it is certain it was the blood of Christ that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us the spirit of sanctification. Had not Christ died, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had never come down from Heaven upon any such design.</p>
                  <p>The pouring forth of Christs blood for us obtained the pouring forth of the spirit of holiness upon us. Therefore the spirit is said to <hi>come in his name, and to take of his and shew it unto us.</hi> Hence it's said, 1 Joh. 5.6. <hi>he came both by blood and by water</hi>; by blood washing away the guilt, by water purifying from the filth of sin. Now this fruit of Christs death, even our sanctification, is a most incomparable mercy. For do but consider a few particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of holiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Holiness is the Image and glory of God. His image <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.10. and his glory, Exod. 15.11. <hi>who is like unto thee, O Lord, glorious in holiness.</hi> Now when the guilt and filth of sin is washt off, and the beauty of God put upon the soul in sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, O what a beautiful Creature is the soul now. So lovely in the eyes of Christ even in its imperfect holiness, that he saith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.5. Turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me.<note place="margin">

                     </note> So we render it, but the Hebrew word signifies, they have made me proud, or puffed me up. It's a beam of divine glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Creature, enamouring the very heart of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it's the souls highest beauty, so it's the souls best evidence for heaven. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,</hi> Matth. 5.8. <hi>And without holiness no man shall see God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. No gifts, no duties, no natural endowments will evidence a righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As holiness is the souls best evidence for heaven, so it's a continual spring of comfort to it in the way thither. The purest and sweetest pleasures in this world are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And to say no more, It is the peculiar mark by which God hath visibly distinguished his own, from other men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>The Lord hath set apart him that is Godly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> Q.

It's certain the last will and Testament of Christ is most sacred, and God will never annul or make it void. Moreover, it is not with Christ as with other Testators who die and must trust the performance of their wills with their Executors, but as he died to put it in force, so he lives again to be the Executor of his own Testament.

                     <note place="margin">An Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the State of Exaltation.</note>HAving finished what I designed to speak to about the work of Redemption, so far as it was carried on by Christ in his humbled state we shall now view that blessed work as it is further advanced and perfected in <hi>his State of Exaltation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole of that work was not to be finished on earth in a state of suffering and abasure, therefore the Apostle makes his Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in order to the finishing of the remainder of his work, so necessary a part of his Priesthood, that without it he could not have been a Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. <hi>If he were on earth he should not be a Priest,</hi> (i. e.) if he should have continued alwaies here, and had not been raised again from the dead and taken up into glory, he could not have been a compleat and perfect Priest.</p>
                  <p>For look as it was not enough for the sacrifice to be slain without, and his blood left there; but after it was shed without, it must be carried within the vail into the most holy place before the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. So it was not sufficient that Christ shed his own blood on earth, except he carry it before the Lord into heaven, and there perform his intercession work for us.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, God the Father stood engaged in a solemn Covenant to reward him for his deep humiliation, with a most glorious and illustrious advancement, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.5, 6, 7. And how God (as it became him) made this good to Christ, the Apostle very clearly expresses it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Justice required it should be so. For how could our sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be detained in the prison of the Grave, when the debt for which he was imprisoned was by him fully discharged, so that the Law of God must acknowledge it self to be fully satisfied in all its claims and demands. His Resurrection from the dead was therefore but his discharge or acquittance upon full payment. Which could not in Justice be denyed him.</p>
                  <p>And indeed God the Father lost nothing by it, for there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a more glorious manifestation made of the name of God to the World than was made in that work. Therefore it's said, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. Speaking of one of the designs of Christs Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it was (saith the Apostle) <hi>That every Tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> O how is the Love of God to poor sinners illustriously, yea astonishingly displayed in Christs Exaltation.

                  <p>Now this singular Exaltation of Jesus Christ as it properly respects his humane nature which alone is capable of advancement, for in respect of his divine nature he never ceased to be the most high. So it was done to him as a common person, and as the head of all believers, their representative in this as well as in his other works. God therein shewing what in due time he intends to do with the persons of his Elect, after they in Conformity to Christ have suffered a while. What ever God the Father intendeth to do in us or for us, he hath first done it to the person of our <hi>representative, Iesus Christ.</hi> And this if you observe, the Scriptures carry in very clear and plain expressions through all the degrees and steps of Christs <hi>Exaltation, viz.</hi> his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, Ascension, Session</hi> at the right hand of God. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Iudge</hi> the World. Of which I purpose to speak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly in the following Sermons.</p>
                  <p>He rose from the Dead as a common person, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If ye then be risen with Christ,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> so that the Saints have Communion and fellowship with him in his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>Ascended</hi> into Heaven as a common person, for so it's said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He hath raised us up,</hi> or exalted us together
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54346:293"/>
with Christ. He sits at Gods right hand as a common person, for so it follows in the next clause, <hi>and hath made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Iesus.</hi> We sit there in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative. And when he shall come again to Judge the World, the Saints shall come with him. So it is Prophesied, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.6. <hi>The Lord my God shall come, and all the Saints with thee.</hi> And as they shall come with Christ from Heaven, so they shall sit on Thrones with him, judging, by way of suffrage. They shall be assessors with the Judge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. This deserves a special remark that all this honour is given to Christ as our head and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative, for thence results abundance of comfort to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Think when you shall hear that Christ is risen from the dead, and is in all that glory and authority in Heaven. How sure the salvation of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed is. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled; we shall be saved by his Life.</hi> Surely it cannot be supposed but he is <hi>able to save to the uttermost all them that come to God by him: Seeing he ever lives to make intercession,</hi> Heb. 7.25. Think how safe the people of God in this world are, whose head is in Heaven.

            <p>WE have finished the Doctrine of Christs humiliation wherein the Sun of righteousness appeared to you as a setting Sun, gone out of sight; but as the Sun when it's gone down to us, begins a new day in another part of the world, so Christ having finisht his course and work in this world; rises again and that in order to the acting another glorious part of his work in the world above. In his death he was upon the matter totally Eclipsed, but in his Resurrection he begins to recover his light and glory again. God never intended that the darling of his soul, should be lost in an obscure Sepulchre. An Angel descends from heaven to roll away the stone, and with it the reproach of his death. And to be the heavenly <hi>Herald</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his Resurrection to the two <hi>Mary</hi>'s, whose love to Christ
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:54346:294"/>
had at this time drawn them to visit the Sepulchre, where they lately left him.</p>
            <p>At this time, (the Lord being newly risen) the keepers were trembling, and become as dead men. So great was the terrible Majesty and awful solemnity attending Christs Resurrection: but to encourage these good souls, the Angel prevents them with these good tidings. <hi>He is not here, for he is risen as he said; come, see the place where the Lord lay,</hi> q. d. Be not troubled, though you have not the end you came for, <hi>one sight more of your dear, though dead Iesus</hi>; yet you have not lost your labour; for to your eternal comfort I tell you, <hi>he is risen; as he said.</hi> And to put it out of doubt, come hither, and satisfie your selves, <hi>see the place where the Lord lay.</hi>

Surely they must have stood as insignificant things in the Scriptures, and so must all the predictions of his Resurrection, by which it was so plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.46. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4.</p>
               <p>To conclude, had he not risen from the dead how could he have been install'd in that glory whereof he is now possessed in heaven, and which was promised him before the world was upon the account of his death and sufferings. <hi>For to this end Christ both dyed, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead, and living,</hi> Rom. 14.9. And that in this state of dominion and glorious advancement, he might powerfully apply the vertues and benefits of his blood to us; which else had been as a pretious Cordial spilt upon the ground.</p>
               <p>So then, there remains no doubt at all of the certainty of Christs Resurrection, it was so, and upon all accounts it must needs be so, for you see how great a weight the Scriptures hang upon this nail. And blessed be God it's a nail fastned in a sure place. I need spend no more words to confirm it, but rather choose to explain and open the nature and manner of his Resurrection, which I shall do by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you four or five properties of it. And the first is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Christ rose from the dead with <hi>awful Majesty.</hi> So you<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> find it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.2, 3, 4. <hi>And behold there was a great Earthquake, for the Angel ef the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sate upon it; his countenance was like lightning, and his rayment white as Snow, and for fear of him the Keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</hi> Humane infirmity was not able to bear such heavenly Majesty as attended the business of that morning. Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ank under it. This Earthquake was as one calls it, <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phale Signum.</hi> A sign of Triumph or token of Victory given by Christ not only to the Keepers and the neighbouring City, but to the whole world, that he had overcome Death in its own dominions, and like a conqueror lifted up his head above all his enemies. So when the Lord fought from heaven for his people, and gave them a glorious, though but Temporal deliverance, see how the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And to increase the splendor of that day, and drive on the Triumph, his Resurrection was attended with the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many of the Saints who had slept in their Graves till then, and then were awakned and raised to attend the Lord at his rising. So you read <hi>Matth.</hi> 27, 52, 53. <hi>And the Graves were opened, and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose, and came out of the Graves, after his Resurrection; and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many.</hi> This wonder was designed both to adorn the Resurrection of Christ, and to give a <hi>specimen</hi> or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of our Resurrection; which also is to be in the vertue of his. This indeed was the Resurrection of Saints, and none but Saints, the Resurrection of many Saints, yet it was but a special Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, intended only to shew what God will one day do for all his Saints. And for present to give Testimony of Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead. They were seen and known of many in the City, who doubtless never thought to have seen them any more in this world. To enquire curiously as some do, who they were, what discourse they had with those to whom they appeared, and what became of them afterwards, is a vain thing. God hath cast a vail of silence and secresie upon these things, that we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with the written Word, and he that <hi>will not believe</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets, neither will he believe though one arise from the dead,</hi> as these Saints did.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As Christ rose from the dead with those <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ellites,</hi> or attendants, who accompanied him at his Resurrection; so it was by the power of his own God-head that he quickned and raised himself; and by the vertue of his Resurrection were they raised al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so who accompanied him. It was not the <hi>Angel</hi> who rolled back the stone that revived him in the Sepulchre; but he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sumed his own life, so he tells us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>I lay down my life that I might take it again.</hi> Hence in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. He is said to be put to death in the flesh but quickned by the Spirit (<hi>i. e.</hi>) by the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:54346:296"/>
power of his God-head o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> divine nature, which is opposed there to flesh or his humane nature. By <hi>the eternal Spirit he offered himself up to God, when he dyed,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by his own God-head, not the third person in the Trinity, for then it could not have been ascribed to him as his own act, that he offer'd up himself. And by the same spirit he was quickned again.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Apostle well observes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>That he was declared to be the Son of God with power, by his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead.</hi> Now if he had been raised by the power of the Father or Spirit only, and not by his own; how could he be declared by his Resurrection to be the Son of God? What more had appeared in him than in others? For others are raised by the power of God, if that were all. So that in this respect also it was a marvellous Resurrection. Never any did, or shall rise as Christ rose by a self-quickning principle. For though many dead Saints rose at that time also. Yet it was by the vertue of Christs Resurrection that their Graves were opened, and their bodies quickned. In which respect he saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.25. when he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed dead <hi>Lazarus. I am the Resurrection and the life,</hi> (i. e.) the principle of life and quickning, by which the dead Saints are raised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And therefore it may be truly affirmed, that though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> some dead Saints were raised to life before the Resurrection of Christ, yet that Christ is <hi>the first-born from the dead,</hi> as he is call'd, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. For though <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others were raised, yet not by themselves, but by Christ. It was by his vertue and power, not their own. And though they were raised to life, yet they died again. Death recovered them again, but Christ dieth no more. Death hath no dominion over him. He was the first that opened the womb of the Earth, the first-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But lastly, Christ rose as a publick or common person.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>As the first fruits of them that sleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. I desire this may be well understood; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or upon this account it is that our Resurrection is secured to us by the Resurrection of Christ; and not a Resurrection only, but a blessed and happy one, for the first fruits, both assured and sanctified the whole crop or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</p>
               <p>Now that Christ did rise as a publick person representing and comprehending all the Elect, who are called <hi>the children of the

So that as we are said to die in <hi>Adam,</hi> (who also was a common person) as the branches die in the death of the root; so we are said to be raised from death in Christ, who is the head, root, and representative of all his Elect seed. And why is he called the <hi>first-born,</hi> and <hi>first begotten from the dead,</hi> but with respect to the whole number of the Elect, that are to be born from the dead in their time and order also, and as sure as the whole harvest follows the first fruits, so shall the general Resurrection of the Saints to life eternal, follow this birth, of the first-born from the dead.</p>
               <p>It shall surely follow it I say, and that not only as a <hi>consequent</hi> follows an <hi>antecedent,</hi> but as an <hi>effect</hi> follows its proper <hi>cause.</hi> Now there is a three fold causality or influence that Christs Resurrection hath upon the Saints Resurrection, of which it is both the <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, efficient,</hi> and <hi>exemplary</hi> cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Resurrection of Christ is the <hi>meritorious</hi> cause of the Saints Resurrection, as it compleated his satisfaction, and finished his payment, and so our Justification is properly assigned to it, as before was noted from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. This his Resurrection was the receiving of the acquittance, the cancelling of the bond. And had not this been done, we had still been in our sins as he speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. And so our guilt had been still a bar to our happy Resurrection. But now, the price being paid in his Death, which payment was finished when he revived; and the discharge then received for us, now there is nothing lies in bar against our Resurrection to eternal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is the meritorious cause of our Resurrection, so so it is the <hi>efficient cause</hi> of it also. For when the time shall come that the Saints shall rise out of the dust, they shall be raised by Christ as their head, in whom the <hi>effective principle</hi> of their life is. <hi>Your life is hid with Christ in God as it is,</hi>

spirit of life which is in him shall be diffused through all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to quicken them also in the morning of the Resurrection. Hence the warm animating dew of Christs Resurrection is said to be to our bodies, as the dew of the morning is to the withered langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing plants which revive by it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Thy dew is as the dew of Herbs,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>the earth shall cast forth her dead.</hi> So that by the same Faith we put Christs Resurrection into the <hi>Premises,</hi> we may put the believers Resurrection into the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</hi> And therefore the Apostle makes them convertibles, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning forward from Christs to ours, and back again from ours, to his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12, 13. Which is also the sence of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> (i. e.) though you are really united to Christ by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet your bodies must die as well as other mens; but your souls shall be presently upon your dissolution swallowed up in life. And then it follows <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>But if the spirit of him that raised up Iesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you,</hi> (i. e.) though your bodies must die, yet they shall live again in the Resurrection; and that by vertue of the spirit of Christ which dwelleth in you; and is the bond of your mystical union with him your head. You shall not be raised as others are, by a meer word of power, but by the spirit of life dwelling in Christ your head, which is a choice prerogative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christs Resurrection is not only the meritorious and efficient cause, but it is also the <hi>exemplary</hi> cause, or pattern of our Resurrection.<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Christs body was raised substantially the same that it was before, and so will ours. Not another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the same body. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very reason the Apostle us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> mortal immortality.</hi> Pointing as it were to his own body when he spake it, the same body I say, and that not only <hi>Specifically</hi> the same, (for indeed no other Species of flesh is so priviledged) but the same <hi>numerically,</hi> that very body, not a new or another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in its steed. So that it shall be both the <hi>what</hi> it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>who</hi> it was. And indeed to deny this is to deny the Resurrection it self. For should God prepare another body to be raised instead of this, it would not be a Resurrection but a Creation; for <hi>non Resurrectio dici poterit, ubi non resurgit quod cecidit.</hi> That can't be call'd a Resurrection, where one thing falls and another thing rises as <hi>Gregory</hi> long since pertinently observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His body was raised, not by a word of power from the Father, but by his own spirit. So will ours. Indeed the power of God shall go forth to unburrough sinners, and fetch them forcibly out of their Graves; but the Resurrection of the Saints is to be effected another way as I opened but now to you. Even by his spirit which now dwelleth in them. That very spirit of Christ which effected their spiritual Resurrection from sin, shall effect their corporal Resurrection also from the Grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His body was raised first, he had in this as well as in other things the preheminence; so shall the Saints in respect of the wicked have the preheminence in the Resurrection, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The dead in Christ shall rise first.</hi> They are to attend the Lord at his coming, and will be knockt up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Christs body was marvelously improved by the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and so will ours. It fell in weakness, but was raised in power, no more capable of sorrows, pains, and dishonours.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To conclude, Christs body was raised from the Dead to be glorified, and crowned with honour. Oh it was a joyful day to him, and so will the Resurrection of the Saints be to them, the day of the gladness of their hearts. It will be said to them in that morning, <hi>awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust,</hi> as <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.19. O how comfortable will be the meeting betwixt the glorified soul, and its new raised body. Much more comfortable than that of <hi>Iacobs</hi> and <hi>Iosephs</hi> after twenty years absence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.29. Or that of <hi>Davids</hi> with <hi>Jonathan</hi> when he came out of the Cave to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.41. Or that of the Father of the prodigal with his Son, who <hi>was dead, and is alive, was lost, and is found.</hi> As he speaks, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. And there are three things will make it so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The gratifications of the Soul by the satisfaction of its natural appetite of union with its own body. For even glorified souls in heaven have such an appetition, and desire of re-union. Indeed the Angels who are pure spirits, as they never h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d union with, so they have no inclination to matter; but souls are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise tempered and disposed. We are all sensible of its affection to the body now in its compounded state, we feel the tender care it hath for the body, the sympathy with it, and loathness to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it. It's said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>To be at home in the body.</hi> And had not God implanted such an inclination to this its Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in it, it would not have paid that due respect it ows the body while it inhabited in it, nor have regarded what became of it when it left it. This inclination remains still with it in heaven, it reckons not it self compleatly happy till its old dear Companion and partner be with it, and to that sence some understand those words, <hi>Iob</hi> 14.14. <hi>All the daies of my appointed time,</hi> (i. e.) of the time appointed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or my body to remain in the Grave, <hi>will I wait till my change</hi> (viz. that which will be made by the Resurrection) <hi>come,</hi> for it's manifest enough he speaks there of the Resurrection. Now, when this its inclination to its own body, its longings and hankerings after it are gratified with a sight and enjoyment of it again, oh what a comfortable meeting will this make it! Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we consider.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:54346:299"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The excellent temper and state in which they shall meet each other. For as the body shall be raised with all the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and endownments imaginable which may render it amiable and every way desireable, so the soul comes down immediatly from God out of Heaven shining in its holiness and glory. It comes perfumed out of those Ivory Palaces, with a strong scent of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon it. And thus it re-enters its body and animates it again. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And principally that wherein the chief joy of this meeting consists, is the end for which the glorified soul comes down to quicken and repossess it. Namely, <hi>to meet the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ever to be with the Lord.</hi> To receive a full reward, for all the labours and services it performed to God in this world. This must needs make that day, a day of Triumph and Exaltation. It comes out of the grave, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> out of his prison to be advanced to highest honour. O do but imagine what an extasie of Joy, and ravishing pleasure it will be for a soul thus to resume its own body, and say as it were unto it, come away my dear, my ancient friend, who servedst, and sufferedst with me in the world; come along with me to meet the Lord, in whose presence I have bee ever since I parted with thee. Now thy bountiful Lord hath remembred thee also, and the day of thy glorification is come. Surely it will be a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful awaking. For do but imagine what a Joy it is for dear friends to meet after long separation, how do they use to give demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their love and delight in each other by Embraces, Kisses, Tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or frame but to your selves a notion of perfect health, when a sprightly vivacity runs through every part; and the spirits do as it were dance before us when we go to any business. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to such a business as the business of that day will be; to receive a Crown and a Kingdom. Do but imagine then what a Sun-shine morning this will be, and how the pains and agonies, cold sweats, and bitter groans at parting will be recompenced by the joy of such a meeting?</p>
               <p>And thus I have shewed you briefly the certainty of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, the nature and properties of it, the threefold influence it hath on the Saints Resurrection, and the conformity of ours unto his in these five respects. His body rose substantially the same, so shall ours. His body was raised by the spirit, so shall ours. Not by the God-head of Christ as his was, but by the Spirit who is the bond of our union with Christ. He was raised as the first begotten from the dead, so the dead in Christ shall rise first. His body was
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:54346:299"/>
improved by the Resurrection, so shall ours. From the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all which</p>

                     <hi>That if Christ was thus raised from the dead, then death is fairly overcome, and smallowed up in Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Were it not so, it had never let Christ escape out of the Grave. The prey of the terrible had never been thus rescued out of its paws. <hi>Death</hi> is a dreadful enemy, it defies all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> None durst cope with this <hi>King of terrors</hi> but Christ. And he by dying went into the very den of this Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, fought with it and foiled it in the Grave its own territories and dominions, and came off a Conqueror. For as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>It was impossible it should hold or detain him.</hi> Never did death meet with its over match before it met with Christ. And he conquering it for us, and in our names, rising as our representative, now every single Saint triumphs over it as a vanquisht enemy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O death where is thy Sting? O Grave where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God, who hath given us the Victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus like <hi>Ioshua</hi> they set the foot of faith upon the neck of that King, and with an holy scorn deride its power. <hi>O death where is thy Sting?</hi> If it be objected that it's said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. <hi>The last enemy that is to be destroyed is Death.</hi> And if so, then it should seem the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not yet atchieved, and so we do but boast before the Victory. It is at hand to reply, that the Victory over death obtained by Christs Resurrection is twofold, either <hi>personal</hi> and <hi>incompleat,</hi> or <hi>general</hi> and <hi>compleat.</hi> He actually overcame it at his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in his own person perfectly, and vertually for us as our head, but at the general Resurrection of the Saints (which his Resurrection as the first fruits assures them of) then it's utterly vanquisht, and destroyed. Till then it will exercise some little power over the bodies of the Saints, in which respect it's called the <hi>last enemy.</hi> For sin the chief enemy that let it in, that was conquered utterly and eradicated when they died; but death holds their bodies in the Grave till the coming of Christ, and then it is utterly to be vanquished. For after that <hi>they can die no more,</hi>
                     <pb n="556" facs="tcp:54346:300"/>
Luk. 20.35. <hi>And then shall be brought to pass that saying that is written, death is swallowed up in Victory. Then,</hi> and not till then will that conquest be fully compleated in our persons, though it be already so in Christs, incompleatly in ours, and then compleatly and fully for ever. For the same word which signifies <hi>Victory,</hi> doth also signifie <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and in this place a final or perpetual conquest. And indeed it drives but a poor trade for present, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only with its <hi>Dart,</hi> not with its <hi>Sting,</hi> and that but the believers body only, and the body but for a time remains under it neither. So that there is no reason why a believer should stand in a slavish fear of it.</p>

To have an able healthy body, and not use it for God for fear of hurting it, is as if one should give you a strong and stately Horse, upon condition you must not work, or ride him.

                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 3.</note>Is Christ risen from the dead, and that as a publick person and representative of believers? <hi>How are we all concerned then to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to our selves an interest in Christ, and consequently to this blessed Resurrection?</hi> What consolation would be left in this world, if the hope of the Resurrection were taken away? 'Tis this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope that must support you under all the <hi>Troubles</hi> of life, and in the <hi>Agonies</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi> The securing of a blessed Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your selves, is therefore the most deep concernment you have in this world. And it may be secured to your selves, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serious heart examination you can discover the following Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
                  <p>Evidence 1. <hi>First, If you are regenerated Creatures,</hi> brought forth in a new nature to God, for we are <hi>begotten again to a lively hope, by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead.</hi> Christs Resurrection is the ground-work of our hope. And the new birth is our title or evidence of our interest in it. So that until our souls are partakers of the spiritual Resurrection from the death of sin, we can have no assurance our bodies shall be partakers of that blessed Resurrection to life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blessed and holy</hi> (saith the Spirit) <hi>is he that hath part in the first Resurrection, on such the second death hath no power,</hi> Rev. 20.6. Never let unregenerated souls expect a comfortable meeting with their bodies again. Rise they shall by Gods terrible Citation, at the sound of the last trump; but not to the same end that the Saints arise, nor by the same principle. They to whom the spirit is now a principle of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> to them he will be the principle of a joyful <hi>Resurrection.</hi> See then that you get gratious souls now, or never expect glorious bodies then.</p>
                  <p>Evid. 2. <hi>If you be dead with Christ, you shall live again by the life of Christ. If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrection,</hi> Rom. 6.5. <gap reason="foreign">

themselves. But I would rather understand it with reference to Christ, and believers; with whom believers are in other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures said to suffer together, and be glorified together, to die together, and live together, to be Crucified together, and buried together all noting the communion they have with Christ, both in his death and in his life. Now if the power of Christs death, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the mortifying influence of it have been upon our hearts; killing their Lusts, deading their affections, and flatting their appetites to the Creature; then, the power of his life, or Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection shall come like the animating dew upon our dead withered bodies, to revive and raise them up to live with him in glory.</p>
                  <p>Evid. 3. <hi>If your hearts and affections be now with Christ in Heaven, your bodies in due time shall be there also,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his glorious body.

                     <hi>the Lord Iesus Christ; who shall change our vile body; that it may be fashioned like unto his own glorious body.</hi> The body is here called vile, or the body of our vileness. Not as God <hi>made</hi> it, but as sin hath <hi>marred</hi> it. Not <hi>absolutely</hi> and in it self, but <hi>relatively,</hi> and in comparison of what it will be in its second edition, at the Resurrection. Then those scattered bones, and dispersed dust, like pieces of old broken battered Silver, will be new cast, and wrought in the best and newest fashion: even like to Christs glorious body. Whereof we have this evidence, that our conversation is already heavenly. The temper, frame, and disposition of our souls is already so; therefore the frame and temper of our bodies in due time shall be so.</p>
                  <p>Evid. 4. <hi>If you strive now by any means to attain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the dead, no doubt but you shall then attain, what you now strive for.</hi> This was <hi>Pauls</hi> great ambition, <hi>that by any means, he might attain the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> Phil. 3.11. He means not simply a Resurrection from the dead, for that all men shall attain whether they strive for it, or no. But by a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymy</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> for the <hi>Ajunct</hi>; he intends that compleat holiness and perfection which shall attend the state of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection so it is expounded, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. So then, if God have raised in your hearts a vehement desire, and assiduous endeavour aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Evid. 5. <hi>If you are such as do good in your Generation.</hi> If you be fruitful and useful men and women in the world, you shall have part in this blessed Resurrection, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.29. <hi>All that are in the Graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the Resurrection of Life.</hi> Now it is not every act <hi>materially</hi> good,<note place="margin">

            <p>IN all the former Sermons we have been following Christ through his Humiliation, from the time that he left the blessed bosom of his Father: and now having finished the whole course of his obedience on Earth, and risen again from the Dead, we must in this Discourse follow him back again into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and lodge him in that bosom of ineffable delight and love, which for our sakes he so freely left. For it was not his end in rising from the Dead, to live such a low animal life as this is; but to live a most glorious life as an enthroned King in Heaven; upon which state he was now ready to enter, as he tells <hi>Mary</hi> in the

               <p>I answer, more generally, he is said to ascend from this world, to leave the world. That is the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> Joh. 16.28.

               <p>

The last sight they had of him in
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:54346:306"/>
this world was a most sweet and encouraging one. They heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from his lips but love, they saw nothing in his face but love; till he mounted his triumphant Chariot and was taken out of their sight.</p>
               <p>Surely these blessings at parting were sweet and rich ones. For the <hi>matter</hi> of them, they were the mercies which his blood had so lately purchased for them. And for their <hi>extent,</hi> they were not only intended for them, who had the happiness to be upon the place with him from whence he ascended; but they reach us, as well as them; and will reach the last Saint that shall be upon the earth, till he come again. For they were but representatives of the future Churches, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. And in blessing them, he blessed us also. And by this we may be satisfied that Christ carried an heart full of love to his people away with him to heaven; since his love so abounded in the last act that ever he did in this world. And left such a demonstration of his tenderness with them at parting.</p>

                        <hi>First,</hi> If Christ had not <hi>ascended,</hi> he could not have <hi>Interceded</hi> as now he doth in heaven for us. And do but take away Christs intercession, and you starve the hope of the Saints. For what have we to succour our selves with under the daily surprises of sin, but this, <hi>that if any man sin, we have an Advocate</hi> [with the Father] mark that <hi>with the Father.</hi> A friend upon the place. One that abides there, on purpose to transact all our affairs, and as a surety for the peace betwixt God and us.</item>

The <hi>fore-runner</hi> made way for all that are coming on in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generations after him. Nor could your bodies have ascended after their Resurrection, but in the vertue of Christs ascension. For he ascended (as was said before) in the capacity of our head, and representative. To his Father and our Father. For us and himself too.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Christ had not ascended, he could not have been <hi>inaugurated</hi> and <hi>installed</hi> in the glory he now enjoys in heaven. This world is not the place where perfect felicity and glory dwells. And then how had the promise of the Father been made good to him? Or our glory (which consists in being with, and conformed to him) where had it been? <hi>Ought not Christ to suffer, and to enter into his glory?</hi> Luk. 24.25.</item>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If Christ had not ascended, how could we have been satisfied that his payment on the Cross made full satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How should we have enjoyed the great blessings of the Spirit and Ordinances, if Christ had not ascended? And surely we could not have been without either. If Christ had not gone away, <hi>the Comforter had not come,</hi> Joh. 16.7. He begins where Christ finished. For he <hi>takes of his, and shews it to us,</hi> Joh. 16.14. And therefore it's said, <hi>

And indeed by Christs ascension both his <hi>sanctifying</hi> and his <hi>ministring</hi> gifts, were shed forth more commonly, and more abundantly upon men. These fell from him when he ascended, as <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <item>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And lastly, if Christ had not ascended how had all the <hi>Types</hi> and Prophesies that figured and fore-told it been fulfilled?
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:54346:307"/>
                        <hi>And the Scriptures cannot be broken,</hi> Joh. 10.35. So that upon all these accounts it was expedient that he should go away. It was for his glory, and for our advantage. Though we lost the comfort of his bodily presence by it, yet <hi>if we loved him we would rejoyce because he went to the Father,</hi> Joh 14.28. We ought to have rejoyced in his advancement, though it had been to our loss: but when it is so much for our benefit as well as his Glory; it's matter of joy on both sides that he is ascended <hi>to his Father, and our Father; to his God, and to our God.</hi> From the several blessings flowing to us out of Christs ascension, it was that he charged his people not to be troubled at his leaving of them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.

Beware you abuse not either of these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Abuse not the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and Officers of Christ. This is a sin that no Nation is plunged deeper into the guilt of it, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely God hath <hi>written to us the great things of his Law, and we have accounted them small things.</hi> We have been loose, wanton, sceptical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors for the most part; that have had nice and coy stomachs that could not relish plain wholesom truths; except so and so modified to our humors.

already. And I doubt before he make an end, plain truths will down with us; and we shall bless God for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> But in the next place see that you abuse not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whom Christ hath sent from Heaven at his ascension; to supply his bodily absence among us, and is the great pledge of his care for, and tender love to his people. Now take heed that you dont <hi>vex</hi> him by your <hi>disobedience.</hi> Nor <hi>greive</hi> him by your <hi>unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi> Nor <hi>quench</hi> him by your <hi>sinful neglects</hi> of duty, or abuse of light. O deal kindly with the Spirit and obey his voice. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his designs, and yield up your selves to his guidance and conduct. Methinks to be intreated, by the <hi>Love of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 15.30. Should be as great an Argument as to be intreated <hi>for Christs sake.</hi> Now to perswade all the Saints to be tender of grieving the Spirit, by sin; let me urge a few Considerations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the point under hand. And

                        <item>Consid. 1. <hi>First, He was the first and principal mercy that Christ received for you, at his first entrance into Heaven.</hi> It was the first thing he asked of God, when he came to Heaven. So he speaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter; that he may abide with you.</hi> No sooner had he set foot upon the place but the first thing, the great thing that was upon his heart to ask the Father for us, was that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit might be forthwith dispatcht, and sent down to his people. So that the spirit is <hi>the first-born of mercies.</hi> And deserves the first place in our hearts, and esteems.</item>
                        <item>Consid. 2. <hi>Secondly, The Spirit comes not in his own name to us</hi> (though if so, he deserves a dear welcome for his own sake, and for the benefits we receive by him which are inestimable) <hi>but he comes to us in the name, and in the loves both of the Father and Son.</hi> As one authorized and delegated by them. Bringing his <hi>Credentials</hi> under both their hands, and seals, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>But when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is come whom I will send to you, from the Father.</hi> Mark I will send him from the Father, and in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26.

And if you have any Love for the <hi>God</hi> that made you, any kindness for <hi>Christ</hi> that died for you; shew it by your obedience to the <hi>Spirit</hi> that comes from them both; and in both their names to us: and who will be

            <p>CHrist being returned again to his Father, having finished his whole work on earth, is there bid by the Father to sit down in the seat of honour, and rest. A seat prepared for him at Gods right hand, that makes it <hi>honourable,</hi> and all his enemies as a footstool under his feet, that makes it <hi>easie.</hi> How much is the state and condition of Jesus Christ changed in a few days! Here he groaned, wept, laboured, suffered, sweat, yea sweat blood, and found no rest in this world; but when he comes to Heaven, there he enters into rest. Sits down for ever in the highest, and easiest throne prepared by the Father for him, when he had done his work. <hi>When he had by himself purged our sins, he sate down,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>What are we to understand here by Gods right hand?</hi> It's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious enough, that the expression is not proper, but figurative, and borrowed. God hath no hand, right or left; but it's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending expression wherein God stoops to the Creatures under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and by it he would have us to understand <hi>honour, power</hi> and <hi>nearness,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The right hand is the hand of honour, the upper hand, where we place those whom we highly esteem and honour. So <hi>Solomon</hi> placed his Mother in a seat, at his right hand, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.19. So in token of honour God sets Christ at his right hand; which on that account in the Text is called the right hand of <hi>Majesty.</hi> God hath therein exprest more favour, delight and honour to Jesus Christ, than ever he did to any creature. <hi>To which of the Angels said he at any time, sit thou on my right hand?</hi> Heb. 1.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The right hand is the hand of power: we call it the <hi>weapon hand,</hi> and the <hi>working hand.</hi> And the setting of Christ
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:54346:311"/>
there, imports his exaltation to the highest authority, and most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream dominion. Not that God the Father hath put himself out of his Authority, and advanced Christ above himself; no, <hi>for in that he saith he hath put all things under him, it is manifest, that he is excepted which did put all things under him,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.27. But to sit as an enthroned King, at Gods right hand, imports power. Yea, the most soveraign and supream power: and so Christ himself calls the right hand at which he sits, Matth. 26.64. <hi>hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And as it signifies honour and power, so nearness in place, as we use to say <hi>at ones elbow,</hi> and so it is applied to Christ, in Psal. 110.5. <hi>The Lord at thy right hand, shall strike through Kings in the day of his wrath</hi>; that is, the Lord who is very near thee, present with thee, he shall subdue thine enemies. This is that then we are to understand by Gods right hand. Honour, power and nearness.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the next place let us see what is implied in Christ sitting at Gods right hand, with his enemies for his footstool. And if we attently consider, we shall find that it implies and imports divers great and weighty things in it. As,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It implies <hi>the Complement and Perfection of Christs work, that he came into the world about.</hi> After his work was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then he sat down and rested from those labours, Heb. 10.11.12. <hi>Every Priest standeth daily ministring, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices; which can never take away sins; but this man when he had once offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God.</hi> Here he assigns a double diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Levitical Priests</hi>; they <hi>stand,</hi> which is the posture of Servants; he <hi>sits,</hi> which is the posture of a Lord. They stand daily, because their sacrifices cannot take away sin; he did his work fully, by one offering; and after that sits, or rests for ever in Heaven.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Edw.

So Christ, while he was here on earth, being anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Ghost and wisdom, went about doing good, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. and having ceased from his works, did at last enter into his rest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.10. which is the heavenly Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19.</item>

And it is as if he had said, <hi>O my Son, what shall be done for thee this day? thou hast finished a great work, and in all the parts of it acquitted thy self as an able and faithful servant to me; what honours shall I now bestow upon thee? the highest glory in Heaven, is not too high for thee; come, sit at my right hand.</hi> O how well is he pleased with Christ, and what he hath done! He delighted greatly to behold him here at his work on earth, and by a voice from the excellent glory he told him so, when he called out of Heaven to him saying, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.17. and himself tells us, Joh. 10.17. <hi>therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,</hi> &amp;c. for it was a work that the heart of God had been upon from eternity. He took infinite delight in it.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christs sitting down at Gods right hand in Heaven, notes <hi>the advancement of Christs humane nature to the highest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; even to be the object of adoration to Angels and men.</hi> For it is properly his humane nature that is the subject of all this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and advancement; and being advanced to the right hand of majesty, it's become an object of worship and adoration. Not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as it is flesh and blood, but as it is personally united to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person, and enthroned in the supream glory of Heaven. O here's the mysterie, that flesh and blood should ever be advanced to the highest throne of Majesty, and being there installed in that glory, we may now direct our worship to him <hi>as God-man</hi>; and to this end was his humanity so advanced, that it might be adored and worshipped by all. <hi>The Father hath commited all Iudgement to the Son, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> And the Father will accept of no honour divided from his honour. Therefore it's added in the next clause, <hi>he that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent him,</hi> Joh. 5.22, 23. Hence the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <hi>salutations</hi> of their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, beg for grace mercy and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ: and in their <hi>valedictions,</hi> they desire the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to the Churches.</item>

                     <hi>If Christ sate not down to rest in Heaven, till he had finished his work on earth; then 'tis in vain for us to think of rest, till we have finished our work, as Christ also did his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How willing are we to find rest here! To dream of that which Christ never found in this world, nor any ever found before us. O think not of resting, till you have done working, and done sinning. Your life and your labours must end together. <hi>Write</hi> (saith the Spirit) <hi>blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours,</hi> Rev. 14.13. Here you must have the <hi>Sweat,</hi> and there the <hi>Sweet.</hi> 'Tis too much to have two Heavens. Here you must be content to dwell in the <hi>Tents of Keder,</hi> hereafter you shall be <hi>within the curtains of Solomon.</hi> Heaven is the place of which it may be truly said, That <hi>there the weary be at rest.</hi> O think not of sitting down on this side Heaven. There are four things will keep the Saints from sitting down on earth, to rest. <hi>viz.</hi> Grace, Corruptions, Devils, and wicked men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, Grace</hi> will not suffer you to rest here. Its tendencies are beyond this world. It will be looking and longing for the blessed hope. A gratious person takes himself for a Pilgrim, seeking a better Country and is alwaies suspicious of danger in every place and state. It's still beating up the sluggish heart with such language as that, <hi>Mica.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Arise, depart, this is not thy rest, for it is polluted.</hi> Its farther tendencies and continual Jealousies will keep you from sitting long still in this world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your <hi>Corruptions</hi> will keep you from rest here. They will continually exercise your Spirits, and keep you upon your watch. Saints have their hands filled with work by their own hearts every day. Sometimes to prevent sin, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to lament it. And allwaies to watch and fear, to mortifie and kill it. Sin will not long suffer you to be quiet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23, 24. And if a bad heart will not break your rest here, then</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a <hi>busie Devil</hi> will do it. He will find you work enough with his Temptations, and suggestions, and except you can sleep quietly in his arms, as the wicked do, there's no rest to be expected. <hi>Your adversary the Devil goeth about as a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyon, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nor will his Servants, and instruments let you be quiet on this side Heaven. Their very name speaks their turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent disposition.<note place="margin">

            <p>CHrist enthroned in the highest glory in Heaven is there to abide for the effectual and successful government both of the World and of the Church, untill the number given him by the Father before the World was, and purchased by the blood of the Cross be gathered in; and then cometh the Judgement of the great day, which will perfectly separate the pretious from the vile; put the redeemed in full possession of the purchase of his blood in Heaven, and <hi>then shall he deliver up the Kingdom to his Father, that God may be all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This last act of Christ, namely his Judging the world is a special part of his Exaltation and honour, bestowed upon him
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:54346:316"/>
               <hi>because he is the Son of man,</hi> Joh. 5.27. In that day shall his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as King, and absolute Lord, shine forth as the Sun when it shineth in its strength. O what an honour will it be to the man Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">

Men and Devils waiting upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their final Sentence from his mouth. In this will the glory of Christs Soveraignty and power be eminently and illustriously displayed, before Angels and men. And this is that great truth, which <hi>He commanded to be Preached and testified to the people; namely, that it is he which is ordained of God, to be the Iudge of quick and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we have four things to be distinctly considered, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Subject, Object, Fountain,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of this supream judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Subject</hi> of it, <hi>Christ. It is he that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ordained to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Iudge.</hi> Judgement is the act of the whole undivided Trinity. The Father and Spirit Judge as well as Christ in respect of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and consent, but it's the act of Christ in respect of visible management, and execution and so it's his <hi>per proprietatem,</hi> by <hi>propriety</hi> the Father having conferred it upon him, as the Son of man; but not his <hi>per appropriationem,</hi> so as to exclude either the Father or Spirit from their authority, for they Judge by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> of Christs Judiciary authority. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>quick and dead,</hi> (i. e.) all that at his coming do live, or ever had lived. This is the <hi>Object personal.</hi> All the men and women that ever sprang from <hi>Adam,</hi> all the Apostate Spirits that fell from Heaven, and are reserved in chains to the Judgement of this great day. And in this personal object, is included the <hi>real object,</hi> viz. all the actions both secret and open that ever they did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Fountain</hi> of this delegated authority, which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God the Father;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Definitus seu constitutus.</hi>
               </note> for he hath ordained Christ to be the Judge. He is appointed, <hi>sc.</hi> as the Son of man to this honourable office and work. The word notes a firm establishment of Christ in that office by his Father. He is now by right of redemption, Lord and King. He enacts Laws for government, then he comes to Judge of mens obedience and disobedience to his Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, here is the infallible <hi>Truth</hi> or unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> certainty of all this. <hi>He gave us Commandment to Preach,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:54346:317"/>
and testifie it to the people.</hi> We had it in charge from his own mouth; and dare not hide it. Hence the point of Doctrine is plainly this.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>DOCT. That our Lord Iesus Christ is ordained by God the Father,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> to be the Iudge of quick and Dead.</head>
               <p>This truth stands upon the firm basis of Scripture authority. You have it from his own hand, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Iudgement to the Son,</hi> viz. in the sense before given. And so the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Act. 17.31. <hi>He hath appointed a day in the which he will Iudge the world in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>In the day when God shall Iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ.</hi> Three things will be opened here. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>certainty</hi> of a Judgement to come. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>quality,</hi> and nature of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that it's a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of Christs <hi>Exaltation</hi> to be appointed Judge in this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">The Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The certainty of a Judgement. This is a truth of firmer establishment than Heaven and Earth. It's no devised fable, no cunning artifice to keep the world in awe; but a thing as confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, as it is awfully solemn. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As the Scriptures fore-mentioned (with these, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. and many other the true and faithful sayings of God,) do very plainly reveal it: so the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and righteousness of God require it should be so. For the Judge of all the earth will do right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. Now righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness it self requires that a difference be made betwixt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the wicked, <hi>Say ye to the righteous it shall be well with him, wo to the wicked, it shall be ill with him,</hi> Isa. 3.10. But no such distinction is generally and fully made betwixt one another in this world. Yea, rather the wicked prosper, and the righteous perish, <hi>There is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Per sive propter justitiam suam, in saepe valet pro.</hi> Poli Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nop. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>that prolongeth his life in his wickedness,</hi> Eccles. 7.15. Yea, not only in, but for his righteousness as it may be fairly rendred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="591" facs="tcp:54346:317"/>Here <hi>the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than himself,</hi> Hab. 1.14. As the fishes of the Sea, where the great and strong swallow up the small and weak. And even in Courts of Judicature, where the innocent might expect relief; there they often meet with the worst oppressions. How fairly and justly therefore doth the wise man infer a Judgement to come from this consideration?<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>I saw under the Sun the place of Iudgement, that wickedness was there, and the place of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that iniquity was there; I said in my heart, God shall Iudge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose, and for every work,</hi> q. d. the Judgement to come is the only relief and support left to poor innocents, to quiet and Comfort themselves withal. To the same purpose also is that, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.6, 7. <hi>Ye have condemned, and killed the Iust; and he doth not resist you; be patient therefore brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.</hi> It is confest, that sometimes God vindicates his providence against the Atheism of the world, by particular strokes upon the wicked; but this is but rare. And as the <hi>Father</hi> well observes, if no sin were punished here, no providence would be believed; again, if every sin were openly punished here, no Judgement hereafter could be expected. Besides,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man is a reasonable being, and every reasonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an accountable being. He is a capable subject of moral government. His actions have relation to a Law. He is swayd by rewards and punishments. He acts by counsel and therefore of his actions he must expect to give an account, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>So then every one of us, shall give an account of himself to God.</hi> Especially if we add, that all the gifts of body, mind, estate, time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are so many <hi>Talents,</hi> concredited and betrusted to him by God, and every one hath one Talent at least; therefore a time to render an account for all these Talents will come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.14, 15. We are but <hi>Stewards,</hi> and Stewards must give an account, in order whereto, there must be a great <hi>audit</hi> day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And what need we seek evidence of this truth, further than our own conscience? Lo, it is a truth engraven legibly upon
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:54346:318"/>
every mans own breast. Every one hath a kind of little Tribunal, or privy Sessions in his own conscience, which both accuses, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, for good, and evil; which it could never do, were there not a future Judgement of which it is now conscious to it self. In this Court Records are now kept of all that we do, even of our secret actions, and thoughts, which never yet took air; but if no Judgement, what need of Records? Nor let any imagine, that that this may be but the fruit of education and discourse. We have heard of such things, and so are scared by them. For if so, how comes it to obtain so universally? Who could be the Author of such a common deception?</p>

                  <hi>Italy</hi>; or as Armies shout when the signal of Battle is given. Above all which (as some expound it) shall the voice of the <hi>Archangel</hi> be distinctly heard. And after this shout, <hi>the trump of God</hi> shall sound. By this Tremendous blast, sinners will be affrighted out of their Graves, but to the Saints it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no more terrour than the roaring of Cannons, when Armies of friends approach a besieged City, for the relief of them that be within. The dead being raised, they shall be gathered before the great Throne on which Christ shall sit in his glory; and there divided exactly to the right and left hand of Christ, by the Angels. Here will be the greatest Assembly that ever met. Where <hi>Adam</hi> may see his numerous off-spring, even as the sand upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore which no man can number. And never was there such a perfect division made (how many divisions soever have been in the world) none was ever like it. The Saints in this great <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical assize</hi> (as the same Author stiles it) shall meet the Lord in the air, and there the Judge shall sit upon the Throne; and all the Saints shall be placed upon bright clouds, as on Seats or Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds round about him; the wicked remaining below upon the earth, there to receive their final doom and sentence.</p>
               <p>These preparatives will make it awful. And much more will the <hi>work it self</hi> that Christ comes about make it so. For it is <hi>to Iudge the secrets of men,</hi> Rom. 2.16. To sever the Tares from the Wheat. To make every mans <hi>whites</hi> and <hi>blacks</hi> appear. And according as they are found in that Tryal, to be sentenced to their everlasting and immutable state. O what a solemn thing is this!</p>
               <p>And no less will the <hi>execution of the Sentence</hi> on both parts, make it a great and solemn day. The heart of man cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what impressions the voice of Christ from the Throne will make, both upon believers, and unbelievers.</p>
               <p>Imagine Christ upon his glorious Throne, surrounded with Myriads and Legions of Angels, his Royal guard; a poor unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever trembling at the Bar. An exact scrutiny made into his heart and life. The dreadful Sentence given. And then a <hi>cry.</hi> And then his delivering them over to the Executioners of Eternal vengeance, never, never to see a glimpse of hope or mercy any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="594" facs="tcp:54346:319"/>Imagine Christ like the General of an Army, mentioning with honour in the head of all the hosts of Heaven and Earth, all the services that the Saints have done for him in this world. Then sententially justifying them, by open proclamation. Then mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him to the third Heavens, and entring the gates of that City of God, in that noble train of Saints and Angels intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And so for ever to be with the Lord. O what a great day must this be!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it will be an awful and solemn Judgement, so it will be a <hi>Critical</hi> and <hi>Exact</hi> Judgement. Every man will be weighed to his ounces and drams. The name of the Judge is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the searcher of hearts. The Judge hath eyes as flames of fire, which pierce to the dividing of the heart and reins. It's said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. That men shall then <hi>give an account of every idle word that they shall speak.</hi> It is a day that will perfectly fan the world. No Hypocrite can escape. Justice holds the ballances in an even hand. Christ will go to work so exactly, that some Divines of good note, think the day of Judgement will last as long as this day of the Gospels administration hath or shall last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It will be a <hi>Vniversal Iudgement,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>We must all appear before the Iudgement Seat of Christ.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Every one of us shall give an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God.</hi> Those that were under the Law, and those that having no Law, were a Law to themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. Those that had many Talents, and he that had but one Talent, must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at this Bar; those that were carried from the Cradle to the Grave, with him that stooped for Age. The rich, and poor; the Father and the Child; the Master, and the Servant; the believer, and unbeliever must stand forth in that day. I saw the Dead both small and great stand before God, and the Books were opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It will be a Judgement full of <hi>convictive clearness.</hi> All things will be so sifted to the bran (as we say) that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Christ both on Saints and sinners shall be applauded. <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord because thou hast Iudged thus.</hi> His Judgements will be as the light that goeth forth. So that those poor sinners whom he will condemn, shall be first <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> self condemned. Their own consciences shall be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that there is not one drop of injustice in all that Sea of wrath, into which they are to be cast.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="595" facs="tcp:54346:319"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And lastly, <hi>It will be a supream and final Iudgement,</hi> from which lies no Appeal. For it is the Sentence of the Highest, <hi>and only Lord.</hi> For as the ultimate resolution of <hi>Faith</hi> is into the Word, and truth of God;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Dei ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum fit ultima resolutio fidei, ad Dei tribunal ultima resolutio judicii.</hi>
                  </note> so the ultimate resolution of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> is into the Judgement of God. This Judgement is supream and imperial. For Christ is the <hi>only potentate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5. And therefore the Sentence once past, its execution is infallible. And so you find it in that judicial process, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>ult.</hi> Just after the Sentence is pronounced by Christ, it is immediatly added, <hi>those shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into Life Eternal.</hi> This is the Judgement of the great day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the last place, I must inform you that God in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Christ to be the Judge,<note place="margin">That this Judgement makes for Christs Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> hath very highly exalted him. This will be very much for his honour. For in this Christs Royal dignity will be illustrated beyond what ever it was since he took our nature, till that day. Now he will appear in his glory. For
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> This act of Judging pertaining properly to the Kingly Office, Christ will be glorified as much in his Kingly Office, as he hath been in either of the other. We find but some few glimpses of his Kingly Office, breaking forth in this world; as his riding with <hi>Hosannahs</hi> into <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> His whipping the buyers and sellers out of the Temple. His Title upon the Cross, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But these were but faint beams: now that Office will shine in its glory, as the Sun in the midst of the Heavens. For what were the <hi>Hosannahs</hi> of little Children, in the streets of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the shouts and acclamations of thousands of Angels, and ten thousands of Saints? What was his whipping the prophane out of the Temple, to his turning the wicked into Hell; and sending his Angels to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his Kingdom every thing that offendeth? What was a Title written by his Judge, and fixed on the ignominous Tree, to the name that shall be now seen on his Vesture, and on his Thigh; <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will be a display of his glory in the highest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole world. For there will be present at once and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Inhabitants of Heaven and Earth, and Hell. Angels must be there to attend and minister; those glistering Courtiers of Heaven must attend his person. So that Heaven will for a time, be left empty of all its Inhabitants. Men and Devils must be there to be judged. And before this great Assembly, will Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:54346:320"/>
in Royal Majesty that day. He will (<hi>to allude to that Text,</hi> Isa. 24.23.) raign before his Ancients gloriously. <hi>For he will come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.10. The inhabitants of the three Regions, Heaven, Earth, and Hell shall rejoyce, or tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that day. And acknowledge him to be supream Lord and King.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This will roll away for ever the reproach of his death. For <hi>Pilate</hi> and the <hi>High</hi> Priest that Judged him at their bars, shall now stand quivering at his bar; with <hi>Herod</hi> that set him at nought, the Souldiers and Officers that traduced and abused him. There they that reviled him on the Cross wagging their heads, will stand with trembling knees before his Throne. For <hi>every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him,</hi> Rev. 1.7. O what a contemptible person was Christ in their eyes once? As a worm, and no man. Every vile wretch could freely tread, and trample on him; but now such will be the brightness of his glory, such the awful beams of Majesty, that the wicked shall not stand in his presence,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </note> or be able to rise up (as that word imports, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.5.) before him. So that this will be a full and Universal vindication of the death of Christ, from all that contempt and ignominy that attended it. We next improve it.</item>

rescind another. He justified them here in this world by Faith. Declared in his Word (which shall then be the rule of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.) That <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.1. And surely he will not retract his own Word, and give a Sentence quite cross to his own Statute-book, out of which he hath told us they shall be Judged. Moreover,</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The far greatest part of them will have past their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgement long before that day, and being therein acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God the Judge of all; and admitted into Heaven upon the score and account of their Justification; it cannot be imagined that Christ should now condemn them with the World. Nay,</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He that Judgeth them is their head, husband, friend, and brother; who loved them, and gave himself for them: Oh then, with what confidence may they go, even unto his Throne? And say with <hi>Iob, though he try us as fire, we know we shall come forth as Gold.</hi> We know that we shall be justified. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if we add, that they themselves shall be assessors with Christ in that day.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Geodwirs</hi> Triumph. p. 146.</note> And (as a Judicious Author pertinently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves) not a Sentence shall pass without their Votes.
<q>So as that they may by Faith not only look upon themselves as already in Heaven, sitting with Christ as a common person, in their right; but they may look upon themselves as Judges already. So that if any sin should arise to accuse, or condemn, yet it must be with their Votes. And what greater security can they have than this, that they must condemn themselves, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</q>
No, no, it is not the business of that day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, but to absolve and pronounce them pardoned and justified, according to the sence of <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. So that it must needs be a time of refreshing (as the Scriptures call it) to the people of God. You that now believe, shall not come into condemnation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.24.

Thou mistakest, if thou expectest mercy out of that way in which he dispenses it. There will be thousands, and ten thousands that will rejoyce in, and magnifie his mercy then; but they are such as obeyed his call, repented, believed, and obtained union with his person here; but for unbelievers, it's against the settled Law of Christ, and constitution of the Gospel to shew mercy to the despisers of it. But it may be you think your tears, your cryes, your pleadings with him, may move him; these indeed might have done somewhat in time, but they come out of season now. Alas, too late. What the success of such pleas and cries will be, you may see if you will but consult two Scriptures, <hi>Iob</hi> 27.8, 9. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul? Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</hi> No, no, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?

            <p>O Brethren, never was the Heathen world acquainted with such arguments to deter them from sin, never acquainted with such motives to urge them to holiness; as I shall this day acquaint you with. My request is, to give up both your hearts and lives to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Father, Son, and Spirit, whose you are, by the holiness and heavenliness of them. Other things are expected from you, than from other men. See that you turn not all this grace that hath founded in your ears, into wantonness. Think not because Christ hath done so much for you, you may sit still; much less indulge your selves in sin, because Christ hath offered up such an excellent sacrifice for the expiation of it. No, no, though Christ came to be a <hi>Curse,</hi> he did not come to be a a <hi>Cloak</hi> for your sins. <hi>If one died for all then were all dead;</hi>

I know the command obliges all men to it, even those that cast away the cords of the commands, and break Christs bonds asunder are yet bound by them; and cannot plead a dispensation to live as they do. Yea, and it is not unusual for them to feel the obligations of the command upon their consciences even when their impetuous Lusts hurry them on to the violation of them: but there are special ties upon your souls, that oblige you to holiness of life more than others.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> God hath peculiarly obliged you to purity and strictness of Life.

               <hi>The Father</hi> hath obliged you and that not only by the common tie of <hi>Creation</hi> which is yet of great efficacy in it self: for is it reasonable, that God should create and form so excellent a piece, and that it should be employed against him? That he should plant the Tree, and another eat the Fruit of it? But besides this common engagement, he hath obliged you to holiness of life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> By his wise and merciful designs and counsels for your recovery and salvation by Jesus Christ. It was he that laid the corner stone of your salvation with his own hands. The first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sprang out of his breast. If God had not designed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for you, the world had never seen him; he had never left that sweet bosom for you. It was the Act of the Father to give you to the Son to be Redeemed, and then to give the Son to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to you. Both of them stupenduous and astonishing Acts of grace. And in both God acted as a most free Agent. When he gave you to Christ before the beginning of time, there was nothing out of himself that could in the least move him to it. When the Father, Son, and Spirit sate (as I may say) at the Counsel Table, contriving and laying the design for the salvation of a few out of many of <hi>Adams</hi> degenerate off-spring, there was none came before them to speak one word for thee; but such was the divine pleasure to insert thy name in that Catalogue of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Oh how much owest thou to the Lord for this! And what an engagement doth it leave upon thy soul to obey, please and glorifie him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="605" facs="tcp:54346:324"/>Secondly, <hi>By his bountiful remunerations of your obedience, which have been wonderful.</hi> What service didst thou ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for him, for which he hath not paid thee a thousand times more than it was worth? Didst thou ever seek him diligently, and not find him a bountiful rewarder, none seek him in vain, unless such only as seek him vainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Didst ever give a cup of cold water in the name of a Disciple, and not receive a Disciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42. Hast thou not found inward peace and comfort flowing into thy soul, upon every piece of sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Oh what a good Master do Saints serve? You that are remiss and unconstant in your obedience, you that are heartless and cold in duties; hear how your God expostulates with you, <hi>Ier</hi> 2.31. <hi>Have I been a Wilderness to Israel, or a Land of darkness?</hi> q. d. have I been a hard Master to you? Have you any reason to complain of me? To whom soever I have been straight handed, surely I have not been so to you. Are the fruits of sin like the fruits of obedience? Do you know where to find a better Master? Why then are you so shuffling and unconstant, so sluggish and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss in my work? Surely God is not behind hand with any of you. May you not say with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119.56. <hi>This I had because I kept thy precepts.</hi> There is fruits in holiness even present fruit. It is a high favour to be imployed for God. Reward enough that he will accept any thing thou dost. But to return every Duty thou presentest to him with such comforts, such quicknings, such inward and outward blessings into thy bosom, so that thou maist open the the treasury of thine own experiences, view the varieties of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and Love-tokens at several times received in Duties; and say this I had, and that I had, by waiting on God, and serving him. Oh what an ingagement is this upon thee to be ever abounding in the work of the Lord! Though thou must not work for <hi>Wages,</hi> yet God will not let thy work go unrewarded. For <hi>He is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your <hi>Father</hi> hath further obliged you to this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and purity of life, <hi>by signifying to you</hi> (as he hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done) <hi>the great delight and pleasure he hath therein.</hi> He hath told you that <hi>such as are upright in the way are his delight,</hi> Pro. 11.20. That he would not have you <hi>forget to do good and to communicate, for with such sacrifices he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> Heb. 13.16. You know you cannot <hi>walk worthy of the
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:54346:325"/>
Lord to all pleasing,</hi> except <hi>ye be fruitful in every good word and work,</hi> Col. 1.10. And oh what a bond is this upon you to live holy lives! Can you please your selves in displeasing your Father? If you have the hearts of Children in you, sure you cannot. O you cannot grieve his spirit by loose and careless walking, but you must grieve your own spirits too. How many times hath God pleased you, gratified and contented you, and will not you please and content him? This mercy you have asked of him, and he gave it, that mercy and you were not denyed: in many things the Lord hath wonderfully condescended to please you, and now there is but one thing that he desires of you, and that most reasonable, yea, beneficial for you, as well as pleasing to him, 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 27. <hi>Only let your conversation be as becometh the Gospel of Iesus Christ.</hi> This is the one thing the great and main thing he expects from you in this world, and will not you do it? Can you expect he should gratifie your desires, when you make no more of grieving and displeasing him? Well, if you know what will please God, and yet resolve not to do it, but will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther please your flesh, and gratifie the Devil, than him; pray pull off your vizards, fall into your own rank among hypocrites; and appear as indeed you are.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>The Father hath further obliged you to strictness and purity of conversation, by his gratious promises made to such as so walk.</hi> He hath promised to do great things for you, if you will but do this one thing for him. If you will <hi>order your conversation aright,</hi> Psal. 50. <hi>ult.</hi> He will be <hi>your Sun and Shield,</hi> if you will walk before him and be upright, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from him that walketh uprightly,</hi> Psal. 84.11. And he promises no more to you than he hath made good to others, that have thus walked, and stands ready to perform to you also. If you look to enjoy the good of the promise, you are obliged by all your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and hopes to order your lives purely and uprightly. This hope will set you on work to purge your lives as well as your hearts from all pollutions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having these Promises let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Yea, <hi>He hath yet more obliged you to strict and holy lives by his confidence in you that you will thus walk, and please him.</hi> He expresseth himself in Scripture as one that dare
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:54346:325"/>
trust you with his glory, knowing that you will be tender of it, and dare do no otherwise. If but a man repose confidence in you and trust you with his concerns, it greatly obliges you to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. What an engagement was that upon <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly when God said of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his household after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> q. d. as for this wicked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whom I will speedily consume in my wrath, I know they regard not my Laws, they will trample my commands under foot; they care not how they provoke me, but I expect other things from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and I am confident he will not fail me. <hi>I know him,</hi> he is a man of another spirit; and what I promise my self from him, he will make good. And to the like purpose is that in <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.78. <hi>I will mention the loving kindness of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord; according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them; according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. For he said surely they are my people, Children that will not lie,</hi> (or fail me) <hi>so he was their Saviour.</hi> Here you have an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple account of the endearing mercies of God to that people, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and the Lords confident expectations of suitable returns from them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. I said (i. e.) (speaking after the manner of men in like cases) I made full account that after all these endearments, and favours bestowed upon them, they would not offer to be disloyal and false to me. I have made them sure enough to my self, by so many bonds of Love. Like to which is that expression, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I said surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction.</hi> Oh how great are the expectations of God from such as you. I know <hi>Abraham,</hi> there's no doubt of him. And again they are Children that will not lie, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they will not <hi>fallere fidem datam.</hi> Break their Covenant with me. Or they are my people that will not shrink as Mr. <hi>Coverdale</hi> well translates, <hi>filii non ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes,</hi> such as will keep touch with me, and will answer their Covenant engagements. And again surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive <hi>instruction.</hi> And shall not all this engage you to God? What! neither the antient and bountiful love of God, in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your Redemption from eternity, nor the bounty of God in rewarding all and every piece of service you have done for him. Nor yet the pleasure he takes in your obedience and upright walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:54346:326"/>
Nor the incouraging promises he hath made thereto, nor yet his confident expectations of such a life from you whom he hath so many waies obliged and endeared to himself? will you forget your antient friend? Contemn his rewards, take no delight or care to please him? Slight his promises, and deceive and fail his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations? <hi>Be astonished, O ye Heavens, at this! And be horribly afraid.</hi> Consider how God the Father hath fastned this five fold cord upon your Souls, and shew your selves Christians; yea to use the Prophets words, <hi>Esa.</hi> 46.8. <hi>Remember this and shew your selves men.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You are yet farther engaged to this precise and holy life by what the <hi>Son</hi> hath done for you, is not this pure and holy life, the very aim, and next end of his death? Did he not shed his blood to <hi>redeem you from your vain conversations?</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. Was not this the design of all his sufferings <hi>that being delivered out of the hands of your enemies, you might serve him in righteousness and holiness all the daies of your life,</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75. And is not the Apostles inference, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. highly reasonable, <hi>if one dyed for all then were all dead, and that he dyed for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him that dyed for them.</hi> Did Christ only buy your <hi>Persons,</hi> and not your services also? No, no, who ever hath thy time, thy strength, or any part of either: I can assure thee, Christian, that Christ hath paid for it, and thou givest away what is none of thine own to give. Every moment of thy time is his. Every Talent, whether of grace or nature is his. And dost thou defraud him of his own? Oh how liberal are you of your pretious words, and hours, as if Christ had never made a purchase of them! Oh think of this when thy life runs muddy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oul. When the fountain of corruption flows out at thy tongue, in idle frothy discourses; or at thy hand, in sinful unwarrantable actions; doth this become the redeemed of the Lord? Did Christ come from the bosom of his Father for this? Did he groan, sweat, bleed, endure the Cross, and lay down his life for this? Was he so well pleased with all his sorrows, and sufferings, his pangs, and agonies upon the account of that satisfaction he should have in seeing the travail of his Soul? <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.11. as if he had said, <hi>Welcome Death, welcome Agonies, welcome the bitter cup, and heavy burthen; I chearfully submit to all this. These are travailing pangs indeed, but I shall see a beautiful birth at last. These throws, and Agonies, shall bring
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:54346:326"/>
forth many lively Children to God; I shall have joy in them, and glory from them to all Eternity. This blood of mine, these sufferings of mine, shall purchase to me the Persons, Duties, Services, and obedience of many thousands, that will Love me, and Honour me, Serve me, and Obey me, with their Souls, and Bodies which are mine.</hi> And doth not this engage you to look to your lives, and keep them pure? Is not every one of Christs wounds a mouth open to plead for more holiness, more service and more fruit from you? Oh what will engage you if this will not? But</p>

He that hath so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, quickened, and comforted you, he will be quenched, grieved, and displeased by an impure, loose, and careless conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; and what will you do then? Who shall comfort you, when <hi>the Comforter</hi> is departed from you? When he that should releive your souls, is far off? Oh <hi>grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by which you are sealed to the day of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 4.30. There is nothing grieves him more than impure practices. For he is a holy Spirit. And look as water damps and quenches the fire; so doth sin <hi>quench the Spirit,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.19. Will you quench the warm affections and burning desires which he hath kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in your bosoms; if you do, it is a question whether ever you may recover them again to your dying day. the Spirit hath a delicate Sence. It is the most tender thing in the whole world. He feels the least touch of sin, and is grieved when thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within are stirred by temptations, and break out to the defiling of thy life; then is the holy Spirit of God as it were made sad, and heavy within thee. As that word <gap reason="foreign">

guide thee in the way of thy Duty; yea, thou not only resistest his motions, but crossest his grand design, which is to purge and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie thee wholly, and build thee up more and more to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of holiness. And when thou thus forsakest his conduct, and crossest his design in thy soul then doth he usually with-draw, as a man that is grieved by the unkindness of his friend. He draws in the beams of his evidencing and quickning grace. Packs up all his divine Cordials, and saith as it were to this unkind and disingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul,<note place="margin">The Spirits Expostulation with careless Christians.</note>
               <q>Hast thou thus requited me, for all the favours and kindnesses thou hast received from me? Have I quickened thee when thou wast dead in transgressions, did I descend upon thee in the Preaching of the Gospel, and communicate life, even the life of God to thee; leaving others in the state of the Dead? Have I shed forth such rich influences of grace and comfort upon thee? Comforting thee in all thy troubles, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee in all thy duties, satisfying thee in all thy doubts and perplexities of soul, saving thee and pulling thee back from so many destructive temptations and dangers? What had been thy condition, if I had not come unto thee? Could the Word have converted thee without me? Could ministers, could Angels have done that for the which I did? And when I had quickned thee, and made thee a living soul, what couldst thou have done without my exciting and assisting grace? Couldst thou go on in the way of Duty, if I had not led thee? How wouldst thou have waded through the deeps of spiritual troubles, if I had not born thee up? Whither had the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan and thine own corruptions carried thee before this day; if I had not stood thy friend, and come in for thy rescue in the time of need? Did I ever fail thee in thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities? Did I ever leave thee in thy dangers? Have I not been tender over thee, and faithful to thee? And now for which of all these kindnesses dost thou thus wrong and abuse me? Why hast thou wounded me thus by thy unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Ah thou hast requited my Love!

               <pb n="611" facs="tcp:54346:327"/>This is the fruit of careless and loose walking. To this sad issue it will bring thee at last, and when it is come to this; thou shalt go to Ordinances, and Duties, and find no good in them; no life quickning comfort there. When thy heart which was wont to be enlarged, and flowing, shall be clung up and dry; when thou shalt kneel down before the Lord, and cry as <hi>Elisha</hi> when with the mantle of <hi>Elijah</hi> he smote the water; <hi>Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</hi> So thou, where is the God of Prayer?

And thus you see what engagements lie upon you from the Spirit also, to walk uprightly and keep the issues of life pure. I could willingly have enlarged my self upon this last branch,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Polew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, <hi>You are under great engagements to keep your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lives pure, even from your selves, as well as from your God.</hi> As God hath bound you to purity of conversation, so you have bound your selves. And there are several things in you, and done by you, which wonderfully increase, and strengthen your Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to practical holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Your <hi>clearer illumination</hi> is a strong bond upon your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> souls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were sometimes darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord; walk as Children of the light.</hi> You cannot pretend, or plead ignorance of your Duty. You stand convinced in your own consciences before God, that this is your unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duty. Christians, will you not all yield to this? I know you readily yield it. We live indeed in a contentious disputing Age. In other things our opinions are different. One Christian is of this Judgement, another of that; but doth he deserve the name of a Christian, that dare once question this truth? In this we all meet and close in oneness of mind and Judgement, <hi>that it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable Duty, to live pure, strict, and clean lives. The grace of God which hath appeared to you, hath taught you this truth</hi> clearly and convincingly, 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 11.12. <hi>You have received how you ought to walk, and to please God,</hi> 1 Thes. 4.1. Well then, this being yielded, the inference is plain, and undeniable; that
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:54346:328"/>
you cannot walk as others, in the vanity of their minds; but you must offer violence to your own light. You cannot suffer the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of your hearts to break forth into practice, but you must slight, and put by the notices and rebukes of your own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.17. <hi>He that knoweth to do good, and doth it not; to him it is sin.</hi> Yea sin with a witness. Aggravated sin. Sin of a deeper tincture than that of the ignorant Heathens. Sin that sadly wastes and violates conscience. Certainly who ever hath, you have no cloak for your sin. Light and Lust strugling together, great light and strong lusts: these make the soul a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea that cannot rest. Oh but when masterless Lusts over-bears Conscience, this impresses horror upon the soul. This brake <hi>Davids</hi> heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.6. <hi>Thou hast put knowledge in my inner parts,</hi> q. d. Ah Lord! I went against the rebukes of conscience, to the commission of this sin. I had a watchful light set up within me. I knew it was sin. My light endeavoured lovingly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain me, and I thrust it aside. Besides, what pleasure in sin can you have? Indeed such as for want of light know not what they do, or such whose consciences are seared and past feeling; they may seek a litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e pleasure (such as it is) out of sin; but what content or pleasure can you have, so long as your light is ever breaking in upon you, and smiting you for what you do? This greatly increases your obligation to a precise holy life. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>You are professors of holiness.</hi> You have given in your names to Christ, to be his Disciples; and by this your engagement to a life of holiness are yet further strengthened, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart, from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> The name of Christ is called upon you, and it's a <hi>worthy name,</hi> Jam. 2.7. It's called upon you, as the name of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is called upon his Wife, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let thy name be called upon us.</hi> Or as the name of a Father is called upon his Child, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. <hi>Let my name be called on them, and the name of my Fathers.</hi> Well then, you bear the name of Christ as his Spouses or Children; and will you not live sutably to your name? Every place and relation, every title of honour and dignity hath its <hi>decorum,</hi> and becomingness. Oh how will that worthy name of Christ be blasphemed through you? If you adorn it not with becoming deportments? Better you had never profest any thing, than to set your selves by your profession in the eye and observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world; and then to pour contempt on Jesus Christ, by
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:54346:328"/>
your scandalous conversations, before the <hi>Chams</hi> of the world; who will laugh at it. I remember it was a <hi>Memento</hi> given to one of his name by <hi>Alexander, Recordare nominis Allexandri.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (said he) thy name <hi>Alexander,</hi> and do nothing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that name. O that's a heavy charge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Through you is the name of God blasphemed among the Heathens.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man, that ever thou shouldst be a reproach to Christ. The herd of wicked men, they are <hi>ignota capita</hi>; men of no note, or observation. They may sin, and sin again; drink, swear, and tumble in all uncleanness; and it passes away silently; the world takes little notice of it. Their wicked actions make but little noise in the world; but the miscarriages of professors are like a <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Comet,</hi> or an Eclipsed Sun, which all men gaze at, and make their observations upon; Oh then, what manner of persons ought you to be, who bear the worthy name of Christ upon you!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But more than this, <hi>You have obliged your selves to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this life of holiness by your own Prayers.</hi> How many times have you lifted up your hands to Heaven, and cryed with <hi>David Psal.</hi> 119.5. <hi>Oh that my waies were directed to keep thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Order my steps in thy Word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me,</hi> vers. 133. Were you in earnest with God, when you thus prayed? Did you mean as you said? or did you only complement with God? If your hearts and tongues agreed in this request, doubtless it's as much your Duty to endeavour, as to desire those mercies; and if not, yet do all those prayers stand on record before the Lord, and will be produced against you as witnesses to condemn you, for your hypocrisie and vanity. How often also have you in your Prayers lamented and bewailed your careless and uneven walkings? You have said with <hi>Ezra,</hi> chap. 9.6. <hi>O my God I am ashamed, and even blush to look up unto thee.</hi> And do not your confessions oblige you to greater circumspection and care for time to come? Will you confess, and sin? And sin, and confess? Go to God and bewail your evils, and when you have bewailed them, return again to the commission of them? God forbid, you should thus dissemble with God, play with sin, and dye your iniquities with a deeper tincture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, to add no more, <hi>you have often reproved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or censured others for their miscarriages and falls, which adds to your own obligation, to walk accuratly and evenly.</hi> Have you not often reproved your erring brethren? or at least privately
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:54346:329"/>
censured them, if not duly reproved them, (for to these left handed blows of secret censurings, we are more apt than to the fair and open strokes of just and due reproofs) and will you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the same things, you criminate and censure others for? <hi>Thou that teachest another,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>teachest thou not thy self?</hi> Rom. 2.21. So say I, thou that censurest or rebukest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, condemnest thou not thy self? Will your rebukes ever do good to others, whilst you alow in your selves what you condemn in them? And as these reproofs and censures can do them no good, so they do you much evil, by reason of them you are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> self condemned persons; and out of your own mouths God will Judge you. For you need no other witness, than your selves in this case. Your own tongues will fall upon you. Your censures and reproofs of others, will leave you without plea, or Apologie, if you look not to your lives with greater care. And yet will you be careless still? Fear you not the displeasure of God? nor the wounding and disquieting your own consciences? Surely these things are of no light value with you, if you be Christians indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>You are yet further engaged to practical holiness upon the account of your brethren, who are not a little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and interested therein.</hi> For if through the neglect of your hearts, your lives be defiled and polluted, this will be thrown in their faces, and many innocent and upright ones, both reproached and grieved upon your account. This mischievous effect holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> earnestly deprecated, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.5, 6. <hi>Oh God thou knowest my foolishness, and my sins are not hid from thee; let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of Hosts, be ashamed for my sake. Let not them that seek thee, be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel,</hi> q. d. Lord, thou knowest what a weak and foolish creature I am. And how apt to miscarry, if left to my self, and should I through my foolishness, act unbecoming a Saint; how would this shame the faces, and sad the hearts of thy people! They will be as men confounded at the report of my fall. The fall of one Christian, is matter of trouble and shame to all the rest. And when they shall hear the sad and unwelcome news of your scandalous miscarriages, (which will certainly be the effect of a neglected heart and life) they will say as <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan; tell it not in</hi> Gath, <hi>publish it not in the streets of</hi> Askelon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or as <hi>Tamar</hi> concerning <hi>Ammon, and we, whither shall we cause our shame to go?</hi> And for them, they
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:54346:329"/>
shall be as the fools in <hi>Israel.</hi> Thy loose and careless life will cause them to estrange themselves from thee, and look shy upon thee, as being ashamed to owne thee, and canst thou bear that? Will it not grieve and pierce your very hearts to see a cloud of strangeness and trouble over the countenances of your brethren? To see your selves disowned and lightly esteemed by them? This very consideration struck a great favorite in the <hi>Persian Court</hi> to the very heart. <note n="*" place="margin">Zozomen. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> It was <hi>Vstazanes,</hi> who had been Governour to <hi>Sapores</hi> in his minority. And this man for fear, denied the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith; and complied with the Idolatrous worship of the King. And one day (saith the Historian) sitting at the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, he saw <hi>Simon</hi> the aged <hi>Arch-Bishop of Selucia,</hi> drawing along to prison for his constancy in the Christian Faith; and though he durst not openly owne the Faith he had basely denied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess himself a Christian: yet he could not choose but rise, and express his reverence to this holy man; in a respective and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable salutation; but the zealous good man frowned upon him, and turned away his face from him; as thinking such an <hi>Apostate</hi> unworthy of the least respect from him; this presently struck <hi>Vstazanes</hi> to the heart, and drew from him many tears, and groans; and thus he reasoned with himself, <hi>Simon</hi> will not owne me, and can I think but that God will disclaim me, when I appear before his Tribunal? <hi>Simon</hi> will not speak unto me, will not so much as look upon me, and can I look for so much as a good word or look from Jesus Christ, whom I have so shamefully betrayed, and denyed? Hereupon he threw of his rich Courtly robes, and put on mourning apparel, and professed himself a Christian; and died a Martyr. O 'tis a piercing thing to an honest heart, to be cast out of the favour of Gods people. If you walk loosely, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor his people will look kindly upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, <hi>Your very enemies engage you to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> pure and holy life upon a double ground.</hi> You are obliged by them two waies, <hi>viz.</hi> as they are your <hi>bold censurers,</hi> and your <hi>watchful observers.</hi> They censure you as hypocrites, and will you give them ground and matter for such a charge? they say only your tongues are more holy than other mens, and shall they prove it, from your practice? They also <hi>observe</hi> you diligently. Lie at catch, and are highly gratified by your miscarriages. If your lives be loose and defiled, you will not only be a shame to your friends, but the Song of your enemies. You will make mirth in
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:54346:330"/>
Hell. And gratifie all the enemies of God. This is that they watch for. They are curious observers of your goings. And that which makes them Triumph at your falls and miscarriages, is not only that deep rooted enmity betwixt the two seeds, but because all your miscarriages and evils are so many absolutions to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and Justifications (as they think) of their waies and practices. For look as your strictness and holiness doth as it were cast, and condemn them, as <hi>Noah, Heb.</hi> 11.7. by his practice, condemned the world, their consciences fly in their faces, when they see your holy and pure conversations. It lays a damp upon them. It works upon their consciences and causes many smart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. So when you fall, you as it were absolve their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, loose the bonds of conviction you had made fast upon them, and now there's matter of Joy put before them.</p>
            <p>Oh say they, what ever these men talk; we see they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we. They can do as we do. They can Cozen and Cheat for advantage. They can comply with any thing for their own ends; 'tis not conscience, as we once thought, but meer stomach and humor that made them so precise. And oh what a sad thing is this! Hereby you shed Soul-blood. You fasten the bonds of death upon their souls. You kill those convictions, which for any thing you know might have made way to their conversion. When you fall, you may rise again; but they may fall at your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and never rise more. Never have a good opinion of the waies of God, or of his people any more. Upon this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>David</hi> begs of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies;</hi> (or as the Hebrew) <hi>my observers, make thy way straight before my face.</hi> And thus you see how your very enemies oblige you to this holy and pure conversation also.</p>
            <p>Now put all this together, and see to what these particulars will amount. You have heard how <hi>God the Father</hi> hath engaged you to this conversation purity, by his <hi>designment of your Salvation. Rewarding your obedience. His pleasure in it. His Promises to it.</hi> And his great confidence in you, that you will thus walk before him. The <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> hath also engaged you thereunto, by his death and sufferings, whereby you were Redeemed from your vain conversations. The <hi>Spirit</hi> hath engaged you by telling you plainly how much you will grieve, and wrong him, resist and quench him, if you do not keep your selves pure. Yea, you are
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:54346:330"/>
obliged further by <hi>your selves,</hi> your clear <hi>illumination,</hi> your high <hi>profession,</hi> your many <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>confessions,</hi> your many <hi>censures</hi> and reprehensions of others, do all strengthen your obligation to holiness. Yea, you are obliged further to this holy life, by the shame, grief, and trouble your loose walking will bring upon your friends. And the mirth it will make for, and mischief it will do to your enemies. Who will fall and break their necks, where it may be you only stumbled, and brake your shins. Who are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and absolved (as before you heard) by your miscarriages. And now what think you of all this? Are you obliged or not, to this purity of life? Are all these bonds tied with such slip-knots that you can get loose, and free your selves at pleasure from them? If all these things are of no force with you, if none of these bonds can hold you; may it not be questioned (notwithstanding your profession) whether any spiritual principle, any fear of God, or love to Christ, be in your souls or no? O you could not play fast and loose with God; if so, you could not as <hi>Sampson</hi> snap these bonds assunder, at your pleasure.</p>
            <p>Consid. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As you are more <hi>obliged</hi> to keep the issues of life pure than others are, so God hath given you greater <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> for it, than others have. God hath not been wanting to any in helps and means. Even the Heathen who are without the Gospel will yet be speechless and inexcusable before God: but how much more will you be so! who besides their light of nature, and the general light of the Gospel, have <hi>first,</hi> such a <hi>principle</hi> put within you. <hi>Secondly,</hi> such <hi>patterns</hi> set before you. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> such an <hi>assistant</hi> ready to help you. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> so many <hi>rods</hi> at your backs to quicken you; and prevent your wandering. If notwithstanding all these helps your live be still unholy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Shall men of such <hi>principles</hi> walk as others do? Shall we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> lament for you as <hi>David</hi> once did for <hi>Saul,</hi> saying <hi>there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of</hi> Saul; <hi>as though he had not been anointed with oyl.</hi> There the honour of a Christian was vilely cast away, as though he had not been anointed with the Spirit? <hi>You have received an unction from the holy one, which teacheth you all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. Another Spirit, far above that which is in other men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. And as this Spirit which is in you is fitted for this life of holiness, (<hi>for ye are his workmanship created in Christ Iesus to good works,</hi> Ephes. 2.10.
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:54346:331"/>
So this holy Spirit, a principle infused into your souls, hath such a natural tendency to this holy life; that if you live not purely and strictly you must offer violence to your own principles, and a new nature. A twofold help this principle affords you for a life of holiness.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>First,</hi> It pulls you back from sin, as in <hi>Ioseph; How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God!</hi> And it also inclines you powerfully to obedience. 'Tis a curb to sin, and a spur to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. It is unpossible for all others to live spiritually and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because they have no new nature to incline them thereunto. And methinks it should be hard for you to live carnally, and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and therein cross the very bent and tendency of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is formed in you. How can you neglect Prayer as others do, whiles the Spirit by divine pulsations is awaking and rousing up your sluggish hearts with such inward motions, and whispers as that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Seek my face.</hi> Yea, whilst you fell (during your omissions of duty) something within that bemoans it self, and as it were cryes for food, pains and gripes you, like an empty sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and will not let you be quiet till it be relieved. How can you let out your hearts to the world as other men do; when all that while your Spirit is restless, and akes like a bone out of joint. And you can never be at ease till you come back to God, and say as <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. <hi>Return to thy rest, O my soul.</hi> Is it not hard, yea, naturally impossible to fix a stone and make it abide in the fluid air? Doth not every creature in a restless motion tend to its proper Center, and desire its own perfection? So doth this new creature also. You see how the Rivers in their course will not be checkt, but bear down all obstacles in their way <hi>&amp; Saevior ab obice ibit.</hi> A stop doth but make them rage the more, and run the swifter afterwards.</p>
            <p>There is a Central force in these natural motions, which cannot be stopt. And the like may you observe in the motions of a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soul, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>It shall be in him as a Well of water springing up.</hi> And is it not hard for you to keep it down, or turn its course? How hard did <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> find that work? If you do not live holy lives, you must cross your own new nature, &amp; violate the Law that's written in your own hearts, and engraven upon your own bowels. To this purpose a late Writer speaks,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>T. Malls</hi> Exhor. to holy living.</note> Till you were converted (saith he) the flesh was predominant, and therefore it was impossible for you to live any other than a fleshly life; for every thing will act according to its predominant principle. Should you not therefore live a spiritual life? Should not the Law of God witten in your
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:54346:331"/>
hearts, be legible in your lives? O should not your lives be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tendency of your hearts? thus he. Doubtless this is no swall advantage to practical holiness. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Besides this <hi>principle within, you have no small assistance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for the purity of life by these excellent patterns before you.</hi> The path of holiness is no untrodden path to you. <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Servants</hi> have beaten it before you. The life of Christ is your Copy, and it is a fair Copy indeed, without a blot. Oh what an advantage is this to draw all the lines of your actions according to his example! This glorious grand example is often prest upon you for imitation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Looking to Iesus,</hi> he hath left <hi>you an example that ye should tread in his steps,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. His life is a living rule to his people, and besides Christs example (for you may say who can live as Christ did? His example is quite above us) you have a <hi>cloud of witnesses.</hi> A cloud for its directive Use, and these men of like passions, temptations, and constitutions with you; who have gone before you in exemplary holiness. The Holy Ghost (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending therein, your special help and advantage) hath set many industrious pens awork to write the lines of the Saints, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve for your use their holy sayings, and heavenly actions. He bids you <hi>take them for an example,</hi> Jam. 5.10. Oh what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men are past on before you! What renowned Worthies have led the way! Men whose conversations were in Heaven, whilst they Tabernacled on earth. Whilst this lower world had their bodies, the world above had their hearts, their affections; their actions, their designs were all for Heaven. Men that improved troubles, and comforts; losses, and gains; smiles, and frowns; and all for Heaven. Men that did extract Heaven out of Spirituals, out of Temporals, out of all things; their hearts were full of heavenly meditations, their mouths of heavenly communications; and their practices of heavenly inclinations. O what singular help is this! Where they followed Christ, and kept the way, they are propounded for your imitation, and where any of them turned aside, you have a mark set upon that action, for your caution and prevention. Doth any strange or unusual tryal befall you, in which you are ready to say with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Was there ever any sorrow like unto my sorrow?</hi> Here you may see <hi>the same affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction accomplisht in your brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. Here's store of good company to encourage you. Doth the world and Devil endeavor to turn you from your duty, by loading it with shameful scoffs, or
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:54346:332"/>
sufferings? In this case you may look to <hi>Iesus,</hi> who dispised the shame; and to your <hi>Brethren</hi> who counted it their honour to be dishonoured for the name of Christ, as the Original of the Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41.<note place="margin">

Art thou at any time under a faint fit of discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; and ready to despond under any burden; oh how maist thou be animated by such examples, when such a qualm comes over thy heart? Some sparks of their holy courage cannot choose but steal into thy breast, whilst thou considerest them. In them God hath set before thee the possibility of overcoming all difficulties, thou seest men of the same mould, who had the same tryals, discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and fears that thou now hast, and yet overcame all. How is thy unbelief checkt when thou saist, <hi>Oh I shall never reach the end,</hi> I shall one day utterly perish. Why dost thou say so? Why may not such a poor creature as thou art, be carried through as well as they? Had not they the same temptations and corruptions with you?

            <p>Oh what an advantage have you this way! They that first trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ, had not such an help as you. You stand upon their shoulders.

Pray from which of all the Saints did you learn to be proud? Did you learn that from Christ, or any of his?

<list>
                  <item>(1.) <hi>First,</hi> When a temptation to sin presses sore upon you, he pleads with your consciences within, whilst <hi>Satan</hi> is tempting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. How often hath he brought such Scriptures to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, in the very nick of opportunity; as have saved you out of the temptation? If you attend his voice, you may hear such a voice within you as that, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.4. <hi>Oh do not this abominable thing which I hate.</hi> What mighty strivings were there in the heart of <hi>Spira,</hi> as himself relates? He heard as it were a voice within him saying, <hi>Do not write</hi> Spira, <hi>do not write.</hi> To this purpose is that promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.20, 21. <hi>Thine eyes shall behold thy teachers, and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying, this is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi> Here you have a twofold help to holiness, the <hi>outward</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and the <hi>inward</hi> teachings of the Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. He shall say <hi>this is the way,</hi> when ye are turning aside to the right hand or to the left. Alluding to a Shepherd (saith one) who driving his Sheep before him; whistles them in when he sees them ready to stray.</item>
                  <item>(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> When ye walk holily and closely with God in your duties, the Spirit incourages you to go on, by those inward comforts, sealings, and joys you have from him at such times. How often hath he entertained your souls in publick Ordinances, in private duties, with his hidden Manna, with marrow and fastness, with incomparable and unspeakable comforts, and all this to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you in your way, and encourage you to hold on?</item>
                  <item>(3.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When you are indisposed for duties, and find your hearts empty and dry, he is ready to fill them, quicken and raise them; so that oftentimes the beginnings and end of your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hearing, or meditations are as vastly different, as if one man had begun and another ended the duty. O then what assistances for a holy life have you? Others indeed are bound to resist temptations as well as you; but alas, having no special assistance from the Spirit, what can they do? It may be they reason with the Temptation a little while, and in their own strength resolve against it; but how easie a conquest doth Satan make, where no greater opposition is
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:54346:333"/>
made to him, than this? Others are bound to hear, meditate, and pray as well as you; else the neglect of these duties would not be their sin: but alas, what pitiful work do they make of it! Being left to the hardness and vanity of their own hearts; when you spread your Sails you have a gale; but they lie wind-bound, heart-bound, and can do nothing Spiritually in a way of Duty.</item>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, to mention no more, <hi>you have a further advantage to this holy life, by all the rods of God that are at any time upon you.</hi> I might shew you in many particulars the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages this way also, but I shall only present these <hi>three</hi> to your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation at this time.</item>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By these you are clogged, to prevent your straying, and wandering. Others may wander even as far as Hell, and God will not spend a sanctified rod upon them to reduce or stop them; but saith <hi>let them alone,</hi> Hos. 4.17. But if you straggle out of the way of holiness, he will clog you with one trouble or another to keep you within bounds, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Lest I should be lifted up, a thorn in the flesh; a messenger of Satan was sent to buffet me.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I have kept thy Word.</hi> Afflictions are used by God, as thorns by husbandmen to stop the gaps, and keep you from breaking out of Gods way, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.6. <hi>I will hedge up her way with thorns, and build a wall that she shall not find her paths.</hi> A double alusion. <hi>First,</hi> to Cattle that are apt to stray. I will hedge up thy way with thorns. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to the Sea which is apt to over-flow the Country, I will build a wall to prevent inundations. Holy <hi>Basil</hi> was a long time sorely afflicted with an inveterate head-ach, he often prayed for the removal of it; at last God removed it, but in the room of it he was sorely exercised with the motions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Lust; which when he perceived, he heartily desired his head-ach again, to prevent a worse evil. You little know the ends and uses of many of your afflictions. Are you exercised with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily weaknesses, it's a mercy you are so; and if these pains and infirmities were removed, these clogs taken off; you may with <hi>Basil</hi> wish for them again to prevent worse evils. Are you poor? why, with that poverty God hath clogged your pride. Are you reproached? with those reproaches God hath clogged your am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Corruptions are prevented by your afflictions. And is not this a marvelous help to holiness of life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By your afflictions your corruptions are not only clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:54346:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but <hi>purged.</hi> By these God drys up and consumes that spring of sin, that defiles your lives, <hi>Esa.</hi> 27.9. By <hi>this therefore shall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away sin.</hi> God orders your <hi>wants</hi> to kill your <hi>wantonness.</hi> And makes your <hi>poverty</hi> poison to your <hi>pride.</hi> They are Gods Physick, to purge ill humours out of your souls. <hi>When they fall by the sword, and by famine, and by captivity, and by spoil, it is to try them and to purge them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan 11.33, 34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>and to make them white.</hi> They are both purges and Lavatories to your souls. Others have the same afflictions that you have, but they do not work on them as on you; they are to you as fire for purging, and water for cleansing; and yet shall not your lives be clean? It's true (as one well observes upon that place of <hi>Daniel</hi>) Christ is the only <hi>Lavatory,</hi> and his blood the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to wash away sin. But in the virtue and efficacy of that blood sanctified afflictions are cleansers, and purgers too.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Cross</hi> without a <hi>Christ</hi> never made any man better; but with Christ, Saints are much the better for the cross. Hath God as it were laid you out so many daies and nights a whitening; and yet is not the hue of your conversation altred? Hath he put you so many times into the furnace, and yet is not your dross separated? The more afflictions you have been under, the more assistance you have had for this life of holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By all your troubles God hath been weaning you from the world, the lusts, loves, and pleasures of it; and drawing out your souls to a more excellent life and state than this. He makes your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in this life, give a lufter to the glory of the next. Who ever hath, be sure you shall have no rest here; and all that you may long more ardently for that to come. He often makes you <hi>groan being burdened, to be cloathed with your house from Heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4. And yet will you not be weaned from the lusts, customs, and evils of it? Oh what manner of persons should you be for heavenly and holy conversations? You stand upon the higher ground. You have as it were the wind and tide with you. None are assisted for this life, as you are. Put all this together, and see what this second argument contributes towards your further conviction, and perswasion to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of life. Have you received a supernatural principle fitting you for, and inclining you to holy actions, resisting and holding you back from sin? Hath God also set before you such eminent patterns to encourage and quicken you in your way? Doth the Spirit himself stand ready so many waies to assist and help you in all difficulties,

They saw him every day about that work, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preparing for a deluge, and yet were not moved with the like fear that he was; this left them inexcusable. So when God shall

say in that day to the careless world, did you not see the care, and diligence, the holy zeal, watchfulness, and self denial of my people, who lived among you? How many times have they been watching and praying when you have been drinking or sleeping! Was it not easie to reflect when you saw their pains and diligence; have not I a soul to look after as well as they, a Heaven to win or lose, as well as they? Oh, how speechless and inexcusable will this render wicked men, yea it shall not be only used to Judge them, but <hi>Angels</hi> also. How many shocks of temptations have poor Saints stood; when as they fell without a Tempter. They stood not in their integrity, though created in such excellent natures; how much then are you concerned on this very account also, to walk exactly! If not, instead of Judging them, you shall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them.</p>
            <p>And thus you see what use your lives and actions shall be put to, and are these inconsiderable uses? Is the winning over souls to God a small matter? Is the salving the honour and reputation of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a small matter? Is the encouraging the hearts, and strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hands of Gods poor Ministers amidst their spending killing labours a small matter? Is the awing of the consciences of your enemies, and Judging them in the last day a light thing? Which of these can you call so?</p>
            <p>O then since you are thus <hi>obliged</hi> to holiness of life. Thus sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly <hi>assisted</hi> for it: and since there are such great dependencies upon it, and uses for it both now and in the world to come; see that ye be holy in all manner of conversation.

And to how little purpose will be all that I have preacht, and you have heard of Christ, if it be not converted into practical godliness? This is the scope and design of it all.</p>
