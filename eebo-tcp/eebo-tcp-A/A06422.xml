            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10188:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prouisyons, wherin ye tryumphe, bringe vnto you great wretchednes and mischieffe. Considre if thou lyst that same golde and siluer, considre these costly houses, consydre this goodly wrought apparell, and all kinde of suche thynges, with what busines they are bought, with howe many labours, peryls, ye and with blode and slaughter, and with how many dethis of man kinde / not onely that in saylinge many do perishe for these thinges, and in sekynge them suffre greuous thinges / but also that they brede fyghtynges / and that for them one lith in awaite to an other, frendes to frendes, children to their fathers, and wyues to theyr hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes. So I thinke Eriphyles for golde did betray her husbonde. And al these thingꝭ is thus, though that dyuers apparell maketh one no whytte warmer, and those gylted buyldinges couers not the better,

nor those cuppes of siluer.

               <p>But yet it was not ordeined for that. For so a man may writh a gredierne to make it serue in stede of a potte / but it was not therfore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned: but howe may any manne ouersee all theyr vnhappynes / that is so great? And yet thou accusest me for that I woll be no partiner of it. yet I lyue as doth that same so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre man, that is to saye, eatinge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that that is sette afore me, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge moste necessary thinges: and
<pb facs="tcp:10188:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not gapinge after those dyuers thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all sortes. And so where I nede lyttell and vse not many thynges, the semeth I ledde a bestly lyfe. And by this reason there is doute, that the goddis be not worse than beastes, as they that nede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge. But to thende thar thou mayst better vnderstande / what ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of thinge, eche of these is, that is to say to nede few thinges / or many thinges / considre fyrst that children nede more than yongemen / and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men more than men, than sicke men more than hole, and alwayes in con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clusyon lower thinges nede more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their betters. Therfore the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis nede nothinge / and they that ar next vnto the goddis, nede leste. Hercules that was the chiefist of al men / a godly manne, and of righte, thought to be a god, thinkest thou / that he was than wretched, whan he went vp and downe naked, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10188:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely a skynne, nothing coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of our thinges? But truely he was not wretched / for he put wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednes from other: nor yet was he poore, for he ruled bothe vppon see and lande. For where so euer he did assault, he ouercame on euery syde, nor in his tyme he chaunced vppon none / that might other matche him, or ouercome hym, whyle he lyued. And thynkest thou that he wanted apparell or showes? and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wandredde abroode in the worlde? Truely it can not be sayd: but he was constaunt and stronge, and wolde lyue temperately, and not gyue hym to delytes.</p>
               <p>¶What was Theseus his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? Was he not kynge of all the Atheniens? and as they saye, sonne of Neptunus, and noblist of his tyme? ye he also wolde go barefote and naked, and it pleased hym to no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>risshe his berde and his busshe / nor
<pb facs="tcp:10188:9"/>
hym onely / but it plesed all thaunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men, and they were better than you, and they wolde not haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any suche thinge / no more than a lyon wolde suffer hym selfe to be clypped. For they thought tendre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of flesshe and smothenes becam women / and they as they were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so they wolde seme / and thought a berd to be the aparell of a man, as a maane for a horse / and a berde for a lyon / god hath gyuen for a beaute of a certeine goodlynes of apparell, so vnto men he hath gyuen a berde. Therfore them I folowe, those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men I say woll I folowe: and I enuye not the men of this age, in theyr name of meruailous blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche they haue in meate and apparel, sins they polyshe and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then all the partes of theyr bodye / and suffer not so moche as that that shuld be secrete, to grow accordinge to nature. But I wolde wyshe my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10188:9"/>
selfe to haue horse fete, as they saye Chiron had: and that nede no more apparell than lyons, nor more dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate meate than dogges. Lette me more ouer be in that case, that euery maner of bare erthe, suffyse me for my bedde / and that I may take the worlde for my house / and that I may chuse suche meates / that maye easely be gotten. But golde and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer let me neuer desyre, nother I nor and of my frendes. For all mischif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes cometh vnto menne oute of the desyres of them, both tresons, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res / awaytes / and mourders. All these thinges springe out of the well of desyre of more. But god saue vs from these thinges / &amp; that neuer I de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syre more than inough: and whan I haue lesse, that I may suffer with euyn mynde. our thinges be of this sorte / of a suerte these thinges are fer from the comen opinion. And it is not to be meruiled, if we differ from
<pb facs="tcp:10188:10"/>
them in apparell / from whome we differ so ferre in order of lyfe. But I wonder of the, that where thou a lowest vnto a minstrell / his certeyne facion and aparell, and vnto a tabre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor his, and vnto a player his / vnto a good man thou alowest no proper facion and aparell. And if it be so, that there be any facion or custome of good men / what is more meter than this that I vse / that vnto wast full folke is most shameful? and vnto which they are most ageynst? My custome &amp; fascion tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, to be swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye / and rough / to were an old cloke / to let my here grow / and to go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fote. And yours is moste lyke vnto the facion of these bougerons / and a man can not know you from them, nother by your apparell / nor by ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenesse, nor in chaunge of shirtes, nor in clokes / nor in prety showes / nor in trymyng of your here, nor in sauour. For ye are perfumed lyke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10188:10"/>
them, euyn you that are so blessed. But what whan a man smell lyke a bougeron? ye and in suffrans of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour ye are no better than they: and with delightes ye are ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well as they, ye fede as they do / ye slepe and go on the same faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / ye you wol not go, but rather be caryed / as though ye were ferdels, some vpon men, some vpon beastes. And me my fete do cary whyther so euer I nede. And I can suffer colde and hete, and that that god sendeth withouten grudge, that is to saye bycause I am a wretche. And you, bycause of this blessednes, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with no fortune, but ye ar wery of all thinges / and can not suffer that that nowe is, and desyres that that is to come, in winter wishinge for summer, and in heate for colde / and agayne in colde for heate, waiward and plaininge as sicke men / whiche thinge is caused by sickenes in them,
<pb facs="tcp:10188:11"/>
and by condycyons in you. And though it be thus, yet ye thinke it mete / to bringe vs vnto your lyfe / and to corrupt ours, where as ofte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes the thinges that ye do, ar yll counselid, and you your selfe in your owne businessis ar not all of the best prouiders / and do nothinge of them by iudgement and reason / but by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of desire. Wherfore of trouth ye differ nothinge from them that ar caryed with the streme. For they ar caried whither so euer the floud wolle / and you whither as lustis woll. And it is lyke with you as with hym, that had lepte vppon a wilde horsis backe, the horse ranne carienge the manne awaye: And he might not nowe a lyght / the horse runninge / one met with hym, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hym whider he wente? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, whither as he woll / and pointed the horse: so if any man aske you, whither are ye caried / if ye
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10188:11"/>
woll say trouthe, ye shall say in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, thider as affections ledde me, and particularly some tyme thider as luste leadeth me, somtyme thider as desire of glory, &amp; sometyme thider as desyre of gaingne: somtyme also anger, somtyme fere / somtyme such other like semeth to cary you away. For ye lepe not only vpon an horse, but vppon many / nowe vpon this, nowe vpon tother ye are caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all are wylde. And yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye fall ye know not that ye shall falle, but this olde clooke / that ye mocke / and my here / and my facion, is of such power, that it gyueth me a quiete lyfe / that I may do what I woll, and company with whome I woll. For of foolysshe and vnlerned folke none woll come vnto me: for by cause of this fascion. And they that ye are of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre lyfe / withdraw them ferre from me. We mete to gyder men of knowlege and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:10188:12"/>
folke / and they that desire ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they chieffly company with me / and in these mens company I delite. I wayte not at theyr dores / that are but callid men: and crownes of gold and purpull, I take for pride, and mocke those men. But that thou mayst vnderstonde / that this fasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not onely mete for good men, but also for the goddis, and thanne mocke it if thou lyste, considre the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the goddis / whither they be lyker you than me, and loke not onely, in the chirches of the Grekes / but in those also of other countreys, if the goddis be paynted and made busshed / and berded as I am / or els shauen as you ar. And thou shalte se many of them coteles as I am now. Howe darest thou from hens forthe disprayse this facion, whan it semeth to be mete also for the goddes.</p>
