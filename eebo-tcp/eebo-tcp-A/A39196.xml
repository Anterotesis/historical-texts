            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And let thy ſable Tears this Paper fill:</l>
               <l>Yea, ſhouldſt thou not ſtay here when this is done,</l>
               <l>But ſtill proceed to wet more cheeks than one,</l>
               <l>Thou wouldſt companions have; ſome are oppreſt</l>
               <l>With heavineſs; ſorrow hath fill'd each breaſt,</l>
               <l>And ſtreaming Tears (the <hi>Indices</hi> of Grief)</l>
               <l>Flow from their Eyes, to give their hearts relief:</l>
               <l>For SAMUEL SOWTHEN's dead, a man ſo rare,</l>
               <l>That few are left that with him might compare.</l>
               <l>He was that Son of which the Wiſeman ſpake,

               </l>
               <l>From whom his Parents did much Honour take.</l>
               <l>He was a Husband, and a Parent dear,</l>
               <l>And to his Brethren bore a love ſincere.</l>
               <l>A Maſter gentle; his Vicinity</l>
               <l>Was peaceful, doing no man injury:</l>
               <l>And to his Friends a faithful Friend indeed,</l>
               <l>Ready and helpful in a time of need.</l>
               <l>Courteous and affable, ſober, and wiſe;</l>
               <l>Safe was his Counſel, worthy his Adviſe.</l>
               <l>All his Acquaintance ſenſibly perceive,</l>
               <l>That by his abſence they a loſs receive.</l>
               <l>So full of Goodneſs was his Spirit fill'd,</l>
               <l>That to his Perſon it did luſtre yeeld.</l>
               <l>As God of this world's Good had giv'n him ſtore,</l>
               <l>So was he bountiful unto the Poor:</l>
               <l>Of what God did beſtow on him, a part</l>
               <l>He did beſtow on them with chearful heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But though theſe things declare a vertuous mind,</l>
               <l>Yet greater ſtill than theſe remain behind.</l>
               <l>For his ſublim'ſt, his higheſt commendation</l>
               <l>Ariſeth from his careful obſervation</l>
               <l>Of thoſe Commands, thoſe Laws, thoſe Statutes all,</l>
               <l>Which God hath made, and charged great and ſmall</l>
               <l>To keep inviolable; thoſe kept he</l>
               <l>Placed before his eyes continuallie:</l>
               <l>And thoſe he made the Standard of his wayes,</l>
               <l>Directors of his Actions all his dayes.</l>
               <l>Thoſe choice Perambulations, which did pleaſe</l>
               <l>His heav'nly mind, were compaſt-in with theſe:</l>
               <l>Wherein he found Paths lovely, large and ſweet;</l>
               <l>Light to his wayes, a Lanthorn to his feet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Goodneſs, Mercy, Bounty, and rich Grace</l>
               <l>Which he found was in God, cauſ'd him to place</l>
               <l>His truſt in Him alone; his care he caſt</l>
               <l>On Him alſo, whoſe care his own ſurpaſt.</l>
               <l>By which means freed from ſuch Anxieties,</l>
               <l>Diſquietneſs of mind, Perplexities,</l>
               <l>Which commonly do hinder and annoy</l>
               <l>Men, when for God their hearts they ſhould imploy.</l>
               <l>Being free (I ſay) from theſe obſtructions noted,</l>
               <l>And from ſome others too, himſelf devoted</l>
               <l>To ſerve the Lord with all his pow'r and might,</l>
               <l>Obſerving what was pleaſing in his ſight:</l>
               <l>Whoſe Dictates and whoſe Will he would obey,</l>
               <l>And teach them too, though men in Pow'r ſaid nay.</l>
               <l>For that which he had heard and ſeen of God,</l>
               <l>He could not chuſe but ſpread the ſame abroad.</l>
               <l>By painful labour night and day he wrought,</l>
               <l>And ſpent himſelf, that others might be brought</l>
               <l>Into the Fold of Chriſt, and there continue</l>
               <l>Among the number of that bleſt Retinue;</l>
               <l>Who wait until he ſhall again deſcend</l>
               <l>In Clouds, as heretofore he did aſcend;</l>
               <l>And that they might be free from ſpot or ſtain,</l>
               <l>Meet to be Kings with Chriſt, their head, to reign.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Such zeal for God did in his breaſt reſide,</l>
               <l>That when he ſaw his Laws were nullifi'd,</l>
               <l>And humane Ordinances plac'd in ſtead,</l>
               <l>It to his pious ſoul much trouble bred.</l>
               <l>To check which inſolency (bold and daring</l>
               <l>Of God himſelf) our <hi>Sowthen</hi> was not ſparing,</l>
               <l>As well by openly declaring, as</l>
               <l>He by his walking exemplary was:</l>
               <l>For he well knew that the Prerogative,</l>
               <l>In Sacred things to be Legiſlative,</l>
               <l>Was His alone, whoſe Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Care,</l>
               <l>Exceedeth humane skill and judgment far:</l>
               <l>And for his Church, whate're was neceſſary.</l>
               <l>Appointed hath, from which they ſhould not vary;</l>
               <l>Nor hearken to the voice of any ſtranger,</l>
               <l>That tells them in their liberty is danger;</l>
               <l>Or, that the Way of God in any thing</l>
               <l>Was ought too ſtrict, or would an evil bring.</l>
               <l>Wherefore he mightily endeavoured</l>
               <l>That all might by God's Word alone be led:</l>
               <l>'Cauſe thoſe who do with humane Laws comply,</l>
               <l>Do in their works God's Soveraignty deny.</l>
               <l>And though from men he had but ſmall regard,</l>
               <l>From God he knew he ſhould have great reward.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some ſaid he was too ſtrict, becauſe he could</l>
               <l>Not yeeld to that which many others would.</l>
               <l>Let theſe beware leſt they too looſe be found,</l>
               <l>Unſtable in their wayes, at heart unſound.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now he's gone, God hath ſo judg'd it fit,</l>
               <l>And 'tis our duty humbly to ſubmit.</l>
               <l>Yet cauſe the loſs is great, his worthy Wife,</l>
               <l>Who tendred him full dearly in his life,</l>
               <l>Can ſcarce be comforted, cauſe ſhe's alone,</l>
               <l>And her ſo much eſteemed Friend is gone.</l>
               <l>His Parents and his Brethrens faces ſhew</l>
               <l>Their love to him, as his to them, was true.</l>
               <l>His Conſort's Siſter grieves too (for another)</l>
               <l>Saying he was like Father more than Brother.</l>
               <l>Alſo his Chriſtian Friends are much affected,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <unclear>'Cauſe</unclear> ſuch a Member is from them diſſected.</l>
               <l>The World have loſt him too, who was a debtor</l>
               <l>Unto them in ſuch things as were far greater</l>
               <l>Than this life could afford: and know God uſeth</l>
               <l>To take from man that good which he abuſeth.</l>
               <l>Let's all therefore redeem the time miſpended,</l>
               <l>Repecting what ſhall be when life is ended.</l>

               <l>But in the midſt of grief we comfort have,</l>
               <l>For he that now is laid into his Grave,</l>
               <l>With heart believ'd, with mouth he Chriſt confeſſed,</l>
