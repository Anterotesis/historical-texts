            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the most excellent and learned both Orator and Poete, Mayster Gabriell Haruey, his verie special and singular good frend E. K. commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the good lyking of this his labour, and the patronage of the new Poete.</head>
            <p>VNCOVTHE VNKISTE, Sayde the olde famous Poete Chaucer: vvhom for his excellencie and vvonderfull skil in making, his scholler Lidgate, a vvorthy scholler of so excellent a maister, calleth the Loadstarre of our Language: and vvhom our Colin clout in his Aeglogue calleth Tityrus the God of shepheards, comparing hym to the worthines of the Roman Tityrus Virgile. VVhich prouerbe myne owne good friend Ma. Haruey, as in that good old Poete it serued vvell Pandares purpose, for the bolstering of his baudy brocage, so very vvell taketh place in this our nevv Poete, vvho for that he is vncouthe (as said Chaucer) is vnkist, and vnknown to most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is regarded but of fevv. But I dout not, so soone as his name shall come into the knovvledg of men, and his vvorthines be sounded in the tromp of fame, but that he shall be not onely kiste, but also beloued of all, embraced of the most, and vvondred at of the best. No lesse I thinke, deserueth his vvittinesse in deuising, his pithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in vttering, his complaints of loue so louely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly, his pastorall rudenesse, his morall vvisenesse, his devve obseruing of Decorum euerye vvhere, in personages, in seasons, in matter, in speach, and generally in al seemely simply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of handeling his matter, and framing his vvords: the vvhich of many thinges which in him be straunge, I knovv vvill seeme the straungest, the vvords them selues being so auncient, the knitting of them so short and intricate, and the vvhole Periode &amp; compasse of speache so delightsome for the roundnesse, and so graue for the straungenesse. And firste of the vvordes to speake, I graunt they be something hard, and of most men vnused. yet both English, and also vsed of most excellent Authors and most famous Poetes. In vvhom vvhenas this our Poet hath bene much traueiled and throughly redd, hovv could it be, (as that vvorthy Oratour sayde) but that vvalking in the sonne although for other cause he vvalked, yet needes he mought be sunburnt; and hauing the sound of those aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poetes still ringing in his eares, he mought needes in singing hit out some of theyr tunes. But whether he vseth them by such casualtye and custome, or of set purpose and choyse, as thinking them fittest for such rusticall rudenesse of shepheards, eyther for that theyr rough sounde vvould make his rymes more ragged and rustical, or els because such olde and obsolete wordes are most vsed of country folke, sure I think, and think I think not amisse, that they bring great grace, and, as one vvould say, auctoritie to the verse. For albe amongst many other faultes it specially be obiected of Valla against Liuie, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against Saluste, that vvith ouer much studie they affect antiquitie, as coueting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by credence and honor of elder yeeres, yet I am of opinion, and eke the best learned are of the lyke, that those auncient solemne wordes are a great ornament both in the one &amp; in the other; the one labouring to set forth in hys worke an eternall image of antiquitie, and the other carefully discoursing matters of grauitie and importaunce. For if my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fayle not, Tullie in that booke, vvherein he endeuoureth to set forth the paterne of a
<pb facs="tcp:11623:3"/>
perfect Oratour, sayth that ofttimes an auncient worde maketh the style seeme graue, and as it were reuerend: no otherwise then vve honour and reuerence gray heares for a certein religious regard, which we haue of old age. yet nether euery where must old words be stuffed in, nor the commen Dialecte and maner of speaking so corrupted therby, that as <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> old buildings it seme disorderly &amp; ruinous. But all as in most exquisite pictures they vse to blaze and portraict not onely the daintie lineaments of beautye, but also rounde about it to shadow the rude thickets and craggy clifts, that by the basenesse of such parts, more excellency may accrew to the principall; for oftimes we fynde ourselues, I knowe not hovv, singularly delighted with the shewe of such naturall rudenesse, and take great pleasure in that disorderly order. Euen so doe those rough and harsh termes enlumine and make more clearly to appeare the brightnesse of braue &amp; glorious vvords. So ofentimes a dischorde in Musick maketh a comely concordaunce: so great delight tooke the worthy Poete Alceus to behold a blemish in the ioynt of a wel shaped body. But if any vvill rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame such his purpose in choyse of old and vnvvonted vvords, him may I more iustly blame and condemne, or of vvitlesse headinesse in iudging, or of heedelesse hardinesse in condemning. for not marking the compasse of hys bent, he vvil iudge of the length of his cast. for in my opinion it is one special prayse, of many vvhych are dew to this Poete, that he hath laboured to restore, as to theyr rightsull heritage such good and naturall English words, as haue ben long time out of vse &amp; almost cleare disherited. VVhich is the onely cause, that our Mother tonge, which truely of it self is both ful enough for prose &amp; stately enough for verse, hath long time ben cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>red most bare &amp; barrein of both. which default when as some endeuoured to salue &amp; recure, they patched vp the holes with peces &amp; rags of other languages, borrowing here of the french, there of the Italian, euery where of the Latine, not vveighing hovv il, those tongues accorde vvith themselues, but much vvorse vvith ours: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> they haue made our English tongue, a gallimaufray or hodgepodge of al other speches. Other some no so wel seme in the English tonge as perhaps in other lan guages, if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> happen to here an olde vvord albeit very naturall and significant, crye out streight way, that we speak no English, but gibbrish, or rather such, as in old time Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders mother spake. vvhose fitst shame is, that they are not ashamed, in their own mother tonge straungers to be counted and alienes. The second shame no lesse then the first, that what so they vnderstand not, they streight vvay deeme to be sencelesse, and not at al to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode. Much like to the Mole in Aesopes fable, that being blynd her selfe, vvould inno wise be perswaded, that any beast could see. The last more shameful then both, that of their ovvne country and natural speach, vvhich together vvith their Nources milk they sucked, they haue so base regard and bastard iudgement, that they vvill not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues not labor to garnish &amp; beautifie it, but also repine, that of other it shold be embel lished. Like to the dogge in the maunger, that him selfe can eate no hay, and yet barketh at the hungry bullock, that so faine vvould feede: vvhose currish kind though cannot be kept from barking, yet I conne them thanke that they refrain from byting.</p>
            <p>Novv for the knitting of sentences, vvhych they call the ioynts and members therof, and for al the compasse of the speach, it is round vvithout roughnesse, and learned wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hardnes, such indeede as may be perceiued of the leaste, vnderstoode of the moste, but iudged onely of the learned. For vvhat in most English wryters vseth to be loose, and as it vvere vngyrt, in this Authour is vvell grounded, finely framed, and strongly trussed vp together. In regard wherof, I scorne and spue out the rakehellye route of our ragged rymers (for so the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vse to hunt the letter) vvhich vvithout learning boste, vvithout

<q>Enough is me to paint out my vnrest, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And also appeareth by the basenesse of the name, vvherein, it semeth, he chose rather to vnfold great matter of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t couertly, then professing it, not suffice thereto according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. vvhich moued him rather in Aeglogues, then other wise to vvrite, doubting perhaps his habilitie, which he little needed, or mynding to surnish our tongue vvith this kinde, wherein it faulteth, or follovving the example of the best &amp; most auncient Poetes, which deuised this kind of wryting, being both so base for the matter, and homely for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the first to trye theyr habilities? and as young birdes, that be nevvly crept out of the nest, by little first to proue theyr tender vvyngs, before they make a greater flyght. So flevv Theocritus, as you may perceiue he vvas all ready full fledged. So flew Virgile, as not yet vvell feeling his vvinges So flevv Mantuane, as being not full somd. So Petrarque. So Boccace; So Marot, Sanazarus, and also diuers other excellent both Italian and French Poetes, vvhose foting this Author euery vvhere follovved; yet so as few, but they be wel sented can trace him out. So finally flyeth this our nevv Poete, as a bird, whose principals be scarce grovven out, but yet as that in time shall be hable to keepe wing with the best</p>
            <p>Novv as touching the generall dryft and purpose of his Aeglogues, I mind not to say much, him selfe labouring to conceale it. Onely this appeareth, that his vnstayed yougth had long vvandred in the common Labyrinth of Loue, in vvhich time to mitigate and allay the heate of his passion, or els to vvarne (as he sayth) the young shepheards <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

For although in Virgile and others the speakers be most shepheards, and Goteheards, yet Theocritus in whom is more ground of authoritie, then in Virgile, this specially from that deriuing, as from the first head and vvelspring the vvhole Inuericion of his Aeglogues, maketh Goteheards the persons and authors of his tales. This being, vvho seeth not the grossenesse of such as by colour of learning would make vs beleeue that they are more rightly termed Eclogai, as they vvould say, extraordinary discourses of vnnecessarie matter, vvhich difinition albe in substaunce and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing, yet nowhit answereth with the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and interpretation of the word.

Other curious discourses hereof I reserue to greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. These xij. Aeclogues euery where answering to the seasons of the tvvelue monthes may be vvell deuided into three formes or ranckes. For eyther they be Plaintiue, as the first, the sixt, the eleuenth, &amp; the twelfth, or recreatiue, such as al those be, vvhich conceiue matter of loue, or commendation of special personages, or Moral: vvhich for the most part be mixed with some Satyrical bitternesse, namely the second of reuerence devve to old age, the fift of coloured deceipt, the seuenth and ninth of dissolute shepheards &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, the tenth of contempt of Poetrie &amp; pleasaunt vvits. And to this diuision may eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing herein be reasonably applyed: A few onely except, vvhose speciall purpose and meaning I am not priuie to. And thus much generally of these xij. Aeclogues. Now vvill vve speake particularly of all, and first of the first. vvhich he calleth by the first monethes name Ianuarie. wherein to some he may seeme fovvly to haue faulted, in that he erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously beginneth with that moneth, vvhich beginneth not the yeare. For it is welknown and stoutely mainteyned vvith stronge reasons of the learned, that the yeare beginneth in March. for then the sonne renevveth his finished course, and the seasonable spring refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the earth, and the pleasaunce thereof being buried in the sadnesse of the dead winter novv vvorne avvay, reliueth. This opinion maynteine the olde Astrologers and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, namely the reuerend Andalo, and Macrobius in his holydayes of Saturne, which accoumpt also vvas generally obserued both of Grecians and ROmans.

For albeit that in elder-times, vvhen as yet the coumpt of the yere was not perfected, as aftervvarde it was by Iulius Caesar, they began to tel the monethes from Marches beginning, and according to the same God (as is sayd in Scripture) comaunded the people of the Ievves to count the moneth Abil, that vvhich vve call March, for the first moneth, in remembraunce that in that moneth he brought them out of the land of Aegipt: yet according to tradition of latter times it hath bene othervvise obserued, both in gouernment of of the church, and rule of Mightiest Realmes. For from Iulius Caesar vvho first obserued the leape yeere vvhich he called Bissextilem Annum, and brought in to a more certain course the odde vvandring dayes vvhich of the Greekes vvere called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> . of the Romanes intercalares (for in such matter of learning I am forced to vse the termes of the learned) the monethes haue bene nombred xij. vvhich in the first ordinaunce of Romulus vvere but tenne, counting but CCCiiij. dayes in euery yeare, and beginning with March. But Numa Pompilius, vvho vvas the father of al the Romain ceremonies and religion, seeing that reckoning to agree neither vvith the course of the sonne, nor of the Moone, therevnto added tvvo monethes, Ianuary and February: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it seemeth, that vvise king minded vpon good reason to begin the yeare at Ianuarie, of him therefore so called tanquam Ianua anni the gate and entraunce of the yere, or of the name of the god Ianus, to which god for that the old Paynims attributed the byrth &amp; beginning of all creatures nevv comming into the vvorlde, it seemeth that he therfore to him assigned the beginning and first enrraunce of the yeare. vvhich account for the most part hath hetherto continued. Notvvithstanding that the Aegiptians beginne theyr yeare at September, for that according to the opinion of the best Rabbins, and very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the scripture selfe, God made the vvorlde in that Moneth, that is called of them Tisri And therefore he commaunded them, to keepe the feast of Pauilions in the end of the yeare, in the xv. day of the seuenth moneth, vvhich before that time was the first.</p>
            <p>But our Authour respecting nether the subtiltie of thone parte, nor the antiquitie o thother, thinketh it fittest according to the simplicitie of commen vnderstanding, to be gin vvith Ianuarie, wening it perhaps no decoru, that Sepheard should be seene in ma ter of so deepe insight, or canuase a case of so doubtful iudgment.

And so is paederastice much to be prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before gynerastice, that is the loue vvhiche enflameth men vvith lust to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard vvoman kind.

VVhich story is first recorded of Plutatch, in his booke of the ceasing of oracles, &amp; of Lauetere tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, in his booke of vvalking sprightes. vvho sayth, that about the same time, that our Lord suffered his most bitter passion for the redemtion of man, certein passengers sayling from Italy to Cyprus and passing by certain Iles called Paxae, heard a voyce calling alovvde Thamus, Thamus, (now Thamus vvas the name of an Aegyptian, vvhich was Pilote of the ship,) who giuing eare to the cry, was bidden, vvhen he came to Palodes, to tel, that the great Pan vvas dead: which he doubting to doe, yet for that vvhen he came to Palodes, there sodeinly vvas such a calme of winde, that the shippe stoode still in the sea vnmoued, he vvas forced to cry alovvd, that Pan was dead: vvherevvithall there was heard suche piteous outcryes and dreadfull shriking, as hath not bene the like. By vvhych Pan, though of some be vnderstoode the great Satamas, whose kingdome at that time vvas by Christ conquered, the gates of hell broken vp, and death by death deliuered to eternall death, (for at that time, as he sayth; all Oracles surceased, and enchaunted spirits, that vvere wont to delude the people, thenceforth held theyr peace) &amp; also at the demaund of the Emperoure Tiberius, who that Pan should be, ansvvere vvas made him by the vvisest and best learned, that it vvas the sonne of Mercurie and Penelope, yet I think it more properly meant of the death of Christ, the onely and very Pan, then suffering for his flock.</p>

               <p>Paradise) A Paradise in Greeke signifieth a Garden of pleasure, or place of delights. So he compareth the soile, vvherin Hobbinoll made his abode, to that earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, in scripture called Eden; vvherein Adam in his first creation vvas placed. VVhich of the most learned is thought to be in Mesopotamia, the most ferule and pleasaunte country in the vvorld (as may appeare by Diodorus Syculus description of it, in the hystorie of Alexanders conquest thereof.) Lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two famous Ryuers (which are sayd in scripture to flovve out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise) Tygris and Euphrates, vvhereof it is so denominate.</p>
               <p>Forsake the soyle) This is no poetical fiction, but vnseynedly spoken of the Poete selfe, who for speciall occasion of priuate affayres (as I haue bene partly of himselfe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11623:29"/>
informed) and for his more preferment remouing out of the Northparts came into the South, as Hobbinoll indeede aduised him priuately.</p>
               <p>Those hylles) that is the North countrye, where he dvvelt. Nis) is not.</p>
               <p>The Dales) The Southpartes, vvhere he nowe abydeth, vvhich thoughe they be full of hylles and vvoodes (for Kent is very hyllye and vvoodye; and therefore so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: for Kantsh in the Saxons tongue signifieth vvoodie) yet in respecte of the Northpartes they be called dales. For indede the North is counted the higher countrye.</p>
               <p>Night Rauens &amp;c.) by such hatefull byrdes, hee meaneth all misfortunes (VVhereof they be tokens) flying euery vvhere.</p>
               <p>Frendly faeries) the opinion of Faeries and elfes is very old, and yet sticketh very religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in the myndes of some. But to roote that rancke opinion of Elfes oute of mens hearts, the truth is, that there be no such thinges, nor yet the shadowes of the things, but onely by a sort of bald Friers and knauish shauelings so feigned; vvhich as in all other things, so in that, soughte to nousell the comen people in ignorounce, least being once acquainted vvith the truth of things, they vvoulde in tyme smell out the vntruth of theyr packed pelfe and Massepenie religion. But the sooth is, that vvhen all Italy was distraicte into the Factions of the Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elfes and the Gibelins, being tvvo famous houses in Florence, the name began through their great mischiefes and many outrages, to be so odious or rather dreadfull in the peoples eares, that if theyr children at any time vvere frowarde and vvanton, they would say to them that the Guelfe or the Gibeline came. VVhich vvords novve from them (as many thinge els) be come into our vsage, and for Guelfes and Gibelines, we say Elfes &amp; Goblins. No otherwise then the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsed to say of that valiaunt captain, the very scourge of Fraunce, the Lord Thalbot, afterward Erle of Shrevvsbury; whose noblesse bred such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the hearts of the French, that oft times euen great armies vvere defaic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; put to flyght at the onely hearing of hys name. In somuch that the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch vvemen, to affray theyr chyldren, vvould tell them that the Talbot commeth. </p>
               <p>Many Graces) though there be indeede but three Graces or Charites (as afore is sayd) or at the vtmost but foure, yet in respect of many gyftes of bounty, there may be sayde more. And so Musaeus sayth, that in Heroes eyther eye there satte a hundred graces. And by that authoritye, thys same Poete in his Pageaunts sayth. An hundred Graces on her eyeledde satte, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Haydeguies) A country daunce or rovvnd. The conceipt is, that the Graces and Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes doe daunce vnto the Muses, and Pan his musicke all night by Moonelight. To signifie the pleasauntnesse of the soyle.</p>

               <q>Ipse ego cana legam tenera lanugine mala.</q>
               <p>Neighbour groues) a straunge phrase in English, but vvord for vvord expressing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine vicina nemora.</p>
               <p>Spring) not of vvater, but of young trees springing. Calliope) afforesayde. Thys staffe is is full of verie poetical inuention. Tamburines) an olde kind of instrument, vvhich of some is supposed to be the Clarion.</p>
               <p>Pan vvith Phaebus) the tale is well knowne, howe that Pan and Apollo striuing for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb facs="tcp:11623:30"/>
in musicke, chose Midas for their iudge. VVho being corrupted vvyth partiall affection, gaue the victorye to Pan vndeserued: for vvhich Phoebus sette a payre of Asses eares vpon hys head &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Tityrus) That by Tityrus is meant Chaucer, hath bene already sufficiently sayde, &amp; by thys more playne appeareth, that he sayth, he tolde merye tales. Such as be hys Canterburie tales. vvhom he calleth the God of Poetes for hys excellencie, so as Tullie calleth Lentulus, Deum vitae suae. <abbr>s</abbr> the God of hys lyfe.</p>

               <p>Menalcas] the name of a shephearde in Virgile; but here is meant a person vnknowne and secrete, agaynst vvhome he often bitterly inuayeth.</p>

               <p>Embleme.
You remember, that in the fyrst Aeglogue, Colins Poesie vvas Anchora speme: for that as then there vvas hope of fauour to be found in tyme. But novve being cleane forlorne and reiected of her, as whose hope, that was, is cleane extinguished and turned into despeyre, he renounceth all comfort and hope of goodnesse to come. vvhich is all the meaning of thys Embleme.</p>

For at what time an infinite number of youth vsually came to theyr great solemne feastes called Panegyrica, vvhich they vsed euery fiue yeere to hold, some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man being more hable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest, for speciall gyftes of wytte and Musicke, vvould take vpon him to sing fine verses to the people, in prayse eythet of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or of victory or of immortality or such like.

So fauoured he the only name of a Poete. vvhych prayse otherwise vvas in the same man no lesse famous, that vvhen he came to ransacking of king Darius coffers, vvhom he lately had ouerthrowen, he founde in a little coffer of siluer the two bookes of Homers vvorks, as layd vp there for speciall ievvells and richesse, vvhich he taking thence, put one of them dayly in his bofome, and tho ther euery night layde vnder his pillovve.</p>

VVhich is as much to say, as death biteth not. For although by course of nature we be borne to dye, and being ripened with age, as vvith a timely haruest, vve must be gathered in time, or els of our selues vve fall like rotted ripe fruite fro the tree: yet death is not to be counted for euil, nor (as the Poete sayd a little before) as doome of ill desert) For though the trespasse of the first man brought death in to the world, as the guerdon of sinne, yet being ouercome by the death of one, that dyed for al, it is novv made (as Chaucer sayth) the grene path way to lyfe. So that it agreeth vvell vvith that vvas sayd, that Death byteth not (that is) hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not at all.</p>
