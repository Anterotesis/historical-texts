            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VPON THE TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY
OF MARRIAGE BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TWEEN
ENGLAND
AND SPAIN.</head>
            <p>THe essentiall poynts thereof seem to be the
advantages, and disadvantages of such an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and whether both weighed in equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
the one will not oversway the other.</p>
            <p>The advantages that England may pretend are these.</p>
            <p>First, a great Kings daughter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, much mony.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, safety.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, continuance of trade.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the bridling of the overgrowing greatnes
of the States.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the Subiects of Spain will not be se bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome
to England being more remote, as those of
France would be that are nearer neighbours.</p>
            <p>Lastly, hindring the Scottish faction for strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it selfe by the alliance of France, which though
it be not publickly taken knowledge of, yet hath his
place among the reasons that further the match with
Spaine.</p>
            <p>These and the like benefits and advantages some
promise to themselues by running the course of
Spaine: but of God or his cause hitherto is made noe
mention at all. And yet vnlesse the Lord build the
house, the builders labour but in vaine.</p>
            <div type="answer">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:14017:2"/>
               <head>The Answer</head>
               <p>The meanest of the houshould of faith are much
greater then those that are without, for they are borne
to a great inheritance: these are their promises.</p>
               <p>First God is their God, and with them hath he
made a covenant: nor ought it to be forgotten that
the house of <hi>Spayn</hi> is stained with incest in the
match with the last King &amp; his owne sisters daughter,
which cannot be but very loathsome to every true
Christians hart: and yet to speake according to the
world, the estate of England is great enough of it selfe
match it where it will, as it hath done in times past,
and as other great Monarkes haue led the way. And
the alliance of France is neere, and hath no ill aspect
upon England, and is as honourable as that of Spain;
that of France will not proue so beneficiall, and so
neither so dangerous or prejudiciall.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, mony wil be soon wasted and melted away,
but the price of it will abide still: and let not any flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
themselues, Spayn giveth nothing but for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and where he giveth much he looketh for a
great returne: Examine well their actions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and make use of experience: whether can or
ought mony to be an essentiall consideration to sway
the weight of so important an Alliance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is not England stronger at this time and
Spain weaker then heretofore? where then is any
cause of feare? But alow that the state of England
stood in feare of any danger of Spayn? will this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
secure them? the feare is idle and the remedy
more idle, unlesse any could make it good that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14017:2"/>
love of Spayne unto England (the match going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
would proue the predominant humor in him,
that should sway his ambission, whereof the world
hath so much experience to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Charles the fift gaue his owne sister in mariage to
Francis the first: was Francis ever a whit the safer for
such an alliance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Savoy</hi> hath married Spaines sister, who nevertheles
doth what he can to swalow him up.</p>
               <p>France and Spaine haue lastly made a double match,
ler it be examined whether Spaine hath laboured
more to quench or kindle the fier in France; and yet
they are both of one and the same religion.</p>
               <p>They erre who thinke there is any thinge to be had
from a Papist for love rather then for feare, or that
Spaine will ever dessist from aspiring to the universal
Monarchy of Christondome, and particularly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the uuited provinces: for though he often
strike saile and put into the harbour in fowle weather
yet doth he not neglect to weigh anchour againe, and
follow his intended course when the season is fit for
it. England doth hinder his designes; and therefore
would he match with England to haue the fitter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
for him: and if he were in quiet posession of all
the seventeene Provinces, then would they be made
a stable or store-house for all things necessary, in so
plentifull and well fitted a situation, for the invading
the parts neare adioyning, whereof the plots are not
new, if England give way unto him, then (disapoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their defences and Bulwarkes) they will stand
(as it were) at his mercy and ly open to all manner
of batteries: as on the other side if he be crossed, then
will things be but where they vvere, both for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14017:3"/>
and assurance against fear of invasion; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in so much the worse termes, because he shall
faile of his expectation, which commonly breeds
much harshnes even amongst the dearest freinds. Let
not any cast a mist in others eyes: though Spain had
left aside his wonted ambition (which none can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
assure) yet will he never loose his hope, or
relent in his resolution of recovering the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
wherein his honour and his reputation are so
deeply interessed: nor can such a great scattered bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that hath so many irons in the fier be but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
armed, and still in action to the danger both
of freinds and foes, as he shall finde his best advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and oportunities.</p>
               <p>If England fear Spain, their safety will rather stand
in keeping him at the staves end then in receaving
such an ambitious and new reconciled enemy and
doubtfull frend into their bosom, where he shall
vvithout blovves be able to doe them much more
hurt by his daily practice and corrupting of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
then he can otherwise by open hostility, which
he will be wary enough not to attempt, lest they
ioyning their foarces by sea with those of the united
<hi>Provinces,</hi> should giue him too great a shake. Strange
intelligence, and corespondence with neighbour
friends and allies will alwayes proue a safer refuge for
<hi>England</hi> against <hi>Spain.</hi> And because all haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
quarrell to his Ambition and greatnes, which in
him will never giue way to any other consideration
whatsoever: for there hath ever been and will still
continue in <hi>Spain</hi> an endlesse ambitious desire of the
obtayning the westerne Monarchy vvhere of a greate
parte of Christendome doth yet beare the scarre, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14017:3"/>
feele the stripes.</p>
               <p>4. Trade will be allowed to continue and as safely
without the Alliance of Marriage as with it: for <hi>Spayn</hi>
doth not only reape a benefit by it; but also will be
afrayde to scare or discontent <hi>England</hi> by the evill
usage of the Marchants. Else why haue they so basely
and abjectly begged a peace: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soever he shall se his
opportunity and finde a greater aduantage to break
then to continue in good termes with <hi>England,</hi> the
Alliance vvill secure the merchants no more, then if
it were not at all.</p>
               <p>5. The states may in time grow great, and their
greatnes may grow dangerous; but <hi>Spayn</hi> is both the
one and the other already; and this Alliance will ad
much unto it: there may also grow yealousy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnes
and thence open emnity betwixt <hi>England</hi>
and them, and so on the other side may the matter
be so discreetly caried, as they two may entertaine
good amity and correspo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dency one with the other for
common defence: for they both professe one religion
and their estate and condition seemes to unite them
together in a necessity of putting out their hands
one to another for mutuall preservation.</p>
               <p>Doe they carry themselves now unkindly or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
unrespectiuly? It doth not so urgently prove
that they may become enemies hereafter, as there
upon to ground a necessity of making an Alliance
with a known enemy, which were no other but to
run into a present mischeif for fear of a future incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
They take an Allarum at <hi>Englands</hi> ioyning
with <hi>Spayn</hi> to their hurt; which though it be not so
ment by <hi>England,</hi> yet it is the scope that <hi>Spayn</hi> aymes at
and that may make them perhaps somewhat to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14017:4"/>
neglect <hi>England,</hi> but remoue the cause, and the effect
will cease, let them be assured of their freindship and
they will prove respectfull freinds: if they prosper and
grow great, who knoweth whether it be not of God,
by such weake meanes to pull downe the loftines of
<hi>Spayn?</hi> and then to withstand them were to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a rock: the very first occasion of their liberty
was driving them to dispaire; which made them to
take hart and resolution to resist the violence that
was offered: wherein being incoraged with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and feeling their owne strength, they haue in
time made such further progresse as is this day to be
seene: better it were for <hi>England</hi> to make use of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
evill, and run a course with them whereby
they may haue their part in their well speeding, then
to ioyne with <hi>Spayn</hi> (a religion and state enimy)
who Allieth him selfe to <hi>England</hi> but for his ovvne
ends, and must needes draw after them the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the cause of religion and ruine the state: and
will never proue but a secrett Enimy and doubtfull
frend. And it must not in this place be forgotten that
if true professors be justly reproved for going to law
before heathen Iudges, much lesse may they side
themselves with any of those that are without, to
the hinderance and hurt one of an other.</p>
               <p>6. If <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Fraunce</hi> should match to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it doth not therefore consequently follow
that the French should become burthensome to the
State by reason of their nearnesse. The lawes of
<hi>England</hi> allow no offices or preferments of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.
The french will haue more hope in their owne
Cuntry where there is without comparison more
to be given then in <hi>England;</hi> the English seeke
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14017:4"/>
not to make any fortune in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the French should be importunate they are
also impatient: let them finde <hi>Visage de Boyes,</hi> and
your couldnes should weare out their earnestnes.</p>
               <p>7. That the French with the Scottish faction may
gather strength by the Alliance of France is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
consideration: against which may be opposed
the greatnes the Spanish faction will grovv unto by
a match vvith <hi>Spayn</hi> to the danger of the state: this
doth greatly lay open the value of such advantages as
<hi>England</hi> doth promise it selfe by matching with <hi>Spain</hi>
vvhich how dearely they vvould notvvithstanding be
bought will more perfectly appeare, if knowledg be
also taken of the inconveniences and mischeifes that
vvould follovv: for the better conceiving vvhere of,
his ends are to be considered, and seriously examined;
for it is not likely that <hi>Spain</hi> a Religion and State Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,
vvho hath both religion and state quarrels
against <hi>England,</hi> vvill yeald to giue his Daughter in
Mariage to <hi>England:</hi> nay rather doth offer great sums
of mony for composing there of; but that he looks
for a great returne,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The price of this Alliance therefore vvill be the
breaking of the match vvith <hi>France,</hi> to the vveakning
of both <hi>England</hi> ane <hi>Fraunce,</hi> vvhereby he may have
the greater footing in eyther, and the deviding <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from his alices, especially from the States of the
united Porovinces, the making vvay for an other
match for his second sonne (vvhom he hath a plot
to settle in the lovv Cuntries, and from thence to
promote him (if he can) to the Crovvne Imperiall)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14017:5"/>
vvith an other daughter of <hi>France,</hi> vvhich vvould
giue so great an Allarum to the vvhole state of those
of the religion, if the pretended match vvith <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
come not betvveen, altering in time the state of
Religion, vvhereof if he had no hope, neither vvould
he harken to the match: for none must thinke he
vvould treat such an Alliance vvithout the privacy
and consent of his divines, or that they vvill giue
their consents to that but upon great probability that
it shall tend to the furtherance of their catholique
faith. The supposed Catholique religion is knovvne to
be in <hi>Spain</hi> one of the fundamentall Lavves of their
estate: and no doubt <hi>Spain</hi> is a very right Romish
Catholique, the further therefore that he spreadeth
his religion, the greater satisfaction it is to his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the more doth he underprop and increase
his greatnes, namely because those of that religion
that are most deuout, but especially the greatest part
of the Clergy throughout Christendom haue their
eyes fixed on him, as upon the greatest stay and piller
of their catholique faith: vvho therefore if he should
match vvith an heritique (for so they terme us Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish)
but vvith a setled purpose by such meanes to
root out heresy, vvould both vvrong his ovvne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and loose his reputation amongst all those of
his beleefe, to the over great vveakning of his estate:
vvhich error none of sound judgment that knovves
<hi>Spayn,</hi> vvill easily beleve that he vvill commit.</p>
               <p>That a change or tolleration should happen in
<hi>England</hi> by meanes of the intended match, is more to
be feared then any can vvarrant to be impossible:
vvherin it vvere vvell vvorth the laboure to find out

there is that the same may be disapoynted; in
the mean time very likely it is in generall that there
vvill be no meanes unattempted, or left on his side,
to bring his purpose to passe. And then it must in
this place be remembred, first that vvhatsoever is
not of fayth is sin, and that sin hath no promise of
blessing; nor is this a vvork of fayth. And next that
<hi>England</hi> hath but too much experience of Popery,
vvith in these fevv yeares, for vvant of due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lavves; vvhich hath bread exceeding great
bouldnes in the papists, asvvell at home as abroad.</p>
               <p>If the mariage goe forvvard they vvill take the more
hart and greater encouragement, no small number of
subiects want teaching, and so are the more easily
shaken, many waver, and many are newfangled the
more prepared for a chaunge: &amp; therefore will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
be wrought upon. The ould serpent will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
many Eves, and pistols will have free passage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where. The worst is yet, that there will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
children: for the mother will give herselfe noe
rest till she have nusled some of them in her owne
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which would make the way very playn &amp; easy
for a chaunge, because the head once corrupted, the
infection will in short time spread it selfe over the
whole body, and true religion is unsociable to sort it
selfe with false worship, and will soone forsake his
dwelling place.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Spayn</hi> can procure a tolleration of religion (vvhich
must needs be follovved vvith ruine of the State) he
may then assure himselfe of sides that vvill alvvayes
be able either directly or indirectly to divert the state
from hindering his designes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as vvell in the lovv
Cuntryes, as vvheresoever else, and although he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14017:6"/>
should not prevayle at the first by practis, or procure
a tolleration of religion, vvhich neverthelesse the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creacing
number of Papists will of it selfe in processe
of time effect, yet when he hath once a faction on
foote and that many of the subjects are perverted in
religion, he will notwithstanding be in good hope
that the state may be stayed, &amp; hindered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opposing
it self against his designes by the working of his factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; the ielousy that will be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaved of the Papists with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Relme: and whether his hopes will fayll him
or no, yet if he should upon such ground make any
attempt against those of the united Provinses, that
could not but fale out to the great troble annoyance
and danger of the state, especially if he send his forses
by sea; for then must <hi>England</hi> upon any such occati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either rig out there Navy to sea to se that he keep
his course, which will allwayes be a matter of great
burthen and charge, or otherwayes abide the danger
of his landing upon their owne cousts, if he have
intelligence with the Papists: wherefore it will be
allwayes safer in such cases to be somewhat iealous
then too secure.</p>
               <p>Now the Alliance with <hi>Spayn</hi> vvill not onely scarr
and discourage in generall, the vvholl side of those
of the religion abroad, to the great vveakning of the
state of <hi>England,</hi> but also breed a particuler ielousy
in those of the united Provinses, vvhen they shall se
that Popery increaseth, or that <hi>Spayn</hi> hath a faction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or party in the Relme: vvhereof one of these tvvo
mischeives must consequently follovv, either that
they will make their peace vvith <hi>Spayn,</hi> or keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
many shipes of vvar in the narrovv seas if
they be able to hould out, especially upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14017:6"/>
of any supplyes by sea to the Artch Duke during
the Truce: vvhich (as they are a people iealous and
suspitious enough by nature) may at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by occationes happening grovv to some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
inconvenience: for betvveen tvvo so neare
neighbours both potent at sea, if there be not straight
amity kept, things cannot long stand vvithout break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth into tearmes of open hostility. And for the
state of those Provinses, though strong by sea, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and cituation, yet are not the foundations of it
so far sure that <hi>England</hi> can vvith safety leaue them
to themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the late sects and questions about
matters of religion threaten their disunion; and <hi>Spayn</hi>
that lies continually in wayt for their liberty hath his
pencioners and dayly practicers amongst them.</p>
               <p>Some doe noyse much the antient amity with the
house of Burgundy, but that house is changed and
hath not kept strok in the conditions of the Alliance,
&amp; so ought the cause to be altered too. It was to weak
for France but now it is too strong, and <hi>England</hi> had
then plots against France which now it hath not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The greatest use of Leagues and Alliances is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
present mischeives, or to further some necessary
enterprice: otherwise reason of state and common
experience teacheth to sway even with the vveaker,
for the brideling of the ambition and greatnes of the
stronger. They make an idle distinction vvho to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
the obiections made against <hi>Spayn</hi> pretend that
mariages are but personall amongst Preinces and not
reall: for if there be no reallity, vvhere is then the
good of <hi>England?</hi> if there be any who is so weak as to
thinke that <hi>Spayn</hi> will easily quit his interest in it.</p>
               <p>To alledge the exampell of <hi>Erance</hi> that houldeth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14017:7"/>
correspondency still vvith his other Allies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to assist them against <hi>Sapyn,</hi> (notvvithstanding
his match vvith <hi>Spayn)</hi> is to as litle purpose in the
judgment of those vvho doe also knovv hovv much
<hi>Spayn</hi> prevayleth in weakning their sinewes, and frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
the effect of such assistance.</p>
               <p>The sum is, that <hi>Spayn</hi> hopes by reason of this match
so to charme <hi>England,</hi> as it shall give way to him in
his courses: and <hi>England</hi> contrariwise promiseth it
selfe the hony of the bee without danger of being
stung: whether of both may come short of their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coning
is at the least disputable. For <hi>Spayn</hi> on the
one side will spare no travell or charge, will use all
the meanes and practises he can, and take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of all occasions, and advantages that shall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bring his purposes to passe: as it may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that <hi>England</hi> for his part will stand upon his
watch, to prevent a mischeife that shall threaten
the state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spayn</hi> may (by a vigilant care and good foresight)
be disapoynted: so may <hi>England</hi> by the contrary be
overtaken: for death will weare away these watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that are now, and others may succeed that will
not be so watchfull: nay watchfulnes it selfe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watched
will in time grow drowsy, and overwearied
carefulnes will grow carelesse.</p>
               <p>The very best cautions and caveats must needes
relent and wax ould in time. In all strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
as well of the body as the mind, if one
side get ground the other looseth it. Time will bring
forth many accidents which may fall out as to the
good, so to the hurt of <hi>England:</hi> who (that may
with good reason be feared) will not be watchfull
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14017:7"/>
nor have his spirits alwayes intent enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the practises of <hi>Spayn</hi> after so straite Alliance, that
cannot now so much as foresee them, or resolue to
keep out <hi>Spayn.</hi> Whereupon the question ariseth
whether it be a sound course for <hi>England</hi> (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
by any urgent necessity) to put the cause of
religion, and their owne well doing and safety to so
great an adversary, in a matter that stands upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
contingents. For it is no new experience that the
things which we think almost impossible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fear them least, doe neverthelesse often come
to passe; because neglected, and so not hindered by
opposition, they creep unawares upon us as through
the mists of security. Well saith the Italian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Quell che non volete che sia non fate cosa per che
avuenga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Spayn</hi> who of late was thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
weak in the head, and wounded in reputation
by those of the united Provinces; yet having never
been more weakly ballanced then at this present,
begins now to resume his spirits, and without
timely and strong opposition, will take so
deep roote, and spread his branches so far,
as to overshadow all his neighbours:
and deadly dangerouse it will be
for any one to sleepe
in such a shade.</p>
