            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 Cor. 15. 29.</bibl>
               <q>And as we have born the Image of the earthy,
so we shall also bear the Image of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHether the Soul in the State
of Separation acts indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
of Matter, purely by
the strength of her own powers, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in order to the better understanding
her self and other Beings, she makes use
of a Body of Air shaped out into such
Limbs and Sences as she hath occasional
employment for; whether or no the
want of her old companion is supplied
this way, is uncertain. But whatever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements
of happiness the pious Soul
may suffer for want of a suitable Body
between the time of Death, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judgment, then we are sure this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
will be removed, and it will be
repossessed of its antient Seat out of which
Violence or Nature had forced it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40272:3"/>
Now this certainty of the Resurrection
is a Doctrine, which helps the meanest
understanding to conceive the Nature of
the Happiness of the other World, and
consequently must needs prove a great
and universal encouragement to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our Duty. For in regard we have
always been used to dwell in these houses
of Clay, the generality would not have
been so well able to apprehend the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of pure and uncompounded Spirits;
but would have been apt to have thought
that the loss of their Bodies would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
them of no small part of themselves;
and consequently would not have been so
willing to resign them or expose them to
hardship and inconvenience upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion: But now since we are
assured that this visible part of us, which we
are so well acquainted with, shall be quitted
only for a time, and then restored us with
all desirable advantages; yet Mortality
shall be swallowed up of life, and we shall
exchange the Image of the earthy for that
of the heavenly; what can we more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
infer than the last verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40272:3"/>
               <hi>Wherefore be ye stedfast, immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord in as much
as</hi> no part of our being is lost, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no part of <hi>our labour is in vain in the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by the Image of the earthy is meant
that mortal corruptible body which we have
derived to us from <hi>Adam,</hi> is plain from the
verse before the text; <hi>The first man was of
the earth earthy, the second man is the Lord
from Heaven,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>as we have
born the Image of the earthy we shall also bear
Image of the Heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because the nature of opposite qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
is best discovered by their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
therefore that it may the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear wherein the advantage of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the earthy for the heavenly consists;
I shall in the</p>
            <p>First place mention those inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and defects to which our bodies are
subject now.</p>
            <p>2. I shall endeavour to prove that the
qualities of glorified bodies will be opposed
to those defects, and free from those incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
we are now sensible of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40272:4"/>
3. I shall draw some practical conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the consideration of this difference.</p>
            <p>1. Those bodies we now have are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
upon these following accounts.</p>
            <p>1. Because of the weakness and useless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them when we have them first.</p>
            <p>2. Because their best condition is but of
a short continuance.</p>
            <p>3. Because our being liable to the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of passion proceeds in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
from them.</p>
            <p>4. Because they make us subject to pain.</p>
            <p>5. Because they hinder the operations
of the mind in its pursuit after truth and
knowledge.</p>
            <p>1. They are inconvenient upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the weakness and usefulness of them
when we have them first.</p>
            <p>Though our deriving our Beings from
those of our own Nature, and coming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
into the World, is a great promoter of
kindness and good correspondence, and
tends very much to support of Government
and Society; yet it must be granted, that we
lose something (tho not so much) by it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. For the Soul at her first entrance,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40272:4"/>
by reason of the indisposition of the body,
is uncapable of acting rationally, and is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to wait till she hath fit instruments to
work with; and when we do begin to judge
of objects, we measure the good and evil of
them by the pleasure of inconvenience
which the body receives from thence: Now
because we are accustomed at first for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years together to make our sences Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
of the value of things, this forestalls our
judgment, with a good opinion of them,
which makes us more inclinable to please
them afterwards, and gives our reason a
greater trouble in the managing of them
than otherwise it would have had.</p>
            <p>Besides in our Infancy unpleasant and
frightful things make a deep impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us both because of the fluid and pliable
nature of the Brain, and because we have
not judgment to discover the worst of things
nor strength to resist them, and therefore
through our own weakness, and the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of those we sometimes happen to
converse with; we are apt to take up odd
prejudices, and to be possess'd with unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
fears, which the reason of our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40272:5"/>
whole life often finds impossible to conquer:
It must be granted therefore that <hi>Adam</hi> had
a great advantage above his posterity, by
being created a perfect man, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through the weakness and folly of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
and Childhood: For in regard his
Body was prepared for the Soul to act in at
their first meeting; he was not so liable to
be imposed upon by ill customs, and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
imaginations, because he was always ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of judging of them: And therefore
his desires and fears must be better propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the nature of things; than they
would have been if his reason had come to
him byassed and tinctured with those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
which the long weakness &amp; unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableness
of his body had made upon it.</p>
            <p>A 2d Inconvenience of our Bodies is, that
the highest condition they are capable of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at, is but of a short continuance: They
are a considerable part of our lives a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up into any tolerable degree of useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
before which time they signifie little
more to us than the Bodies of Brutes do; and
when they are once fitted for the service of
the Soul, and we begin to understand what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40272:5"/>
they are good for, it is not long before they
decline into Age and Indisposition, and that
which seem'd to be a Palace before, turns to
a Prison, and hath little either of pleasure or
convenience in it. For though our Youth is
not placed upon such a precipice as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to tumble from its highest station in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a decrepit condition; yet when life is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Hill, its motion is not so slow,
but that it may be perceived in a little time,
especially if it be pushed forward by any
accidental distemper.</p>
            <p>1. The Sences grow flat, and do not enjoy
and relish their respective objects with that
quickness and eager satisfaction which they
formerly did. But if this was all the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we were liable to, we ought possibly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to account it an advantage than a loss,
because the lessening of sensual delights
would rebate the edge of our desires, and
make them submit to the Laws of Religion
with less reluctancy. But the flower of Youth
does not only go off quickly, but which is
more to be regretted, the fruit of it too; and
the abatement of the Sences vigour, is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
followed with an apparent decay of
strength. Thus life, when it is once fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40272:6"/>
to the height, hath its spirits continually
flying off, till it is drawn to the Less, and
that part of it only remains which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
makes us uneasie both to our selves
and others: so that when the mind is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
in any design of considerable length
and advantage; it is usually set a shore upon
the other World before it hath reached its
intended port; or else forced to spend that
stock of time and abilities which remains, in
stopping the Leakage and piecing up the
ruins of the Vessel; which is not only a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
of the main business, but is likewise
a very troublesome employment.</p>
            <p>A 3. Inconvenience of our bodies consists
in their making us subject to passion; That
our passions, at least the violence of them, are
immediately caused by the motion of the
spirits, that is the finer parts of the Blood, will
appear, if we consider, that those who have a
greater stock of spirits supplied them from
youth or intemperance, are soonest over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
which disorders of this nature.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God made our minds subject to
the impressions of Passion upon a very good
account; that by such unusual commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
within us, we might be awakened, and as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40272:6"/>
it were roused up to pursue those things
which are useful, and avoid the contrary,
with the greater vigour and industry: For
if we had nothing but dry reason and cool
Blood to contrive and execute for us, our
apprehensions in many cases would be too
flow, and our endeavours faint: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the advantage the Passions
were design'd to give us, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
managed, they do more harm than
good: For we are apt either to place them
upon wrong Objects, to fly them to too
high a pitch, or to continue them upon us
when they ought to be discharged, which
makes us hasty in our Resolutions; injurious
and careless in our words and actions; they
make us dote almost to Frensy upon trifles,
and by being too kindly entertained by us,
improve a sudden disgust against our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
into a setled and habitual malice; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
almost are the indecencies and sins
which the ill Government of our Passions
betrays us to; they discompose the whole
frame of mind and body, disquieting the
one, and disordering the other; the effects
of them are different according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the power they have gotten over
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40272:7"/>
our reason; sometimes they make men lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and pine away with envy or desire;
sometimes through an excess of fear they
betray them into worse inconveniencies than
those they were afraid of: Some are said to
have absolutely lost their wits in their anger,
and raved themselves into <hi>Bedlam;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
we may observe are over-joyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
folly and ridiculousness.</p>
            <p>Now, though a great part of our present
vertue and future reward depends upon the
due management of our Passions; neither
can they come up to this height which I have
mentioned, without our own fault; yet in
regard our bodies are the immediate instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their violence, we must grant they
are inconvenient upon this account: For
if our reason was quick enough to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
and pursue our interest of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being spurred upon duty by Passion; if
the mind had sufficient power to command
the body upon its utmost, without being
concerned with its motions any farther than
it thought fit; our condition would be
much more perfect and secure: For if we
knew we are naturally invincible, we
need not give our selves the trouble of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40272:7"/>
upon our guard, then we should be free
from all inward tumults and the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of them; and then, as the power of
Passion declined, that of Reason would grow
up and flourish; and the pleasures of the
mind would more than counter-ballance
those which we lost by shaking off some of
our correspondence with the body; and we
might have delight equal to those of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
transport without the violence and
danger of them.</p>
            <p>4. Our bodies are inconvenient, because
they make us liable to suffer pain.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed that the state of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
does not exempt us from having
ungrateful perceptions, but in some respects
makes us more obnoxious to them if we lye
under any moral indisposition: For when
the Soul is disengaged from the oppression
and soil of the body, it will act upon it self
with greater vigour, and make the Springs
of Thought go much smarter than they do
now; so that ill men will be made much
more powerful to torment themselves; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that it may be a question whether
all the Fire, and Feinds in Hell, are a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
punishment to the wicked than the guilt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40272:8"/>
of their own Consciences; besides, the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which I have mentioned, when they are
violent, bring an easiness along with them.</p>
            <p>But then the reason why I distinguish pain
from the trouble which proceeds either from
passion, or the more abstracted and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
operations of the mind, is, because the
Soul is not only liable to this disturbance
purely upon the account of its Union with
the Body, but because it is perfectly out of
our power to prevent it. For, let a man be
never so innocent and compos'd, let Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Religion secure him never so
well against Vice and Passion; yet there is
no fence against bodily pain: This proceeds
from those motions over which the Will
hath little or no command; and when we
consider what a vast number of parts the
Body consists of, many of which are very
fine and slenderly tyed together (otherwise
they would be unserviceable) and upon this
account are easily put into disorder, when
we consider how ignorant the generality are
of the frame and constitution of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
of the due proportion, and quality of
their nourishment; how careless and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
they are often in their Labours, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40272:8"/>
and Passions, to which if we add
the sometimes sudden alterations of seasons,
&amp; many other unavoidable accidents, when
we consider all these things, I say, we have
great cause to admire and bless the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God that our bodies are not oftener
put out of order than they are. Now, though
some decays of the Body are unobserved by
us, yet generally when there is any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
jarr made in the wheels of this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Machine; when the harmony of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
is disturb'd; when the strings are
wound up too hard, or too slack; when any
thing of this nature happens, the Soul usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
hath notice of it, which unacceptable
news is that which we call pain, which is
sometimes so pungent and afflicting, that it
makes all worldly blessings insignificant to
us, insomuch that there are not many who
have experienced any accute distemper, who
would not, if it were put to their choice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
health and poverty, to violent pains and
diseases, though supported and gilded over
with never so much wealth and honour.</p>
            <p>Now if it be asked why God hath made
the Soul so deeply sensible of the injuries
which the Body receives, I suppose these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40272:9"/>
Reasons (without adding any more)
may be a sufficient satisfaction to such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>1. Therefore we may rationally conclude
that God hath made the Soul liable to impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of this nature, that we might be more
careful to preserve the body from falling into
decay. Pain I observed before was an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and grating sense of some injury which
the body suffered, now if the Soul was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
affected with alterations of this nature,
and concerned upon its own account to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the welfare of its companion; we have
reason to believe a great many bodies would
be very indifferently provided for. For the mind
would be so much taken up with its own busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that were it not admonished of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of the Body by partaking of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of them, they would be often neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
men of Covetous, Ambitious or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
minds, rather than have their designs,
and pleasures interrupted, would be apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the body its due maintenance in eating and
sleeping; if they were not importuned, and as
it were forced upon justice; by the trouble and
uneasiness of watching and abstinence, were it
not for the pain of a wound or distemper, we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40272:9"/>
should often let them run till they were incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
In this case many would serve their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as they do their houses, which because they
do not feel them smart when they decay, they
let them drop for want of timely repairing.</p>
            <p>A second reason why God made the Soul sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of bodily pain, may be, that its virtue might
have the fairer tryal. To be above the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of ill men, and to submit to any pain and
hardship, rather than depart from those Opinions
and Practices which we believe to be right and
necessary, is an argument of true greatness of
mind, and the highest testimony of a good man.
Now the Body, by laying us open to almost all
sorts of injuries we are capable of receiving,
gives us an opportunity of exercising our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Fortitude in suffering in obedience
to God's commands. To these virtues the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
and defenceless state of our Bodies
advances us; for, were we proof against all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
we should be uncapable of this honour;
for patience supposes us to lye under the sense
of a present evil; take away the affliction, and
there will be no appearance of the virtue left
behind; neither can Fortitude have any place,
except we believe our selves within the reach of
danger; for what courage can it be to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40272:10"/>
any thing, when we know it's impossible
for us to be hurt?</p>
            <p>A third Reason why God hath subjected the
Soul to bodily pain, is, for the correction of our
vices. Many sins do naturally bring indisposition
and diseases upon the Body, the dread and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of which does not seldom restrain and
bring us off from them: Besides, pain and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by convincing men how insignificant, or
rather troublesom their life is to them, &amp; what
a slender hold they have of it, are oftentimes a
good expedient, not only for the reclaiming
those vices which depend upon the ill use of the
Body, but of a general Reformation: For, did
mens Bodies fret out like their cloaths, without
any considerable trouble to those that wore
them, we have reason to believe the Soul would
fare much the worse for it, and be oftener sent
into the other World in an unprovided and
forlorn condition.</p>
            <p>So that without question, we are as much
bound to thank God for the infirmities, and
pains which flow from our constitution, as for
the health and pleasure of it. Besides, we have
reason to account it a great mercy that God hath
bound the Soul so gently to the Body, that a
short struggle, if it happens to prove boisterous,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40272:10"/>
will let it loose; so that according to <hi>Epicurus</hi>
his Maxim, it's impossible for that pain which is
violent to continue long, whereas, had the Union
of the Soul and Body been so strong, that a
man might have continued under the sharpest
torments for some months or years together,
how difficult would patience have been then?
what an advantage would the worst men have
had over the best, and have been able by their
cruelty to have almost tyred out the bravest and
most resolute virtue.</p>
            <p>5. The present constitution of our Bodies is
inconvenient, because it hinders the mind in her
pursuit after knowledge. Knowledge next to
goodness is the highest exaltation of humane
nature, and sets us at the greatest distance from
the Brutes beneath us: Now that the present
condition of our Bodies does hinder our profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
in this so excellent an accomplishment,
appears from what has been said already.
As</p>
            <p>1. Because we are born Infants, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is unfit for the Soul to exercise its functions
in; in which state of our infancy we pass a
great many wrong judgments upon things, so
that when we come to the use of our reason, we
are not only void of true knowledge, but have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40272:11"/>
a great many things to unlearn; which mistakes
it's very difficult to shake off. Now though these
prejudices relate chiefly to our proficiency in
the knowledge of natural causes, yet it must be
aknowledged in the</p>
            <p>Second place; That the passions which the
Body subjects us to, are sometimes an occasion
that we do not examine things with that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and indifferency which is necessary to the
finding<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> out moral Truth; and consequently
make us inclinable to some practical Opinions
rather than others: For according as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Byasse of our Bodies disposes us to any
excess of hope or fear, of anger or pleasure;
if we are not careful, our apprehensions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
will bend into a compliance with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and Tendency of these passions. For when
Reason is either bribed, or discomposed by the
Affections, it is than more likely to pronounce
amiss upon things, than when the mind is even
and impartial: For example, a man of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
and gloomy temper, if he gives way
to it, will be in some danger of perplexing his
imagination with infinite and unreasonable
fears concerning God Almighty, as if he was a
Humoursom or implacable Being; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
such a person may be more easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40272:11"/>
to the Doctrines of Superstition, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair:
Whereas another of a bolder and more
sanguine Constitution, will be rather tempted
to presume too much upon Gods goodness, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
his mercy to the prejudice of his wisdom
and justice: And if he happens to fall upon ill
Books or Company, he will be dispos'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
his Creed with Principles of Libertinism,
that so he may make it more agreeable to the
Complexion of his Body, and reconcile it with
the use of unlawful pleasures: But here we must
observe that these motives do but incline; they
by no means force us upon mistakes; so that
then when we are swayed by them, it is our own
fault: The reason why I mentioned them, is,
that we might take the greater care to enquire
into the particular defects, and propensities of
our temper; and form our judgment with a
suitable caution and suspition of our selves.</p>
            <p>3. Bodily pain is likewise no small impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the enlarging our understandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
while it continues upon us, it takes off our
thoughts from other things, and fixes them only
upon that which troubles us: And oftentimes
when it is over, it leaves such ill effects behind
it by altering the Texture of the Brain or Blood;
that the mind hath not fit instruments to assist
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40272:12"/>
it in the work of close and constant Meditation.</p>
            <p>4. The generality are forced to spend a
great part of their time in providing for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of life, so that they have little leisure to
attend to the improvement of their minds: But
let them not be discouraged upon this account
if they take care to live well in this World; their
utmost curiosity and thirst after knowledge shall
be satisfied in the next; without being encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
with that labour and difficulty which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
very inconsiderable Attainments here.
Then as the Apostle informs us, <hi>We shall know
even as we are known, and see God as he is, in whom
all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge are hid.</hi>
1 Cor. 13. Joh. 1. 3. To what hath been said
upon this Argument if we add that considerable
number of hours which those who are most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
of their time are obliged to spend in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
sleeping and recreation; we shall see that
he had great reason for his Opinion, who hath
told us, that Art is long, and Life but short.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding these inconveniencies
with which our bodys are attended in this state of
imperfection, we are not to complain as if God
had dealt hardly with us; because they are not
just such as we could desire them; let us rather
consider that if the conveniencies of them were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40272:12"/>
much less than they are, it was more than God
owes us; besides, how impatient soever men
may sometimes be under extremity of pain,
yet their general behaviour is a plain argument
that they have no contemptible Opinion of
their Bodies, for they are commonly loath to
leave them when they are at their worst condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Let us therefore be thankful that God hath
made them so commodious for us now, and
hath promised to improve them to the utmost
of our wishes afterwards; which brings me to
the second thing at first propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> to
shew.</p>
            <p>That the Qualities of Glorified Bodies are
opposed to those defects, and free from those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
we are now sensible of.</p>
            <p>1. They will be very much refined, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
fitter for the Soul to act with. <hi>It shall
be raised a spiritual body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 44. which
implies that it shall be changed into an exalted
and vigorous condition: All grossness and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culency
which adheres to it now, shall be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off; all unevenness and roughness of parts
will then be filed into an exact serviceableness,
and the Soul will no longer labour under the
disorders of an unweildy and incompliant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
The Body will then be exactly at its
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40272:13"/>
beck, and execute all its commands with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and dispatch. That Quality which we call
Heaviness, which hinders our motion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
us to the lower part of the World, will then
no more molest us; for the Refined Body by
its nearer resemblance to the Air about it, the
improved Activity of its Spirits, and the greater
force the Soul will in all probability have to set
them a work. By these advantages we shall be
enabled to meet the Lord in the Air, and fly up
into the Regions of light and happiness; and
that the Soul may be the better accommodated,
the Sences will be improved in two respects
beyond what they are now.</p>
            <p>1. They will be larger, that is, able to take
in more objects at a time, and reach them at a
father distance than they can now.</p>
            <p>2. They will be quicker, that is, whatever
notices they convey to the Mind, will be more
intimately and vigorously communicated to it:
Upon which two accounts they must afford the
Soul a much greater pleasure than they do now.
And that the Sences will be thus improved, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
from a principle, which every one that
owns the Resurrection must grant, namely,
that Glorified Bodies will be endued with far
greater Activity than they are at their highest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40272:13"/>
condition here; now we know men have a
more full and delightful use of their sences in
their youth than at any other time.</p>
            <p>Now of all the sences, those of Seeing and
Hearing are not only the most instructive to
the mind, but likewise the most refined, and as
I may say, the most creditable sences: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need not question but they will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the Bodies of the Saints to Heaven and
possibly that of Smelling too; but as for the
two other grosser sences, they belong to a State
of imperfection, and are too coarse and insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
to have much employment there; for
ought we know they may be changed into two
new ones of a more spiritualized and refined
nature; which it is not possible for us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
or conceive till we are possessed of them;
which we shall cease to wonder at if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that were a man born Deaf or Blind it
would be impossible for him to have the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
notion of sound or colour: Nay, I may
add, he could have no imaginable Idea of these
qualities except he received some description
of them from others.</p>
            <p>2. And as the Bodies of the Saints will be
defective or superfluous in nothing, but be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fitted for the service of the Soul, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40272:14"/>
they will be much more splendid &amp; grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than now they are; which is another property
of the Image of the Heavenly: Instead of those
obscure and unamiable qualities they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in here, they will be decked with light as
with a garment, and be cloathed with Majesty
and Honour; they will then be all beauty and
brightness without any disfiguring blemish,
any scars remaining, except of those wounds
they have received in their Masters cause, which
then probably will shine out with a more ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and distinguishable lustre. This is indeed
to bear the Image of the Heavenly, of which
we are assured from more places than the
Text. As <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21. the Apostle affirms, <hi>Our
Saviour shall change our vile Bodies, that they may
be like his glorious Body,</hi> a representation of which
we have at his Transfiguration, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
but a faint one, and yet the Evangelists
tell us, <hi>his face shone like the Sun, and his Raiment
with the Reflection was white and glistering.</hi> Mat. 17.
Luk. 9.</p>
            <p>3. The Bodies of the Saints will be impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
They will then be fortified against all
accidents and diseases, and be no longer subject
to any painful or dishonourable alterations;
Time and death will have no power over them.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40272:14"/>
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> after he hath described the general
Resurrection, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. in the 21 <hi>chap. v.</hi> 4.
proceeds to mention the unchangeable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Heavenly Inhabitants, where enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their privative advantages, he informs
us, that there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
more pain; for the former things are passed
away; that is, the states of imperfection and
mortality is over, Whereas, did not all things
stand at a stay; were not the perfections of
the Body permanent and unalterable, secured
against all injury and decay; if there was not
pain, we may be sure there would be sorrow to
lose the least part of so glorious a condition.
Now which way our Bodies shall be made
immortal, signifies not much to know; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
they may have such an advantageous
change from the Laws of Motion, from the
Figure of their parts, or the temperature of
the Climate, as may preserve them from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any alteration, or loss of parts; or if
the parts do fly off as they do now, it's easie
with God to supply them with new ones im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
made fit, without the trouble of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or concoction: But whether by any of
these ways, or which of them they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40272:15"/>
immortal, whether by the settled course
of Providence, or by Miracle, is neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
to dispute, nor possible to determine; that
they will continue so, we are sure, for as with
him that hath made this Promise, nothing is
impossible, so likewise he is Faithful and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny himself. It is more proper for us to
prepare our selves by a vertuous Life for so
blessed an immortality, than vainly to enquire
into the mystery of it: The best way of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
our curiosity is to endeavour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worthy to obtain that World, and the
Resurrection from the dead; for we need not
doubt but that those who are possessed of this
priviledge will understand the causes which
make it such; and that the goodness of God
will enable the Saints to explain the Philosophy
of their happiness.</p>
            <p>Now from what we experience here, we
may in some measure conceive how considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an addition it will be to our happiness to
have our Earthy part refined into such a state of
perfection as I have been describing: To have
the wisdom and experience of Age without
the sickness and uneasiness attending it; and
the sprightlyness and vigour of youth separated
from its usual rashness and indiscretion. What a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40272:15"/>
glorious change must it be to have these inob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious,
and cadaverous Bodies possessed of
the three only desirable qualities; being
made to the height of our wishes suitable, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious,
and immortal?</p>
            <p>I shall now in the</p>
            <p>Third place proceed to draw some inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the consideration of the different state
of our Bodies here, and hereafter.</p>
            <p>Therefore the consideration of the frail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our Bodies here, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they will be advanced to hereafter, ought
to make us entertain a low opinion of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of sence; both because we are permitted
but a short enjoyment of them, and because
they are only fit for us while we are in a state
of imperfection: We should consider that the
Body is not able to provide for it self; it's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are not of it's own growth, but must be
supplied from Forreign Parts, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are infallible marks of our want and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
and therefore to have a strong desire for,
or high Opinion of these things, does but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
our own weakness to be the greater; and
that we preposterously value our selves upon
the Poverty of our condition: What are these
satisfactions but only short respits from bodily
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40272:16"/>
pain and trouble? for after the uneasiness of
hunger and thirst is over, the pleasure of eating
and drinking immediately ceases; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the action any longer is more a burthen,
than a refreshment: Those therefore who are
capable of the greatest bodily pleasure, must
have the strongest sence of want and uneasiness
upon them; for unless they are thus prepared,
it will be flat and unaffecting to them.</p>
            <p>Now who would desire a Fever only for
the satisfacton of drinking in it; or be in love
with extreme poverty because of the unusual
pleasure which is then taken in receiving the
Charity of others?</p>
            <p>The Body therefore is only so far to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
as is necessary to put it into the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be employed by the Soul; for as it
should not be tyrannized over, that being the
way to make it both troublesom and unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable;
so on the other side, we should be
careful to maintain the Soveraignty of the
mind; that whenever Reason and Religion
requires it, we may have power to controul our
sences, and be pleased with the victory: But
on the contrary, to make the Soul a Slave to the
Body; to employ the powers of Reason (the
Image of the Glorious God) in providing for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40272:16"/>
the gratification of the Animal Life; is a most
degenerous and dangerous abuse of so great a
priviledge: And when God hath made us little
lower than the Angels, ought we not to blush
to make our selves less than the Beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish?
Now that sensuality does degrade us in
this manner is apparent, it being unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
more scandalous and uncreditable to abuse
the use of Reason, than to want it; for the
one only argues natural incapacity; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it could not be prevented, is no just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to any Being; but the other besides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
to the Doner implies most egregious
folly; for what can be more senceless than to
be inapprehensive of the Prerogative of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to misapply and squander away the
fairest opportunities of being happy?</p>
            <p>A man that makes himself a Beggar by ill
Menage, and Luxury, is in the true estimation
of things a much more despicable person than
he that is born to that low condition, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it by those impotencies and defects of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or mind which were irresistably forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. The rational Brute therefore is most
certainly the meanest, because he stupidly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues
the dignity of his Being, and employs
the highest qualities in the most sordid drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40272:17"/>
Whereas other creatures act according to
the Instincts and Appetities which Providence
hath put into them, it being as impossible for
them to rise above their natures, as it is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for us to sink below ours. But this
practice is not only dishonourable but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
for if we give our selves up to the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Appetite, and make our Bodies instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in sinning; besides the diseases which
intemperance often exposes them to here, we
shall find the sad consequence of it in the other
World; where they will be joined to the Soul
only to encrease its misery by putting it into a
new capacity of suffering. For the Apostle as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us, if we live after the Flesh, and make
Provision to fulfil the Lusts thereof, we shall
die, for to be carnally or sensually minded is
death, and that we cannot expect to live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
except we mortify the deeds of the Body,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6, 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ought to be contented with
the trouble, the present infirmities of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may put us to.</p>
            <p>God hath made our Bodies of a frail Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and liable to many inconveniencies;
that we might aspire after a higher and more
confirmed happiness; and not place it in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40272:17"/>
satisfaction of our sences, which are so easily
made unacceptable to us by diseases, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stupified and worn out with Age. Besides,
upon the account that our Bodies make us
liable to pain and diseases, we have thereby an
occasion of exercising many virtues, which
otherwise we could not have: If we were
not liable to pain and uneasiness, there could
be no such thing as a contented Poverty; and
an humble Resignation to providence in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and distress; the essence of these virtues
would be lost in such impregnable circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
For to be contented when a man neither
feels, nor fears any evil, is not so much a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
as a necessary action; it being
as impossible to be troubled when we have
what we have a mind to, as to be perfectly
pleased when we have not: I confess to
be thus fortified against injury and want, argues
a great happiness of nature, but a moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
it is not; and consequently deserves
admiration, but not reward. The Honour
of our Christian warfare consists in the labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and hazard of it, and the strength of
our virtue lies in the weakness of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and though we are made a little lower
than the Angels, yet (with all respect be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40272:18"/>
to those superiour Beings) upon this
account we seem to have some advantage
of them; for their station being above the
reach of misfortune, makes them incapable
of suffering upon the score of Virtue and
Religion. We ought not therefore to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
because God hath made our Bodies
liable to many inconveniencies here; but to
resist the temptations they expose us to, with
resolution to bear the pains and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of them, with submission and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
considering that in a discreet and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
management of these things, a great
part of our obedience, and future reward
consists: It is not long before we shall be
dismist from this service, and when death
shall be swallowed up in Victory, and this
mortal shall put on immortality, then it will
be a pleasure to survey the difficulties of our
past life, and the very thoughts of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
troubles will be an addition to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <q>Haec olim meminisse juvabit.</q>
            <p>And therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ought not to be over-time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
lest we should impair the strength of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40272:18"/>
our Constitution, but lay it out freely upon
Religious and Worthy Actions.</p>
            <p>Health is not chiefly to be desired for the
sensual pleasure it affords, but because we are
then in the best condition to serve God, and
to be useful to the society we live in: Let it
not therefore be our great aim to keep our
Bodies in Reparation, and ingloriously slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
out our time for fear of wearing them
out too fast; but according to our several
Stations and Callings, let us diligently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them for our own real interest, and that
of others; making them contribute to the
improvement of Reason, and the exercise of
Virtue: If they decay in such service, they
will fall with honour, and rise with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
The best way of consulting their future
advancement is, not to dote upon them now:
If we would have them flourish in immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
youth, and beauty hereafter, we must
neither be too fond in indulging, nor too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in adorning of them: We must not
out of an effeminate niceness to preserve their
agreeableness, decline any proper austerities,
or opportunity of doing good. In short, if
we expect these earthy Bodies should bear the
Image of the Heavenly, we must employ
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40272:19"/>
them generously and religiously; suffer the
inconveniencies of them with Patience and
Christian Courage, and please them with
temperance and reservedness.</p>
