         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to Two Objections AGAINST <hi>A BILL depending in the Honourable Houſe of Lords, For Reſtraining</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>WRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT SILKS,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. If this Bill Paſs, it will not give preſent Relief to the Poor that are out of Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will give preſent Relief, as it will increaſe the <hi>Maſter-Weavers</hi> Credit. As Matters now ſtand, thoſe Merchants and Yarn-makers we deal with, foreſeeing we are like to be undone by the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade, refuſe to give us Credit, and many of them tell us plainly, they will not truſt us, unleſs this Bill Paſs. The <hi>Mercers,</hi> and others we ſell our Goods to, tell us, if this Bill do not paſs into a Law, they muſt leave Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, and turn their Stocks into the <hi>India</hi> Trade; becauſe the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> ask for, and Buy little but <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Commodities. If this Bill Paſs, the Retailers will preſently Buy of us, and not <hi>India</hi> Goods, leſt any of them ſhould be left upon their Hands, when the time comes they are Prohibited ſelling them. If this Bill Paſs, it will Incourage the <hi>Maſter-Weavers,</hi> to employ the Poor, who offer us to Work, allowing us the Diſcount of Bank Bills, by which means we ſhall be able to have Money to pay them; the <hi>Maſter-Weavers</hi> will be able to go on to employ the Poor, in hopes of a Trade theſe Incouragements. If this Bill do not Paſs, the Maſter-Weavers will be Dejected and Diſcouraged, and under ſad Apprehenſions muſt turn out more of their Poor, and employ their Stock ſome other ways, for the Support of themſelves and Families, to the greater Damage of the Nation, and further Calamity of the Poor.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>If this Bill paſs, we ſhall get no</hi> Salt-Petre <hi>from</hi> India.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot go to the Great <hi>Mogull</hi> preſently, to get a Licenſe from him, to give us Liberty to Buy <hi>Salt-Petre;</hi> but we believe there is as great Reaſon, that we may have <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> for our Money, as that we may have <hi>Muſlins, Callicoes, Raw Silk, Floretta Yarn, Pepper, Fanns,</hi> or any other of their Commodities. The Great <hi>Mogull,</hi> never forbad or hindred the <hi>French</hi> from having <hi>Salt-Petre</hi> for their Money, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>French</hi> King's Decree to hinder the Selling their Goods in his Country, which Decree yet ſtands in full Force, and is binding upon the Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> and not Reverſed or Diſpenſed withal. Or is it the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Trading Nations to refuſe to take Money for their Produce,(unleſs for their unwrought Commodities for Manufacturies) will not all the other Manufactories and Commodities that we buy for Ready Money and Conſume in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>India,</hi> be a Conſideration ſufficient for Salt Peter, which to them is of little value; but why may not our Merchants bring theſe Silks as well as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or any others? Shall we not have as many Markets for <hi>India Silks</hi> as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and more, and ſhall we not ſtand upon equal ground with them for <hi>Salt Peter;</hi> does not the great <hi>Mogul</hi> deſire our Money, and want our <hi>Lead,</hi> as much as we his <hi>Salt Peter;</hi> but is this the manner of other Nations? The <hi>Venetians</hi> prohibit our Cloth, but do we refuſe to ſell them <hi>Tyn</hi> or <hi>Lead.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> refuſe to buy our Dyed Woollen Manufactures, but do we refuſe to ſell them our mixt or white Woollen Manufactures; we prohibit the <hi>Dutch Ribonds</hi> and <hi>Buttons,</hi> but do they refuſe to Sell us their <hi>Linnens</hi> and <hi>Velvets?</hi> But any thing will ſerve for an Argument to hinder a Bill that deſigns only the Regulating the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; and it is an Amazement to us to read a Paper, Entituled, <hi>Proofs offered upon Oath, by Perſons concerned, against the Bill for Prohibiting</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Silks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Such as follows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Value of One Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in Woollen Manufactures have been actually Exported to <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in <hi>Holland</hi> there are many more Loomes going then in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is no ſuch Edict in <hi>France</hi> as is pretended, or it is diſpenſed withal, or ſome new Edict hath been ſince Emitted.</p>
            <p>That it is not theſe <hi>India</hi> Goods which is the decay of the Weaving Trade.</p>
            <p>That at this preſent time <hi>Norwich</hi> begins to have a brisk Trade, and their Goods are Riſen 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and in great Demand.</p>
            <p>That though <hi>Mercers</hi> beſpeak Goods of the Weavers, the Weavers will not make them.</p>
            <p>That it is only the Silk-Weavers that are concerned in this Matter, and not the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers.</p>
            <p>That the Weavers concerned in this Affair, are nothing ſo Numerous as is pretended.</p>
            <p>That the Poverty and Miſery among the Weavers is very much miſrepreſented.</p>
            <p>That if <hi>East-India</hi> Silks are Prohibited, and not other foreign Silks, we ſhall only wear the latter in the room of the former.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>Notorious</hi> Fallacies, uncertain Conſequences, and direct Falſhoods, as theſe are, Thoſe that Aſſert them muſt either be very Ignorant, or ſcarce fit for Humane Society; and none would offer to prove them upon Oath, unleſs they be ſuch as their Learned Councel was pleaſed to call <hi>Journey-men Swearers.</hi>
