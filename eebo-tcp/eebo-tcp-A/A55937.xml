            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Proceedings at the Aſſizes in <hi>SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THWARK,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe moſt ſad and remarkable Tryal at this Aſſizes, was that of a Woman dwelling lately in <hi>Fiſhmongers-ally</hi> in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark;</hi> ſhe was indicted, that not having the fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her eyes, but moved by the inſtigation of the Devil, on the 25 day of <hi>September</hi> laſt, wickedly, traiterouſly, and of her malice fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, with a pair of Sizzars which ſhe held in her right hand, ſhe had killed and murdered her Husband, giving unto him one mortal wound on the left ſide of his Breaſt near the left Pap, of the breadth of half an Inch, and the depth of 3 Inches, of which he immediately died.</p>
            <p>The Caſe appeared to be thus, as well by the Evidence, as by her own voluntary confeſſion at the Bar. This woman and her Husband had been together at the Ale houſe; and ſhe now alleadged, that though ſhe drank not above a pint and a half, yet ſhe was light-headed. Some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58456:3"/>
diſpute aroſe between them there concerning a ſilver Seal, and a Grater, and ſome other toys which he had taken from her, and refuſing to return them, ſaid, he would give them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woman: When they came home ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them again, and ſaid ſhe would go look above ſtairs where he had hid them; hereupon a Quarrel begun, and he was ſeen by ſome of the oppoſite Neighbours to ſtrike her with a Fire ſhovel, inſomuch that ſhe pretends he knockt her down, and that ſhe lay in a trance: From which being recovered, ſhe got up theſe Sizzars intending to go to work with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her cuſtome at the Ally-gate till his fury were over; but he catching up a Frying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan to beat her again, ſhe held them forth to keep him off, who was ſo violent, that, having his Boſom all open to the skin, he run upon them, and thereby got this miſchief; which ſhe no ſooner perceived, but ſhe endeavoured when ſhe ſaw him fall to give him ſome Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups; but finding him ready to die, was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and went forth, leaving him lying on the Stairs, going into <hi>White-chappel,</hi> where ſhe declared that ſhe had unfortunately killed her Husband: ſhe now proteſted very paſſionately her innocence as to any intention of murdering him; but that he died by her means, freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. 'Twas proved by ſeveral that ſhe had often threatned to do his buſineſs; and one ſwore that ſhe once heard the Priſoner ſay ſhe would poiſon him. A young Maiden ſtept
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58456:3"/>
into the houſe after the miſchief done, and ſeeing the man lie on the Stairs, asked the now Priſoner if her Husband were in a Swoon; to which ſhe replied ſurlily, bidding her meddle with her own buſineſs, and forthwith went out; but the Girl telling Neighbours, ſome of them entred, and found the man juſt a dying, being onely ſeen to ſtir one hand. Whereupon ſoon after the Priſoner was taken, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as you have heard. Upon conſideration of all circumſtances the Jury found her guilty of the Petty-Treaſon; for which ſhe received Sentence to be Burnt to death.</p>
            <p>The next we ſhall mention, were two High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men: One of them diſgracing his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Profeſſion with thoſe wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practiſes of villany and miſchief. For on the 10th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, he and one of his Companions being off of <hi>Putney,</hi> ſet upon a Gentleman, threatning his life if he did not ſpeedily deliver: whereupon he deliver'd them Twenty pound; beſides which they took from him a Rapier, but did not ſearch him, for he had more money about him which he ſaved: however, they cut his horſe bridle and turn'd him looſe. As ſoon as they were gone, he got to a houſe and rais'd the Hue and Cry; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were taken before they got to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for their horſes were poor ſorry Hackneys: ſo that at laſt they be took themſelves to their own heels, and fired Piſtols without execution. One of them, to prevent their being purſued,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58456:4"/>
flung down the money; but the Country being up, took them notwithſtanding: and upon full evidence, being now Convicted, they received Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>There was a perſon arraigned upon two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Indictments for ſtealing a bay Guelding from one man, and a cheſnut Mare from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He had lately been married, and went down into the Country pretending to fetch money; but inſtead thereof, brought up theſe Horſes, and got his Brother-in-law to vouch them in <hi>Smithfield:</hi> but they being ſoon after found, and he diſcovered, he offered to pay Eighteen pounds for them; a new trick of a Jocky to ſteal horſes firſt, and enquire the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces afterwards. Upon ſuch pregnant Evidence he was found guilty and received Sentence.</p>
            <p>A fellow was found guilty of Felony, for ſtealing Five pounds in money, two Shirts, and other things, from one that had lately been his Maſter. He was ſoon taken, and part of the things with him, and now was burnt in the hand.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> there were Four tried upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments for Murder; but none found guilty. One, a wench for killing her Baſtard-childe at <hi>Horſlydown;</hi> it was proved ſhe had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and was heard to groan and make a great noiſe in the night; but her Miſtriſs think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it common ſickneſs, took no notice of it. Upon the whole ſhe was acquitted. So was a Waterman for killing a young man of the ſame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58456:4"/>
Trade, who quarrelling with him about money for a Fare, he did ſtrike him one box on the Ear, and gave him one kick, but as 'twas prov'd not violently; yet ſo fatally, that the fellow ſickned and ſhortly after died. However, no murderous intention appearing, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd. The third was a Bayliffs follower, who going to arreſt one, and a ſcuffle ariſing, to ſecure their priſoner they uſed ſome blows, and with much ado carried him to Jayl, where ſoon after he died; upon which he was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but found not guilty. The fourth was a man for the ſuppoſed Murder of a childe of Nine years of age, his wives ſon: She having been abroad, at her reutrn found the childe ill and bloody, but it did not complain the Father had hurt it, nor would tell bow it came; but growing worſe and worſe, died the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Grandfather and Grandmother willing to know how it came by its End, bound the Father over; but no Witneſs appearing of his ſtriking or injuring the Lad, there was no colour for the Indictment.</p>
            <p>A young wench was found guilty for robbing her Maſter twice; once of 6 <hi>s.</hi> and afterwards getting his Breeches and her Miſtriſs's Petticoat off their Bed, and taking the Keys of his Counting-houſe, carried away ſome ſmall parcel of money, a Diamond ring, a plain Ring, a piece of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58456:5"/>
Gold given by his Majeſty for curing the Evil, and other things of value; but was ſoon taken, and now Convicted.</p>
            <p>A fellow having ſnatcht away a Sword from one in <hi>Southwark-</hi>Fair, partly in jeſt and more in earneſt, was now found guilty of ſtealing it: And ſince he was ſo fond of a Sword, may have occaſion ſhortly to uſe one, being ordered for Tranſportation.</p>
            <p>Several other petty Tryals we omit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There were in all Four Condemned to die; that is, Two Highway-men and One Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealer to be Hang'd, and One woman to be Burnt; Seven burnt in the hand, Seven to be tranſported, and five to be whipt.</hi>
