            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FInding, that in our Modern Controverſies with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which are Printed, and in Diſcourſes with thoſe of that Communion, they make their Retreat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upon all Accounts to the Churches Authority; either as a Point that may be moſt Colourably defended, or which lazy and weak Heads moſt readily take up with, I was induced to examin it.</p>
            <p>Safety and Certainty are things very valuable, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they carry a delightfull correſpondency to our Minds, but alſo for the reſpect they have to the Time before us, which in Prudence we muſt provide for; no Condition being ſo uneaſy and diſgracefull, as when a Man comes to proclaim his own Folly by ſaying, Who thought of this?</p>
            <p>Such as our Intereſt at ſtake is, ſuch ought our Care to be, that we may not be impoſed upon by Pretences. It argues a degenerous Mind, that reſts it ſelf upon that which comes next hand. But not to inlarge this Preface, I will only ſay a very few Things concerning Faith, for which Church-Authority is pretended as a Ground.</p>
            <p>Faith is often in Scripture put to ſignify Religion; and in that Senſe it implies, not only thoſe Things which a Chriſtian muſt know and believe, but alſo the applying the Mind to them in all Obedience and Humility, not excluding the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Grace which ſubdues the perverſneſs of our Wills; and thus, with a particular Propriety, it may be ſtyled the Gift of God. But in this following Diſcourſe, as ſometimes in Scripture, Faith more eſpecially means, that Act or Operation of the Mind whereby it imbraces thoſe, Things which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Propoſed to it. And as Truth is more or leſs appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo the Mind is more or leſs firmly united to it. Not that the Object of our Faith has in it any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty, but
<pb facs="tcp:62724:3"/>
that our Prejudices and Paſſions, our Intereſts and Pleaſures, by which our Wills are warped and made ſtubborn, hinder the Mind from apprehen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Truth. Theſe falſe Biaſſes too often <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nfound our Reaſon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and miſguide our Minds: And he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce it comes to paſs, as the Scripture obſerves, that Faith in ſome is Weak, in all capable of Increaſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis manifeſt, the Mind may diſcern Truth ſo, as to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it; but ſtill a Corrupt Will may as it were unhinge the Judgment, and make its adherence leſs firm. This was well enough obſerved by him that lately wrote the Hiſtory of <note place="margin">Sect. 40. pag. 38. Printed at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </note>the Life of Chriſt, That Faith which ſprings from the Evidence of Senſe, or from clear Demonſtration, muſt needs be of ſmall Eſteem and Reward with God. St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was Checked for not believing without it; and the Parable tells us, if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets could not Convince, neither would they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded though one roſe from the Dead. Now if the Churches Authority be that which our Faith may reſolve into; the Aſſent of the Mind would in all Points be equally Firm and Clear; and ſo Faith would be Equal in all, annd capable of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in none.</p>
            <p>Plain it is, that the deſign of Religion is to bring Men to a right apprehenſion and belief of God; and to ingage them to a holy and vertuous Life, in conformity to ſuch an Idea of that pure and perfect Being. He that has not a Mind ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, will never be influenced by an Infallible Guide; and he that has an humble Mind, and teachable Spirit will need none. However, I am ſure, he that will not be ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one, muſt go farther than <hi>Rome</hi> to find him. But this grows too faſt for a Preface; therefore I will only tell you, that I have purpoſely avoided a multitude of Citations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have more or leſs Authority as People pleaſe; but I have proceeded by the weights and moments of Reaſon, which are equally valuable to all.</p>

            <head>A SHORT DISCOURSE Concerning the Churches Authority IN MATTERS of FAITH.</head>
            <p>IT is a fundamental Maxim, and of unqueſtionable Authority in Nature, That Truth is always and every where one and the ſame. So that among the various Opinions in the World, but one of them can be right. Upon which account, Schiſm, with its ill Conſequences, is on all ſides much lamented, whileſt every body thinks he has the Truth, and Peace, and Unity, in pretence at leaſt, much deſired. But the miſery is, all would have them upon their own terms, and that fruſtrates their deſires.</p>
            <p>Controverſies therefore ſtill depending, and the Points under debate being of ſuch importance, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62724:4"/>
the Party which affirms them, makes the believing them to be a neceſſary Condition of Catholick-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and damns them that refuſe them; while the Party that denies ſays, they run a manifeſt hazard that imbrace them: It cannot be thought unfit for any Man to inquire after a method, which may bring theſe Diſputes to an iſſue, or that may keep in Peace and Quietneſs the Minds and Conſciences of Chriſtians, while Pride, Intereſt, or Prejudice, ſhall keep open the Breach, or maintain the Quarrel.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more Natural and Congenial to Mankind than Truth; and the deſire of it is implanted in the hearts of all Men; an impartial ſearch after it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is what all Men are bound to. And as Salvation is the End in Common aimed at by all, ſo, it highly concerns-every Chriſtian to examin the way by which he goes toward that End; and he ought to inquire the more Cautiouſly and Diligently, for that the ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for attaining Salvation are Many and Different: And thoſe that go one Way, will hardly allow Safety to them that take another. And this at preſent is the Caſe between the Papiſts and the Proteſtants, which invite Men to each others Communion, as ſafer and better for attaining Eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Every Man has a Soul to be ſaved; and what muſt be done to inherit Eternal Life, is an Enquiry every one in the World ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, I hope, moſt Chriſtians do, make for themſelves.</p>
            <p>For ſince our firſt Parents, by their Diſobedience, incurred Death to themſelves, and their Poſterity, Salvation is what by Nature we could neither Claim nor Expect. But, that the Devil might not triumph in an abſolute Conqueſt over ſo glorious a part of the Creation as Mankind, God, of his infinite Mercy, was pleaſed to enter into a Second Covenant with Men, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62724:4"/>
order to their Salvation; but this upon Condition of Faith and Repentance on our parts, to anſwer the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation propoſed and offered on his.</p>
            <p>Now this Covenant, being an Act of meer Grace, iſſuing purely from the good Pleaſure of God; it is very plain, Mankind can know no more of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor of the Conditions of it, than God himſelf has been pleaſed to Reveal and Diſcover. So that all Queſtions and Diſputes, about our Common Salvation, muſt be brought to this one as the Standard of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be the Will of God, or rather, Whether God has Diſcovered it to be his Will. For though the Will of God be the Fountain of all Duty and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it cannot be a binding Law to any body, till it be made known to him, or ſufficient means given for him to know it.</p>
            <p>That God can make his Will known to any Man, is too certain to be doubted; but that his Will ſhould be known, before he has diſcovered it, can never be pretended. And becauſe every Man, conſidered as a Creature, and more eſpecially every Chriſtian, is bound to obey the Will of God; therefore every Man is bound to inform himſelf of ſo much as God has made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known for his Salvation. I have added this, to ſhew that Implicit Faith is a dangerous bottom for any body to reſt upon: For to believe as another believes, unleſs a Man knows what it is he believes, and upon what account, is very abſurd, as may be made out anon.</p>
            <p>So much of the Will of God, as may be diſcovered by the Light of Nature, is beſides my preſent Buſineſs; becauſe there is little difference among us about it. But that part of the Will of God, which we are bound to know, and adhere to, as we are Chriſtians, by Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of Mankind, as being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62724:5"/>
in Covenant with God, is the Subject of this enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Now this part of the Will of God, is either revealed to the Mind of every individual Chriſtian, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and immediate Inſpiration from God, or it was made known to ſome particular ſelect Perſons, who were to inſtruct the reſt. The firſt of theſe ways is not pretended, or allowed, either by Proteſtants or Papiſts; but the ſecond is, <hi>viz.</hi> That God did Diſcover his Will to ſome that they might Publiſh it to the reſt. And thus far I take it to be agreed betwixt us.</p>
            <p>Before we advance another ſtep, we will lay it down <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note>as a Ground, That no Man knows the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mind of a Man, ſave the Spirit of a Man that is in him: No Man can know the Mind of another farther than it is Diſcovered to him. And by Conſequence, no Man can know Revelations from God, made to the Mind and Underſtanding of another, but by one of theſe two ways; in the firſt place, either God, by Inſpiration, muſt aſſure him that he has made ſuch Revelations to the other: As when God ſent St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his Converſion to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to be inſtructed by <hi>Ananias,</hi> which was an extraordinary Caſe, not fit to be drawn into Precedent; and ſo neither pretended to, nor to be expected, ſince ſtances of it hitherto are ſo rare. Or, in the ſecond place, he, to whom the Revelation is made, muſt bring ſuch Teſtimony and Evidence, as may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men that it is really Divine. His bare word for it, will not be a Competent Proof: Nor will the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of other Men ſatisfie the Minds of reaſonable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers in this Caſe; for thoſe others muſt have ſome to Witneſs for them too, and ſo on without End. Which plainly evinces, that this is not a Baſis for Faith to reſt upon. Let us ſee then what will do, for we cannot forget what our Saviour confeſſes of himſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62724:5"/>
to the Jews, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 5. 31.</note>That if he bear Witneſs of himſelf, his Witneſs is not true; that is, it is not of force to Convince. But then he tells the Jews, <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 14. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>They ought to Believe him for his Works ſake; and accordingly he appealed to his Hearers. That the Works which he did in his Fathers Name bore Witneſs of him. <note n="*" place="margin">Poſt. monſtra tot perdon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the Miracles which he wrought among them were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove his Authority to be Divine, and his Doctrin to be from God. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> freely confeſſed as much, when he owned him a Teacher come from God; becauſe no Man could do the Miracles which he did; except God were with him. And as our Saviour did demonſtrate his Divinity by his Works; ſo, when he ſent his Apoſtles to publiſh his Doctrin to the World, he ſealed their Commiſſion, by giving them a Power to work Miracles, which might convince their Hearers of its Truth. <hi>And they</hi> (the Apoſtles) <hi>went</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 16. 20.</note>
               <hi>forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the Word with Signs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</hi> So that it is not to be doubted, but that the Doctrine which the Apoſtles preached was Divine; and the Miracles which they wrought, are our aſſurance that it was ſo. And hitherto all Chriſtians proceed with little or no difference.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid down Miracles as a foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we are in ſome manner to enſure our Faith; it ſeems neceſſary before we proceed, in few words to ſet down, 1. What we mean by Miracles; and, 2. How far this Teſtimony of Miracles may extend, ſo as to authoriſe our Belief.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by Miracles we muſt underſtand ſuch Works as are not only without the Lines of ordinary Courſe, and meaſure of Nature; for of this kind many things happen, which may be called Wonders, but not Miracles; but ſuch as are above the power of Nature to effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62724:6"/>
But becauſe many ſuch Works have in appearance been wrought, for very different Purpoſes; we muſt, in the ſecond place, look what Judgment muſt be made of all ſuch things. And certainly ſome way there is to diſtinguiſh; or elſe, the Minds of Men would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in moſt perplexing and inextricable Difficulties, by ſuch Contradictions, as have been abetted with Signs and Wonders. Let us ſee then by what Rules we muſt examine and judge Miracles themſelves, or ſuch Doctrines as are advanced upon them. For to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all without diſtinction, would come to the ſame thing as to allow none: Becauſe that can never prove any one Point, which may be alledged, or colourably pretended, in favour of another; unleſs there be ſome way to appropriate it to one ſide, as by the Rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it may.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever Doctrin is propoſed, that is contrary to right Reaſon, or the fundamental Laws of Nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Divine, or ſuch as we ought to believe, though never ſo many Signs ſhould be ſhew'd to confirm it. For right Reaſon is only a Judgment made according to that Law and Standard of Juſtice and Truth, which God our Creator has ſtamped upon the Minds of Men. And the Fundamentals of Reaſon iſſuing from God, as Light flows from its Fountain the Sun, muſt always remain unchangeably the ſame; becauſe he himſelf, from whom they Spring, has no variation. And if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon were not ſo fixed, we ſhould be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all manner of illuſion; and ſhould never be able to believe any thing, becauſe we could be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of nothing.</p>

Reaſon, than allowing many Gods. Yet further, God, when he created Man, according to the exact Laws of eternal Juſtice, implanted in our Natures the Seeds of it, and the Senſe of Honeſty; inſomuch that whatever Miracles tend to the Damage of Mankind, or the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners, they cannot be from God; nor can they authorize any Doctrin as Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the forementioned Standard of Juſtice and Reaſon. And this makes a real Diſtinction, and <note place="margin">Origen. cont. Celſ. lib. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>91.</hi> Ed. Cant.</note>ſenſible Difference betwixt the Miracles wrought by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, and thoſe by Heathen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. On the one hand, the Miracles always tended to good, and were ſuch as might invite Love as well as Admiration. On the other hand, they were, for the moſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hurtful to Mens Perſons and Eſtates; unleſs it was ſometimes that the Devils cured the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes they had cauſed, but it was ſtill to eſtabliſh a greater Tyranny. When the Jews taxed our Saviour <note place="margin">Matt. 12. 24.</note>with caſting out Devils by Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils; he anſwers to this effect, That the Devil was too Wiſe a Creature to deſtroy his own Kingdom, by caſting out Devils; eſpecially, when ſometimes they were made to own themſelves to be Devils, and to confeſs Chriſt to be the Son of God: <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> verſ. 28.</note>
               <hi>if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is come unto you.</hi> And this was frequent, in the Primitive Church, that the Chriſtians, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <note place="margin">Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. l. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi> &amp; alibi.</note>Power, overruled all the Powers of Darkneſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Magicians of thoſe times. For as to do Works above Nature, ſpeaks a Power above her; ſo, when thoſe Works tend to the good of Men, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Vertue, and eſtabliſhing true Piety, they muſt reaſonably be concluded to be from a Divine Author. Let this then be the firſt Step, or the Ground of all; That whatſoever Doctrin, or pretended Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62724:7"/>
deſtroys Juſtice, or contradicts Reaſon, cannot come from Heaven; and ought not to be Believed.</p>
            <p>In the next place; when once a Law is eſtabliſhed as Divine, upon a ſufficient Teſtimony of Miracles, no other Revelation that is contrary to it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, until it be repealed; and no repeal can be, but from the ſame Authority that enacted it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the repeal cannot be of force, till the Authority upon which it ſtands makes it ſelf manifeſt by as great, if not greater, Miracles than were wrought at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation. In this Point was the Prophets Miſcarriage, that went to cry againſt the Altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be overcome by the pretence of the <note place="margin">1 King. 13. 18.</note>old Prophet, contrary to his own Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>But without purſuing this farther at preſent, it is manifeſt, and by all Chriſtians acknowledged as ſuch, That the Goſpel, which our Saviour and his Apoſtles publiſhed to the World, is neither contradictious to Reaſon, nor deſtructive of Vertue, or good Manners, or inconſiſtent with former Revelations; but that, on the contrary, it propoſes the nobleſt End, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Life, and directs to the fitteſt and moſt agreeable Method for attaining it, and therefore muſt be accounted Divine.</p>
            <p>This being granted, it follows, That no Doctrin, or Revelation, which is not reconcilable to this Goſpel, can be from Heaven, or have Power to bind us. <hi>If an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel, let him be accurſed.</hi> Gal. 1. 8.</p>
            <p>My preſent Buſineſs being not with Heathens, but with Chriſtians, I will take it for granted, till I ſee more occaſion to prove it, That the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, who were Divinely Inſpired, committed to Writing that Goſpel which they had received; that is, <note n="*" place="margin">Cum ſit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum Canon, ſibique ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It muſt alſo be granted, That theſe Scriptures are no otherwiſe the Word of God, than they are rightly Underſtood and Interpreted. And here the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie begins, about the Senſe of Scripture. For the Gentlemen of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monſ. de Meaux</hi> Expoſ. of the Doctr. of the Cath. Sect. 19.</note>tell us, we muſt receive the Canon of the Scripture, and the Senſe and Interpretation of Scripture, upon the Authority of the Church; for ſo the matter is ſtated even by their late Writers. And this being of great Importance, we will conſider it Carefully, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with as much Clearneſs, as may be a ſufficient, though ſhort, diſcuſſion of the Point.</p>
            <p>If we are to receive the Canon and Senſe of the Scripture upon the Churches Authority, then the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority is the Ground upon which the Canon and Senſe of Scripture depends as to us; and if the Canon and Senſe of Scripture depends as to us, upon the Church, then the Church has Authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and determine our Faith in theſe two Queſtions, 1. What Books are Canonical; and, 2. What the Senſe of them muſt be. For if I know not the Senſe of them, I know not the Will of God; without which it ſignifies nothing to have the Books, although they had been written with God's own Finger. And</p>
            <p>If the Church has Authority to declare what Books, and what Senſe of thoſe Books, is Divine; then the Church has a Power to make me Believe its Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſay, the Church muſt have a Power, if it has Authority, to make me Believe; becauſe no Man can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62724:8"/>
Believe more than he can Believe, nor help Believing what for the time he does Believe.</p>
            <p>If the Church has a Power to make me Believe, it either has it of it ſelf, as it were by Nature, or it has it from God: But, of it ſelf, the Church can have no ſuch Power; becauſe God only has a Dominion over the Minds of Men, and is therefore to be Believed by virtue of his own Authority.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Church, as it conſiſts of Men, who in their private Capacities, (that is, as they are Men may err) has no Authority of it ſelf to determine my Faith; then the Authority of the Church, if it have any to make me Believe, muſt be Supernatural and Divine: Which, I think, is granted by the Author of <note place="margin">Cap. 15. of Tradition.</note>the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented and repreſented;</hi> when he ſays, he believes no Divine Faith ought to be given to any thing but what is of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>'Tis then an eſtabliſhed Point, That the Churches Authority is not to be believed as Natural, but as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and Divine; and if it be Supernatural, it cannot be proved out of Natural Principles. This the Papiſts ſeeing very well, lay down Infallibility for the Ground of the Churches Authority: So that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority ariſing from its Infallibity, no Man can be bound, in matters of Faith, to ſubmit to the one, farther than he can be Convinced of the other; and the Church can no longer have a Power over Mens Faith than ſhe is Infallible.</p>
            <p>The Infallibility then of the Church, being the Ground of her Authority, the Papiſts expect we ſhould reſolve our Faith into it; and we will conſider how reaſonable their expectations are in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>But, firſt, let us remember, That all this Authority and Infallability is challenged for the preſent Church of this Age; or elſe there is no viſible Infallible Judg,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62724:8"/>
and ſo the matter comes to nothing: For if they were affixed to the Church of any one Age, then our Faith, when that Age is expired, muſt reſolve it ſelf ſome other way, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
            <p>This hint being given, we proceed in ſearch of this Infallibility; which is indeed a ſafe Baſis to reſt upon, whereever it is found. In the firſt place therefore, we muſt enquire what it is, or, what is to be underſtood by it.</p>
            <p>Infallibility, properly taken, is the knowledge of all things. He that does not know every thing, may be miſtaken in ſome thing; and he that may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in any thing, is not Infallible. To know all things, is to be Omniſcient; and ſo God alone, who created every thing, by virtue of his own Infinity, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Infallible: But, for created Beings, their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is confined to ſuch things as the wiſe Creator has placed within their Capacities, and ſo made know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as it were by Nature. Therefore in other things which are Supernatural, and of which we can know no more than is revealed to us, Infallibility means a being preſerved from all Errour and Miſtake about them; and by Conſequence muſt it ſelf be a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Divine quality, imparted according to the good Will and Pleaſure of God.</p>
            <p>And now our Buſineſs is come to this, to know firſt, Whether any body, or no, has this Infallibility. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if any body has it, where he, or they, are to be found? And thirdly, how others may be aſſured, that they, who pretend to have it, have it indeed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether any body has this Infallibility. I take it for granted, upon the foregoing Proofs, that it is a Divine Supernatural Gift; and being ſuch, that it muſt iſſue from the good Pleaſure of God. Now any Gift whatſoever, which is Arbitrary, and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62724:9"/>
upon the Will of any one, cannot be pretended to in Reaſon, till he in whoſe Power it is, has made his Will known, that the Right and Poſſeſſion of it paſs over to him that Claims it. In like manner, no Divine Gift, which concerns more than them, who perſonally pretend to it, can have any weight or force without a Divine Teſtimony to enſure its own Credit.</p>
            <p>Upon this Point the Papiſts argue, That Chriſt, who was not leſs able or faithfull than Moſes in his houſe, would not leave his Church deſtitute of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means for Peace and Unity 'tis granted; But then, ſay they, without an Infallible Guide (beſide the Scripture) there can be neither reaſon for Faith, nor ground for Peace among Chriſtians. A bold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption <note place="margin">Pap. Miſrepr. and repr. cap. 16. pag. 19.</note>this! Nay farther, 'tis ſaid, That Chriſt has promiſed to teach his Church all Truth, by ſpecial Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, to the end of the World. This indeed is to the Purpoſe; but, that if any thing, it proves more than they wiſh: For it does as much prove all Chriſtians to be Infallible as one, or more. For the Promiſe, being indefinite, cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be appropriated to particulars; and, if it contains perpetual Infallibility, let them that can ſhew, from that Promiſe, that the Paſtors have more right to it than the People.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe now there is Infallibility in the Church, let us ſee whereabouts it is Lodged, that we may have recourſe to it, to end the Diſputes, which have ſo long diſturbed the Peace of Chriſtendom. For if it <note place="margin">De non appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſt ratio.</note>cannot be found, we ſhall hardly be made to grant that there is any ſuch thing; or, if it cannot be come at, we ſhall value it at the rate of all uſeleſs things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62724:9"/>
I ask therefore, Where this Infallibility is, that has been ſo much talked of? Why, ſome have ſhewed their good will to fix it to the Popes of <hi>Rome:</hi> And one would at firſt think the Author, who repreſents a Papiſt, looked that way; when he told us, he did <note place="margin">Cap. 18. p. 21.</note>not doubt but God aſſiſts them (the Popes) with a particular helping Grace, ſuch as was given to all the Prophets, when they were ſent to Preach, that was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Such as was given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was made a God to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that was Miraculous. Sure he forgot the Lives of ſome Popes; or elſe, ſome late Pope has divided the Sea, or turned a River in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Blood, and ſo filled him with Wonder, that he never thought to make any Reflexions. Laſtly, with ſuch Grace as was given to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied that Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation: A Truth which he utter'd without any good Deſign, as appears by his Sentence afterwards; and this inſtance indeed might well fit Pope <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. Yet, after all this, we are told that it is our Choice, Whether we will allow <note place="margin">Pap. Miſrepr. and repr. cap. 18. pag. 22.</note>the Pope to be perſonally Infallible, or no: And if they do not ſee reaſon enough to believe it, I am ſure I do not; and ſo the Pope's Claim muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed as indefenſible.</p>
            <p>But is a Council without him then Infallible? If it be, what becomes of the Pope's Supremacy? For whereever Infallibility goes, the Supremacy, touching matters of Faith, muſt go with it. And they cannot be ſeparated, ſince, as we ſhewed above, the one has its whole dependance upon the other.</p>
            <p>This difficulty has been apprehended; and ſo, to ſecure the Pope's Supremacy, a Council without him <note place="margin">Vide Not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. in Conc. Nic. en. ſecund. Chron. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſper. An. Dom. <hi>793.</hi>
               </note>has been judged not Infallible: And where any Council has wanted the Pope's Confirmation, as we ſee for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, it has been thought to want Authority to.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62724:10"/>
Though for all this, the Point of Supremacy, of how great importance ſoever, is not well agreed among <note place="margin">Vide quid Chron. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſper. ex Brunone Card. de Greg. <hi>7.</hi> ad An. Dom. <hi>1080.</hi>
               </note>them; for Councils have taken upon them to depoſe the Pope, and the French Roman Catholick Divines allow them in it.</p>
            <p>The only expedient in this Caſe is, what ſome lay down, That a Council aſſembled by and under the Pope, whoſe Authority muſt confirm their Decrees, is Infallible.</p>
            <p>Being come to this, as the laſt effort, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with a regard due to a Tenet of ſuch moment.</p>
            <p>And here I ask again, Whether every Biſhop and Devine, that Debates and Votes in Council, be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible? No; this muſt not be ſaid, becauſe there have beeen great Differences among the Divines, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions much urged: Beſides, it would make every Biſhop as abſolute as the Pope, to make him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, which would quite undo the pretences of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But then, if every Biſhop in Council be not Infallible, for ought I can ſee, this Infallibility muſt be given to the Pope. And if his approbation be indeed neceſſary to Authorize their Decrees, he has e'en moſt right to it. For if the Authentickneſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees depends upon the Pope, 'tis plain, he muſt have a Negative vote to the Council; and, if he has a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative vote to the Council, either he muſt have this Infallibility, or there can be none at all of any uſe. But as to the Pope's being Infallible, we were told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is no Article of Faith; and ſo we are at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from them to believe it, or let it alone. Though, to ſay the Truth, if I had been told the contrary, the Errors which ſome Popes have fallen into, would have hindred me, in deſpite of any good will, from owning him ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62724:10"/>
Is this Infallibility ſhared among them, ſo that every one has ſome? For Infallibility they muſt have, or their Authority is loſt: No, this cannot be neither; for Infallibility is a Quality that cannot be divided, or enjoyed to the halfs. And if it could, it would not do the buſineſs; for then they would be Fallible in part, as well as Infallible in part. And ſo we ſhould be as hard put to it, to find which part their Infallibility reaches to, as we are to find that they have any at all.</p>
            <p>Here peradventure, it may be thought, becauſe it has been ſaid heretofore, That though the Pope and his Council may be Fallible, in their Arguments and Diſcourſes, yet, in the Reſult of them, <hi>viz.</hi> their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions which only concern the Church, they are Infallible. This indeed is to the purpoſe, if it could be as eaſily proved as ſaid. But ſince neither Art nor Nature does allow an Infallible Concluſion to iſſue from Fallible Means, it muſt be wholly Supernatural and Divine. And ſo we are come, in the third place, to ask, How they came by a Power to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion Divine, the Means being Humane? or, How they will make it appear to me, or any Man elſe, that they are endued with ſuch a Power?</p>
            <p>Certainly a Claim ſo bold as this, ought to be very well made out. But here, alaſs! we are turn'd over to Motives of Credibility, which are ſometimes called the marks of the Church; however, we will ſee what can be made of them.</p>
            <p>By Motives of Credibility, muſt be meant, ſuch as may work upon my Reaſon, and ſo incline my Mind to believe, or aſſent to any thing for a Truth; and ſo I can be induced to believe no farther than the point is made Credible to me. Well; but whatever is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural can never work upon my Reaſon, as being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62724:11"/>
quite above it, without ſome Divine Evidence and Teſtimony; and that muſt either be Miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Scripture. For Miracles, they have of late been little pretended to: But from Scripture, they tell us, Chriſt has promiſed to his Church a perpetual Aſſiſtance of his Grace; yea, ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit, as made <hi>Caiaphas</hi> propheſy Truth, almoſt whether he would or no. But how can they pretend Scripture in this Caſe? <note place="margin">Pap. Miſrepr. and repr. cap. 14. pag 15.</note>who have told us, we muſt receive the Senſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture from the Infallible Authority of the Church: And that not in a few Points, but in every Doubt; and never preſume upon our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sentiments, howſoever ſeemingly grounded on Reaſon and Scripture. If we muſt thus abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Authority of the Church for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, then the Authority of the Church muſt be better known to us than the Senſe of the Scripture: And if it be better known, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved by Scripture; for every thing that proves another muſt it ſelf be more evident. And if the Churches Authority cannot be proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it can never be proved without Miracles; and by conſequence can never be believed. But if Chriſtians muſt read and judg of Scripture, and believe it in this Point, I can ſee no reaſon why they may not in every one elſe that concerns Religion; ſince there are few Points in it that are not much more cleary expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Here Traditions would put in to help out. But, to ſpoil all we are told, we muſt receive them too up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of the Church; for it would be as dangerous to truſt the World with a liberty of judging Traditions, as of judging Scripture, and more conteſts there are and would be about them. And yet, which is an inſuperable Difficulty, Tradition is ſilent in many Points of the Romiſh Faith; nay, in all, whereabout
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62724:11"/>
any Difference is, I mean, as to the Primitive Church; and ſure Tradition cannot be produced where there is none. If Tradition could be produced, ſtill the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty returns: That Tradition would be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and therefore above the Churches Authority. And how acceptable a Point that is at <hi>Rome,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vide Hiſtor. Haereſ. Blaclo.</note>and Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> could have told at their own Coſt.</p>
            <p>But though Scripture and Tradition are inſufficient, perhaps Succeſſion may make out this Matter; or elſe, why are we ſo often told of it? and truly, I muſt needs ſay, I do not know why we are. For, if they mean a Succeſſion of Biſhops, that can prove nothing to <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it is common to other Churches, who have as undoubted a Succeſſion as they. If they mean a Succeſſion of Doctrin, from the Apoſtles to us, 'tis what we allow; and, for want of it, refuſe thoſe other Doctrins they would impoſe.</p>
            <p>There is behind a very forcible Argument, to prove, That the Pope and his Council together are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or, that the Papiſts themſelves do not think them ſo. I Inſtance, in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. where it was decreed, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be Depoſed. He that Repreſents a Papiſt, <note place="margin">Pap. Miſrepr. and repr. cap. 20.</note>anſwers, That this is no Article of Faith, and that they are not bound to believe it. But if this be not to be believed, it is becauſe the Truth of it is not evident enough; and if it be not evident enough, it muſt be becauſe the Churches propoſing or decreeing is not ſufficient to make it evident, which is the Point I aim at.</p>
            <p>If he will, as ſome have, acknowledge the depoſing Doctrin to be true; let the World conſider what kind of Subjects thoſe muſt be that are in ſuch a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and if he diſavows it; he makes it appear that he does not think their Church Infallible. Nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62724:12"/>
can I think that Church has ſufficiently cleared it ſelf from the Charge of this Doctrin, which ſome of them call a Calumny, till it be as Publickly and Authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repealed, as it was Decreed. Nor can I imagine, how that Author could tell us, in the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Book, that he thought himſelf obliged not to rely on his own private Judgment, but upon the Authority of the Church, in any Doubt; and yet, in the twentieth Chapter of the ſame Book, tells us, in Conſequence, what the Church has peremptorily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, is not to be believed. I am ſorry, when that Decree paſſed, ſuch a powerfull Meaſure of the Spirit, which made <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Propheſie, was abſent. And ſince it was ſo then, I do not ſee how they can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably preſume he was not abſent in other Points too. Damnation being ſo particularly denounced againſt Rebellion, we cannot think that a Point ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as to be paſſed by in advertency.</p>
            <p>It now plainly appears, that this Challenge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is very unaccountable; and, to ſhew its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity yet more, you ſhall ſee, that though we ſhould grant (as we do not) that they have Infallibility ſome where, yet, in the reſolution of Faith, it would be uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>The Church at this day is vexed and divided by many Hereſies, and contrary Opinions. How muſt the Truth be cleared, and Peace be reſtored to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom? By the Churches Authority, ſay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. But it has been proved that the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority extends no farther than ſhe has Infallibility; and the Pope being not Infallible alone, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Council aſſembled under him, the preſent Church has no Infallibility, and ſo, by Conſequence, no Authority to determine Controverſies about Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62724:12"/>
Peradventure it will be ſaid, the Council which ſat in the laſt Age defined all Points, and ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Faith. I anſwer, That what that Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined is one thing; and its ſetling Faith, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Controverſies, appears by the effect to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It will be ſaid, it determined all but what Pride and Obſtinacy ſtill kept on foot. But if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ſtill remain, whether from Pride or Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-pravity, or from any other Cauſe whatever, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not: Why ſhould the Scripture be taxed as inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be a Rule of Faith, for not effecting what their Infallibility cannot bring to paſs? Sure, there is no reaſon why it ſhould.</p>
            <p>Well, but for obſtinate and prejudiced Perſons, we will ſet them aſide; and ſee what can be done for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive People, ſuch as are Willing to be Convinced; what ſhall theſe do?</p>
            <p>They tell us, They muſt be guided by the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Decrees of the laſt General Council aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Trent.</hi> But how ſhall they be aſcertained that they have a true Copy of the Acts of that Council? For upon occaſion Suppoſitious Canons have been alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Authority of the preſent Church cannot do it, as you may conclude from that which has already been ſaid; beſides, it is the thing in Queſtion. However, ſuppoſe from the Teſtimony of the preſent Church witneſſing, though not authoriſing, and by ſuch Methods as we receive the Works of other Writers, we ſhould admit the Acts of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be truly derived to us; What ſhall we do to attain the true Senſe and Meaning of them, without which they can ſignifie nothing?</p>
            <p>And to ſhew you that this is no Captious Queſtion, ſome great Men among them have interpreted that Councils Decrees very differently. And the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62724:13"/>
of a Papiſt has conſtrued them in a Senſe very wide, from what ſome eminent Doctors long ſince gave of them. Are we not now in a fair way for Peace and Unity? After all, if ſo many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſurround the Learned, what ſhall Women do, and ſuch as only underſtand their Mother Tongue?</p>
            <p>I can meet with no Anſwer to this, but that the Learned muſt with honeſt Minds, and juſt Diligence, ſearch out the Senſe of the Churches Definitions; and from them, muſt thoſe of leſs Judgment and meaner Capacities, receive it.</p>
            <p>But if the matter muſt reſt here, for my Life, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee why the like Care and Pains ſhould not bring a Man to the true Senſe of the Scripture, as well as of a Council. 'Twould be an ill Reflection upon God's Wiſdom to ſay, he ordered his Will to be written, but not ſo intelligible as human Writings. And if there be ſome, who for want of Ability in themſelves, muſt reſt their Faith upon other Mens Judgments, I do not ſee why the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may not as well be relied on, as the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſince the World has no reaſon to think them leſs Learned, or leſs Sincere.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> among all impartial Men, has this manifeſt advantage, that She derives Her Faith from Scripture; not fancifully Interpreted, but Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a Senſe which the Text reaſonably leads to. And to ſtrengthen Her Expoſition, She takes in the Teſtimony of the Church in Her four firſt General Councils: Not that She reſts upon an Authority in them, but She takes them as Witneſſes to ſhew, that in Her Interpretation, She is neither Singular nor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
            <p>Thus, in ſhort, a Member of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> proceeds. He is certain his Faith is right and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62724:13"/>
true, becauſe it is founded, as to its Object, upon the Will of God. He is certain it ſtands upon the Will of God, becauſe it ſtands upon the Word of God. He is certain it is built upon the Word of God, becauſe it is built upon the Scripture. He is certain the Scripture is the Word of God, becauſe the Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, that wrote it, were Divinely Inſpired. And he is made certain that they were Divinely Inſpired, by the Divine Teſtimony of Miracles which God gave them. Nor, laſtly, can he doubt, but whatſoever God ſets his Seal to, is Truth; for he will not, he cannot Lye or Deceive.</p>
            <p>If he be asked, how he knows theſe Books to be Written by thoſe Inſpired Men, to whom they are attributed? He Anſwers, for that, he has an univerſal Teſtimony of Friends and Enemies through all Ages: Which is as good an Evidence as a Matter of Fact can bear, or does require; and, when he reads them, he is farther Confirm'd, by finding them ſo admirably Compiled and Suited to that Character.</p>
            <p>If he be asked, how he attains the right Senſe of them? He anſwers, by uſing due Attention, and an unprejudiced Mind, with ſuch other helps as are fit for that Purpoſe; he gains as great Certainty of the true meaning of Scripture, as Senſe and Reaſon can <note place="margin">Duplici modo munire fidem fidem noſtram debemus Primo ſcil. divinae Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Authoritate tum deinde Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Catholicae Traditione. Vinc. Lirin. Com. adv. Haer. Cap. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>bear in an ordinary Capacity, (I mean, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Articles of Faith ſumm'd into his Creed;) and is as ſafe, in this Reſolution, as was the Primitive Church, with which he agrees. More than this, he does not apprehend neceſſary.</p>
            <p>After this, ſince the Papiſts have taxed our Faith as wavering and uncertain, how unjuſtly, you may eaſily diſcern, I might here make them a Requital; by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the World, that upon their own Principles, they can have no Faith at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62724:14"/>
For if what Faith they have ariſes from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority, then, if the Church has no Authority, they can have no Faith. But, I have proved before, the Church can have no ſuch Authority, becauſe it has not Infallibility; and it cannot reaſonably pretend to Infallibility, becauſe it can make no Evidence of it, and without Evidence no Man can believe.</p>
            <p>But God forbid I ſhould ſay, or think, they have no Faith: I only offered this, to ſhew the weakneſs and inſufficiency of the Principles they go upon, and what little Reaſon they have to charge us.</p>
            <p>And now to that Queſtion ſo often asked, By what Authority we depart from the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> I anſwer, by an Authority which is inſeparable from the Mind of every Man, to refuſe to believe any thing for which he has not a Reaſon to him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; indeed, no Man can believe without it. For the Mind of Man is ſo diſpoſed, as to Truth, that it immediately imbraces it, and cloſes with it as ſoon as ever it diſcerns it: But if the Mind diſcerns no Truth in a Propoſition, it cannot aſſent to it, whatever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion the Man makes.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has not ſufficiently proved the Doctrins in diſpute betwixt us; and that, if we had no more, would be Authority enough for us to refuſe them, and depart from her; ſince She will not receive us to Communion, but upon Conditions which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make out to be reaſonable, unleſs we grant that falſe Suppoſition of Infallible Authority.</p>
            <p>They ask farther, who is to be Judg of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Reaſonings between us? I anſwer, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man muſt for himſelf: For as every Man muſt believe, ſo every Man muſt have a Reaſon why he believes; and ſure every one muſt be a Judg of his own Reaſon whether he be Convinced or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62724:14"/>
We are told, That then there will be Hereſies and Schiſms; it is true there are ſo, and, for ought I ſee, will be ſo ſtill: But that's no more than the Apoſtle told the <hi>Corinthians</hi> muſt be, <hi>that thoſe which are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note>
               <hi>approved may be made manifeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may appear yet more unequal in Her Pretences; for that She advances a Doctrin which cannot be believed, even by thoſe who pay the utmoſt deference to her Authority, and that is Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, which implies ſeveral Contradictions. Some, that own the Churches Infallible Authority, and are reſolved to reſt upon it, may ſo overrule their Minds as to keep them from conſidering or thinking upon that Doctrin, and ſo for the time do not as it were disbelieve it; but, whenever they come to weigh it, their Minds cannot imbrace it, becauſe there can be no Reaſon for a Contradiction: For ſure Church Authority cannot go on where the Power of God ceaſes. If it be ſaid, it is only a Contradiction in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that comes to the ſame thing; for 'till it can be made not to ſeem a Contradiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt have the ſame effect upon all Mens Minds, as upon ours, who know it to be really a groſs one. And this makes me ſenſible, That it is a greater abſurdity to believe, as they ſay, implicitly or indefinitly as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, when a Man conſiders not what that is, than to Pray implicitly, or in a general intention with the Church, when one knows not what the Church Prays for. It being abſurd to ſay, a Man believes any thing which the Mind does not particularly imbrace, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it ſelf to; and the Mind cannot be ſaid to imbrace that which it thinks or knows nothing of.</p>
            <p>Here it muſt not be forgotten, that I am not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Habit, but the Acts of Faith. Nor do the Principles I have laid down oblige me to think, every
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62724:15"/>
one has alwas a true ground for his Faith. I doubt not, but many believe upon inducements, that would, if examined, be found Slender and Diſproportionate: for ſuch it is their good fortune if they believe aright, but if they are in the wrong, they muſt anſwer for not taking greater Care. But if they have uſed their utmoſt Care and Diligence, and yet continue in the wrong, we may leave them without any deſperate apprehenſion to the mercy of God.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Points about which we differ with <hi>Rome</hi> have been diſcuſſed in particular Treatiſes, and ſo I will meddle little with them, having from the firſt deſigned in chief to conſider the grounds of Faith.</p>
            <p>I would here have taken leave, but that I am ſtayed with a Pretence, That the Faith which we own, we had from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an account of our Church primitively, let them read the Learned <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Britanicae.</hi>
               </note>I will not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the merits of this Pretence, but examin what uſe they make of it. Suppoſe now we had the Scripture, and the Creeds from them, what follows? Why, then they would have us receive all the reſt of their Additional Articles too. Indeed, if we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all we believe upon their Churches Authority it had been a better inference. But they know, we did not receive any Articles upon any Authority but the Reaſon of them; and therefore where that ends our Faith ſtops, and we receive no more.</p>
            <p>They would it ſeems preſcribe; and, ſuppoſing we imbrace ſome Truths which they pretend to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us, would have us entertain whatever elſe they offer. This is very ſtrange indeed!</p>
            <p>If any one hearing the Devils declaring Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, as the Goſpel tells us they did, ſhould have believed him ſo; and <note n="†" place="margin">Edatur hic aliquis ſub Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunalibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, quem Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone agi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtet, juſſus à quolibet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano loqui Spiritus ille impurus, tam ſe Daemonem confitebitur de vero quam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi. Deum de falſo. Apolog. Cap. <hi>23.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> we know made it a great Argument, and appealed to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon it, when the Devils made Confeſſion; muſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62724:15"/>
they therefore have believed all the Devils ſaid at any time, becauſe they ſaw reaſon to believe what they ſaid ſome times: 'Twould have been a ſtrange Caſe with Religion, unleſs Men had been aſſured the Devil's inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to deceive ſhould have always been overruled; and they, like <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> ſhould have been made to ſpeak Truth whether they would or no. In like manner, to have received ſome Truths from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be no reaſon why we ſhould believe others.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have conſidered the Grounds of Faith, and ſhewed the Weakneſs and Inſufficiency of thoſe Means which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes to reſolve it by. I pray God, by his Grace, ſo to inlighten the Underſtandings, and diſpoſe the Wills of all Chriſtians, that they may heartily endeavor the Peace and Unity of the Church, by an humble and impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after Truth, the only Way effectually to bring it about.</p>
            <p>Popery has of late been Expounded to a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Senſe, and Repreſented in a leſs formidable Dreſs, than it wore heretofore: And ſo far am I from being angry at it, that I am heartily glad; hoping it may tend to the Scattering thoſe thick Miſts of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Ignorance that have obſcured the Truth, and hindred many from diſcerning it. I only wiſh they would manifeſt the Sincerity of their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by a Practice anſwerable to it. They took away the Scriptures from ſome, leaſt in reading they ſhould miſinterpret it: And I wiſh they would take away Images, which have been horribly miſunderſtood; ſince they now tell the World they think them but as Books to inſtruct the Ignorant, and honorary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances to the Learned. This would be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and fair Step toward reſtoring Peace, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Schiſm. And ſince we are told, that no Power
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62724:16"/>
upon Earth can limit, alter, or annul, any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Divine Inſtitution, contrary to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law-giver, (a Poſition highly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) we expect the Cup ſhould be given to all of the Communion; ſeeing that our Saviour inſtituted and gave that as well as the Bread. And after his Inſtitution, the ſame Night that he was betrayed, I cannot find that he made the leaſt Alteration. To ſay our Saviour had no Mind that ſhould be done which he appointed, would be very abſurd: Therefore what he once inſtituted, muſt continue in force as his Mind ſtill, unleſs they can ſhew that he altered it; and this would be another good Step toward our Union. They have now reduced their praying to Saints departed, to a deſire only that the Bleſſed would aſſiſt them with their Prayers to God, as we deſire good Men on Earth to pray for us; but this not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying any Neceſſity of praying to them, though for no more than to pray for us, 'tis great pity they will not lay down a Practice to which our Apprehenſions will never ſuffer us to be Reconciled. One would think they that aggravate the Sin of Schiſm ſo much, ſhould remove all Obſtacles that may be a hindrance of Union: The Order and Decency of God's Service would be no way diſturbed by ſuch abatements. And let them look to it, that divide the Church upon Points by their own confeſſion not neceſſary; and no otherways to be accounted for, but upon the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Authority of the Church. But this is to enter into particulars, which I reſolved to decline, having undertaken only to examin that Pretence: And ſo I will wind up all in a ſhort Advertiſement, That when I diſpute againſt the Authority of the Church, I do not mean that Power which every Church, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate Society, muſt have to caſt out of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62724:16"/>
ſuch as walk Diſorderly; nor that Power therefore which every Church muſt have over Her Members to eſtabliſh Rules for Decency and Order, in the Circumſtantials, the Ceremonies of Religion: But, I mean, that Authority which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to have over our Conſciences and Faith; in which Caſe we own no Maſter but one in Heaven.</p>
