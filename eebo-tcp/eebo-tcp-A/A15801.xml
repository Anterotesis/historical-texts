            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OBLES and Gentlemen, I will salute you with a sentence of mine Author sir <hi>Iohn Froysard,</hi> The aduentures of armes (saith he) are so diuers, and so far oftentimes beyond expectation, as that their effects causeth great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which saying of his caused me with the more attention to read ouer his works, and finding the same most truly prosecuted through the whole course of his historie, but especially in the actions and aduentures of two famous Capitains Sage and Imaginatiue, the one sir <hi>Iohn Chandos,</hi> and the other sir <hi>Iohn Grayllie</hi> by name (commonly called the <hi>Captall de Buz</hi>) it delighted me (as a louer of honor and cheualrie) to note downe their seuerall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes with some reasons of their falles, as men may gesse at the iudgements of God, and hauing enterprised the publishing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, haue dedicated these my labors, such as they be, to your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable societie: which doings of mine though they may seeme to some men friuolous and not woorth your regard, yet doubt I not but you shall finde matter of benefit valuable to the time you shall therein bestow, both by way of imitation, and vertuous aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as being a subiect that may stir your woorthie endeuors to the honor of God, your dutifull seruice of hir Maiestie, the benefit of your countrie, and your owne eternall glorie. I haue been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to set downe (as my maner is) the Standards pennons, cote armours, and other marks of honor, to the end it may publikely be knowen of what necessitie the vse of them is (as being for that cause first ordeined) how and in what maner they are to be vsed, and to whom they do of right most chiefly and properly appertaine and belong. And these matters being well conceiued (as indeed without such tokens no martiall discipline can be exercised, no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21144:3"/>
armie ranged, no attempt of any companie atchieued, and so (by consequence) no conquest made, nor so much as any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (whatsoeuer) defended, neither from outward enimies, ciuill discord, nor the rebellion of any plebeian rout, be the same neuer so simple, rude, or of small esteeme) it will (I hope) reduce into esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation a matter both of honor, order, and necessitie, which now (through the abuse thereof) is so far run into contempt, as that (of many men) it is holden for a thing of no price, but thought to be a very mockerie, and a matter of no other sequence, than to set vp vaine and fantasticall glorious fellowes into a pride, and to drawe from them some small summes to certaine persons into an office instituted, which no doubt was by the wisest and best gouerned states at the first deuised, and generally by all of any policie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to a most necessarie end: yet thinke they (as it is now in vse) it serueth but onely for that purpose. And indeed I must by the way complaine, that certaine of the said officers (or others pertaining to them) either for want of skill or maintenance, or otherwise for their gaine, haue committed faults not iustifiable, whereby they haue brought a matter of great honor into defame, and iniured thereby the Commonwealth, and brought both others that haue managed those affaires with more discretion, and themselues into obloquie. But these faults and errors, and some others also (spoken of in this dedication instituted to that purpose) will in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this matter more easily appeere, and the thing be (I hope) reformed either by the good endeuors which the officers (vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof) will vse, or else by the magistrate, when he shall haue knowledge of such the abuses as he may be informed of. And first that Guydhomes ensignes and marks of armorie be of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, let it be but considered whether wars be somtimes of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be taken in hand or not, and surely I thinke there is none of so very meane capacitie, but will yeeld vnto it that they be: especially defensiue, and in some cases also offensiue: which as a thing granted I will ouerpasse. And then I say further, that wars being lawful and of necessitie, it must also be granted, that the same must be made by companies and bands of men, ouer which some must command, and the rest obey, and then will it follow, that for the oredring &amp; diuiding of those to the best aduantage, standards and banners must be allotted to euery companie, to the end they may draw togither in their strength, and performe such actions as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21144:3"/>
they shall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, thus may you see the necessitie. And for the vse it doth also appeer, that sithence some must be commanders, it is of importance that they be known both by the persons ouer whom they command, &amp; generally by al, and that so perspicuously that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery sudden occurrent, the meanest &amp; simplest common soldier may thereby know euerie particular officer, and captaine that hath charge: for which purpose our ancestors deuise was, that such men should weare some such coate of marke ouer his armor, as whereby they might be easily discerned, to be the same persons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were: and where somtimes (when occasion so offered it selfe) they were forced to vse pauishes for their defence, whereby a great part of the marke which was vpon their vesture, was shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from sight, it was thought necessarie that their markes should be also laide vpon their shieldes: the commanders of horse-men (their faces being for the most part couered) they added to the crests of their helmets some further distinction to be the better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so knowen by: thus much for the ordinance and vse of armorie. And hereby also may it appeere to whom they do properly belong and appertaine, namelie, to Kings, Princes, Archbishops, Bishops, Earles, Barons, Lords of prouinces and fees, Knights, officers in the Armie, Nauie or peece, and generallie to all that haue charge ouer bands and companies of soldiers. And now sithence from hencefoorth manie of my speeches will tend to the discouerie of such things as I take to be abused, erronious, or faultie, wherein I may peraduenture not square in opinion with some others, and being my selfe no officer or of any authoritie, whereby I should haue cause to deale in these affaires, I will therefore first beseech your honors and all others to whom it may appertaine, that if anie thing shall passe my pen which shall be offensiue, that they wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no woorse of it then I meane, which is but to bring these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of armorie into question, to the ende that if anie thing be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse (as I for my part thinke that manie things are) that then the same may be reformed: but if happelie I mistake, that then it would please such as be of iudgement or skill, to iustifie the same as well done, and I shall most willinglie yeeld to authoritie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and so not speaking but vnder correction, I saie that first I find (as I conceiue) some blame to be imputed in your selues which be professed soldiers, that where your ancestors and al others general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie did in their standards, banners, and pennons shew foorth to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21144:4"/>
viewe and face of the enimie, certaine faire, ancient, and knowne marks, which their elders for the most part had vsuallie before time carried, or at least themselues had then taken (if they but then were in their rising age) wherby their owne people were in a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and decent order conducted and led, and their enimies verie much terrified, when they should see those marks shewed foorth, the owners whereof had in their memories by plaine feat of armes ouerthrowne their parents, or happely themselues, beaten them out of the fielde, razed downe their castels and fortresses, sacked their townes and cities, wasted and spoiled their countries, ranso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their people, and generally so daunted and amazed them, that it was sometimes found to be true, that verie bare names of some valiant persons ouercame whole armies. I can not but blame you of all sorts which shall make choise of banners (which you call co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors) so curtein like and so far from all due order of Ancient bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as may be, and for your parts which are descended from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors of marke, I would be glad to heare any reason from you, to what end you should lay the same a side, and make choise of a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein in the place thereof. And you others (whose wisedome and valure haue gained you the reputation of a charge) I would gladly also heare from you what should moue you to be of that mind, as not to take some conuenient marke, such a one as may be thought meete by authority for you, whereby you may gaine an honor, both to your selues and your posteritie, and by your good vsage thereof much enlarge the reputation, you haue by your valours obtained.</p>
            <p>An other thing that is amisse as I take it, and hath great need to be reformed, is the quartering of many marks in one shield, coate, or banner, for sithence it is true that such marks serue to no other vse but for a commander to lead by, or to be knowen by, it is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie that the same be apparent, faire, and easie to be discerned, so that the quartering of many of them together doth hinder the vse for which they are prouided. As how is it possible for a plaine vnlearned man (who may be as good a soldier in some respects as the best) to discerne and know a sunder, six or eight, (what speake I of six or eight?) sometimes thirtie or fortie seuerall marks clustered all together in one shield or banner, nay though he had as good skill as <hi>Robert Glouer</hi> late Somerset that dead is, and the eies of an Egle, amongst such a confusion of things, yet should he neuer be able to decipher the errors that are daily committed in this one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21144:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
point, nor discerne or know one banner or standard from another, be the same neuer so large? So that except it be to be made in a pedegree or descent to locke vp in an euidence chest, therby to shew mens titles to their lands or the Alliences and kindreds of their houses, otherwise (as I say) I see not to any vse in the world they serue, specially so many together to be made vpon a mans vesture, Target or banner, and therefore I could wish that euery man would content himselfe with his owne peculiar coate of name, and not to vse aboue one quartered therewith at the most: which one yet doth not so much trouble the capacitie of a man, but that he may both know and discerne a banner or shield well ynough. And this one do I the rather esteeme well of to be borne, for that a Prince or Noble man making challenge or title to any Countrie (for which he is forced to make warres before he can obtaine it) it will be a goodly thing for him to shew foorth his standard of the Armes of that Countrie quartered with his owne amongest those people which in reason and conscience owe him duety and obedience, to the end that they may thereby be the sooner induced to submit themselues to their true and lawfull soueraine, as his subiects. And for that cause (as I take it) King <hi>Edward</hi> the third and his valiant sonnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised and shewed foorth the Armes of France and England quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered together, and although my Author saith that <hi>Iaques Dartuell,</hi> a honie trier of Gaunt was the first deuiser thereof, yet will I not beleeue otherwise, but that the principall reasons that led the king thereto, was to make knowne the iustnes of his title to that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome where he then intended to make warres. But now it may be obiected, sithence a Prince or great Lord may haue title to seuerall Countries, that therefore it is necessarie for him to beare all such tokens or marks as he hath title too: To this I answere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could yeeld to them (but that it will bring the confusion aforesaid) yet is it of no such necessity, for that a man needs to shew his title but onely to them whom he means to subdue: and if it should fortune that he had title to diuers and seuerall Countries, and that he would make warres to them all at once, yet should it not be needfull to him to shew foorth any more marks quartered in one standard, but onely vnto euery seuerall countrie the Armes of that nation quartered with his owne. But this being the case of Kings and Princes, wherein (amongest others) our most famous, noble and worthy kings and princes of this land, haue shewed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21144:5"/>
themselues most prudent and wise, to what purpose is it that others being but commanders vnder their prince, and which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue neither title to countrie nor are able to maintaine wars, should in their princes seruice pester their banners and shields with such an infinite number as many do? And in this point I cannot ynough commend the Baron of Stafford, who heerin sheweth his great skill and temperance, for althongh his Ancestors haue had title to quarter the marks of that valiant <hi>Thomas</hi> of Wodstocke (yoongest sonne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third) Earle of Buckingham and Duke of Glocester, of Bohune Earle of Hereford and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanton and high Cunstable of England: and also of that great house of Somerset, which by their ancestor <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Somerset, (yoonger sonne to <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gaunt) descended from the same king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, (I omit to speake of diuers Barons and others of great estate, whose heires both with reuenue and honor enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged greatly his family) yet the said Baron contents himselfe with the paternall marke of his house, and neuer so much as dreames of any other, far differing from a number of meaner persons, who if they possesse any mannor or lands by descent, albeit their ancestors married the heire of the same many hundred yeers agone, and whose parents peraduenture neuer did beare any marke, or if they did (time hauing obscured the same) it remaineth vnknowen: yet shall you haue them run to an Herald or painter, as busily as if the matter were of weight, and there make search they know not for what, and the herald or painter (on the other side) to draw some small peece of siluer from them, will find out the badge of some one or other of the same name, although many times none of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and may be neuer came neare that countrey, and that will they inuest them with as their owne, and sometimes (when no marke for any of the name will be found) then deuise some conceit or other, and say they find it borne by such a name, and content them wonderously therewith, which serues yet to no other vse, but to make vp a iust number, whereby their owne marks become the more confused: and yet into this quartering (being a very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of errors) many both Noble men and Gentlemen, and the officers of Armes themselues, do oftentimes very rashly enter. It is not long sithence there died a knight in Staffordshire of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and (in his life time) was a deputie Lieuetenant there, to doe his obsequie came an officer of Armes, who compiled for him nine

seuerall marks all in one Escuchion, and yet neuer a one of them (as they were there set foorth) to him belonging, but his owne of name. And as I haue giuen you this one for an instance, so almost can a man come into no towne of any account, nor almost into any Church or house of Noble man or Gentleman, but he shall find errors, so that the numbers thereof be infinite: It were therefore to be wished that this matter of quartering should be reformed, as well for the vntruths therein committed, as for the titles that may be brought in question thereby to lands and Heritages: And as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the chiefest things that bringeth the honor of Armory into disgrace: for not long agoe heard I one speake in this maner, did I not (quoth he) know the grandfather of this man (speaking of the owner of a scuchion wherein were quartered many marks) to purchase by plaine patent (although he neuer were man at Armes) both his coate and crest within these fortie yeers, and how comes it now to passe that I see his nephew inuested in all this Armorie? (numbring many and diuers seuerall deuices all in one shield by way of quartering) this being a very mockerie to see a man of no valure or estimation in warlike affaires, and the paternall Ances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of whom (for ought that can be prooued) were not in any late age welders of Armes, to entrude themselues into so many badges of Armorie is not the least matter to bring into contempt an order so honorable and necessarie, as the bearing of Armes is.</p>
            <p>Another matter that to my vnderstanding is also to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is the maner of differings, which are by the yoonger brothers and their posterities laid vpon their marks, being cressants, mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, &amp;c. and that such little ones, as that a man cannot discerne them a verie small distance from him, which differences are in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be made faire, plaine, and large, that they may be also as easie to be discouered as any other deuise that is in the coate, shield, or banner, otherwise they serue not to the purpose for which marks were first ordeined. And the inconuenience which ensueth of this error will the more easily appeere, if I but set you downe the words of mine Author (treating of an accident that happened in such a case) which be these: <hi>Et feist msr Robert Baileul aler sa Banniere tout deuant en escriant moriannes les Henuiers qui inestoint esthauses Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceurent la Banniere de moriannes qui encore estoit tout Droicte, si cuide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent que ce feust la leur ou ilz se deuoient radresser, car mult petite y auoi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus then hauing shewed by example the harme and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that cannot but many times happen through the littlenes and nicenes of such differences, I haue thought it not amisse to laie before you the differings that antiquitie vsed, that by comparing them togither you may discerne the great wisedome of our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and our owne imperfections in this point, for want of due consideration: which was done at the first by changing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise borne into other colors onely, but when that would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the number of leaders (manie times all of one house) then were they forced to varie their markes by adding of either bars, bends, cheurons, cheefes, quarters, borders, labels, losinges, or such like, and verie seldome should you see in those times cressant, mollet, or such like small little thing borne for a difference, and if anie did, yet was the same made so large and faire that it might be seene as well as any other the deuise which should be in the shielde or banner.

            <p>Thus haue I set downe vnto you (though something tediouslie) the vse that the antiquitie followed in a verie glorious line, for Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, which florished diuers hundreds of yeeres sithence, and you may see that these men (though they were manie of them great Barons) were not ashamed of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, but laide them foorth largely to the view, neither do I esteeme it a shame wherby any man should couet to hide the same, to be descended as a yoonger brother, sithence that euerie brother (hauing the like parents) is as well descended as the eldest, and therefore as good a Gentleman (though not so rich) as he. And the more is his honor, if without the helpe which by reason of his patrimonie the elder hath, he can aduance himselfe into place of office or dignitie, whereby he may raise an other florishing familie of the same surname: And therefore you my masters that be yoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brothers, neuer hide your differences by putting foorth a little cressant, or a peeping mollet, but vse some faire large deuise, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence in truth your estimation is by your rising to be had in as good a regard as if you were the elder.</p>
            <p>And now being in speech of yoonger brothers and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, I haue obserued two kinds of them which the antiquitie vsed, (besides the aforesaid) one was, that such as were aduanced by Kings, Princes, or other great Lords, did manie times beare some part of the deuise of him who aduanced them, by way of addition vnto the marke of their owne familie, which serued verie aptlie to distinguish them from their elder house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21144:9"/>The other was, that diuers did adde vnto the marke of their owne house, some part of the deuise of that familie from which their mothers descended, and both these two kinds of differings are (in my minde) greatly to be commended, not onely for that they may be made large and apparent, and for that cause serue very properly to the vse for which Badges are ordained, but also that the one makes manifest a gratefull minde (in him that is aduanced) to his prince or lord of whom he receiued benefit, and by reason thereof linketh them togither in a kinde of amitie, which seldome or neuer is worne out, and by that meanes a great strengthening it is vnto both houses.</p>
            <p>The other not onely serueth to vnite the families which haue matched togither in the foresaid loue and amitie, and thereby wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the like effect, but besides it sheweth the certainty of the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sending of the said yoonger brother out of both the said houses, and also giueth knowledge of the time thereof, whereby if any title of inheritance be at any time cast vpon the yoonger brother, either descending from ancestor of the fathers side, or mothers, it giues him a testimonie of his title, and witnesseth vnto the world the truth of his descent by the continuall bearing of that deuise, so that this kind may (many times) worke profit to the bearer, and auoid many troubles and sutes: and therefore into one of these kind of differings could I wish our yoonger brothers, which from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth shalbe aduanced, to inuest them selues, as being both hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, faire, certaine, and profitable. But now it may be obiected that the order in vse sheweth plainly ynough the diuersitie of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the cressant a second, the mollet the third, that by this means the matters are made certaine: to this I answere, that first the time is not (by this means) signified, neither can it be known which of the Cressant bearers was the vncle or nephew. And further it is a very vsuall matter for euery new Riser at this day, if he can find that there is any of the like Surname that beareth marke, presently to vsurpe the same with a Cressant or some such difference, so that (for my owne part) I do seldome credit such kinde of differinges nor their bearers, vnles it be by some other testimony or proofe made manifest, which cannot be counterfetted so well in the other deuise, except the riser should be throughly acquainted with the descent of him whose line he seeketh to intrude himselfe into, and besides, it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21144:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be the sooner espied by them of the true line &amp; forbidden, nor the other dare (for feare thereof) so soone venter the committing of a falsitie. But what a confusion is it when you shall see the second of a second brother, and sometimes an other second from him, to cluster one Cressant vpon an other, many times three or foure, one on horsebacke vpon an other, where as by the aforesaid bearing of the difference from the Prince, Lord, or mothers family, a man may better distinguish the brothers and set downe for a second, a third, and fourth, &amp;c. And after from those againe, in a fairer, larger, and more apparent manner: And the more apt am I to speake against these ordinary differences (as they are called) knowing them to be but new inuentions, and any of them as ordinaries (in fashion as now they are) neuer vsed before the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt, before which time men were much more warie and discreet in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their marks, and in foreseeing that no intruders should enter into their families, nor that any should lay away or remoue their differings without speciall warrant or license of them that thereby might be preiudiced: for a Labell being much in vse for the heire apparent (to wear as his difference during his fathers life) was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome remooued to the second brother, but when the inheritance went vnto the daughters of the elder brother, and then the second was permitted to beare the same for his difference, as being the heire male of his familie and as one that remained in expectancie, yet might not the second brother vse to intrude himselfe into the absolute signes of his house (the inheritance being in his neeces or kinswomen) as appeared in the case betweene <hi>Gray</hi> of Ruthine and <hi>Hastings</hi> which was this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> married to his first wife <hi>Izabell</hi> one of the sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and heires of <hi>Almerie de vallence</hi> Earle of Penbrooke, by whom he had issue <hi>Iohn Hastings</hi> (after Earle of Penbrooke) <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of Ruthin) and some other children which needs not to be spoken of, for that (as I take it) al the lines of them failed before the extinguishing of the line of the said <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of penbrooke: after (such issue being had) the said <hi>Izabell Vallence</hi> died, and the said <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> tooke to a second wife <hi>Izabell</hi> the daughter of <hi>Hugh Spenser,</hi> by whom he had issue <hi>Hugh Hastings,</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and then died, and left as heire <hi>Iohn</hi> his son by his first wife (who was Earle of Penbrooke as I haue said, erected by reason
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21144:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his mothers inheritance) which <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Penbrooke married and had issue an other Earle of Penbrooke, who also married and had issue a third Earle of Penbrooke, but in the end all the line of the said <hi>Iohn Hastings</hi> (first Earle of Penbrooke of that familie) fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there arose a question betwixt the heires of <hi>Roger Gray</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife being sister (of the whole blood) and the heires of <hi>Hugh Hastings</hi> brother (of the halfe blood) to the said <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Penbrooke, for the inheritance of the <hi>Hastings.</hi> But <hi>Gray</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the same (by the law that saith, <hi>Possessio fratris de feodo simplici facit sororem esse haeredem</hi>) called the said <hi>Hastings</hi> also (hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued the difference of his marke for that he was then heire male of that house) into the Court of cheualry, and there hauing a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against him, the said <hi>Hastings</hi> was compelled to vse a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (which was a Label of siluer) vpon his marke, a faire red sleeue of his Ladies vpon his golden vesture: Since which the heires of that yoonger familie haue vsed the said Labell euen vntill this our age. So that you may see by this that the law was then taken to be such, that such an heire male as had not the inheritance of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors should not be suffered to beare his marke without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it should seeme (by this) that the issue of them that had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the heire generall of any familie (being by reason thereof pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the lands) had not onely an interest in the Armes, but might also forbid any man the bearing thereof: and moreouer it would also appeare that the law was then supposed to be such, that the owner of euery marke might dispose of the same, as of his lands and inheritance, and that the <hi>Donee</hi> had power (by vertue of such gift) to vse the same as his owne proper Armorie, for I haue seene a deed importing thus much:

            <p>There is also another matter out of square, which is, that euerie man that obtaineth large possessions (whether the same be acquired by his iudgment in law, traffike in marchandize, or any other meane) yea although neuer any of his progenitors (from whom he can deriue himselfe) had the charge to lead
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21144:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men of armes, will yet at this day intrude themselues into the badges and marks of soldiers: for although such as be descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from men of martiall discipline, haue an interest in their ancestors marks (amongst other their goods) and therefore may shew foorth the same to their predecessors glorie, and their owne (in respect of their descent) yet such men as rise by their sciences, iudgements, or skill in other arts, affaires, or trades (although they be to be reuerenced for their wisedome &amp; praisefull actions, and had in honor answerable to their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and dignities) haue yet little to do with the marks or badges of soldiers. For although a reuerent Iudge that hath ministred law and iustice a long time (and that so long as that thereby to his great glorie) he hath obtained reputation, wealth, and reuenue, is to be had in high estimation, and in respect thereof to haue allowed him some note or marke of honor fit for his calling, yet (to my simple iudgement) the same should be disposed vnto him after the old Romane order by signifying the maner of his rising, rather than to put a corselet on his back, a burgonet on his head, a target on his arme, and a sword by his side, being things that would cumber greatly the good old man to vse, either for his owne defence, or but to shew (by way of triumph) for his glorie, sithence neither is it tolerable (by reason of his age) nor in his youth did he exercise himselfe in welding thereof. And as these things are vnseeming for him to weare, no more can I see any reason why he should deck vp the moniments of his house with such signes or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, except he can deriue himselfe from an ancestor that hath had the vse of such things, and then (to set them foorth as a glorie to his deceased parent) will greatly augment the regard of his rising, which rising yet (of it selfe) is a sufficient honor, the same being by any iust, vertuous, or laudable meanes. And these new risings I could wish to be of more reputation than they seeme to be esteemed of, either by others, or themselues that so rise, as is apparent by manie of their dooings, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themselues into marks of Antiquitie, and setting foorth of descents, wherein they are yet faine many times either to counterfet, or else to deriue themselues from some poore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which they (either truly, or by surmize) alledge to haue descended from some ancient familie, and that haue been by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21144:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some accident or other in former time decaied: wherein me thinkes men do greatly mistake the matter, for that (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) a man that is but of meane parentage and riseth by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable meanes, is equiualent to him that riseth from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied familie, namely when his said parent hath been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne for offence, as many times they alledge (in plaine termes) which yet is to be vnderstood although it were neuer spoken of, for that God in his iustice (seldome I suppose) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth any of estate, except for some great offence by some of the house committed, although (peraduenture) the same lies hid to the world &amp; appeereth not. But this being an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is daily in question amongst learned men, I wil leaue to them to be discussed, and returne to my former purpose, which is, that I could wish euerie man that raiseth a house by his good industry, should be honored with some such badge or marke, as should be answerable to the qualitie of his rising, and not euerie man of what condition soeuer they be, to entrude themselues into the signes and markes of soldiers, and such as follow the field with martiall exploits.</p>
            <p>Some people also there are that be so precise, as that they do disallowe altogither the setting foorth of any memory of well deseruing men, which haue shewed themselues valiant either in the act of Religion, their Princes seruice, or defence of their countrie, neither allowing their posteritie to set foorth any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of their praises, nor suffering any moniments or garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to remaine of their burials, as though it were a matter offensiue to God to haue goodmen well spoken of, or their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous doings by their obsequies either reuerenced, or by anie record, remembred: To such men I haue not thought it amisse to shew them their error by directing them to such places of Scripture as do not onely tolerate and allow of such actions, but also praise and commend the dooing thereof, and in some sorte charge and command the same to be done, wherby both they may (if they be not obstinate) reforme their misconceaued opinions, and others may be fortified in their praisefull ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors towards the honoring of vertuous and woorthie men, to the animating of posteritie to imitate their laudable actions, sithence indeed the chiefest matter that stirreth vp men to do well next their zeale to God, and the loue of vertue it selfe, is to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21144:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinke that not onely their soules shall be rewarded with the mercies of God, but also that their doings shall be had in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent remembrance with the reports of all good men that shall speake of them: And first, that the vsing, bearing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth of Banners, Ensignes and markes of armorie are allowable by the sacred scriptures, it appeareth by the holie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist Saint <hi>Luke</hi> recording the peregrination of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and speaking of armorie without reprehension (which he would not haue done had the vse thereof been offensiue) in this sort:
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Act. Apost. Cap. 28.</note>Post menses autem tres nauigauimus in naui Alexandrina, quae in insula Hyemauerat, cui erat insigne Castorum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the booke of Numeri God by his prophet <hi>Moyses</hi> commandeth his people of Israel to deuide and dispose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into companies by their Ensignes &amp; Banners speaking vnto them in these words:
<q>

            </p>
            <p>So that by this you may see, that as these matters be no new inuentions of men, so they are also things allowable by the word of God.</p>
            <p>Neither do obsequies or moniments ensuing woorthie acts want the authoritie of Scriptures, for in the booke of Numeri it is written thus:

            </p>

            <p>And for the collection of Genealogies thus saith God to <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Eleasar:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. cap. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Numerate omnem summam filiorum Israel à viginti annis &amp; suprà, per domos &amp; cognationes suas, cunctos qui possunt ad bella procedere: &amp;c. Ruben primogenitus Israel huius filius, Henoch, à quo familia Henochitarum: &amp; Phallu, à quo familia Phallui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum: &amp; Hesron, à quo familia Hesronitarum.</hi> And for a further proofe of the recording of Genealogies, it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how diligently the same hath beene obserued through the whole course of the Scriptures, as the descents from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noe,</hi> and from <hi>Noe</hi> to <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> do sufficiently testifie. And more that with the spirit of truth the Genealogie of Christ our Sauiour and redeemer as concerning his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is also by the writing of his holie Euangelistes most plainelie and sincerely remembred and set downe. All these things being therefore by the Scriptures of God, and decider of all controuersies, prooued and declared: Your Lordships may see that the bearing of Armes, raising and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Standerds, Banners and Ensignes, vsing of obsequies, erecting of moniments, enroling and regestrings of pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and descentes haue ioyned to the auncient customes and Lawes both of this Land and all other nations, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Gods word being very well accompanied with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reason, and iudgement, for God hauing by his sacred institution ordeined Kingdomes, Prouinces, and Seignories, and that ouer them Kings, Princes and Magistrates, shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, rule and gouerne his people, to the ende chiefely that his heauenly kingdome may be replenished with the blessed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21144:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soules of his seruants, for the instructing whereof he hath also ordeined his holy Church, and the Bishops, pastors and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the same, which Bishops and other spirituall officers cannot so well enforme his Christan people without the aid of the said Kings and temporall Lords: neither can they gouerne their particular Countries either from the inuasion of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tyrants or inward rebels, but through the vse of their sword of iustice, which sword cannot be exercised against vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly persons being of strength wanting men skilful in Martiall Discipline, who cannot manage those affaires but by meane of the aforesaid Armes and ensignes, in maner as before I haue more largly expressed. And in like sort as Princes, great Lords, Iudges, Magistrates and Gouernors, do vse to weare sacred Robes of gold, purple, scarlet, and other ornaments and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, not to take pride in, or for any vaine ostentation or show, but onely that they may be distinguished from the inferior peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the end that a reuerent regard may be had of them in respect of the high office which vnder God here on earth they beare. And as these things no man of any reason will gainsay, so I see not but as wel may their iust vertues and good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be remembred with funerals, obsequies, and moniments, after their decease, whereby such as succeed in gouernment may also be had in more high estimation, and a faire example is thereby giuen them to imitate the regiment of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. Likewise doth the registring of descents carrie with it reason ioined to authoritie and custome, for as by Gods lawe there is commanded a priuiledge of enheritance to the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of Israell, and so for want of sonnes to the females, and from them to others answerable to the proximitie of their blood and kindred, which with our lawes of this land, and of most nations do concur and agree, it doth well stande with peacefull gouernment for the auoiding of contentions which may rise for want of records, to testifie the truth of mens titles to their enheritances, that Genealogies and Pedegrees should be enrolled and kept in remembrance.</p>
            <p>I haue my good Lords stood the longer vpon this point, for that of late traueling through some countries of this Land, and hauing a desire to see the moniments of antiquitie which haue remained in such places as I passed by, for which cause as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21144:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
otherwise I many times resorted to Churches and other hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to satisfie my affection, I found that many moniments both of burials and in glasse were so broken and defaced, that vneth may be had any knowledge what the fragments remaining did signifie: and enquiring of the inhabitance how it came to passe that those things were so blemished, they made report that certaine persons, delighting as may seeme in noueltie, for they can abide no marke of antiquitie, had defaced the same. These men that take vpon them to be reformers, whose desires are great through the singularitie &amp; pride they haue in their owne wits and vnderstandings, weening themselues to be very wise, where indeed they are verie simple, and onely looke but into the abuses of things, and do not see into the grounds &amp; depth of the reasons and causes for which good ordinances were made, go about to finde faults, where many times none are, but if peraduenture they hap to finde an ordinance well made misused, then streight neuer seeke they to reforme the abuse, but by their wils, downe goeth ordinance and all, such is their insolencie, rashnes, and want of iudgement. It were well done therefore my good Lords, and I could wish that your Honors hauing somtimes accesse to hir Maiestie, and oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with my Lords of hir priuie Councell, should enforme hir Highnes, and their Honors of the said abuses committed, and to be thereby a meane that these simple fellowes taking vpon them to be reformers, might be reformed themselues, and both kept from destroieng of good ordinances, and be punished for their offences in that behalfe committed. In the meane time yet shall I desire that Honorable personages will looke better to the moniments of their ancestors, by correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the destroiers thereof, and therein to imitate the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions of <hi>William Fleetwood,</hi> Serieant at the Law, and Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Citie of London, who being commissioner amongst others for the visitation of causes Ecclesiasticall, by the Princes authoritie, by vertue thereof imprisoned certaine wilfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that had defaced the moniment of Queene <hi>Katherine Dowyger</hi> at Peterborough, vntil such time as they had reformed the same, which thing was through his good endeuor reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and perfected againe, and so remaineth to this daie: for although some happily see standing those of their own parents,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21144:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet it were good they should foresee that no others be pulled downe, for that there is not to be looked for but that suffering such iniuries to rest vnpunished, the dooers thereof wil in time growe more insolent, and haue a cast to ouerthrowe theirs also.</p>
            <p>And now being in speech of moniments, I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ignorance who make small account of anie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestour except before the Conquest, weening that all that lie crosse-legged so were: and that all ancient euidence without date is the like: whereas the one was not had in vse vntil after the Palestine wars, and the other, such as be sealed, be also since the Conquest, for I could neuer see nor heare of any that had seene sealed deed, but the same was made sithence the Conquest of this Land, when the vse (as I take it) of sealing with waxe first began in England.</p>
            <p>But these men will not stoupe one iote vnder the Conquest, telling manie fables of their ancestors then preseruing their houses, Honors, &amp; Armories, forgetting quite that it is much more glorious and honorable to be descended from a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous nation conquering, then such people by plaine feate of Armes subiuged, for as the Poet saith,
<q>
                  <l>quis enim sua praelia victus</l>
                  <l>Commemorare velit? referam tamen ordine, nec tam</l>
                  <l>Turpe fuit vinci, quàm contendisse decorum est,</l>
                  <l>Magnaque dat nobis tantus solatia victor.</l>
               </q>
So that if they haue any thing praise woorthie left to brag of, it is that they well contended with so puissant conquerors, which were then in their time as wise, glorious, and famous a nation as were in the whole world to be found.</p>
            <p>Another sort there be not much more skilfull, who if they see any Armorie, straight enter into the comparison of the fairenes thereof: and foule and false is it, if mettall lie vpon met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall alone, or colour vpon colour: And yet I could wish we should neuer haue more dishonorable men nor woorse soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than haue so borne their Armorie: for to omit that woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and that <hi>Mack Morise</hi> king of Lymster in Ireland, whose onely daughter and heire was married to <hi>Richard Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe</hi> Earle of Penbroke, and bare in a blacke shield a red ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Leon, of our owne sir <hi>Richard Sanbach</hi> of Sanbach in Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21144:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sir <hi>William Wakbirge</hi> of Wakbirge in Darbyshire, two vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knights, yet both bare colour vpon color. Passing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of examples, I will onely recite the words of mine Author speaking of the aduentures of a braue Knight in the companie of sir <hi>Robert Canole</hi> resting by Parris, this Knight hauing vowed to strike with his launce on the barriers of the citie, performed it, and then the words be these: <hi>Celluy cheualier ie ne sca comment il auoit nom ne de quel pays il estoit mais s'armoit a gueulles a deux fous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses noyeres et vne bordure noyre non endente.</hi> And although I grant they be not so well to be discerned, as when mettal and colour be varied the one with the other, yet sithence the number be great of most woorthie men that haue borne their armes in such maner, I will esteeme their marks as honorable as the rest, and neuer impute any falsitie to them. And this kinde of men also commonly descant vpon the proportion, nature, and qualitie of the deuise, as if the name of <hi>Richard</hi> were better than <hi>Robert,</hi> and <hi>Ralph</hi> better than <hi>Roger,</hi> and in their conceits the Eagle or Faulcon are the fairest birds to be borne of all fethered foules, and so of other the like: when indeed except for the reuerence due to the bearers, who do honor their bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings by their renowme, vertue, and valure, otherwise there is no difference in the fairenes of marks: but that those onely are to be preferred which be easiest to be perceiued, discerned, and knowen to be the same things they be marked out for: And therefore the Capitale of Beusz blacke <hi>Midas</hi> head with his faire long Asse eares was as good a crest, as sir <hi>Iohn Chandos</hi> chiftains head proper in a white scarffe goodly enuellopped: and as faire a cote is <hi>Hopwells,</hi> being three red hares playing on bagpipes in a siluer shield, as <hi>Newinton</hi> which bare d'Azure three eglets d'Argent displaid. And now me thinks I heare some that esteeme me to mend, and become more fine, skilfull, and Herauld like in my emblazons, as vsing the French phrases of <hi>d'azyer &amp; d'argent,</hi> who thinke I doubt not, but that I haue committed a great error for want of vsing the said French phrases in my emblazons, notwithstanding I will ioine in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such as esteeme it to be more proper to speake and vse English termes and phrases in an English booke dedicated to Englishmen, than French or Latine, otherwise than cited authoritie leadeth.</p>

               <l>The French of life the hostages depriue:</l>

               <l>Such chaffring brought good harts their deadly paine,</l>
