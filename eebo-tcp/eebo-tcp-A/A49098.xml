         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>O Lovely London, the beauty of England, and admiration of the world, leave off thy haughty pride, and ambition, and put on thy ſute of Repentance, and Humility, for thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have broken their peace with the mighty Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion the Almighty God and governour of us all, his ſword is drawne againſt us, and what is the cauſe? Alas it is the multitude of our ſinnes; how many times hath our gracious God beene pleaſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us, in hope of our amendment? But alas, it is ſoone forgotten and out of mind! there are but few living about the City of London, that are of any age but may remember the time of dolor and woe, that was in and about this City of London, ſome eleven yeares ſince, and ſince that againe, God made a prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to give us warning: O doe but thinke how death did then play his part, the clamour of Bells ſounded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94004:3"/>
mournfully in our eares, to call ſome or other to their laſt home, and our hearts always trembling for feare of our ſelves, our eyes weeping for the loſſe of our friends, whereſoever wee went, griefes and lamentations were our companions: ſighes and ſobs our comforters, whileſt woe and miſery were our daily objects: the droſſe of this world was then worth nought, wee would have given all wee had, ſo that wee might have bribed death and taken any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for longer life: but no man might ranſome himſelfe, or redeeme his brother; the raging Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence tooke away the rich with the poore, the young with the aged, leaving our houſes deſolate, did fill our ſepulchers with the dead: what heart of ſtone was there whoſe eyes were ſpectators of this wofull ſight, and did not mourne and ſhed teares, but all this was ſoone forgotten, for truly I thinke I may ſay with a ſafe conſcience, that in a twelve moneth after, the ſinnes of the people was growne as great as they were before: thus in former time he hath laid his hand of viſitation upon us, in hope to make us amend our lives, but now alas, we doe exceed the former time, in our abominable prophaneneſſe, even our drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoredome, ſwearing, deſpiſing of Gods Word, contemning of his Ordinances, our diſſolut Sabbath-breaking, all which doth cauſe the very earth to mourne, the beaſts of the field to repine, and the comfortable Sunne which ſometimes doth make the graſſe and flowers to ſpring, is now ready to burne them all away, if God ſhould goe to juſtice and paſſe judgement upon us according to our deſerts, we ſhould bee utterly conſumed, but hee with a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94004:3"/>
viſitation doth warne us to repentance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returne O London, &amp; put on thy mourning gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that thy neighbours round about thee, may be provoked to commiſerate thee in this thy affliction. For, what earthly Judge living in the whole world is there, that will alwayes ſhew favour to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary malefactor? or, what earthly King will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes give pardon to a rebellious ſubject? and ſhall the mighty King of Kings alwayes give pardon to us that are rebellious ſinners? Now ſeeing it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that ſin is the cauſe of ſickneſſe: It may appeare as plainly that prayer muſt be the beſt meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure health and ſafety, let not our ſecurity and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe give death opportunity, what man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will not ſeeme to ſtart, at the ſigne of the red Croſſe, as they paſſe by to and fro in the ſtreets? and yet being gone they thinke no more on it. It may bee they will ſay, ſuch a houſe is ſhut up, I ſaw the red croſſe on the doore but looke on thine owne guilty conſcience, and thou ſhalt find thou haſt a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of red crimſon ſinnes remaining in thee, thou canſt ſpy the mote in thy brothers eye, but thou canſt not ſee the beame in thine owne eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou ſeeſt thy neighbour puniſhed with Gods angry viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, doe thou fall to prayer for feare the Lord lay the like on thee, ſuppoſe thou wert at Sea and ſee thy neighbours drowned before thy face, by reaſon of the ſtormes and tempeſts, wilt not thou preſently ſeeme to pull in thy ſailes and eſcape drowning if thou canſt poſſibly? yes ſure, I thinke thou wilt, doſt thou ſee thy neighbours houſe on fire? it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves thee to bee carefull of thine owne: in like
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94004:4"/>
manner, it behooves one and all of us, to bee carefull at this time, let others harmes be our armes, for God hath ſent forth his Angell of wrath, and nothing can appeaſe him but prayers, wee muſt ſprinkle out cheekes with teares, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did the poſts of their doores with the blood of the Paſchall Lambe: Let us turne to the Lord with faſting, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning, it is he that muſt be our Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for there is no helpe in any mortall man, but onely in God: if the Lord ſhould ſtrike us with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that were a thing would torment us ten times more, or if the Lord ſhould give us over to the hand of our enemies, that were a thing moſt lamentable, doe but thinke what care and dolour appertaines thereto, would it not grieve any Chriſtian to ſee their goods diſtributed before their faces themſelves, like to bee murdered, or their poore Infants ſlaine before their eyes? O this is a thing moſt lamentable and full of feare: but thanks be given to God, we are not troubled with no ſuch thing, nor I hope never ſhall bee. It is our ſinnes have made this breach with God, and it muſt be our Prayers that muſt ſtop this breach, therefore let all good Chriſtians pray to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to ceaſe this viſitation.</p>
