            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE best excuse that can be given for a Preface before a Play, is when the Reader is not troubled with an Apology for the Authors faults, it being too much to abuse his patience with both; since if just, they will soon be perceived by an impartial apprehension, and more, that he bestows on the world a needless So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism; there being nothing more hard, then to cozen men by an excuse of Wit, for which the generality of judgments have so little kindness, as they will hardly receive any; nor do I find that the Antient Poets, or any of most repute of our Modern, assumed this kind of vindication to themselves; though perhaps they might have done it, with more assurance of success, then any that now most confidently undertake it; either as they contemn'd the impotent censures and cavils, that were spread against their performances, or else a judicious confirmation in themselves, that their works were the best defiances that could be given their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Not that I judge our unimitable <hi>Johnson,</hi> or those wonders of Wit, <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> were without their failings, or that in some things, their Plays were not questionable, as well as ours; though I could wish our Muses were so happily adorned, as their spots and
<pb facs="tcp:65848:3"/>
beauties appear together: and I doubt it may be truly affirmed, that in the greatest of their failings, they fell more below themselves, then beneath us; which gives us some caution not to be too busie with their faults.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to be excellent, and another to be absolutely perfect; the Diamond doth require some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, though of most commendable figure and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: The like may be said of these excellent Poets, their thoughts were always pretious, though not alike polished and set off by themselves.</p>
            <p>Wit is one of the best Talents of nature, but like her other productions in Men, must not expect an absolute perfection; it hath been long a growing from the Antients to the Modern, and from them to us, and yet we do not find its growth compleated; like ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it seems to have no limit, and yet confin'd in its as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring: there are some, perhaps, vain enough to judge it high in themselves, though far enough from the top of <hi>Parnassus;</hi> and notwithstanding all the hast, such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make, I doubt whether the swiftness of their Muse may not fail them by the way.</p>
            <p>Most men are naturally inclin'd to give to Antiquity its due respects, and there is some reason for it (if no more) in that we must be old our selves; but he were weakly an admirer of times past, that by an over dotage on them, would continue himself in a Childhood of knowledge; since that were to go backward with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, as we set too forward theirs, they have their fame, and we must expect ours; though at present they challenge so long a prescription, that until ours
<pb facs="tcp:65848:3"/>
does number more then the three parts of an age, in equal repute with theirs. I make some doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the best Rhime, or Reason, that the Stage is now beholding to, will establish us as great in the judgment of those who shall succeed us; which, as I am far from assuming it to my self, in behalf of any undertaking of mine, so I shall as unwillingly allow it to the boldest of Pretenders; besides this, we are obliged in so great a measure to those great Artificers of Invention, and Wit, by which they raised our Stage to its former glory, as also in a high degree for those excellent rules and observations, which (if well heeded) cannot but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our endeavours in this kind, and from whom (if we do well) it is impossible to differ so far, as to declare them Enemies, and like the example of the <hi>Trojan Hero,</hi> to erect a Trophee and superscribe on it,</p>
            <q>Aeneas haec de Danais victoribus arma.</q>
            <p>Butas I am nothing concern'd, or envy the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any man, on what account soever the world is pleased to allow it him; so I conceive that others have as little to do with mine, and I will be as free in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering my opinion, as I willingly allow them the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theirs; since I do not conceive the Muses have yet established their Dictator in Poetry; though I am not desirous to controvert any thing (except I shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily mov'd thereunto) and which signifies little more then to try who can squirt Ink sarthest: to which purpose, I will retire to my self, desiring the Readers excuse, that I have led him so far about, before I have spoken of my Play; in order to which, I have chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:65848:4"/>
design'd this discourse; having made my self so far a party on the side of our former Poets, that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this Play in some resemblance to theirs of the like nature, which in my judgment I have esteemed best. I have given it the name likewise of Tragi-Comedy, as I find they have done some of theirs, which I need not particularize to the Reader, because they are well enough known to be at this day no inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ornament and entertainment of the Stage; not that I will undertake to justifie the word (since every Play, if strictly taken, must be either Tragedy or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, excluding Farce, which does not so much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a <hi>Dramatis Personae</hi> to be set before it, as we shall soon manifest) And it was doubtless created by former Poets, who finding that mixt Plays were very sutable to the English Stage, and that it was somewhat below the denomination of their Heroicks to call them simply Comedies (which as they are corruptly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, imply, little more then scurrility and laughter, though of far greater dignity, if rightly apply'd) They allow'd them the names of Tragi-Comedies, &amp; I do not find but the highest of our English Tragedies (as <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, The Maids Tragedy, Rollo, The Cardinal and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor)</hi> considerable enough to be rank'd with the best of these, are at all undervalued by their Authors, in being sweetned with mirth; for as all people do not come pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to sympathize their passions with those of the Plays, so some will expect to be diverted accordingly; nor do I believe that it is less natural (as some have thought) to form a Play, that shall have this variety of
<pb facs="tcp:65848:4"/>
Genius, then I do to find of mankind some grave, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, fierce, cruel, others of more aiery and pleasant converse, to mingle humours and affairs together.</p>
            <p>If we take our observations from the Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before we descend lower, we shall find it familiar enough (and doubtless Plays are most profitable as well as delightful, when they so represent humane things and actions, as even the greatest are as obvious to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques, as those of a lower orb of experience) nor do I conceive any kind of Plays more difficult to be truly form'd, then such as have this Heroick mixture, because it is not easie to give humour and mirth a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rise and generous correspondency with the grandeur of the other, which if sutable in point of character, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not render it less grateful to the Audience, it being as it were two Plays in one.</p>
            <p>Nor do I find that the serious Plays (now in use) wholly relie upon their Heroick foundation, why else are we diverted by Scenes, Machins, Habits, Jiggs, and Dances; but to give more variety of entertainment to the Spectators? either as they are not otherwise to be trusted, or least the Audience should be too soberly tired without them, which I will not presume to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: and whether it be not as natural to admit of a course of Comedy that is made essential to the Plot and dignity of the Play; I leave it to my Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>Verse that ends in Rhime is generally now the Mode of Heroick Plays, but whether so natural and proper, I will not controvert, otherwise then by declaring my
<pb facs="tcp:65848:5"/>
opinion, that I like it not so well as I do Verse without it, and I conceive I have reason enough on my side; for who can believe that words must not of necessity lose much of their grace, and emphasis, when deliver'd in Rhime, which limits so much of both to it self; or that the thoughts of <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Tragedies could have been so well, or better expressed in any language whatsoever in Rhime (though to an ear that is most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the noise) then they are delivered by him; or that our former Poets have been exceeded in heighth of expression and fancy, because their Muses have mounted without these Bells jingling at their heels; doubtless a judicious spirit may soon observe the difference, nor can lines in Rhime ever run so smooth, but there will be some unnaturalness in them as to the freedom of dialogue, and converse (which Plays should resemble) because Verse of that kind will of necessity be sententious and restrain it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be improper to manage the various intregues of a Play, or else in plain terms be forced to want them: Nor is a grave or wise manner of speaking to be allow'd the wittiest, because that which is sober enough as to Wisdom, may be far enough off from being Witty; and he that will not grant the former to be more easie to invent, must conclude that the Wit of Poetry is as familiar with Men as Gravity and Prudence; nay, it is plainly to be observed, that generally Men write better for the Stage this way, (I mean in Rhime) then they have, or can do, after the manner of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poets without it; which is some demonstration
<pb facs="tcp:65848:5"/>
that the latter is less difficult, though more unnatural then the former: And for my greater Authority I will adde these few excellent Verses of our Famous <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> on this subject, which he calls a fit Rhime against Rhime.
<q>
                  <l>Rhime the rack of finest Wits</l>
                  <l>That extracteth but by fits</l>
                  <l>True conceipts,</l>
                  <l>Spoiling senses of their treasure,</l>
                  <l>Couzening judgment with a measure,</l>
                  <l>But falle weights.</l>
                  <l>Soon as lazie thou wert known,</l>
                  <l>All good Poetry hence was flown, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
And as I doubt not well enough to wave any oblique exception that any man can throw on my Opinion (since patronized by his) so I do not detract from the deserts of any who have done well in this kind, otherwise then by declaring, that as I find it not used by our former Poets, I likewise do not approve it, or have made use of it in this Play of mine; 'tis true, according to their example (which I wish I could have better imitated) I have writ a Masque in Rhime, and closed some Scenes, and all my Acts likewise with it, which places have ever been allowed most proper for it, because they are Period in which the Audience may best expect a weighty and sententious close; and whensoever Verse was us'd by <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> as it is in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s <hi>Ghost,</hi> or scatter'd in some places in <hi>Sejanus;</hi> I cannot but observe his Art and Nature together, in not confining the periods of sense and Rhime together (as is too much us'd now)
<pb facs="tcp:65848:6"/>
but most commonly by carrying the sense of one verse into part of another, which Elevates the stile of Verse (as is to be seen in <hi>Virgil)</hi> and without which it will never shew so like Prose, and proper for Dialogue, as it ought to do; an example to be worthily imitated by such as will write in Verse, to whose consideration I presume to commend it.</p>
            <p>In the Epick way, I judge that Rhime is far more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, (though the Antients us'd it not) because Verse of that kind may be granted to appear more grave and stately, which represents a continued gravity of Style and Matter, (which not withstanding, by reason of the great extent of the Argument, the variety of the Descriptions and Dialogues, will be more varied in this then in any other manner of using Verse, as is well known to the judicious) besides, that our English Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is neither so copious and great, as Greek or Latin, as must needs be perceived in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> Translated; so that though Rhime in Verse be of little use to sense (and consequently one of the poorest ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of the Muses) yet as it confers on Verse a Solid and sententious manner of expression (a fault in Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Poesie, if two frequently us'd, as is discours'd before) I conceive it may be decently admitted in the Epick way; but then it ought to be written with a free and unconfined nature, as is before instanc'd in the measures of <hi>Virgil;</hi> and as it is my judgment, so I have made it practicable in that small Heroick Poem of mine, called <hi>The Brittish Princess,</hi> which I will not presume to commend, more then that it is so far at least an imitator of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65848:6"/>
Neither do I believe that Sir <hi>William D'avenant,</hi> who was the first introducer of Rhime on the Stage, did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise intend it then for vocal Representations, and <hi>Operas,</hi> (in which it may do well) rather then for Plays, as was known in his <hi>Peru, and Siege of Rhodes.</hi> And I presume that my Lord of <hi>Orrery</hi> (whose Ingenuity in Verse brought it more in fashion; in those ornaments he bestowed on the Stage in <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and other of his Heroick Compositions) would not judge it a debasing of their worth, if they were distinguished by the name of Poems, instead of Plays, for reasons that he is better able to give himself, then any which I have here presumed to offer; but enough of this subject, which I thought fit to touch, to justifie so far my excuse in not complying in my Play, with that manner of Verse written in others.</p>
            <p>As likewise that I have not been help'd by any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story or known Tale in forming of my Plot (not but that I conceive it very allowable, if well managed, and that the truth of History be not evidently impaired by it, which were to render the actions of men contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory and fabulous, where they are otherwise verifyed by authority) being willing to believe that a reasonable Genius (and such a one I will only presume to) might produce that which should be at least as new and useful, as any thing could be taken from either; nor do I find but the greatest Plays formerly were the Poets own Tales, as well as Plots; and doubtless they found few better then they could devise, as also that it was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and delightful for them to manage such best.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65848:7"/>
There are three things which chiefly the Muses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to compleat their perfections; the first is the beauty of Invention or Design, its two fair seconds, Eloquence and Wit, with an useful improvement of these to our converse and manners, (nor did I ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any man so ignorantly confident to affirm, that a Poem, or Play, could be compleated with Humours and Characters alone) though above all, the first is to be allowed the greater value, as being the fountain from whence these streams must flow.</p>
            <p>Thus a Poet is said to be a maker or feigner, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies in Greek, from whence it is derived according to <hi>Aristotle;</hi> in like manner the Structures of Poesie are not decently to be raised like other buildings, in which the foundation is the design of one man, the model anothers, the fitting of the timber, and other materials a thirds; whilest the Poet should not only be the sole Architect, but all other operations contrived and performed by himself; besides it destroys the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Fiction (the exercise of the Muses) pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioning those wings they delight to spread, and doth advantage, though little more, then to be lazily diligent; insomuch that it is very observable, since Translating hath been so much practis'd, and taking from Romances and Foreign Plays, the compositions arising from them appear not less disproportion'd and uneven, then if a Painter undertaking to describe a History, should from the drawings of Masters, and Figures in Print (to a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious eye very discernable) take a posture from one, a head from another, a body from a third, and having
<pb facs="tcp:65848:7"/>
put them on such legs as he shall make for them, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently averre he hath performed the noble invention and design that belongs to a Story Painter. And I doubt not to affirm, that the great veneration and repute of former Tales amongst the Antients, lessened not only fiction and contrivance in their works, but in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did mightily prejudice most of all their Successors in Poesie, who have endeavoured to lay their designs after the same manner; insomuch, that who judicially examine it, may soon find how thin and deficient their Poems were, in respect of that beauty their sublime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions gave them, (excepting <hi>Virgill</hi>'s the Prince of Poets to which I attribute all things) And had they equally been happy in the glory of the other, there had been small honour to have been gotten by the Muses at this day.</p>
            <p>And that I may come nearer my Reader, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to say, that I should be unwilling (for the reasons here given) to have been Author of the contrivance of <hi>Statius, Tasso,</hi> or any I have seen since <hi>Virgil</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick way, as in the Dramatick I dislike the <hi>Tragedian Seneca</hi> in the choice of his Argument and Characters, in both of which, he is so far out-done by our <hi>English</hi> Poets, that he cannot in that kind (notwithstanding the greatness of his thoughts) stand in any comparison with them; which can be attributed to no other cause, then his doting on those pitiful Tales of <hi>Medea, Hippolitus, Theseus, Hercules,</hi> and the like (that were less worthily then long the esteem of Antient Poets;) and it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more a wonder, that the Schools being so frequent
<pb facs="tcp:65848:8"/>
amongst them in those days, they should forget to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this obvious Philosophical Maxim, <hi>Omne agens agit propter finem,</hi> which as it holds in all humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so its prudence ought to be heightned as far as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, both in Epick, and Dramatick writing.</p>
            <p>I confess a Poet should not be so negligent, as to be unacquainted with the Tales and Fictions of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, in which he ought to be well knowing, as far as necessary, or as he ought to be conversant with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learning of times past, since the Muses seldom vouchsafe their favours, where there is not a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sutable to their dignity and greatness; as it were absurd to invite a Queen, and have no ornaments fit for her reception; so on the other side, the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of literature should be rather assistant to Fiction, then any way burthening or depressing it; <hi>Virgil</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of all Poets was most learn'd, yet shews us in all parts of his works, that his Muse was the Mistress of his Studies, and that their best splendors, were to serve for her greater delight and entertainment. In other Sciences, Learning is a Tutor, but in this of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Fiction must illustrate, and guide that, leading us unto those pleasant retirements of the Muses, where as from various and beautiful platforms of Gardens, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the particular designments of shades, walks, and flowers.</p>
            <p>Words are the children of thought, and man must be granted to have first imagined speech, before he could express any conception of his by words; so that thought, was both the primitive ground, and glory of
<pb facs="tcp:65848:8"/>
Tongues, which successively came to be more improved; and doubtless it was the Wit of Poets that (above all) refin'd their own languages; so that I wonder to find it affirmed, that <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> (who had such a soul of thought) did by Translating beautifie our Tongue; as if his ingenuity was not to be allowed the glory of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far more by its single strength. I should be loth to wish any so ill, as that he were alive to answer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; however, I could be well content, that such as will make him their president in Translating from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, could dispose of it so well, and that they had like wise as much Wit, and Learning besides.</p>
            <p>Translating, may I grant, adds some perfection to a language, because it introduces the wit of others into its own words, as the <hi>French</hi> have of late done well in theirs; and we have pretty well requited their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to us, in rendring so much of theirs in ours; but where I can make use of good Originals, I shall be more sparing of my esteem of Copies, and I dare averre, that the Ingenuiries of <hi>Johnson, Beaumont,</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> with some other of our former Poets, left our language more improved, as it expressed their thoughts, then if the best of <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Wit, had been Translated by the greatest of Pens. I wish it be our good fortune (for the benefit of future times) to leave our Tongue as much inlarged and imbellished, as they left it to us.</p>
            <p>With as little reason can any man affirm, that <hi>Virgil</hi> did not elevate the Latin Tongue to that strength and sublimeness of style, from the vivacity of his thoughts, rather then from those few conceptions, and perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:65848:9"/>
the meanest of his works, which he copied from <hi>Homer,</hi> whether in honour of that antient Tale of <hi>Troy,</hi> or some other of his Fables which the world had long admired (as it was the manner of the Antients, as is already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) and I doubt are very imperfect in <hi>Homer,</hi> if compared with the manner of his delivering them in his second Book, for which his more victorious Laurel might deserve no less then what he expresses of himself, on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother occasion in his Georgicks, in reference to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Primus ego in patriam mecum (modo vita supersit)</l>
               <l>Aonio rediens deducam vertice musas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Works that are great and singular, will, and ought to be the imitation of men (as is more particularly the case of Epick Poesie) in those few Authors that have writ of it in so many Ages; so that <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Tasso</hi> had some kind of noble emulation in endeavouring to be the Successors of <hi>Virgil,</hi> notwithstanding they were behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for much of their Model and Characters, and could not come so near his height, as he exceeded <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;</hi> like small Structures that must be content to be over-looked by a more stately Palace, though they epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize its resemblance; whilest in the Dramatick way, the Genius of men hath not been so confin'd, nor any particular manner and authority in point of writing so much acknowledged for excellent; wherefore the same license is not reasonably to be admitted, but if we will needs make the first our Presidents, for the liberty that
<pb facs="tcp:65848:9"/>
is now taken in the latter, it were well for the Stage, if such things were only imitated of our Antient Poets, that have had transcendent applause from our former Theaters: And doubtless it is a commendable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Writers of what kind soever, if they endeavour to heighten their Works and Stiles, from the examples of others, that have been most approved in the same kind, (since example were of small use otherwise) as he that would be master of the Latin Tongue, might be well content to imitate the stiles of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Caesar;</hi> the like may be said of some excellent Presidents in our own Language, the defect whereof is no small rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that neither Latin, nor English is so well written, as it might be at this day.</p>
            <p>Having thus far discours'd of Heroick Plays (and such other things as I thought incident to them, and to which this Dramatick composition of mine is in part relating) I shall in the next place (though with less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity) give my Reader an account of the other part of it, which is Comedy, and of that kind of Poesie in general.</p>
            <p>Though the Nature of Comedy be not the same with Tragedy, the end of it is; for Instruction is the part of both, as man may be disciplin'd under several School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters.</p>
            <p>The word Comedy was derived from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or more largely understood by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients of a Play representing humane life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; whereas the business of Tragedy is in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature to dispose and elevate the intrigues of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections; I mean such as depend on Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:65848:10"/>
Revenge, Love, Honour, and the like, and so detect their vices accordingly. As it is the duty of Comedy to do the same, in those that come nearest our Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though it must be granted that the representation of Tragedy, cannot be so universally practicable (and consequently not of that benefit to mankind) because its concernments, and actions, are more sublime, and separated from the universality of men, rather fit only for the ear of Princes, (who are very often the greatest number of characters in a Tragical Fable) then for a lower degree of Persons; which shews us, that Comedy hath some merit above it, in that it is of a more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal nature. Upon which occasion our famous <hi>Johnson</hi> well observes, that <hi>Lysippus</hi> was not able to form with his Graver, or <hi>Apelles</hi> to Paint with his Pencil, those life stroaks and touches, that true Comedy represents, in respect of the various affections of the mind, in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the insolence of some in joy, the melancholy fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, the raging madness of such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done with love, avarice, riot, tortur'd with expectation, consum'd with fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he gives the example, and to whom we are obliged for so many excellent Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Characters to this purpose.</p>
            <p>And as Tragedy requires a strong intrigue and Plot (I wish it were more observed now adays) as being the representation of highest passions, and actions; so Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in like manner would abound with all delightful variety of both, by which we behold the humours, and inclinations of men, in due elevation, and magnitude; not that it is requisite that all the characters in a Play
<pb facs="tcp:65848:10"/>
should be equally great, or manage alike the main drift of the Drama, (as lines drawn from the center of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, have an equal extent within its circumference) but rather receive a becoming proportion, which is indeed the Golden Rule to be observed in Plays, and requires no less the invention, and skill of the Poet to make it practicable; for as in Mathematical Operations, there is nothing more hard then to be cunning in the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of lines, and figures they express; so the Poets disposition of his characters, ought in as high a degree to be proportionable to that body of thought he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs for them. This is that which enobles Language and Wit, giving to both a decorum on the Theater; for though the Muses prescribe few rules, they abhor irregularity, and license, 'tis their sublime instinct, where their excellencies meet in any, as is divinely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by <hi>Ovid.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Sedibus aethereis spiritus ille venit.</q>
            <p>And as <hi>Lipsius</hi> affirms, <hi>Scio Poetam neminem praestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fuisse, sine parte quadam uberiore divinae mentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plays that are Historical, or have much of narration in them, are generally ingrateful, because they dull the edge of the hearers, which as it is sharpen'd by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what is actually produc'd, so it is impair'd by hearing of relation instead of action, whether it be true or false, an unpardonable error in most of the <hi>French</hi> Writers, who it seems did not well apprehend that things actually represented, have more of nature, and life in them, then any account of them, that can be given in words; as likewise such Plays may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
<pb facs="tcp:65848:11"/>
the body of whose design consists more essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the mistakes of persons, then the intrigues of passions, as most of the <hi>Spanish</hi> do, and some of the <hi>French,</hi> where the grand design is to keep the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in suspence, till it end with discovery of the true person, by reason that it cannot be of so much concern to an Audience, as when Plays sympathize with those passions that are observable in men; which is so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I need say no more as to these particulars, they being equally defects in Tragedy and Comedy.</p>
            <p>And as Plays in either kind, ought to have the same end, in respect of manners, so there is an Analogy and commendable resemblance of characters in both, though of different natures, according to the rule, <hi>contraria jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta se apposita, magis elucescunt.</hi> For as in the characters of Tragedy there will be some violent in love, others haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rash, and turbulent, above what is ordinary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in men; so Comedy will have its extravagancies (besides many more) in morose, heedless, timorous and foolish persons, which are images of the like contrary effects of nature; in like manner, the designs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures depending on these, have their proportions; for as Dramatick characters will have some remoteness from the ordinary actions of men, so must their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings be sutable; wherefore I wonder to find it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that extravagancies of actions should be fixed on Farce, (which is rather an entertainment of Mimik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than a Play in any kind) since Plays must not be so even, as to represent nothing above nature, which were to make them more reasonable, then Poetical;
<pb facs="tcp:65848:11"/>
besides, it is a commendable license (especially in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) to represent what is rather useful to know, (as it seems actually done) then the possibility of it, so it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide well for our manners; as we see in Comedies, where we are taught from the mouths of Fools, and by such extravagancies as are in some kind impossible to be supposed, how we may become the wiser; why else did our learned <hi>Johnson</hi> compleat that great work of his Alchymist, with such persons that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a prosecution of extravagancy of humour or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility together, (except the making of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers Stone be held a known truth) or that his <hi>Dol Cômon</hi> representing the Queen of Fairies, was not to pass upon the weak capacity of <hi>Dapper</hi> deceived by it? The same may be affirmed of his <hi>Cynthias Revells,</hi> where <hi>Cupid, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Eccho</hi> have parts, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more extraordinary in his <hi>Devil's an Ass,</hi> where the grand Demon, and a lesser, are made characters, as Satyrical Reflections on Vanity and Vice, to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by them; which shews, that the truth or possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the characters, is less to be considered, then the Morality they aim at. <hi>Et hercule omnis salsa di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi ratio in eo est, ut aliter quam est rectum verumque dicatur,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> observes.</p>
            <p>As the chief end of Comedy is improvement of manners, so the mirth arising thence, is to entertain our passions, and affections with delight proper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; wherefore to make laughter the chiefest end of Comedy, is to impair its more superiour esteem, since what is ridiculous, is not therefore Comedy. If a
<pb facs="tcp:65848:12"/>
Clown were shewn in a Ladies Gown, or a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramuchio that provokes laughter, no otherwise then by making a wry face, or gesture, he must strangely participate of vulgar folly, that would call either of these the parts of Comedy, since they work nothing on the affections, no more then a man can be said to laugh properly without mirth, or be sick, and have no disease.</p>
            <p>But I need not trouble my Reader with a farther vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of comedy, (though it be some misfortune to our Theaters in being so little happy in it this Age) other then by taking leave to suppose, that it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valu'd most by such as do not rightly conceive of its worth, or else despair of writing, what shall merit its esteem or name.</p>
            <p>There is another sort of diversion on the Stage, much received of late (I will not question with what prudence) and that is Farce; which, as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, consists of Mimikry and other ridiculous Gestures mingled together, for which it may properly enough bear the denomination, though it is no more of kin to a Play, then a Mule is to a Horse, in having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer ears; or that a Pedlar who hath some things in his Pack, that Drapers and Silkmen furnish their Shops with, should be said to be of these Trades, though he hath none lawfully of his own.</p>
            <p>No less doth this <hi>French</hi> Mode of entertainment on our Theaters, vilifie mirth, and countenance for the most part debauchery, where it is frequent to observe, the waiting womans intrigue is to Pimp for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> for the <hi>Mounsieur</hi> he
<pb facs="tcp:65848:12"/>
serves, which performed with some ease in the compass of five Acts, they go to bed likewise for their labour; the rest of the characters have commonly so little to say for themselves, that a man cannot discern a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick Fool, or Clown, otherwise then by their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits or Gestures.</p>
            <p>And as Farce cannot be allow'd to be Comedy, in its meanest signification, because it doth not perform the requisites unto it; so I find no reason to call Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy low, though consisting of mean characters, if answering the ends already expressed (as is to be seen in not a few of our antient ones) and cannot deserve a more worthy esteem, if by the skill and wit of the Writer, the characters of vulgar men are made worth the observation of the greatest, according to that of <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Georgicks, speaking on the familiar sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he there treats of;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nec sum animi dubius, verbis ea vincere magnum,</l>
               <l>Quàm sit, &amp; angustis hunc addere rebus honorem,</l>
            </q>
            <p>Notwithstanding I would not be thought averse from such a choice of persons in Comedy, as are most fit to character the most generous instruction of manners; wherefore if for the greatest number they represent the same dignities in either Sex, the entertainment is more sutable to the Audience, which most considerably doth consist of these; and here I cannot chuse but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on our mean imitation of <hi>French</hi> Plays, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of servants and waiting women to have parts,
<pb facs="tcp:65848:13"/>
without being essential characters; an error well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by our former writers, who never admitted any, otherwise then as messengers and attendants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on the account of being characters, as is to be seen by <hi>Numphs</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew Fair,</hi> and <hi>Face</hi> in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymist;</hi> the latter of which (notwithstanding what can be objected against him) may deservedly be granted one of the best parts on our English Stage.</p>
            <p>But perhaps we are not now so destitute of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as we are of design and wit to manage them, invention being ready to afford many, and observation some; though here I cannot chuse but censure the unpoetical, and no less offensive license in particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly designing the persons of any, an abuse that deserves to be severely resented, since (if permitted) no man can be secured, but that he may give his money to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his alliance, friend, or himself, made his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious entertainment on a publick Stage; besides, Plays ought more to reflect on manners, then men, as being their moral use, and when they do otherwise, they are Libels rather then Plays, and nauseate the ear of a modest Audience.</p>
            <p>Having made these observations on our past and present Stage, I must be so ingenuous with my Reader, as to fear, that the perfection of our former Dramatick Poesie ought more politickly to have been my dispute with others, then that I should have maintain'd its praise, since he is prompted by it, to compare the excellency of their Plays with my defects in this, and for which I have an objection to answer, though, I hope, a weak
<pb facs="tcp:65848:13"/>
one, concerning the character of <hi>Tysamnes,</hi> whom I find to be charg'd with a breach of promise to <hi>Statyra;</hi> the matter of fact I confess; but as actions have their degrees of evil, as the circumstances relating thereunto shall render them more or less excusable; so I must say in the behalf of this my character, that the temptation of enjoying of a Crown together with the love of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Queen, did produce his neglect of <hi>Statyra;</hi> and whosoever shall consider the prevalency of ambition in Princes, (especially in one without a Crown, which was his case) and how often they forfeit the highest obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to advance it, will grant I suppose without much difficulty, that there needs small excuse for his character; besides, there was such a reparation on his side, both to his Queen, and her, that though he remov'd the former, partly for her sake, he did not make himself so guilty, as to marry the latter; but by a due sorrow for his ingratitude to both, confirm'd an honourable repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on his character; all which the Reader may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the Play: so that it is not meerly the doing of ill, but the persisting in it, that fixes an indelible stain on persons; besides, that no man is of necessity to be presented on the Stage with an evenness of passion, as being neither common, or natural in men, in whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects will have some place with virtue.</p>
            <p>This objection (though feeble enough) hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be supported by the impertinent cavils of some, who will hardly like any thing, and care as little for what is good; whether this proceeds from their Spleen to the ingenuities of men, or that they hold it a
<pb facs="tcp:65848:14"/>
more noble imployment for their Criticism, I cannot tell; and yet I do not find any other objection made against my Play, though both the design and characters were new as the hour in which it was first seen, being wholly created without having reference to truth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then possibly consistent with it in the persons I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, according to <hi>Horace;</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Ficta voluptatis causa, sint proxima veris.</q>
            <p>The misfortune it had in having some of the Parts ill and imperfectly performed, as also the laying down of it, the sixth day of its being presented, when the Audience was very near as considerable, as the first day it was Acted, as also an intermission hitherto occasioned by the long absence of some principal Actresses, could not but prejudice the esteem it gain'd, and might have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in a further time; not that I judge of the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Plays, according to the good fortune they have in point of reception, it having been ordinary enough for very mean or ill ones (especially in this Age) to have had the credit of getting money at a small expence of Wit, whilst they have little more reason to glory in the heat of their acceptation, or number of hearers, then the Fly had in the Fable, that sitting upon a Wheel, most ingeniously boasted of the dust that was rais'd by it.</p>
            <p>I fear I have trespass'd too much on my Readers pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (though I have not troubl'd him with any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Dedication) being ready to acknowledge that what I have writ here, seems more a discourse, or Essay on
<pb facs="tcp:65848:14"/>
Dramatick Poesie, then a Preface to a Play; and indeed, I had thoughts of compiling the discussing of that subject with some things of that nature, not but I conceiv'd it might be as usefully given him in this place, where he may more readily observe how far I have made practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable the Theory of this kind of writing I most esteem; nor do I undertake to rectifie the judgments of others, farther then theirs shall do mine, where I conceive their reasons to be more prevalent; or would willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy so frivolously my Pen, as to entertain a Polemick discourse of Plays, that to the prudent can signifie little more then to controvert which is the best way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a trifle.</p>

               <p>Must we still persist then to fool Wit out of countenance, and so bid farewel to good Plays and Comedy for ever?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>We must, as I take it, until there are Poets that can write them.</p>

               <p>In the mean time, we are like to maintain a despicable Stage.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>And why so, Sir, ought not that which gets the most money, be held the best Wit? I suppose our Company are much of that opinion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Und.</speaker>
               <p>However, as I am an Actor, and bound to honour true Mirth and Comedy, I am so far concern'd, that I could wish the Scaramuchos, and Jack-Puddings were sent to their proper Stages, since Plays are now grown so greasie with French Lard, that an Actor do's not know how to handle them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>My right reverend Comedian, you are not wise, and thus I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it—I will play a Farce ten to one against a Comedy, Tragi-comedy, or any Heroick Play whatsoever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Und.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>I told you before, that was no question—nay more, I can assure you, that many good Wits of the Town encourage it, who damn all Plays besides.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Und.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps in compassion to us Actors, or out of contempt to the Writers of this Age, whose Wit they judge cannot reach the elevation of their Brain.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>No matter whether it be from the Poles above, or the Poles below, I am sure they are better then Pole-stars to us, provided they dispense their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence often here.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Why, our Actors have soberly resolved, it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to some other time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing certain in the world, though 'tis so concluded, unless some unexpected prohibition, or Fate hinder it—but 'tis almost time.</p>
