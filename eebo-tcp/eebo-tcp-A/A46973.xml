            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Foot with ſome Horſe towards <hi>Trim,</hi> upon Tueſday following we marcht after them, the ſecond day we lay 4. miles ſhort of <hi>Trim,</hi> where we heard the Van of our Army, with ſome Forces out of the Garriſon in <hi>Trim,</hi> had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63610:3"/>
taken in the Caſtle <hi>Knock,</hi> lying 4. miles to the left hand, wee loſt 30. men, for they ſtood it out to the laſt man. Upon Friday all the Army met two miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Trim,</hi> wee had 51. Colours flying and about 1000. Horſe, wee marcht to the Caſtle of <hi>Baramore,</hi> which is the nigheſt way 42. miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and never ſaw an Enemy, onely the Enemy made us returne and goe more upon the left hand by burning a Bridge, ſo that we could not paſſe that way, there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Bridge the Wayne marcht, and a pretty Towne, but forſaken and burnt by us, as we did all other Townes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles all the way we went, the Enemy has left the Townes, but their Goods they have hid in the Bogges, or elſe conveyed them into the County of <hi>Weekley</hi>; the Rebels had made a very ſtrong breaſt Worke againſt the Bridge, and were 500 men to man it, but in the morning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke it: The Caſtle of <hi>Baramore</hi> where
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63610:3"/>
wee reſted one day before our returne is a place naturally fortified with a great Bogge, only one way to come to it, where they had made ſtrong Workes, yet durſt not make them good; from thence my Lord <hi>Jones</hi> and Sir <hi>Michael Earnely</hi> their two Regiments went alone, which is ten miles further, and are to keepe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in <hi>Canaught</hi> and thereabouts. The next day wee marcht ſtraight for <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> with the remainder of our Army, finding no oppoſition, onely one day we paſt by one of the Enemies Caſtles, which wee could not ſtay to take in, by reaſon we wanted pieces of Battery and bread for our men if wee ſhould ſtay; when the Reare of our Army was paſt which wee had upon our March that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome quantitie of the Enemies Horſe very well mand came ruſhing out of a Wood, which cauſed us when wee were over the Bogge to fall about and make a ſudden ſtand, expecting that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63610:4"/>
they would have charged us, but they onely ſtaid for ſtraglers, the next day we was to paſſe a moraſle, where there was but a narrow Cauſey, which way the Enemy thought we would have marcht from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and had therefore made a ſtrong breaſt work, and to hinders us had made a double ditch, halfe pike deepe, and caſt all the looſe earth in the midſt, which did hinder us in reſpect we wanted timber, and the ground was ſo baſe, as it was long ere the Carriages durſt venture over; that night we marcht to <hi>Kilcock</hi> a very pretty Towne 12. miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> the onely Towne wee left unburnt, it was lately built by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; all the way of our march what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſoever, as men, women, or children that our Souldiers met, they gave no quarter they were ſo enraged that the Enemy would not fight.</p>
            <p>I never ſaw finer Countries in all my life then we were thorow, ſtore of Corn
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63610:4"/>
growing, and that ſpetiall in all parts, and after the two firſt dayes march wee wanted not for good beefe, and excellent Cheeſe, but not a drop of drinke for 3. or 4. dayes together, and then but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by chance for the Officer. I never in my life time in <hi>England</hi> knew greater and colder raines in winter then we had every day but one with us, I proteſt I doe verily think we did not come 3. nights all the march to our quarter but our men were wet to the skin, and then the good earth was our lodging, and we came uſually ſo late as the men had ſcarce time to help themſelves, and to get reſt, for wee was to march by 4 or 5. in the morning; it had bred much ſickneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our freſh Souldiers, wherein I have a part, being brought to extreame weakneſſe with the Countrey diſeaſe, for which I this day take Phyſicke.
