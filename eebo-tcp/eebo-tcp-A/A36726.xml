         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
Of the Design of this
BOOK.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THere's no doubt but all who love
the purity of the</hi> Moral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<hi>of</hi> Christ, <hi>are very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Corruption the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
labour to introduce thereinto by the
Opinions they have invented: But it
may be said,</hi> That nothing is more
dreadful in the Conduct of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
than to see them pursue those
<pb facs="tcp:65277:3"/>
corrupt maximes in their Practice, and
that of the many things they allow in
others contrary to the Law of God, and
the principles of the Gospel, there is
not any they commit not themselves, to
satissie their Avarice, or to promote the
Grandeur and Glory of their <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove this, is the business of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Collection</hi> of those Learned and
Pious Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> to inspire
the World, and the <hi>Jesuites</hi> themselves
with horror at their detestable <hi>Morality,</hi>
there being no better way to demonstrate
the danger of the looseness they autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize,
that latitude and remisness whereof
they are Patrons, than by discovery of that
abyss of <hi>Injustice, Avarice, Lust,</hi> and
<hi>Other Vices</hi> wherein they have plunged them.</p>
            <p>Let none imagine we were moved to
gather the different pieces that make up
this <hi>Collection,</hi> with design to decry or
prejudice the <hi>Society.</hi> God is our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb facs="tcp:65277:3"/>
we have undertaken it out of the
Charity we have for them, and the grief
we are sincerely affected with to see them
so unhappily engaged. We sigh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind
them the causes of the loss of so many souls
they seduce, and draw with themselves
into the precipices of Errour and Vice.
We deplore their obstinacy in shutting
their eyes against the Light held forth
by the Pastors of the Church, to guide
them out of their wandrings into the
right wayes of Piety and Truth; and
tremble when we consider, that every day
they literally fulfil the Prophesies deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of them in the infancy of their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For is it not a terrible judgement of
God, not only on the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> but the
whole Church, that almost in all parts
of the world providence hath raised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
wise, illuminated, and full of the
<hi>Divine Service,</hi> who from the first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of this Company have foreseen
all those mischiefs it hath wrought in the
<pb facs="tcp:65277:4"/>
Church, its turning topsie turvy the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline,</hi> its troubling
and disordering all Estates and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that in the mean time the
same Company hath been permitted to
mount to that degree of Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that they have laid at their
feet almost all that is Great in the
World, that those of their Order are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of almost all the Consciences of
<hi>Christendom,</hi> that they resist all Bishops,
and very often attempt against their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns.</p>

of mens infidelity and unwillingnesse
to embrace the instructions of <hi>Jesus
Christ,</hi> which are, <hi>To be puft up
with pride,</hi> and <hi>to imagine that
godlinesse is to be used as a means to
enrich themselves.</hi> For by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
we have reported out of the
<hi>Image of their First Age,</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
on the one side <hi>The pride of
their hearts,</hi> and to what a pitch of
extravagance their self-conceitednesse
hath carried them, as that there is not
any artifice, injustice or violence they

               </gap>y not to enrich themselves, by
the spoils of all sorts of persons Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and Religious, Soveraign and
private.</p>
            <p>They have no cause of complaint,
that we attribute these disorders to
<pb facs="tcp:65277:7"/>
the Society, for that though they were
onely the faults of those particular
persons who committed them, they
might neverthelesse be justly imputed
to the Society, as authorizing them
all by the doctrine she defends, and
the impunity the offenders find in her bosome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For where are the punishments she
inflicted on them who acted such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
and inhumanities against the
Nuns of</hi> Voltigerode? <hi>What course
hath she taken to repair the damages
sustained by so many desolate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
ruined by the banquerupt of the

Mariana, Chap.</hi> 14. have but bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
enough, what faults soever he
be guilty of, he remains in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
if he have but the wit to frame
an excuse, or any pretence for what
he hath committed. I passe by gross
crimes, a great number whereof is
winked at under colour of want of
<pb facs="tcp:65277:8"/>
sufficient proof, or fear to have
them noysed and so become pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

uppermost, as if the fire that lies
under would not sooner or later
send forth some smoke. No rigour
is exercised but upon those poor
wretches who have neither power
nor protection, whereof there are
instances enough; others shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the greatest mischiefs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet no man touch one hair
of their head: A Provincial or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
shall turn all upside down, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Rules and Constitutions of
the Order, squander away the Estate
belonging to their Houses, or give
them to his Kindred, without any
punishment after severall years mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage,
but the rendring of his
condition better than ever, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
him of his Office. Does any
man know a Superior chastised for
<pb facs="tcp:65277:8"/>
such excesses as these? <hi>And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
having wished, that there were
in the Society Rewards provided for
the good, and Punishments for the
vicious, he addes,</hi> 'Tis a lamentable
thing, and permitted by God for our
sins, that oftentimes we practise the
contrary, for among us the Good are
afflicted, yea put to death without
cause, or for very light reasons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are assured to find no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
nor resistance from them,
whereof we could produce many
deplorable examples; and the wicked
are upheld; because they are feared.
A conduct capable to provoke God
to precipitate the Society into the
Abyss of Destruction.</p>
            <p>See how this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Author, who was a
member of the Soiety, deplores <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her

               </gap>ive at the greatest enormities
of the persons of whom she consists!
And how farre she is answerable for
<pb facs="tcp:65277:9"/>
their greatest extravagancies by che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
and maintaining them, and
making it her Choyce to tolerate in
them all sorts of Corruptions, rather
than discover to the World any thing
that may induce the people to believe,
the Society is composed of any but
Saints.</p>
            <p>It were easie to prove, that the
Greatest part of the Maxims of their
Moralls are grounded on nothing else
but the libertinage of the members,
whose justification the Society un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes:
When one of the Company
had seduced his Penitent, and made
use of pretended Revelations to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
under the name of marriage his
impurities and sacriledge: Another
of the Society to justifie the Crime,
fails not to teach, <hi>That a Fryar
profest may marry upon a probable
Revelation.</hi> If one publish Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
against the most innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
because he imagines they did
<pb facs="tcp:65277:9"/>
the Society prejudice; Another will
teach, <hi>That a Fryar may not only
destroy the reputation, but slay the
person of any he foresees may annoy
the Glory of his Order:</hi> Lastly, if
some be so wicked, <hi>as to inspire the
Subjects of best Princes with designs
against their Lives, and the quiet
of their Estates;</hi> Others will <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
intire Volumes to justifie those
Assassines and Murtherers, and the
Society will Canonize them for
Saints, and Register them in the
Catalogue of Martyrs, especially if
they be of her Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May it not be truly said then,
that the Members of the Society
commit not any disorder that may
not justly be imputed to the Society
it self? But 'tis not our purpose in
this Collection; where we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
nothing but what hath been
done by whole Houses, and intire
Provinces, and the Society it self
<pb facs="tcp:65277:10"/>
appeared highly in defence of. So that
we shall omit a great number of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
whereof we have most ample and
Authentick Memoirs in our hands,
with the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Surnames of the
Persons, the Houses, the Provinces,
and the Circumstances of their
Crimes specified so particularly,</hi> that
there cannot remain the least doubt
of the truth of the facts alleadged;
which yet shall one day see light, if
these Fathers force us to publish,
there is not any enormity in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of Vices which is not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
amongst them; that they abuse
their Missions into strange Countreys,
to lay snares for the Chastity of the
Inhabitants, their Conversation, the
Word of God and surintendence of
Monasteries to corrupt Virgins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
to God, Mens Daughters and
Wives, the Sacrament of Penance to
pervert mens Consciences; and pollute
their Colledges and Congregations, by
Enormities not to be named.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65277:10"/>
There is evidence sufficient for this
in the book <hi>F. Jarrige the Jesuite
of Rochell published against them,</hi>
wherein the matters of fact are set
forth with all their particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
that not to believe them
were to offer violence to our senses:
'Tis true the Book was published du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Apostacy, but 'tis as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that after his return to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his publishing
at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the <hi>Jesuites</hi> Colledge,
the causes of his return, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
at large of that Book, he
charges himself with too much heat
in the writing, but doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
disavow any one of those
scandalous stories he reported there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
This is an indubitable proof
of their truth, it being impossible
that the <hi>Jesuites</hi> would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
him, having published against
them so many Calumnies without
obliging him to a publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
<pb facs="tcp:65277:11"/>
that they were false, if the
facts he had reported had not been
true.</p>
            <p>But we were willing to pass by these
and many other enormities, as well
to avoyd offence to the Reader, by
writing things which cannot with
modesty be made publick, as for that
what openly appears in the visible
conduct of the Society affords too
clear proofs of the perfect Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between their Practices and their
Maxims: And that having abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Rules of the Gospel, to follow
their vain Ratiocinations, God hath
delivered them up to the wandrings
and errours of a depraved and
corrupt spirit, which hath engaged
them in Actions unworthy not only of
Priests, and of Fryars, but of Vertuous
Pagans.</p>
            <p>The benefit we propose in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Collection, is to confirm the
<pb facs="tcp:65277:11"/>
faithfull in the abhorrency they ought
to have of the Moralls of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi>
which as a poysoned spring convey
venome into the hearts of all that
approach them, and to perswade the
people to avoyd their detestable Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
which having corrupted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
engage the will in disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness
and debauchery; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the <hi>Jesuites</hi> to give better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to the Iudgement past of
them by so many great persons, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
those of the Faculty of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
at <hi>Paris,</hi> in 1554. the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whose sentence is cleared by
the Historical Relations reported in
this Collection.</p>
            <p>'Tis our hearty desire the <hi>Jesuites</hi>
may reap the benefit of our Labour,
for, (whatever they say) we love them,
and have for them all the Charity
we ought: But we dare not hope they
will profit by what we have done, for
that these Fathers never return from
<pb facs="tcp:65277:12"/>
the Abysse they are plunged in; but
as they are invincibly obstinate in
the defence of their greatest enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we are to resolve upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible
firmitude, and indefatigable
constancy to reproach them therewith,
and press them to amend, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
sighs for their errors and
miscarriages, and prayers to God to
mollifie the hardness of their hearts.

            <head>Of the Pieces contained in this
First Part.</head>
            <p>ALl the Pieces, whereof this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
is composed are reduced
to two things we have undertaken to
justifie, that is, <hi>That the Jesuites
are animated with a spirit of</hi> Pride
<hi>and of</hi> Avarice.</p>
            <p>The first is made appear by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
we report from a Book Entituled
<hi>The Image of the first Age of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Jesus,</hi> which the <hi>Jesuites</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be printed in <hi>Flanders</hi> in 1640.
The reason of the Title was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
to represent in that Book all the
different Events happened to their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>
since their establishment in 1540:
which they have pursued with so much
affectation, &amp; executed in a manner so
full of vanity and pride, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
open the Book without abhorring
the impudence of these fathers, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things to their advantage, and
<pb facs="tcp:65277:13"/>
labouring to draw Glory from that
which ought rather to humble and
confound them. It might have been
necessary to have translated the whole
Book to make known their folly at
large, and to discover their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
in their perfect dimensions;
but we have been content to make only
some Extracts, to which a person of
Piety hath added reflections, no less
solid than ingenious, the Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
renders their Vanity more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
We doubt not but the <hi>Readers</hi>
will judge, that we ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
them thus, since, as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
says, <hi>there's nothing more due to the
vanity of men than to be railed at.</hi>
We hope that these Extracts will <unclear>servs</unclear>
to demonstrate the utility and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the present Collection, for that
this <hi>Society</hi> having affected to give
the world such false <hi>Ideas</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and representations quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what they really are, it
was but just to present men with the
<pb facs="tcp:65277:13"/>
true pictures of these Fryars, and give
them the occasion <hi>To know them by
their Fruits,</hi> Mat. 7. 16.</p>
            <p>The other pieces of this Collection
serve to prove, they imploy all sorts of
means to inrich themselves, and that
nothing escapes the claws of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice</p>
            <p>The first stories we report, are taken
out of works so authentique, that to
name them will be sufficient to exempt
their credit from question, as being
Extracts out of a <hi>Memorial</hi> presented
to His Majesties Council by the Vicar-General
of the Order of <hi>Cluny</hi> in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi>
others out of a book of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Benedictine</hi> Fryar in <hi>Almaigne,</hi>
and others from an arrest of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Metz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The residue are <hi>Extracts</hi> of a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Book, Intituled, <hi>The Theatre
of Jesuitisme,</hi> or <hi>the Jesuitique Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre;</hi>

               </gap>ple to give it the credit it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
without a more particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Author, and occasion that
moved him to write, we shall endeavour
in few words to satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie their doubts:</p>
            <p>To begin with the Occasion that
gave birth to the <hi>Theatre of Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme;</hi>
we are to observe that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiate
<hi>Esclapes,</hi> having made a Book
Intituled, <hi>A manifest addressed to all
the Faithful in Jesus Christ;</hi> of the
wicked maximes taught, maintained
and practised by the <hi>Jesuites:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Author under the name of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Aquila</hi> answered it by a Book
which appeared with this Title, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreme
el Perro y no me muerda:
Let the Curr bark at me but not bite
me.</hi> This pretended Doctor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
in this work to justifie all that
<hi>Esclapes</hi> had reproved, and to shew
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e understood not the matter he
Treated of, when he affirmed the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
to have been sole Authors of
<pb facs="tcp:65277:14"/>
those Maximes, whereas they had only
followed the Authors who preceded
them, and especially the <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
in whose Books they had learnt them.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Theatre of the
Jesuitisme</hi> undertakes by that Book,
the refutation of <hi>Aquila,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of all the Authors he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued.</p>
            <p>The Book is divided into two parts:
The first comprehends the refutation
of <hi>Aquila</hi> upon the Maximes reported
by <hi>Esclapes:</hi> We have taken nothing
out of this; <hi>The Moral Doctrine of
the Jesuites,</hi> not long since published,
containing large <hi>Entracts</hi> made of that
part: We have confined our selves
principally to the second, as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
most to the design of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
which is to demonstrate the
practice of that doctrine in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the <hi>Jesuites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall observe here onely two
things: 1. That this passed in <hi>Spain</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:65277:15"/>
same time when the pernicious <hi>Morals
of the Jesuites</hi> were attaqued with
such zeal and success in <hi>France.</hi>
2. That the Author sayes, he affirms
not any story in his <hi>Book,</hi> but what
concerns the <hi>Society</hi> intire, or some
particular person, whose protection
and defence the Community undertook,
and for whom by consequence they are
responsible. To which he adds, that
'tis visible, that among the <hi>Jesuites,</hi>
'tis not so much the particular persons
that offend, as in other Orders of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
who correct and expell them
that are guilty, but that a general
dissoluteness hath seized the whole
body; which he justifies by the words
of <hi>Azeuredo,</hi> and <hi>Villa Sante</hi> Iesuites
of <hi>Spain,</hi> who renewed the Sect of the
<hi>Illuminated Heretiques,</hi> and having
been imprisoned and interrogated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their abominable Tenets, answered
the Magistrates, <hi>That if they were
imprisoned for them, they might have
as well imprisoned the Society.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65277:15"/>

Name: He was a Natural Son of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
reputed very considerable in the
Court at <hi>Madrid:</hi> Nor was it his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
by that assumed name to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his composure of that work, which
he hath alwayes publickly owned as the
true Author thereof; and had it been
feasible to have confined the Book to
the Kingdome of <hi>Spain,</hi> he had prefixt
his Name, since none in that Realm
but knew it his work; but his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and humility inclined him to hide
his name from those of forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
who were ignorant of it.</p>
            <p>He was a <hi>Dominican</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Book; his name is <hi>Ildefonso
de S. Thomas a Sancto Thoma:</hi> And
though his Book by the Credit of the
<hi>Jesuites</hi> hath been condemned and put
into the <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him not from being named suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
<pb facs="tcp:65277:16"/>
to <hi>John de Pallafox</hi> in the
Bishoprick of <hi>Osme,</hi> and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in that of <hi>Placentia</hi> worth fifty
thousand Crowns annual rent; and
lastly, in that of <hi>Malaga,</hi> which he
is new possessed of, having preferred
it before that of <hi>Placentia,</hi> though it
be worth but twenty thousand Crowns,
which is thirty thousand Crowns less
than the other, to justifie this choice,
he said, that the Monastery where he
made his profession was in the City of
<hi>Malaga;</hi> though the more probable
cause may be, that being a person of
most accomplished piety, having past
all the Offices and Dignities of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he gladly embraced the occasion
by his dis-interesment on this occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie the Church, and lessen
his account to be rendred to God,
which would have been increased, had
he continued in charge with a Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick
so considerable as that of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia,</hi>
being one of the richest of <hi>Spain</hi>
after <hi>Toledo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65277:16"/>
The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him his Son, and he was made
Bishop in the Life of the King. The
three Bishopricks mentioned, were all
void in less than three months; so
that he hath stood charged with no
other Church but only that of <hi>Malaga,</hi>
and is highly esteemed in his Diocess;
He is reputed one of the greatest and
most zealous preachers this day in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and applies himself much to
Confession, and the direction of Souls
committed to his care.</p>
            <p>His Mother was Maid of Honour
to <hi>Isabel</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> late Queen of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and was Sister to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
<hi>Mortara</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan;</hi>
but being with Child, the King to
save his Honour married her to the
Marquess <hi>Quintana,</hi> one of the greatest
and richest Lords of his Court. The
Marquess had that passionate love for
this Lady, and gave her those Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of real affection, that she held
<pb facs="tcp:65277:17"/>
her self obliged to testifie her acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,
by revealing the secret of
her being with Child by the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Espousals with the Marquess
her Husband: But all the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
she could make of inviolable si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to him could not save the poor
Marquesse from receiving in this news
his mortal wound, for though he gave
his Wife no testimony of it, he was
seized with such grief upon the report,
that it brought him to his end within
two months after.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marquesse</hi> having lain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into a Monastery, whence she
took great care of her Sons educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and afterwards became a <hi>Nun</hi>
and died there: But having before
told her Son who he was, he took a
resolution to take the habit of <hi>St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minique</hi>
in the City of <hi>Malaga,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which is scituate the Estate he
quitted to become a Fryar of that
Order, wherein he lived ever since, and
<pb facs="tcp:65277:17"/>
continues at present with the dignity

            <p>THe <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>St. Hildegard</hi> hath been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the <hi>Iesuites</hi> by many persons,
and among others, by <hi>D. Ierome Baptista de la
Nuza</hi> of the Order of <hi>St. Dominique,</hi> afterwards
Bishop of <hi>Albarazin</hi> and <hi>Balbastro,</hi> whose <hi>Elegy</hi>
may be seen in the Acts of the Chap. General of
that Order Celebrated at <hi>Rome</hi> in 1629. 'Tis
said of him, that all his life he observed exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the rules of his Order, even in the smallest
matters, and added thereto in his practice fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Fasts, and instead of cords made use of
chains of iron in acts of Penance and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
his constant exercises were Prayer and
Reading of Godly Books; he had the gift of
<hi>Prophecy,</hi> was of great Wisdome, and excellent
Understanding, whereof his Master <hi>St. Lewis
Beltram</hi> and his Books give ample testimony and
a clear evidence: He spent fifty years in the
Ministry of the Word, and when he preach'd
his face was often seen to shine with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
lustre; his Charity, when Bishop, made
him very poor, for he gave all his Goods, even
the Bed he lay on, in Almes; his Confessor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us he never sinned mortally, and in the
seventieth year of his Age died at <hi>Albarazin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

for reason, their fear that these were the
men of whom <hi>St. Hildegard</hi> had Prophesied;
to which the <hi>Prelate</hi> made answer, that there
was no cause of complaint against those Orders,
for that till then they had not given other than
good Examples; but the time would come,
when the <hi>Prophecy</hi> should be fulfilled; which
in the Margent of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> in the <hi>Annals</hi> of

            <p>I shall relate the <hi>Prophecy</hi> as I find it recited
in <hi>Bzovius</hi> a famous Author; for though the

for fear of those Prisons, Banishments,

fear had a stronger influence, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

the love of the truth which kept up those of

               <p>Thus the <hi>Prophecy</hi> describes accurately their
manner of preaching, and maintaining the
Faith among the Great Ones without hazard of
life. The Apostles and Preachers of the Gospel
went among infidels, like Sheep among Wolves,
exposing themselves to Martyrdom for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
of the Faith; and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and
<hi>Franciscans</hi> treading their steps, have since the

<hi>Catalogue</hi> of their Martyrs to a volume: But the

their persons in danger by the displeasure of the
Emperour there, addressed themselves to King
<hi>Philip</hi> for a guard of Soldiers, that they might
preach in safety; which was so scandalous to
all that knew it, that <hi>D. Michael de Bonavides</hi>
Bishop of the <hi>Philippines</hi> held himself obliged to
write thereof to the King; and though they
were the first Preachers in most parts of <hi>Iapan</hi>

               <p>When I consider what happened in the time
of <hi>Gregory 13<hi rend="sup">th,</hi>
                  </hi> I think it easie to demonstrate
how properly this may be applyed to the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites:</hi>
As soon as they entred <hi>Iapan,</hi> they
perswaded the Emperour of the Countrey and
the Pope, that it was not expedient to admit
any persons to come thither who differ'd from
them in Habits, Customs, or Ceremonies;
giving for reason, that the new Converts
would be scandalized at the diversity. As if
the Church were not like a Monarchy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of different estates, and compared in
Scripture to a Queen attyred in divers colours,
but were wholly Jesuitical in habit and all
other things. This reason was sufficient to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Pope, and procure them his Grant,
that none but they should enter <hi>Iapan;</hi> so that
had there been a Bishop for the Countrey, he
was excluded his Diocese: A thing never
heard of, to shut the door of the fold against
the true shepheards, and hinder them to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacraments; which hath been the
Cause that many have renouneed the faith for
want of Confirmation: But such is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Doctrine, that Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Orders by Bishops <unclear>are</unclear> not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65277:27"/>
And that this is their tenet, the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Iapan,</hi> the passages between the <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
and the Papers sent to the Pope by the Bishop
of the <hi>Philippines,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuites</hi> actions in

in the hearts of the people: They call
them first, <hi>The fortunate Malignants,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of sanctity pretend great trouble
and care for the credit and reputation of other
orders of Religion, as if they came with that
heat and fervency that is necessary to repair
that vigour and strength they have lost by age.
Their envy appears in telling their friends
tales to the disadvantage of other Orders, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the Crimes of some Fryers, and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stories of their condemnation, which they
deliver in a compassionate Accent, full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and sympathy, casting words by the
by of the dangers they are in, for no other
end but to perswade the hearers into fear for
them, and a solicitous care for their safety,
though in truth they do it only out of envy
against other orders, whose Grandeur is their
trouble, whose growth and increase, they
esteem their wane and decay.</p>

            <p>THe first day of <hi>December, Anno Dom.</hi> 1554.
The sacred faculty of <hi>Theology</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi>
having heard the Mass of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
sung in the Chappel of the Colledge of
<hi>Sorbon,</hi> was then the fourth time assembled by
oath, to determine of two <hi>Bulls,</hi> said to have
been granted by two Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> 3. and <hi>Iulius</hi>
the 3. unto those who affect the name of the
<hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> which <hi>Bulls,</hi> the Parliament of
<hi>Paris</hi> by their Usher sent on purpose, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the view and examination of the said fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65277:36"/>
the tenour whereof followeth:</p>
            <p>And first of the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Then of the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Iul.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>But before this Faculty would begin to treat of
a matter of so great weight, all, and singular the
Masters thereof made open &amp; publick profession
that they would not think, much less, decree or
attempt any thing against the Authority and
Power of the Pope; but as they and every of
them, as obedient Children have always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and confessed, so they now do
sincerely, faithfully and willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and confess the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> Soveraign
Vicar of Jesus Christ, and Universal Pastor of
the Church, to whom Christ gave the fulness of
Power, whom all persons of either Sex are
bound to obey, to reverence his Decrees, and
every one in his place ought to defend and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve:
But forasmuch as all men, especially Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
ought to be ready to give satisfaction to
every one that demands it in matters relating to
the Faith, manners and edifying of the Church,
the said faculty held themselves obliged to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the demand, command and request of the
said Court.</p>
            <p>Therefore, all the Articles of both <hi>Bulls</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

from the austerity of the first Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi>

but ordered all demands and petitions to be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
writing.</p>
               <p>The establishment of those of this <hi>Order,</hi> who
call themselves <hi>Iesuites,</hi> in this Kingdome, hath
been judged so pernicious to this Estate, that all
the <hi>Orders Ecclesiastical</hi> opposed their reception;
and the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>bon</hi> declared that this Society was
introduced for destruction, not for edification;
and afterwards in the assembly of the Clergy in
<hi>Septemb.</hi> 1561. where the Arch-bishops and
Bishops were present, and the Cardinal of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
President, this Society was approved of,
but with so many clauses and restrictions, that
had they been pressed to observe them, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
they had soon changed their abode.</p>
               <p>They were received but upon <hi>Provisa,</hi> and by
arrest of the year 1564. were prohibited to take
the name of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> or <hi>Society of Iesus;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, they have not forborn to take
that illegal Name, and exempt themselves from
all powers Ecclesiastical and Secular: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65277:38"/>
them would increase their authority,
and render their condition better then ever.
This judgement was so much more worthy of
your Court of Parliament, in that all your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Religious <hi>Orders</hi> held it necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them with caution, to put a stop to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness
of their actions then too great,
which they foresaw would increase to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the publick, and produce greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
then could then be discovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as they vow universal obedience to the
Pope, so the propositions in their doctrine are
uniform, that they acknowledge no Superiour
but the Pope, to whom they swear fealty and
obedience in all things, and hold it an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
maxime,</hi> That he hath power to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Kings, and that a King excommunicate is but
a Tyrant, that his people may Rise against him,
that all the inhabitants of his Realm, who are in any
the meanest Ecclesiastical Orders, what crime soever
they commit cannot be judged traytors, for that they
are not his subjects, nor under his jurisdiction; so
that all Ecclesiasticks are exempt from the secular
power, and without fear of punishment may lay
bloody hands on sacred persons. <hi>This they write,
and impugne the opinion of those who hold the
contrary propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two <hi>Spanish</hi> Doctors of Law, having written
that <hi>Clerks</hi> were subject to the Power of Kings
and Princes, one of the prime men of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65277:39"/>
writ against them, alledging, that as the
<hi>Levites</hi> under the Old Testament were exempt
from all secular powers, so are Clerks by the
New.</p>
               <p>Your Majesty will not approve of these
Maxims, they are too false and erroneous:
Therefore they that hold them and will abide
in your Realm, must publiquely abjure them
in their Colledges; if they do it not, will you
permit them to stay? they will subvert the
foundations of your Power and Authority-Royall:
if they do it, will you believe that
by shifting places, they can lay down and
take up again a Doctrine which is part of their
Religion, good for <hi>Rome,</hi> and good for <hi>Spain,</hi>
but quite contrary for <hi>France,</hi> which rejecteth
that the others receive? if they say they can
do it by secret dispensation, what assurance
can you have of men nourished in a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which by change and diversity of place
becomes good and bad?</p>
               <p>This Doctrine is common to them all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are, and make such progress in your
Kingdom, that it will at last slip into the most
reserved Societies.</p>
               <p>At their establishment they had no greater
adversary than the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> which at present
favours them, by reason of that multitude of
young Divines, who have studyed in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.
Other Schollers will do the like; and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65277:39"/>
will in time be advanced, and may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the chief Offices in your Parliaments,
holding the same Doctrine, withdrawing
themselves from your obedience, permitting
the loss of all the Rights of your Crown, and
Liberties of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> and judging
Treason commited by a Church-man not
punishable by your Lawes.</p>
               <p>We have been so unhappy as to have seen
in our dayes the effects of their instructions
upon your sacred person; <hi>Barriere</hi> (I tremble
Sir when I pronounce that word) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by <hi>Varade</hi> the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> and confessedly
had taken the Sacrament, upon the Oath he
had administred him for murthering you. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
failed in his enterprize, others raised the
courage of that little Serpent, who performed
in part what was conspired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gingnard</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> wrote books to justifie
the Parricide of the late King, and confirm the
Proposition condemned in the Councel of
<hi>Constance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why should not we fear when we think upon
these mischievous Acts of disloyalty, that they
may be too easily renewed? If we must pass
our dayes in continual fear to see your life
in danger, what repose can we find in our
own?</p>
               <p>Were it not impious to foresee the danger
and mischief, yet draw it so neer you? were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65277:40"/>
not this to plunge our selves into the depth of
misery, and not to desire to survive the ruine
of the State which as we told you already is at
no greater distance than of the length of your
life.</p>
               <p>Thanks be to God, Sir, for the mutual
Amity between you and the Pope; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
you long in your Throne, and him in his
Charge. But if age or infirmity shorten his
dayes, and his Successor ill affected to your
Crown, should insheath against you his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sword, as his Predecessors have done
against other Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>varre,</hi>
what regret would it be to your Subjects to see
in the midst of us so many enemies of your
Estate, and Conspirators against your Majesty,
as against that of the late King of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory?
how dreadfull would it be to behold
them in the bowels of the Realm, who have
been the Authors and principal Ministers of the
Rebellion in his Reign, and not guiltless of
his murder?</p>
               <p>They say, they ought to be no more charged
with past faults than other Orders and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
which have failed no less than they.
But it may be said to their prejudice, that
though fault may be found in other Orders
and Societies, yet it hath not been universal.
The companies were divided, and all the
members did not withdraw themselves from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65277:40"/>
the obedience due to your Majesty, but those
of their Society have continued united and
close-linked in their rebellions, insomuch that
not only not one of them stood on your part,
but were all most partial for the ancient ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of your Crown, used the advantage of
being in your Countrey to act more malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
against your interest: <hi>Otho</hi> one of their
Society being chosen for chief by the 16 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators.</p>
               <p>And if I may be allowed to interweave
among our own a passage taken from foraign
affairs, it shall be that lamentable one in the
History of <hi>Portugal.</hi> When the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
attempted the usurpation of that Kingdom,
all the Orders of Religion stood firm in the
obedience due to their King, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> only
deserted him to advance the Dominion of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and caused the death of two thousand
Fryers, and other Ecclesiastiques, for which
they had a Bull of absolution.</p>
               <p>Their Doctrine and Deportment in time
past caused that when <hi>De Chastel</hi> rose against
you, there followed an Arrest as well against
him as against those of their Society condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by your mouth. An Arrest which we have
consecrated to the memory of the happiest
miracle of our time; judging from thence,
that if they continued to bring up Youth in
that mischievous Doctrine, and Damnable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65277:41"/>
your life could not be in safety, which
made us pass over those formalities which
oblige us to judge of Causes in our Conusance
by regular instances, which we postposed to
the safety of the publick, by sentencing them
who being peculiarly subject to the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your other Courts, might in ordinary
cases have claimed exemption from ours, But</p>
               <p>We had not any malice, envy or ill will
against them in general or particular; if we
had, God had punished us for being their
Judges, though the atrocity of the Crime, and
the affection we had for your Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
for the future, invited us to give this
Arrest, though executed within the Jurisdiction
of the Parliament of <hi>Roven</hi> and <hi>Dijon,</hi> by your
commandement, and met with no resistance
from any but them, who were not well setled
in their obedience to your Majesty, and could
not but with difficulty part with their ill will
and disaffection to your Government.</p>
               <p>They complain by their writings that the
whole Society ought not to be charged with
the faults of three or four: But their enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are such, that had they been reduced to the
condition of those, called <hi>the Humble Fryers,</hi>
they had not had just occasion to complain:
one Fryar of that <hi>Order</hi> had plotted only the
Assassinate of Cardinal <hi>Borrom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o</hi> about thirty
years since, and the whole <hi>Order</hi> was suppressed,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65277:41"/>
and for ever abolished by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth,
pursuant to a resolution of the Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
notwithstanding all the instance of the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the contrary: our judgement
is not so severe, if they say there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
between their <hi>Order,</hi> and that of the <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Fryars</hi> theirs being far greater, we shall tell
them that there is less comparison between a
Cardinal and the greatest King of the world,
exalted far higher above a Cardinal then their
<hi>Order</hi> above the meanest that may be: That the
<hi>Humbled Fryars</hi> were in less fault then they, for
one only of them was author of the Assassinate of
the Cardinal, but they all are guilty of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide
by means of their instruction.</p>
               <p>We do therefore most humbly beseech you,
that as you approved of the arrest so justly given,
and then necessary to deter so many traytors
from conspiring against you, so it may please
you to maintain it, and cast your eye back on the
danger we then were in to see the life of our
Common Father taken away, which is dearer to
us than our own, and we could not but expect
the shameful reproach of disloyalty and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
did we not keep in perpetual memory
the danger you were in, since 'tis you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
us our lives, our peace, and our estates.
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e remembrance of the past ought to serve us
for precaution to take such <hi>Order</hi> that we be

petition on the behalf of the university that
you would have pity and compassion for it,
which cannot but dread the consequences that
may ensue upon the admission of so pernicious
an <hi>Order</hi> as those we have spoken of.</p>

is inequality when eminent things are rare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,

               <p>We cannot doubt now, but it was in their
favour, as themselves assure us, that the Abbot
<hi>Ioachim</hi> prophesied, <hi>That at the end of the world
there should be a Religious Order composed of</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

the same, for they are almost all perfect, and
all so eminent in the Art of governing consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,

that miracles are not admired, because ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Sure <hi>Avila</hi> and St. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> nere
thought of this Society, when they said, that we

the people are as learned, and as wise as those

               <p>These Fathers are so prophetical, that they
are not content to speak magnificently of their
Society by studied discourses in prose and verse,
but in imitation of the Prophets of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
they express themselves by actions and
representations that are obvious to the sight, and
dazle our eyes. This was seen in the City of
<hi>Goa,</hi> when to celebrate their Secular year, they
caused a triumphant Chariot to be drawn,
wherein the Society was represented with all
the pomp and splendour they could devise: 'Tis

true, this Chariot was not lift up in the air as

it was view'd and admired by a great number
of persons, and trilled through the town with
the acclamations of the beholders.</p>
               <p>They went not to heaven to seek Angels to
guide it, that had been too troublesome, they
chose them among their Schollars, who became
Angels by changing their habits: these young
Angels provided of white robes and wings of
all colours were imployed to draw some of
these good Fathers in the chariot for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
to the whole City.</p>
               <p>This triumph was accompanied with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
musick, which ceased not till silenced by
a more masculine, composed of the sounds of
Drums and Trumpets, which sounded an Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
and Charge when they came to any nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
lane; for there they must engage the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
who placed there of purpose pretended to
stop the chariot, and hinder the triumphant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
to finish their carreire: But as the Society
is ever victorious, so these combats ended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to their advantage; and the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen, as well as the Angels, out of their
Schollars, were of intelligence with them, not
to make long or eager resistance.</p>
               <p>While they thought nothing, but the pleasure
of their divertisement, an accident which all
their prophetick prudence could not foresee,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65277:45"/>
marred all their mirth, and was an ill omen to
their proceedings: One of the wheels of the
Chariot fastned in a hole whence all the vertue
of these <hi>Elias's</hi> who were in it, and the strength
of the Angels that drew it could not get it out,
though the poor Angels strained hard to sair it,
but in vain; then, as their custome is in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,
to make use of any thing to serve their
turn, they were necessitated to invoke the aid of
of their Devils to pull out their Chariot, which
they did, but not without the laughter of the
spectators, and scandal to many who begun to
say publickly, <hi>That the devils had at least as great
a share in the triumph of the Iesuites as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is really vertuous, however things
happen, continues so still: But when one is not
in reality an <hi>Elias</hi> or a <hi>Saint,</hi> but goes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
only by emblem, and in a machine all is in
disorder when the machine fails: This may be
confirmed by another accident at the same
time, and in the same City.</p>
               <p>One of these Fathers praising the Society in
his Sermon, compared it to a clock which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Regulation, and regulates all other things;
but as he enlarged magnificently upon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Clock of their house by misfortune
struck above a hundred, and by the irregularity
caused such disorder in the auditory, that they
could not forbear mocking the Preacher and the

and regular as their Clock.</p>

'Tis my opinion, that as in the world there
is no greater or other miracle than the world it self,
so there cannot be found in the Society a greater
miracle than the Society.</p>
               <p>Think it not strange then if the Iesuites do not
any particular miracles as other Orders of Religion
in the first age of their institution have done, and
expect not the same from <hi>Ignatius</hi> their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who did no miracle at the foundation of the
Order, as <hi>Ribadeneiro</hi> in the first edition of his life
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65277:46"/>
assures, whereas other Founders have done so many,
since the Society is a publick and perpetual miracle,
as the Creation and preservation of the world.</p>
               <p>I know it may be said nevertheless, that the
Foundation, Propagation, and subsistance of the
Church over all the Earth in the time of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme</hi>
was much more miraculous in the first
ages, than the foundation and extent of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Iesuites among <hi>Christians,</hi> and that the
Church did millions of miracles by the Saints
and Bishops who succeeded the Apostles, which
by consequence were so much more desirable in
the Society of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> as it is an <hi>Apostolical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
(if they interpret of it the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Abbot
Ioachim</hi>) destin'd for conversion of Hereticks,
insidels, and ill Christians, to which miracles
would be very subservient: But we must believe
that though no miracles are to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, as they say here, were not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
them less Apostolical or less Holy, for
these sixty or eighty years last past since the
death of their first Fathers, because their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
is a miracle of miracles, and that though
the <hi>Orders</hi> of St. <hi>Benedict, St. Dominick,</hi> and St.
<hi>Francis</hi> did so many miracles in the first age of
their institution, it proceeded not from their
sanctity alone, as if it were greater than that of
the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who are (as they say) <hi>A Society of
Angels, of new Apostles, new Samsons, full of the
Spirit of the Lord, and the most perfect of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65277:47"/>
but because God would supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of those Societies in general by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
miracles of their individuals, whereas the
default of particular <hi>Iesuites</hi> who work not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
is recompenced &amp; made up by the general

               <p>This sublime Elegy of this admirable Society
obliges us to render it extraordinary honours,
for can men say more, than that it is the Oracle
of the Doctrine of Truth, which the High Priest
of Jesus Christ carries on his breast, and on his
heart, as the Scripture saith in <hi>Exodus?</hi> It was
called <hi>The Oracle of judgment,</hi> because as <hi>Vatablus</hi>
and other Interpreters say, <hi>The High Priest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave judgment in matters of importance, but he
had this Ornament on his stomack;</hi> and as others
say, <hi>Because it contained the Iudgement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God, that the High Priest should be odorned
with a soveraign doctrine, and most perfect accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
purity of manners.</hi> So it may be believed
with reason, that the Society of <hi>Iesuites</hi> so strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united to the Pope, is the Oracle of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being as eminent in Knowledge as San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity;

whose heart (they tell us here) their Society
rests as the Oracle of Doctrine and Truth, which
he ought to consult in affairs of moment, as the
High Priest of the <hi>Iewes</hi> never consulted the
Deity, but clothed with this Ornament; so that
we are to conclude, that there is just cause to
believe the Pope infallible, when he takes advice
of this famous Oracle of Truth, or doth any
thing in favour of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> as in the name
of <hi>the Company of Iesus</hi> granted them by <hi>Paul</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For there is cause to believe, that the Pope
consults not his Oracle, when he acteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               <p>Now me thinks these good Fathers ought to
reserve their humility, and modesty for some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and not call her the <hi>Little Society,</hi> when
they tell us, their Society <hi>is the Oracle of the

               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65277:49"/>As for what they add, that the Church loves

respect, Truth being venerable of it self, and

for the preservation of the Church, though all

               <p>Three great Archbishops of <hi>Malines,</hi> who

               <p>The first Embleme, is The Name of <hi>Iesus</hi>

this, <hi>She preserves all things in the midst of night.</hi>

<hi>Eclipsed by the opposition of the Earth.</hi>

               <p>All these passages cited by these Fathers in
their favour, are no solid proof that the
Authors of holy Scripture and the Prophets
spoke of them, but shew their presumption and
self-love in entertaining themselves with the
thoughts of their excellencies, whereof they
are so full that they see them in every thing:
This is the cause they have so little respect for
Holy Scripture, that they fear not to make it

themselves in the place of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and

               <p>The Mission which Christ gave his Apostles
to subdue all the Earth was somewhat more

the Sun to stand still, that he might
have time to compleat his Victory, for he in
the perpetual course of his illustrious and most

East to West almost throughout the World;
And having conquered himself, he had cause to
hope to conquer the Universe.</p>
               <p>What could be said more of Christ? who
saith in the Gospel, that he hath overcome the
world; of whom the Church sings, that he
hath subdued all the Earth, not by the edge

not very rare for men, even writers, to want
judgement and common sense; but whatever
these good Fathers say, they are too well known
to be taken for Angels. Yet since they lift up
their voice to heaven, and affect altogether
to compare their Society to the Church, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Apostles, and to Jesus Christ whom
they look upon as their companion, it may do
well to advertise the world how dangerous and
irregular their passion is, which makes them use
such extravagant expressions.</p>
               <p>They ought to remember that we cannot

to heart that we are really meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
as he is the Soveraign Omnipotent Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
               <p>Pride being the first crime that corrupted An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, is also the most deeply rooted
in our nature; so that there alwayes remains in
us an inclination to desire with our first Parents
to be like the most High, and to make our selves
and the things we affect, Idols to be set up in
the place of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65277:60"/>'Tis true, that since the light of the Gosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there have not appeared where Christ is adored,
any persons so impudent to cause themselves to
be worshipped as Gods, or that durst attribute
that honour to any other man: But we see a
shadow of this disorder in <hi>Christendome</hi> it self;
for as soon as it falls out that we have a vertuous
friend, because we dare not make him a God;
yet this doth not restrain us from making him a
Saint, and if we may be believed, the greatest
in <hi>Paradise;</hi> and if it lye in our power, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
him so high, that none but <hi>Christ</hi> shall be fit
to compare with him: But this passion more
easily spreads in communities and succeeds more
happily; they cover it with the presence of the
<hi>Glory of God,</hi> promoted by publishing holiness,
which is no where so resplendent as in the
Saints: They make it their devotion, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their zeal to commend the members of
the Society. One <hi>Iesuite</hi> thinks he merits by
praising another, and as that other is of his coat,

of the same rule, and is his companion, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

they have made of their company: Because
there are amongst them some persons reputed
holy and learned, they would impose on the
world to have no other <hi>Idea</hi> of their Society, but
that it is composed only of persons no less chaste
and bright than the Angels, and have not a

There is nothing on Earth, as they say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to compare this Holy Society, but the
Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> with this difference, that the
Church is obliged to continual mourning for
the rareness of Vertue among the members
thereof, and because the wheat is almost all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with chaff, whereas in the Society there
is only wheat without any chaff. The Church
hath this advantage, that none can be saved but
in her bosome; but though all that live there
are called to salvation, yet few are saved, and
chosen for heaven. And those few who are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
enough to be saved, and persevere to the end,
must do it with much labour, and continual
combates against their infirmities and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
the whole time of their life. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they see no good thing in
themselves, that the law of sin from which they
are not intirely exempt, causes them often to
do the ill they would not, as the weight of their
corruption hinders them to do the good that
they would; they acknowledge, that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are enlightned with the Faith, their light

is but small, and would be wholly extinct, did
they not constantly pray to God to increase it;
that they find themselves often involved in such
darkness, that they know not what they ought,
or ought not to do, to perform the repentance
they owe unto God, and the charity they are
obliged to pay unto their neighbour.</p>
               <p>Lo here, what men the Saints of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> are! they alwayes walk in humility, in
fear and in self-denial, knowing they must fall
when they quit this path; but the Church of the

persons that are perfect, there are no children
nor imperfect ones amongst them; they are all
born with helmets on their heads, they are all

               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65277:61"/>Lastly, having exhausted all sort of praises,
and compared themselves to Angels, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
to the Apostles, the twenty four El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Apocalipse, the Pharisees and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
having applyed to themselves all they
could find in Scripture, which might make for
their <hi>Glory,</hi> to end all, they compare this great
body to <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himself, as if all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but that of <hi>God-man</hi> were unworthy of
them: They are strongly possest with a fancy,
that their Company is like unto Christ, and that
as there is nothing in Christ but what is Holy, it
follows in their imagination, that all is holy
among them too: There is nothing so corrupt
in their manners, so extravagant in their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so false in their Theology, which they
maintain not as the Sentiments of the Church.
Many of their Divines invent fanatick opinions,
and the Universities have been often obliged to
censure their Authors.</p>
               <p>But these Fathers persist in their principles,
and thinking it necessary to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be infallible as the Church, they never
recant, and have all in their hearts what one of
them sometime stuck not to pronounce, That
the opinion of a <hi>Iesuite</hi> is alwayes <hi>Catholique,

               <p>And thus supposing alwayes this Society to
be, all holy, all luminous, all perfect, without
spot, without infirmity, without malady, they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65277:62"/>
believe it impossible to praise it excessively, as a
work of God beyond all praise; and that these
holy companions of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> are so united to
him, that all that may be said to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
returns unto God. In so great a measure
doth he partake of all that concerns them.</p>
               <p>But while they admire themselves in this
manner, they perceive not the misery of the
condition they are fallen into; which we cannot
better express, than to say, that the extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
they have had to pass for the wisest and most
illuminated in the world, hath rendered them
foolish and senseless, that they have lost them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their vain Ratiocinations; that their
minds and their hearts having been covered
with darkness, they have transferred the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due only to the incorruptible God, unto
their Society full of corruption and misery
and as the <hi>Pagans,</hi> having chosen for Gods, men
subject to all sorts of passions and vices, were in

disorders; so the <hi>Iesuites</hi> alwayes supposing

not impeccable. So great is their passion to
make their Society pass for a Virgin without
blemish, that they have intirely abolished re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
amongst them, and all the marks of it
as a superfluous thing.</p>
               <p>I cannot but report on this occasion the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
made to me by one of their brethren, for
some few there are who mourn for these hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
disorders, and begin to open their eyes:
He told me, that as soon as any of them is <hi>Priest,</hi>
if he be unhappy enough to fall secretly into a
mortal sin, he must of necessity dye in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
for they are indispensably obliged to say
Mass every day which supposeth them all saints,
or that a simple confession can in a moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
them in the sanctity they had lost, and
restore them to the dispositions necessary in
them who approach the Altar, what crime so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have committed. I enter not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the heart, and of the consciences of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, but if we may be allowed to guess
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65277:63"/>
in general at their weakness and infirmities,
by those of many who publickly fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Actions, I think it may be said, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
passing rash Judgement, that 'tis very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that some of them fall into sins that oblige
them to repentance; and that it is so much
the more possible, that they are of a very great
number, that they live without any Austerity,
and great liberty of converse with all sort of
people, besides that their ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
their Preaching, Confession, and Classes
are oftentimes neer dangerous occasions of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into sin; so that it being very probable
that some fall into those precipices which all
are so neer, 'tis strange, that the passion they
have for their Glory, should so harden them
in their Crimes, that it hath never been seen,
that any of them that have fallen, came out
of that state by a true and compleat repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>This love of Glory is so great amongst them,
that it hath not only made them abolish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for fear of giving any colour to think
they need it, but hath carry'd them sometimes
to the doing of extreme violences, and great
injustice, for covering those faults whereby
they might receive any dishonour; and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to conceal them, they labour with all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
to justifie the persons who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them. We have an instance of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65277:64"/>
in the Theatre of the Jesuites, <hi>p.</hi> 396. so
horrible that the Author durst not report it:
But the world knowes it by other means, and
<hi>Mariana</hi> acknowledges, that it is their custom,
when they fear the fault of any Father not yet
discovered may come to light, to transport
him presently into another Province. And
when some disorder appears in a Superiour,
whose reputation they would maintain in the
world, whom notwithstanding they dare not
trust any further, they suggest to him that he
may desire leave to go to the New World, to
which he hath no sooner consented, but they
make this forced desire pass for an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

their Glory, they are not ashamed to count
those of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Society Martyrs, who dyed for

of Christ crucified, who justly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffer as capital

it in this image of their first Age, and at

On the other side these Fathers consider not
that when they boast their Society a Virgin

to say, that they ought to be ashamed that

they being <hi>The saved,</hi> and he alone the
<hi>Saviour:</hi> Whence it is that this name is not

with unanimous consent, (and not, as they

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65277:66"/>
be received, it should be only as a Society and
Company, and not as a new Order of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that they should be obliged to take
another name than that of the company of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
or <hi>Iesuites:</hi> This was held so reasonable
by the whole Assembly Generall of the <hi>Gallican</hi>
Church, that she received them not but with
express Charge, that they should be obliged to
take another title than that of the <hi>Society of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
or <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and under many other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to which they then submitted out of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
prudence, but performed them not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then no other end but to establish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in <hi>France,</hi> and knowing according to
one of their Emblemes, that as soon as their
Society should put in a foot, it would move the
whole Land, <hi>p.</hi> 321. by tumults and popular
seditions, before they could be removed out of
their places.</p>
                  <p>But because they have taken this Glorious
Name, and preserved it by the favour of a Pope
who not being able to resist their importunities,
gave them as many Bulls as they thought fit to
desire as themselves have observed, they say,
That the use and office of this Name which
consists in fighting for the Church seems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to their Fathers by the particular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
received by the Popes Bulls, since none
can, be ignorant that we can prove to our glory
by every dayes experience, that no man almost
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65277:67"/>
hath declared war against the Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in these evil times, who thought it not his
duty to swear an immortal enmity against our
Fathers: So that the passage in Scripture may
be as properly applyed to our Society as it was
to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I will shew him how much he must
suffer for my Name, <hi>p.</hi> 123.</p>
                  <p>Why should I trouble my self further to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the boldness of these new Apostles who
pretend to make as many Articles of Faith as
they please, to find new senses of Scripture, in
corrupting it, and turning the passages from
the true sense to apply them to themselves; for
if you believe them, 'twas not so much of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> as of their Society that Christ spake when
he said, <hi>I will shew him how much he must suffer
for my Name:</hi> They who have any love for their
salvation, are much concerned that the faith be
not corrupted by these new additions, and those
who receive easily these Articles of Faith of the
<hi>Iesuitick Church,</hi> ought to fear lest they forget
those which <hi>Christ</hi> hath taught his Church;
what they add in the same behalf is an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
without ground, pretending the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
(as they call them) make war particularly
against them, by reason of the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
which they bear; to shew it is not for the Name
of Catholicks which they have common with
the Bishops, the Popes, and an infinite number
of Doctors, Ecclesiastical persons and Fryars,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65277:67"/>
but because by particular priviledge they bear
the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> in bearing that of <hi>Iesuites.</hi>
As if the hereticks believed not in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and held not the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> Sacred and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as we, and as if it were not known that
<hi>Calvin</hi> hath put the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> at the top
of every page of his Institution, to endeavour
to sanctifie his books by that Holy Name, as
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> make use of it to hallow their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
actions and opinions.</p>
                  <p>In another place with a pride proper to them,
and on design to draw glory to themselves from
the hatred of hereticks towards them, say they,
all the enemies of the faith, fling their darts at
us, as if the maintenance of holiness, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion depended on the subsistence of
our Society alone, being perswaded, that if this
pillar of publick safety were pulled down and
ruined, there could be nothing easier than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to destroy the faith, with the piety, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and worship of the Church: As this
thought is suitable to the good opinion the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
have of themselves, I <hi>believe</hi> them at least as
capable of it, and all other thoughts of self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and vain glory, as the worst of those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>But as to the particular animosity between
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvanists,</hi> and these fathers,
all the learned know, that it proceeds not from
an opinion that they are better able to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and many other excellent persons of the faculty
of divinity, and other eminent Prelates are
stronger against the <hi>Lutherans</hi> than those of the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> and that when compared with <hi>Saintez</hi>
upon the Eucharist, or Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> against
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the books of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> look
like those of Students or School-boys: besides
it comes not to pass, because they of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches think them more holy than
other <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> (though they publish
themselves altogether perfect and <hi>Ramparts of
the Doctrine of Faith)</hi> for they know as well as
the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> that their spirit is less
humble, their life less austere, their knowledge
less Ecclesiastical, their charity less patient and
meek, their piety less dis-interessed, than those
of other <hi>Orders;</hi> but 'tis because the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
preach no other thing in their books against he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
but that they ought to be exterminated
and burnt: And that those Hereticks who have
not zeal enough to seek the Glory of false mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
love more the charity and gentleness
of Catholick Doctors and Bishops, <hi>who desire not
the death of a sinner but that they may be converted
and live,</hi> than the irregular zeal of those who
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65277:68"/>
labour not so much to convince men by Truth,
and overcome them by Charity, as to destroy
them by injuries, and ruine them by violent
counsels, which they inspire into Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
against them.</p>
                  <p>Another Reason that the Hereticks are more
inclined to ingage with them than other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Doctors, is, that those Fathers fill their
books with new Opinions, fantastick tenets,
and corrupt maximes which give the hereticks
great advantage against them, this medley of ill
things making it more facile for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send
themselves against their writings, and to
answer their Reasons:</p>
                  <p>Other Orders are said to come of the Saints who

so of the rest, which is the reason they are called the

great reason, that according to the custome among

given it the surname of Christian, from his name
Christ, appears in the foundation of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
whereof they say Christ is the true and
first Author, and gave it his Name incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
more August than his Surname, as if he had

he might reserve this highest honour for the

This vision,</hi> sayes Maffens the Jesuite, <hi>was the

But 'tis a strained conclusion, and will hardly
pass for a good inference in any but <hi>Iesuitical

them at <hi>Rome;</hi> it was his intention that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Order</hi> should assume his Name, which the

                  <p>Thus the <hi>Iesuites</hi> being a company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Apostles, do but praise God in praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of other simple men: You may hold them
impeccable, as the Angels and Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

most subtill and most spiritual sin, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Chief Order of Angels in Heaven,
and might have kept <hi>Paul</hi> from ever coming

of Satan to buffet him, lest through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

declare they have no need of, having attained

                  <p>'Tis the priviledge of these Examples of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
above other men, that they can without

them a work, may be resolved their doubt; for
they teach us here, that the greatest Glory of
the Society is the same thing with the greatest
Glory of God, that being the work of God
alone, as they do but praise God when they
praise themselves, so they act for God when
they act for themselves, and love God in loving
themselves: And that we can no more accus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

When first the Society began to appear, the
Pastors of Souls and other Ecclesiasticks, who had
strangely neglected their own, and the peoples sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

purity of Religion and Manners succeeded, where
impiety, ignorance, and luxury had reigned, nor

which Vice had usurped. <hi>pag.</hi> 54.</p>
               <p>It was the pleasure of God to cure by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety

               <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> think they have re-established

               <p>'Tis true, there are many Converts in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and from the teeth outwards, that
is, that come to Confession, which satisfies these
Fathers to cry them up for Proselytes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
But permanent conversions are rare, those
attended with relapses into sin are frequent
and ordinary.</p>
               <p>I will give you an instance of the singular
address of these Fathers, for converting the
most hardned sinners, being a story from the
mouth of one of them, in a conference had
with the Nunnes at the Visitation of St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
street</hi> in <hi>Paris:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There was, said he, a person of quality,
who having lived very dissolutely at Court,
and in the Army, was dangerously sick, and
would by no means hear of going to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
it being so long since he had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any duty in that kinde, that he could not
remember he had ever done it. Those about
him used their best endeavours to perswade
him to send for a Confessor, but in vain; the
multitude of his Crimes making him asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to declare them. But being willing to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65277:79"/>
receive the other Sacraments; a <hi>Iesuite</hi> was
made choyce of to administer to him. The
sick person had no sooner discerned him, but
he cryed out, he might have saved his<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pains
in coming, for he was resolved not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.
The <hi>Iesuite</hi> promised him not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Confession, but believed him willing to
exercise Acts of Faith, Contrition and others
necessary to prepare him for death; and told
him he came to direct him therein: The sick
man consented, and after instruction given
in the other particulars, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> asked him
whether he would exchange his sins for his
good works: Which the sick man willingly
agreed to; the <hi>Iesuite</hi> thereupon assured him,
he would take upon him all his sins, and from
thenceforth esteem them his own, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
to the sick person the merit of all his good
works: This done, he pronounced his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and retyred. But being gone to the
Gate, he returned to tell the sick, he had
forgotten to ask him what those sins were
wherewith he had charged himself, so that
he could not make confession of them as his
sins, which he desired to do, to prevent dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
The sick man without any difficulty
or shame recounted those crimes which he
believed not his own. The <hi>Iesuite</hi> presently
brought him the Eucharist, and the sick man
soon after dyed, and at night appeared to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65277:80"/>
Jesuite, to give him thanks for the gift of his
merit, for which God had received him to
Glory, though he had deserved the torments
of Hell; and to assure him that his charity in
charging himself with his sins, was so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with God, that he would not impute them
to the Jesuite, but pardoned him freely.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Jesuite, in relating the story conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not, that nothing doth so quench the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of repentance in men of Religion, as to
bear them in hand, that the most hardned sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may enter Paradise without being obliged
to repentance or confession of their sins with
the humility necessary in actions of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The Examples are every where obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of persons propense not to fear any sinne,
which they think may be easily remitted. This
induced the ancient Fathers of the Church to
believe and teach, that Death-bed repentance
is very dangerous; and though they refused
not to absolve such as humbly and earnestly
desired reconciliation with God, yet it is true,
that admitting their repentance, they did not
assure them of salvation. But the Jesuites are
far bolder, and more illuminated; they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
sinners who will not vouchsafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
their sins, or if they confess them, they do
it historically by way of relation, without any
compunction or contrition for committing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65277:80"/>
them. And lest the validity of the Absolution
should come into question, they are furnished
with revelations to confirm them. But he that
hath care of the health of his Soul, will not
rely on these broken reeds of pretended mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which serve only to beget a false confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in sinners. And the charity of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who charge themselves so freely with
the most horrible crimes committed by others,
may assure us they have artifices to exempt
themselves from repentance, as they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to excuse others from it.</p>

of the mysteries of that Sacrament kept them from
the Eucharist, and so covered their disgust and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
thereof with the Name of respect. Thus the
frequent use of communion, that assured aid of
salvation seemed laid by on all sides, and (which is

ten thousand General Confessions having been

credible the whole <hi>Society</hi> established in thirty
six Provinces purifies yearly above a hundred
thousand Consciences by these General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions:
How immense is the benefit? How
worthy their pains, by this sole invention to
draw yearly out of the slavery of vice, and the
Devil a hundred thousand Souls, and set them
at liberty in the state of the Children of God:
should the <hi>Society</hi> reckon how many she puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies

would be added to the number? But were

               <p>'Tis true, General Confessions were not so

since these Fathers by acquaintance with these

of General Confessions: 'Tis a clear evidence
they confess not as they ought, but spend their

before the tribunal of the Church, whose
severity they feared, which made true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
rare even in the <hi>primitive times;</hi> a thing
not easily performed, but difficult and toylsom.
The same Fathers who taught us, <hi>That the life
of Grace was freely received by us in Baptism,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
us also, <hi>That a Soul dead in sin is not
easily revived, and that when we have made our
selves slaves to the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is very hard to break his
chains; when we have blinded our selves in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our lusts, we cannot without miracle come out
of darkness, and return into the way of Iesus Christ.
Lastly,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> is bolder than we durst have
been, when to shew how difficult it is for <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
to return to God after their fall, he uses
these terms in the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews, Chap. 6.
It is impossible for those who have been once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and tasted the good word of God, and the gift
of the Holy Ghost, and the power of the life to come,
if they fall away, to renew them again to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
seeing they crucifie the Son of God afresh.</hi>
And Ch. 10. of the same Ep. v. 26. <hi>For if we sin
wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the
Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, &amp;c.</hi>
The reason why the Apostle made use of those
vehement expressions, was his belief that he
could not implant in <hi>Christians</hi> too great an
Opinion of the difficulty to repent after falling
into sin. But since it appears, that it is the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65277:89"/>
great secret of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> policy, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of their Casuists and Confessors to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men that there is nothing easier than for
the most hardned sinners to re-enter into <hi>Grace;</hi>
I assure my self, that these modern directors of
Conscience who guide men by new lights, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read those words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
their practices, but they say with their
Father <hi>Adam, That this Apostle suffered himself
to be transported by the heat of his Nature into
strange expressions:</hi> And if they durst use lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
suitable to their practices, they would
accuse all the ancient Fathers as too hard and
morose, and applaud themselves for enlarging
and making plain the wayes of Heaven, which
from <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to their time continued nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and rugged; in a word, whereas hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was a rare thing to see a sinner Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you may now see thousands in their
Churches. Where there needs not such formality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so many tears, such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much humiliations as in the Primitive Church.
The danger is only that God changes not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their fancies, but is as just, and as
severe as ever: But this matters not with them
whose design is to make good compositions
with sinners, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

needs no more than tell his <hi>Confessor</hi> the story of
his disorders, and he is presently capable of the
greatest favours of the Church, and cleared of
his sins without fear of an after clap.</p>
               <p>When Bishops and Priests were not without
difficulty induced to proceed to the reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Penitents to God, for fear of binding
themselves in those sins, whereof they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>loose others,</hi> whom it may be, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Judge had not absolved, sinners though
reconciled, continued in fear and humiliation,
having their sins ever before them, and after
the practising of all sorts of good works, and
submission to the rigour of <hi>Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
they were still afraid they had not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the <hi>Iustice of God.</hi> And that their sins were
not so mortified, but that they might recover
the dominion of their hearts to their eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and ceased not to charge themselves
with sins of ignorance and infirmity, with
omissions and neglects. But now as if the most
hainous crimes were as inconsiderable as the
lightest faults, and as easily pardoned as the
smallest miscarriages, as if the maladies of the
Soul were not difficult to cure, and as if God
had for the future for ever remitted the severity
of his judgement against sinners from the time
they follow the advice of the <hi>Iesuites;</hi> the
most wicked of men, the most dissolute wretches
are no sooner absolved by these complaisant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65277:90"/>
but their Consciences are in peace for
all their past sins, though they are resolved to
commit them again: These are the persons
that make up these vast numbers which fill
the Churches of the Jesuites, and swell the list
of their Confessions. They are directors of all
those Consciences which love not to hear any
but pleasing Doctrines, who pretend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension
to mens weaknesses and infirmiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
and never imploy the Knife and the Lance in
the cure of their wounds.</p>
               <p>This makes all those who cannot endure
sound doctrine, but have itching desires to be
flattered in their wayes, to have recourse to
these Prophets of the last times, and having
shut their ears against the truth, are by the just
judgement of God given up to be seduced by
fables, which serve only for their greater se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
and Depravation.</p>
               <p>It may be said to the glory of the Society
that they are Guides to an infinite number of
persons, and with this advantage, that whereas
St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>That not many wise men after the
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esh, not many mighty, not many Noble were
called;</hi> these good Fathers have in their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
so many persons of greatest quality, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rich, so many wise men after the flesh, that
they have no room for the Common people,
and ordinary men: And have made the wayes
of repentance so smooth and easie, that the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65277:90"/>
most tender and delicate sinners run thither
with as much ardour and facility as they
could possibly have done to their sins and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
               <p>If you consider these Fathers as to worldly
enjoyments, and weigh their condition in the
balance of humane opinion, they have cause
to be intirely satisfied with their Estate in the
places where they reign, as having all the
Grandeur of the World prostrate at their feet;
but if you view them by the light of Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will appear so miserable as these blinde
Guides, who lead the blind, and together with
them fall into the ditch, and abyss of darkness.
They have reason to fear, that God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at their hands the blood of an infinite
number of Souls, who for want of repentance
dye in their sins, whom they abused by hasty
absolution, and covered their faults instead of
curing them.</p>
               <p>'Tis lamentable to observe, how sinners are
daily confessed by these Ghostly Fathers, but
never converted to newness of life, repenting
every moment, but never truly, drawing nigh
to God with their lips, but denying him in
their hearts; becoming Proselytes to these
new <hi>Phari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> and thereby more the children
of Hell than before. Tis true, they practise
not these things alone, but this augments ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than excuses their condemnation; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65277:91"/>
drawn others to follow their courses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tempted to like Actions, in hopes of equal
success, and as many disciples as the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
had gained by their easie devotion; so that
now there are <hi>Iesuites</hi> every where, and in all
habits, and though they claim the honour of
being the first Authors of <hi>Moralls</hi> which have
quite overthrown those of the Church, there
want not others who have imitated them in
deceiving the world.</p>
               <p>I remember, that on a Holiday, in a Church
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> I saw a vast multitude of people
thronging to Confession and the Sacrament:
And soon after in discourse with one of these
Fathers, I told him I was much edified at the
Devotion of the people, and asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was alwayes equal to what it appeared
on the last Holiday: The Father assured me
I had seen only what was usual and ordinary,
that the people were very devout, and failed
not to frequent the Sacrament often. But Sir,
said I, to compleat my joy, give me leave to
ask you whether all these persons that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
so often, do it with that piety and
holiness the Greatness of these mysteries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
whether they examine themselves se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
before they approach the Holy Table,
for fear of coming thither to condemnation,
and eating there their eternall ruine: To speak
plainly, is it probable, that all those who I see
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65277:91"/>
communicate every day in the week, do all
lead an holy and innocent life, exempt from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse
into mortal sins, after their repentance,
and in a word, are so holy as they ought to be
who so often partake of those holy things?</p>
               <p>I perceived I spake to this good Father in a
Language he was not accustomed to hear; for
being by this time sufficiently astonished, he
told me I demanded too much, and what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
was the highest perfection; that it was
a rare thing to see men who fell not into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
sins; but that those Communicants took
care to confess without fail, as often as they
fell:</p>
               <p>What Sir, said I, those persons that fill your
Churches are the same that after dinner people
Taverns and Tipling-houses, Bowling-greens
and Theatres, and other places of divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Contrary to the Gospel, they serve two
Masters, in the Morning Christ, and the rest
of the day the Devil; if so, their Confession
may in appearance bind the strong man of sin
armed in their hearts, but do not you know,
that when the House of our Soul hath been
swept only by a servile and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruitless Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and not filled after with sincere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
and garni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed with good works,
that strong man armed whom they fancyed
bound and cast out, returns thither with seven
other spirits more wicked than himself, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65277:92"/>
the last state of that man is worse than the first?
The Good Father had not the patience to hear
what I would have said, but speaking out of
the abundance of his heart, Sir, said he, must
we not save all the world? and if we cannot
send sinners straight into Paradise, 'tis good to
send them at least into Purgatory. The frailty
and weakness of men is so great in these times,
that to require great matters from them in
duties of Religion, is to make them quit all;
therefore as often as they fall into sin, we must
not neglect to grant them absolution whenas
they demand it, for as in their demand there
is an appearance of their fear of damnation,
that fear with Confession, are sufficient Grounds
to give them absolution, nor can it be denyed
them, according to the common opinion of the
Casuists.</p>
               <p>This Father could not have been more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at my Answer than I was at his reply,
Repenting in a manner that I had engaged
with a person of Principles so different from
mine, that I foresaw it was impossible for us
to agree; however I resolved to make good my
ground, and one affault more to bring him to
reason. Father, said I, I am amazed at your
expressions; what agreement can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your practice, and the Doctrine of the
Fathers? They teach us, that to persist in the
Commission of sin, for which we pretend to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65277:92"/>
have repented, is not true repentance, but a
mocking of God, that the Vicis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

another, is to turn and return in the wayes of
the wicked, which certainly end in everlasting
perdition.</p>
               <p>I know, 'tis not strange, that men who sin
naturaly, should be capable of falling into all
kinds of disorders; but 'tis insupportable, to
see them from whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

light and instruction, to serve for nothing but
to blinde them the more, and to put them out of
that just fear they ought to have to approach
Jesus Christ, without reforming their Lives.
It was St. <hi>Augustines</hi> direction, that he only
should partake of the body and blood of the
Saviour of the world, who is already a part of his
body by the union of Charity. St. <hi>Basil</hi> would
have Communicants able to say with St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
that <hi>it is not they that live, but Christ that lives in
them.</hi> St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> in this last Age advises
none to a daily Communion, but such who not
only never relapse into mortall sins, but have
no affection for the most Venial. But by your
practise, Father, these rules are exploded, for
with you they are worthy to be Communicants
as often as they confess, and to receive the
bread of life, though their crimes live, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in their hearts and their Actions. Thus
Confession alone is sufficient to make them pass
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65277:93"/>
for Devout, and a life better regulated is an
extraordinary sanctity, not proportioned to
the frailty and infirmities of persons of this
Age.</p>
               <p>The Father impatient to give me the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
could not refrain from intterrupting me,
to tell me, that they did no more than what
Christ had allowed in the Gospel, for in St.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> asked Christ how often
he should forgive the sins of his Brother, the
Saviour of the World made answer, <hi>Not seven
times, but seventy times seven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was so moved at his producing so strange
a proof, and vouching a Text so improper to
confirm the Maxim he maintained, that I gave
him not leisure to adde any more, but told
him: Have you read that passage in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel?
I doubt not but you have, but your de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire
to make it subservient to your purposes, and
to apply it so as it may countenance your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
hath made you forget part of it which
renders it wholly useless for your designs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me then to put you in minde, that there
are in that passage these very words, <hi>Lord, how
often shall my Brother sin against me, and I forgive
him?</hi> Observe those words, <hi>Against me,</hi> which
shew, that he treated only of particular offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which our Brethren may have given us,
but not of Crimes they commit against God.
And the question is not touching the use of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65277:93"/>
Keys which <hi>Christ</hi> hath committed to the <hi>Pastors</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> but of that patience, that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and charity every particular person ought
to have towards them that offend him. The
<hi>Priests</hi> ought not to remit sins committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>God,</hi> but according to the <hi>Rules</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Sacred Canons,</hi> nor have
any power, according to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to unbind
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> who is the type and figure of a <hi>Sinner,</hi>
but after he hath been raised by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to
new life: But as to offences which concern us
particularly, <hi>Charity</hi> hath no bounds, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
command to love even our enemies,
and what ill soever is done us we are obliged
to overcome by pardon and forgiveness; not
seven times only, but as often as the offence is
reiterated: This is the meaning of the place, as
all <hi>Commentators</hi> unanimously agree in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, not one pretending that those words
favour the facility of some <hi>Confessors</hi> in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
absolution to <hi>Sinners</hi> as often as they
please to demand it.</p>
               <p>I thought sufficient had been said to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and gain this good Father, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and saw by experience, that he had a
Spirit that was Reason-proof. And to be rid
of me, he told me plainly, he little valued all
the proofs I could bring, and that he would
proceed as he was accustomed; this being a
common practice, authorized by good <hi>Casuists,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65277:94"/>
and should they attempt to do otherwise, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
would become an intollerable yoke,
<hi>Confession</hi> forsaken, all the world forced away
from the Altar, and <hi>Sinners</hi> despair; he should
have added, that it would ruine many <hi>Sacred
Communities</hi> which had no better means of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
than this easie absolution, and truly by
the genius and countenance of the Father, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that this last was the most prevalent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
with him, and therefore resolved to
hold my peace; for 'tis to no purpose to bring
the most demonstrative evidences to undeceive
a man whose perswasions are grounded in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of interest, unless you first cure the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness
of his heart. We have no more to do
upon these occasions, but to sigh, and pray <hi>God</hi>
that he would effect what to us is intirely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
               <p>To return to the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> it must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that they have been very prudent in the
choyce of proper and successful means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
their design of drawing after them a great
number of people; they easily perceived, that
had they exacted from <hi>Sinners</hi> the fruits of a
solid repentance, intire self-denyal, reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life, serious mortification of Vice, they
could not have easily attained their ends, and
that if they treated the <hi>Sinner</hi> that should come
to them, according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
their <hi>Churches</hi> should never have been filled, nor
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65277:94"/>
their <hi>Confessors</hi> much imployed: But judging
very wisely, that though they obliged not <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
to put off the old man, they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to put on the new, if they promised men
<hi>Heaven</hi> for some petty works of no weight or
difficulty; there could be no <hi>Sinner</hi> so hardned
who would not be their proselyte on so good
termes, and pay them to boot for the pains they
should take to send him to <hi>Hell:</hi> This is the
reason that moved them to pitch on these
works of ostentation, and exhort all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to communicate every day in the week, and
to authorize their practice, pretend it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by an <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Valentia,</hi> in an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
<hi>of</hi> Doctors,</hi> and that he Ordained <hi>It sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uld
be free for all the people to Communicate every day
in the year, to see the vanity of their pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
authorized by this Arch-Bishop;</hi> Observe, that
it hath been ever allowed for persons truly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
to Communicate every day: But these are
not the persons they understand in the <hi>Ordinance</hi>
for being few in number, they could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the term of <hi>All the People:</hi> So that <hi>All
the People,</hi> who, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> say have permission
to Communicate every day in the week, are all
kinds of persons, and the common sort of men
who live in such a manner, that they are not
worthy to Communicate once in their age, and
never approach the Altar, but they abuse the
facility of their Confessors, and make themselves
guilty of a new crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65277:95"/>
But let the <hi>Iesuites</hi> say what they please it
cannot be denied, but the face of affairs is the
same it was before they appeared in the world,
no less Simony and Usury, Injustice and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Impurity and Violence committed now than
before: Tradesmen cheat as they were wont,
Judges take bribes, Souldiers blaspheme and

have done, is, that men commit wickedness
with ease, without fear or remorse, they make
it a sport upon the credit of these Fathers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it easie to get pardon, and when they
have chosen one of them for their Confessor,
they find him so apt to condescend, so full of
good words, and of so pleasing an h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that, as themselves say, <hi>Sinners expiate their
crimes with as much chearfulness and ardency, as
they committed them;</hi> and in a moment become
Saints worthy to receive the body of <hi>Christ</hi> as
often as they please; but the mischief is, that
their sanctity having cost little, it is but short
lived, and their passions not mortified, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
produce the same disorders again: But these
Fathers care not though the multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>We read in Scripture, that though the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

who valued not the loss of mens souls if they

only to the commission of an infinite

their Churches with innumerable multitudes of
persons who never part with their Confessors
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65277:97"/>
without absolution, what crimes soever they
are guilty of, and as soon as confest, are held fit
for the Altar.</p>
               <p>I cannot forbear the relation of a story on
this occasion, often told by a <hi>Iesuite</hi> with very
great delight: This good Father acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
he had been much hindered from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to Communion, a person so Cholerick
and subject to blaspheme, that he could not go
from the place of Confession to the Altar with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
falling into the same crimes, loosing in a
moment all the fruit of his Confession, and
wholly indisposing himself to receive the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist:</hi>
The <hi>Father</hi> according to the custome
of the <hi>Society,</hi> being more solicitous to make
this man Communicate, than to cure him of so
dangerous a malady, resolved to confess him at
the foot of the Altar, and to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to him immediately after absolution.
This rare expedient he afterwards mentioned
as a most refined invention and quintescence of
spirituality which he had brought into practice
by the happiness of his conceit without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident.</p>
               <p>How extravagant soever this conduct may
be, 'tis certainly very proper for persons who
serve their interest, and despise that of <hi>Christ.</hi>
The more corrupt men are, the more they love
to be flatter'd, and desire to be rid of that
trouble and fear that are the natural compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65277:97"/>
of crimes: And if they find such directors
of <hi>Conscience</hi> as will assure them they are in the
way to eternal beatitude, there's not a person
amongst them so sensele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s as not to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
indebted to so obliging Divinity, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
their temporal goods unto them who are
so liberal of those of God; and as the Casuists
resolve, that the Fathers are not bound in duty
to give, but may sell these things to their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes;</hi>
so these cannot but make good payment
for their gentleness, their condescendence, their
lies and their cheats. Nor can it be doubted,
but that the confessionals they multiply so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in their Temples are so many little mines
of Silver and Gold, for as they procure all
conveniencies for their penitents, it cannot be
supposed they forget themselves. And while
others who have not the excellent address of
these Fathers take great pains by serious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to dispose penitents to a sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and a newness of life, these good Fathers
are so dexterous and nimble, that they dispatch
in a short time the most detestable and inveter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
sinners. The most corrupt consciences
which appear to others as an impenetrable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byss,
never stop their Carriere, who <hi>Can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess

need onely consider their Relations of the
pomps and shows they fill their Churches
withall, they make it their Glory to draw the
people thither, by erecting machines which may
render their industry admirable, and surprize
the eyes of spectators. But in the mean time
neglect their cures, and the Churches of other
benefices they have usurped, though they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
nothing to satisfie the most curious; their
Altars are adorned with the most exquisite pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and delicate sculptures, nothing appears
but rich and magnificent, and all animated by
Consorts of Musick that ravish the sense: So
that the house of Prayer and Penitence, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into a place of pleasure and divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and oftentimes they act their Tragedies
and Comedies, and pass several dayes in most
profane manner, though it must be confessed
they forget not for all that to say <hi>Mass.</hi> The
world knows how they profane the Chappel of
the Colledge of <hi>Marmonsteir,</hi> which they had
united to their Colledge at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Rector
of the University was obliged to exhibit an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
against them upon his own view of
the disorder, having found in one part of the
Chappel a Haberdashers shop, and the rest full
of Hey for the horses of a person of quality
their Pensioner. Since that time I have seen
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65277:98"/>
men at work there to dress up a Theatre, and
prepare <hi>Machines</hi> for a Ballad which we must
have learnt in the Chappel, or gone all day in
search of the Dancing Master who practised
there only, and was not permitted to come into
their Colledge for fear of disturbing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and troubling their exercises.</p>
               <p>I know not whether they finde these means
very proper to incline men to prayer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire

left us for prayer. For our <hi>Divine Master</hi> in the

would pray, to enter a private place and shut to

ought to be observed, as far as possibly it may

Chaunt, and to render their prayers more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
by joyning with their brethren in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:
Besides when they Chaunt, all their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65277:99"/>
words are intelligible, that their thoughts may
be imployed and taken up in attending the
sense, and filled with the affections of <hi>David</hi>
in the composure of the <hi>Psalms:</hi> Thus the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus</hi>
and other <hi>Orders</hi> of Religion retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their primitive purity and simplicity of
spirit, have nothing in their Churches to
scatter and dissipate their thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
nothing to <hi>ravish their eyes and their
eares,</hi> and to draw away their hearts from
minding their devotions, to gaze on fine fights,
and wander in vanities. The like may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in such of our Cathedrals, wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ancient simplicity, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting that may be necessary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
performance of the external worship of
God, so we find not there such numbers of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
Ornaments that serve only to amuse
grossie and carnal spirits and earthly dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Such simplicity and modesty please not the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> they must have something to quicken
the senses; and whereas Christ Commands us
to offer our Prayers in the most private retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our houses, &amp; from the bottom of our
hearts to prevent the distractions of our straying
and wanton senses; these Fathers invite us to
enter their Churches, to see and hear thing to
ravish our eyes and tickle our ears, but to empty
our hearts of all affections of devotion, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65277:99"/>
render us incapable to pray with Reverence
and Attention.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they glory in their shame,
and triumph in that which ought to be their
confusion; they rejoyce in these practises for
which they should mourn, and prove by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that men are so wretched, that there's
nothing so ridiculous, nothing so contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but may serve to flatter the vanity of their
humours, and raise up in their fancies moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of pride.</p>
               <p>Had we leisure to examine that intire Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
composed by <hi>Alegambe,</hi> of the names of
their Authors, it would be a fresh instance of
their vanity and pride. Can any thing be more
ridiculous than to amass an infinite number of
names of pitifull Books, and more pitifull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
to make the world believe their Society
is full of extraordinary men? What Glory was
it for the company to have produced those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable

and their Authority, to bring their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
and ridiculous Novelties in Credit, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,
Poza, Garasse,</hi> &amp;c. have done.</p>
               <p>Is it not a shame, that they have permitted
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65277:100"/>
those scosting Companions, those ill-made
Spirits of their Fathers, <hi>Binet, Monk,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
to write Books so intirely ridiculous?</p>
               <p>Are they not struck with prodigious, and
irrecoverable blindness, to boast of those works
they have composed against the sacred persons
of Kings and of Bishops, and to own those
mischievous Books, which were published un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feigned names, and deserved censure as
soon as they came forth, as those of <hi>Seribanius,
Smith,</hi> and <hi>Mariana?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, What reason have they to insert in
the Catalogue of their Works those books they
have stollen from others, whereof their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But though this be common among
these good Fathers, and every dayes practice,
I will content my self at present with one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
by which it will appear, they spare not
their best friends; but are ever ready to do them
any injury which may afford them the least
hope of Glory.</p>
               <p>'Tis notorious to the world, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
they maintained against the University of
<hi>Paris, M. De Monthelon,</hi> whose name is famcus
in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> defended their
Cause against <hi>M. De la Martiliere;</hi> and that this

but the misfortune was greater to have Clients
so ingrate as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> proved to him. For
is it not strange, these Fathers should envy
their Advocate the glory of having defended
them, and attribute the Argument he publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

The Three Priories in Alsatia, usurped by the

of <hi>Strasbourg:</hi> the second in the Village of
<hi>Veldbach,</hi> and the third neer the town of <hi>Alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
in the Countrey, reunited to <hi>France</hi> by the
Treaty of the peace of <hi>Allemaigne.</hi> The first
depends on the Abby of <hi>Chesy,</hi> and the two

being in the Abbots, and preserved without
interruption, and the Prioryes alwayes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed

               </p>
               <p>The Priory of St. <hi>Valentine</hi> was founded
about the eleventh Century, by two Monks
of the Abby of <hi>Chesy,</hi> in the Diocese of
<hi>Soissons,</hi> assisted by the Offerings and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the people, upon the occasion of the
Great Miracles wrought by the Martyr Bishop
of <hi>Soissons,</hi> when those Monks in their return
from Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome</hi> arrived at <hi>Ruffach,</hi>
enriched with his Reliques by hte Gift of the
Abbot of St. <hi>Potentience</hi> of the same Order in
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> so that in a short time they
built that Priory which continued alwayes in
the possession of the Monks and Abbot of <hi>Chesy,</hi>
though the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have not omitted any arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
from the beginning of their institution, to
make themselves masters thereof, contrary to
the Bulls of the Popes, <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
3<hi rend="sup">d,</hi> who excommunicated all those that should
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65277:102"/>
attempt any thing concerning the said Priory,
in prejudice to the rights of the said Abbot and
Monks: For after the year 1578. they procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and obtained from time to time Bulls upon
Bulls, but so voyd and null they durst not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them: And in 1618. they huddled up all
the nullities and obreptions of the precedent
Bulls into one, suggested by them to have been
obtained for the benefit of the Colledge of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they set forth contrary to the truth that
it was a simple Priory without a Convent, and
aliened long since from the said Order with the

In pursuance of this Bull, these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

though the <hi>Iesuites</hi> in 1638. had obtained
Letters Patents from the said King, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation

they got by surprize, upon false suggestions that
the said Priory ever since 1578. had been Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically
united to the Colledge of <hi>Selestat,</hi>
which had not been founded before 1615,
and that the said <hi>Verdot</hi> of <hi>Chesy,</hi> whom death

issued from Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> Bishop
and Lord of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> under pretence of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting

design he had to write the Life of the deceased
Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> his Father; but
it was his desire to compose a piece worthy
the subject, and for that purpose to retyre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some pleasant place, where he might have
good Aire and refreshment, and named a fair
Abby of the Order of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> excellently
seated, as a place fit for his designs. Which
the Emperour approving of, gave him Letters
of recommendation to the Abbot, who made
him all the welcome and good entertainment
imaginable while he sojourned there. The
<hi>Iesuite</hi> was so taken with the pleasantness of
the place, that he was enamoured of it, and
resolved to begg it of the Emperour: To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
this design, he made it his business, not
only to watch narrowly, and accurately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
but amplifie the smallest defects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
of the Fryars, and having finished
his double work, took his leave with all the
marks of greatest satisfaction from the Abbot
and Fryars, who believed their Guest would
serve them for the future as a powerfull Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the Emperour upon occasion: The

his Majesty the Book he had composed of
the life of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, told him with

deceived in the choyce he had made of the
place to write in, for whereas he thought it a

House of Religion, he found it a House of
scandal and debauchery, and had seen exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of a most dissolute life amongst men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Religion, but having nothing of it but
the habit. That his Majesty was obliged in
Conscience to remedy it speedily. The good
Emperour answering, that disorders must be
reformed: The <hi>Iesuite</hi> replyed, that these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
were arrived at such excess, that he saw
no other remedy but a total expulsion of those
debauched Monks; and that if his Majesty
pleased to give the Society the management
of it, such good Order should be taken that the
Change would quickly appear. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

the place within eight dayes, and leave it to the

               <p>Another Abbot of the Order who by good
Fortune was by the Councel immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
an express to the poor Abbot, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
him of the Resolution taken against him,
The affair being communicated in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as usual) it was concluded that the Abbot
accompanyed with one of the ablest of his
Monks should go to Court, to seek a remedy
for this misfortune, and to prevent their total
ruine. When they presented themselves to the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65277:112"/>
Emperour, they found him so prepossess'd, that
he presently rejected them, telling them his
word was engaged, and he could not revoke it:
The Abbot bethought himself of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
he besought his Majesty to be graciously
pleased, that he might at least defend his Cause
by a publique dispute; which was granted him,
and the dispute continued three dayes succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.
The <hi>Iesuite,</hi> who maintained the part
of the Society, and flattered the Emperour by
attributing to him a power he had not, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at his pleasure of the Benefices of Ancient
Orders, and change their Foundations, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had born away the Bell the two first

the third day insulted over the Monk
who accompanyed the Abbot, slighting him
as a Cypher, and one that came thither only to
fill up a room, or make up a number: The

than the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> having on his Knees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Abbots blessing before he made his
Defence, and received it, made it appear, that
there is a time to be silent as well as to speak,
and that as he knew the former, he was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the later: He began to repeat from
one end to the other all that had been said, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
answered and replyed, on the one side
and the other the two first dayes; and after
that so refuted the seeming reasons of the <hi>Iesuit,</hi>

that he taught him to hold his peace, having

               <p>As there's nothing more just than to restore

which were,</hi> That he was of opinion he could not

such course that the Religious Orders might flourish

thereof: that pursuant to this design he had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Authority. Imperial, that the Abbies, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65277:126"/>
other places Consecrate to Religion, which had been
profaned by the iniquity of the times, or converted to
other uses should be restored every one to the Order to
which they belonged, as being Consecrate thereto
from their first foundation, and not to another. <hi>He

that they were ready to serve him in any thing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65277:126"/>
but what concerned the interest of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
<hi>F. Lamormam</hi> seeing them leave the
Court, presently suggested to his friends, and
gave out in Speeches, That these two Abbots
had made a voluntary Cession of several Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
to the Society: And on this fiction,
(whereof he was afterwards convicted by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and authentick Acts) he grounded a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,
which he presented to the Emperour,
desiring that in pursuance of the voluntary
Cession of these two Abbots, his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would send Commissioners into several
Provinces of the Empire, to put the Society in
possession of those Abbies. Having by this
means surprized the good Prince and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
who took this Imposture for truth, they
obtained Letters addressed to the Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Generall of the Circles, to three Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials
of the Society, and to the Generals of the
Imperial Army, the Duke of <hi>Friesland,</hi> and
Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> forthwith to sequester the said
Abbies.</p>
               <p>All the world was astonished, sayes learned
<hi>F. H,</hi> at this sudden and unjust Change of
the Emperours former Orders, not knowing
what cause could possibly incline this Prince to

               <p>But the <hi>Iesuites</hi> raised a report, that this
Change proceeded from the voluntary Cession

the name of their Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the two
Abbots were obliged to make a solemn prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
against this notorious falshood, both
by Letters to the Confessor, and by publick
Acts, insisting that they had not so much as
thought of a promise to consent to the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

any power so to do. And a famous <hi>Benedictine,</hi>

discovered, they resolved for maintaining
their unjust usurpation, openly to confront
and attaque the Edict of the Emperour, and
the right of the ancient Orders: This they did
by two Writings, wherein the Emperours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to his Ambassadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> suitable
to his Edict executed already in several Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes,

charged to have exceeded his power in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of these Abbyes to their ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But seeing that all the Ministers of State of

of the Confessor, and opposed their unjust

                  </gap>hes.</p>
               <p>To the first point, where the good Fathers
suggest, that the Fryars had not title to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies;
<hi>They Answer,</hi> That the <hi>Iesuites</hi> denying
that the Abbies did belong to the Ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Religion, did not cover their injustice,
but render it more visible; and that they did as
a Robber, who taking another mans purse
should tell him, <hi>Friend, I do you no wrong, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not your goods; this purse belongs not to you.</hi>
And as to the second point of their pretended
moderation, and their perfect disinteresment,
<hi>The Fryars answered with astonishment,</hi> That hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
written so many Books, and published such
Volumes to destroy the Edicts of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
having sent so many Letters to the great
Lords of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> to engage them to solicite
from his Majesty Imperial a gift of these Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
to the <hi>Society of Iesus,</hi> they feared not to
say, That the Soveraign Powers of <hi>Christendom</hi>
constrained them by force to accept of these
Abbies, and that they were not ashamed to call
themselves Children of Obedience, who could
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65277:136"/>
not resist the Soveraign <hi>Pastor of the Church,</hi>
whom they were obliged to obey by a quadruple
vow. In the mean time, to inform the world
with what Faith these Fathers proceed in their
Actions, the <hi>Benedictines</hi> produced a letter of
the late Cardinal <hi>Riche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ieu</hi> to the Congregation
of Cardinals in 1630, wherein as the Abbot of
<hi>Cluny</hi> he complains, <hi>That the Emperour having
Ordained,</hi> That all the Monasteries which had
been possessed by the Protestants should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the same regular Orders on which
they depended before the usurpation; <hi>It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
nevertheless,</hi> That the Provost-ship of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
being a dependant on the Abby of <hi>Cluny,</hi>
to which his Prodecessor had presented an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
was claimed by the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who disputed
his Orders, and desired to possess themselves of
it on pretence to found a Seminary there.</p>
               <p>But because these solemn testimonies, and
their violent actions publickly done in the face
of the Sun, made it visible to all, that they had
a passionate desire to take away these Abbies
from the owners, they thought fit to confess
their desire, but with this trim and pleasant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction;
<q>That the Fathers of the <hi>Society</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
the Estates of these Abbies, not for the
Estates, but for the conveniency of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a greater number of persons to labour the

Whereupon the <hi>Benedictines</hi> no less wisely than

truly; <hi>Observe</hi> that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> did not so eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the defrauding of the Church of necessary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers

the gain of Souls, to the favouring of

many that envied her prosperity, and very
powerful adversaries, but presaged that they
and their posterities should one day acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
under the sense of the Chastisements of

in the Conversion of Hereticks, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to perform with that dexterity and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

multiplying Jesuitical preachers; that there
were multitudes of other pious men of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

with the dexterity and success of their <hi>Society;</hi>
that it was a piece of injustice and falsehood to
say they would not, and of arrogance to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
they could not perform as well as others;
That if the <hi>Iesuites</hi> were as necessary to the
Church as they would be taken to be, God
had provided other means for their subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
than to uncover one Altar to cover an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
to rob the ancient foundations for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
new comers. That it would be hard
to prove, that the change they desired was for
the bettering and improvement of the ancient
Abbies: That when <hi>Iacob</hi> saw the Ladder,
he built an Altar of stone, and poured oyl
upon it; but these good Fathers keep for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the profits of the oyl, reduce Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into bare heaps of stones, and Abbies into
Countrey-houses; so that in truth, the change
they make for the better is not in the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but in the Ministeries of their Kitchins.</q>

This Warr of the Jesuites of <hi>Almaign</hi> against

stopped by the opposition of the Ecclesiastical

cooled, not out of any vertuous disposition, but
disability to attain their unjust desires: And
though they appropriated by their shifting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

in that Town where they had a Colledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
All this appears in express terms in the
Commission they obtained, though the one and
the other were notoriously false, the said Nuns
of the Order of the <hi>Cisteaux,</hi> having been in
possession of the said Abby many months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>'Tis the saying of a Pious Doctor, that the
Devils prophecy what they <hi>will doe;</hi> so these
Fathers bestirred themselves with all expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make that appear true in Act and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was absolutely false in allegation:
The first Cheat they applyed themselves to
was this: Having perswaded these Nunnes,
that they were not secure in this Abby, as situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in the Countrey, and exposed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
of Souldiers and violences of Warr;
they proposed as an expedient that they should
for a while quit the Abby and retire to <hi>Goslar,</hi>
where it should be their care to procure them
reception, which was accordingly done in the
Monastery of <hi>Franquemberg</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1631.
But though the Nunnes, frighted by this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
departed the Abby, their Moveables, their
Servants, their Cattel, and Houshold-stuffe,
were left at <hi>Voltigerode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> having sped so well in this piece
of craft, soon made it appear, that the Nunnes
had no reason to fear any incursion of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65277:141"/>
or violence but theirs. For presently after,
<hi>viz.</hi> 29 of the same month of <hi>March, Herman
Gauvinz,</hi> Provincial of the Company, took
possession of the Abby, and left some Jesuites
in it, and forced the Nunnes Servants to swear
fealty to them, without any signification to the
Superiors of the Order of the <hi>Cisteaux,</hi> or to
the Abbot of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> Guardian of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.</p>

did, forcing me clear round the Abby, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cast me out of the Cloyster, they made
me march between the two Sergeants in the
midst of a field, led by the Arms like a thief.
Meeting a Chariot by the way, I catched at

such violence, that on the morrow I found

the servants of Hangmen, to put themselves by
their insolence, into the possession of Temples dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the living God, consecrated by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and adorable Mysteries of Iesus Christ. And
to dragg away innocent Nunnes from thence by

fervently reproach the Jesuites with the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

these holy Virgins, for not obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Jesuites to depart the Abby; and
having retyred into the Church-yard, as in

                  <hi>COVRCOL</hi> for the Appellantes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandantes
sets forth, <q>That the Suite was of a
Contract of Sale of a house situate in this
City of <hi>Metz</hi> passed by <hi>F. Forget</hi> then Rector
of the Jesuites of the said City for the use of
the <hi>Vrsuline</hi> Nuns of <hi>Mascon,</hi> stipulating for a
new establishment of the Nuns of the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be made at <hi>Metz</hi> aforesaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the qualities of the parties would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the cause, it being certain that the Nun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
come from <hi>Mascon,</hi> for the new establishment of
this Monastery, were not of the Community or
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65277:148"/>
Nuns of this Monastery; for that according to
the constitutions of the Order, such Nuns as
had not made profession in the new Monastery
remained still profest Nuns of the Monastery
whence they came out, and whither they might
return or be recalled; and the Nuns of the new
Monastery were not obliged to retain them:
so that neither this Monastery of St. <hi>Vrsula</hi> of
<hi>Metz,</hi> nor the Community thereof had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
but from the day when the first of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellantes
made profession there, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
was not accomplished untill there were
three Nuns profest; that two infallible and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive
consequences arose from hence; the one,
that the Appellantes who made up the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
having not been privy to the Contract
nor ratified it, the Defendant had no Action
against them, nor morgage on their dowers;
the other, That they could not be otherwise
answered than as <hi>Minors,</hi> who are alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveable
in these things, they may have done to
their prejudice; That judgement had been
given in the like case for the Jesuites of <hi>Authun</hi>
and <hi>Bourg</hi> in <hi>Bresse,</hi> as may appear by an Arrest
of the Parliament of <hi>Dijon</hi> in 1632. and by a
judgement of the Presidial of <hi>Bourg</hi> in <hi>Bresse,</hi>
whereby the Jesuites relieved for purchases they
had made to their prejudice, being damnified
a third part thereby in the price paid above the
value of the things purchased. That there is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65277:148"/>
damage sustained of above two thirds; for in
1627. this house with another adjoyning call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Duponce</hi> was bought at twenty seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Francs Messines.</hi> In 1642. the Jesuites upon
an exchange valued it but at thirty thousand
<hi>Francs</hi> with all the improvement and buildings
they had erected, after the demolishing of others
very considerable. In 1646. it was farmed at
four hundred and fifty <hi>Francs M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssines per Ann.</hi>
In 1649. they offered it to Nuns, and a person
of quality at twenty seven thousand <hi>Francs</hi> of
the same money, but they refused it as not
worth so much: Yet the same year 1649. <hi>F.
Forget</hi> the Rector, having been in several Cities
of the Kingdom, and afterwards addressing
himself to the <hi>Vrsulines</hi> of <hi>Mascon</hi> surprized
them by several untrue suggestions, and sold
them this house at thirty thousand <hi>Liures Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois</hi>
currant money of <hi>France,</hi> which make four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
thousand <hi>Francs Messines;</hi> so that the
Nuns are damnified above two thirds; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the consideration of damage, the frauds,
artifices, cheats, and false suggestions on which
the contract was grounded, make it void and
null.</p>
               <p>This will appear by a writing of <hi>F. Forgets</hi>
intituled <hi>Important Avisoes</hi> wherein he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
this house, but with many fictions and
disguisements of the Truth, both as to its si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and the consistence of the buildings,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65277:149"/>
and promised several advantages which had
never been, nor ever will be; and to gain the
better credit, he writ, and caused to be written
a great number of Letters to the said <hi>Vrsulines,</hi>
and the late Lord Bishop of <hi>Mascon;</hi> and not
content with this, he sold the house according
to a plat-form, and model both of the body of
the lodgings, and the frontispiece signed with
his hand, but found false upon view, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
made of the house with the model;
That he had sold it as in good condition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the view taken, and by him report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Mascon,</hi> which was also false. That he
sold it, as all regularly built and fit for Nuns,
so that there was not, said he, any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished
but the grates and windows, whereas
in truth there was not one regular place, save
the Dormitory, which was not habitable by
reason of the stink and infection of the River
<hi>Seille,</hi> and the publick Sewers; that there was
no Church, no burying place, no Cloyster; that
he suggested, other Nuns would have bought
it, which was not true; that the Nuns of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
who were sent to instruct the Virgins of this
new Monastery in the rules of Religion, and
their Order being accompanied with two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality bound for <hi>Metz</hi> to see whether
they had been cheated in the buying of this
house: when they came to <hi>Chaumont, F. Forget</hi>
made them believe that they could not pass fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65277:149"/>
without danger of their lives, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their return to <hi>Mascon,</hi> as may appear by a
letter of <hi>F. Forgets;</hi> yet the morrow after <hi>F.
Forget</hi> writ another letter quite contrary to the
former. Lastly, that there was so much deceit
and fraud in the business, that it was evident <hi>F.
Forget</hi> to make the Nuns of <hi>Miscon</hi> believe that
this house cost the Jesuites more than he sold it
for, suggested to them that the decree of adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
was made to them for twenty two
thousand and three hundred <hi>Liures,</hi> without
adding <hi>Messines,</hi> and afterwards in his sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
of the workmens accounts and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
he made them also believe that there
were improvements and buildings of above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thousand <hi>Liures Tourtois</hi> value, which was
not so, in regard that allowance being made for
the buildings they had demolished, all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
were not worth two thousand five
hundred <hi>Liures Tour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ois.</hi> Further, <hi>F. Forget</hi>
fearing lest the Nuns upon the place might have
discovered the trick of <hi>Liures Messines,</hi> dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
stipulated by the bargain of Sale, that the
Evidences of their purchase of this house were
not to be put into the hands of the buyers till
after full payment of the whole price.</p>
               <p>That the lapse of ten years could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against the <hi>Appellantes,</hi> because their
Community had its beginning between five and
six years since: That by Evidence communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65277:150"/>
by the Defendant himself, it appeared that
the Nuns of <hi>Mascon</hi> who remained there, had
made continual complaint against the Rector of
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> for the cheat he had put upon them.
That this was carefully concealed from these in
this Monastery, that the Rector of the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
did plot and contrive by intelligence and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with others to deceive the Nuns
that were to make profession in this Monastery,
by keeping the contract from their knowledge;
That the pretended ratification of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 13.
1649. made by the Nuns of <hi>Mascon</hi> sent hither,
could not hurt or prejudice the <hi>Appellants,</hi>
who never appeared nor intermedled therein,
nor had ever agree'd or ratified it: That the
pretended ratification had been contrived and
extorted by <hi>F. Forget,</hi> who was Director Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Temporal to the Nuns who came from
<hi>Mascon,</hi> that by the reading it was evident he
had digested and compiled it as he pleased.
That it was visibly false in all its propositions,
and could not give validity to a contract in it
self fraudulent and null. That the Contract of
Sale could not oblige the <hi>Appellants</hi> who were
not privy to it, since it is not permitted for any
to stipulate for a third person. That the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of restitution were not necessary for the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants</hi>
but for a surabundance of good right
they had taken them, to the end no act they
could have done might be objected against
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65277:150"/>
them; That the Defendant having already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
eighteen thousand <hi>Livres Tournois,</hi> it was
much more than the house was worth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he concluded, that in regard of the said
Letters, and in allowance thereof the parties
ought to be remitted into the same estate they
had before the Contracts of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 16. and
<hi>Decemb.</hi> 13. 1649, and the Defendant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to restore the eighteen thousand <hi>Livres</hi>
by him received upon the <hi>Appellants</hi> offer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the said house: And in the Suit by
conversion of Appeal into opposition, that the
Seizures made at the Defendants request be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
null, injurious, and wrongful; and an
<hi>Ousterlemain</hi> granted thereon with costs, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DE CLOS</hi> for the parties intervenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fathers, Mothers, and next Kin of the
Nuns, said, <hi>It may not be thought strange these
parties intervene in the cause, as being of no less
concern than the destruction of a Monastery, and
tending to the famishing of their Children the Nuns.</hi>
That the Defendant, or <hi>F. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rrest</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
in the Office, having by a fraududent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
surprized the Nuns of St. <hi>Vrsula</hi> of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
had the dexterity to conceal this Contract
ten or twelve years till he had apprehension of
the letters of <hi>Rescision;</hi> that to secure his debt
by sufficient morgages of the Dowers, which
from time to time should be brought by new
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65277:151"/>
Nuns into this Monastery, having published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
that this house had been given the eight
Nuns come from <hi>Mascon</hi> to establish the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
for their Dowries; he proceeded at last to
the Seizure of all the Revenues of these Nuns,
and had caused the Rents and Pensions of the
Nuns and Pensioners to be seized to draw from
them the payment of the sum of twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Livres</hi> pretended residue of the price of the
house in question, and nine years arrerages:
That this unexpected rigour reduced the Nuns
to the necessity of begging, contrary to the rules
of their Order, and the tenour of the permission
of their establishment at <hi>Metz,</hi> or falling again
into the hands of their kindred; That the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Nuns were sacred, and not subject to
Commerce: That the Church tollerated no
other use of them, than only for the Alimony
of Nuns: That they could not be diverted to
the payment of debts, much less of debts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to question, secret and fraudulent as this;
yet it appeared, that by the Contract of Sale of
the said house <hi>F. Forget</hi> had the boldness to sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate
a particular morgage to secure his debt
upon the Nuns Dowries, who should make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
in this Monastery; and so the Dowries
of these Nuns should be aliened along time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their profession, which cannot be judged
to be other than Simony; that the monies of
these Dowries having been stipulated for Alimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65277:151"/>
could not be seized for the Defendants debt.
That the new Nuns, who alone made up the
Monastery, had never signed any of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
made use of by the defendant against them
which were alwayes kept secret; so that they
were at their full liberty to accept them or not.
That the Nuns of <hi>Mascon</hi> had been so grosly
surprized in this, that they were excessively
damnified. That these parties had a notable
interest, and were concerned to take care that
their Daughters the Nuns should not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in an unhealthy and infected place; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he concluded, <hi>That having regard to their
intervention, it would please the Court to grant the
Appellants and Demandants their Fines and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LE FEVRE for the Rector of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi>
said, <hi>That he could not admit the App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
to be parties; that they were not qualified to
sue;</hi> that being Nuns profest of the Monastery
of St. <hi>Vrsula</hi> of <hi>Metz</hi> aforesaid, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to proceed at Law without their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour;
the particulars which compose the body,
having no power without their head: That all
the Convent ought to have been parties, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
denied to the particular Nuns, whose
proceeding was so unjust, that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
by their Superiour; that though the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
had been past by the <hi>Vrsulines</hi> of <hi>Mascon,</hi>
who were not profest of the Monastery of <hi>Metz:</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65277:152"/>
it was good notwithstanding, for that it was
passed for, and to the profit of the Monastery to
be established at <hi>Metz:</hi> That new establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were made no other way; that if such
Contracts should not oblige houses newly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bished,
and the Nuns that should make profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
there, the Sellers should be alwayes cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that they should give away their estates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any assurance to receive the price for them.
That the Committy of the Monastery of <hi>Metz</hi>
begun on the day when the first Nuns sent from
<hi>Mascon</hi> were encloystered and continued, and
was increased by the profession of such as were
newly received; that though the Nuns newly
profest were not named in the Contract, nor
had ratified it, yet they were obliged by it, as
the new Monks of a Monastery are bound to pay
the debts of their predecessors in the same
house. That the Dowers of the new Nuns
coming by acquisition to the Convent, were
from thenceforth subject to the discharge of
priviledged debts, as the price of the said house,
which was their habitation and part of their
Alimony: That the juniority they alledged
could stand them in no stead, because the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
was made with all formalities requisite,
and by the Authority and Counsel of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
who had contracted; and therefore
the Contract must stand, otherwise no person
will Contract for like establishments, nor with
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65277:152"/>
Nuns. That the desire of an object came as
well by the ears as the eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that it was not
necessary the buyer should see the thing he
would buy, but it sufficed if he knew its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and value by the report of another: That
there had not been any deceit, fraud, surprize,
or trapan on <hi>F. Forgets</hi> part, who in his <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Avisoes</hi> delivered nothing but what was
true concerning the description of this house:
That the platforms and models of that house
which he gave them, were true, if the places
were measured by the foot of <hi>Metz</hi> according
to the custom of the Countrey where they were
drawn: That the Nuns had the liberty to cause
it to be viewed before they took possession; that
they had perused it six weeks, ratified the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and declared it agreeable to the model
received of <hi>F. Forget</hi> in the City of <hi>Mascon,</hi> and
that they had found it fair and more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for regularity, and the functions of their
institution, than they conceived or imagined at
the time of the purchase; that if <hi>F. Forget</hi> had
been their Director Spiritual and Temporal, it
was an extraordinary favour received of him
who deserved other acknowledgements than
those they made, and that for this reason they
could not annul the ratification, for otherwise
they who intermedled with their direction, and
should take care of their temporalities and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
could make no Contract with them; that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65277:153"/>
the intervention of their Parents and Kindred
was precarious and useless: Therefore he
concluded, that without regard to their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Rescision and restitution, or to their
opposition, the App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>Ioly</hi> was heard for the Kings Atturny Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and said, That the business depending
was of great importance, as well in respect

of the Jesuites on the Goods given them

part: That whereas question was made
in the Cause, touching the quality of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants,
as not parties capable to plead,
without the assistance of their Superior, the
establishment of the quality was a thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65277:153"/>
to the Suit, and that he was of opinion,
that this obiection was not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Appellants only were concerned in
the differences now in Judgement, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that if the Jesuites pretensions took place
they should be reduced to beggery, and see
themselves deprived of things given for their
Dowers and Aliment, without having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with or known these suits to have been
their Creditors, as also for that the Superior
and other Nunnes remaining of the 8 come
from <hi>Mascon,</hi> to make this new establishment,
should be received at any time to return into
the Convent, whereof they were alwayes
deemed to be part, according to the rules and
constitutions of their Order. That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
all obstacles in this point, is that in all
Communities Secular and Regular, when any
thing hath past prejudicial or contrary to the
Canons, Ordinances and Arrests, there is not
one particular member in the body, who hath
not good ground of Appeal as for wrong; and
that in such case the assistance of the head was
needless, for that it falls out often in such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
that the head is the party to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of. Having established the quality of
the partyes Appellants, with a brief summary
explication of the fact, the parties reasons for
maintaining their pretensions, he said, It might
have been wished that an affair of this nature
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65277:154"/>
had not appeared in publique: And that the
partyes had not of themselves been inclined to
have agreed among themselves and done one
another Justice. That it was horrid to see per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who made profession of a life more perfect
than other men, disposed to break the sacred
tye of that holy union, which we ought to
finde among the most Lukewarm Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we must endeavour by exact examination
to stoppe the further oppression of Justice and
Equity, and to preserve them from incerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in their stations. To effect this, we must
inquire whether the damages sustained exceed
the moity of the Just price, whether there were
any deceit or surprize, whether the Appellants
were Minors, and lastly how con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iderable the
Contract in question might be: To settle the
damage he said, That the house had been
bought by the <hi>Iesuites</hi> by Decree for 22 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
300 Livres Messines, every Livre twenty
Groats value, which makes 12 Sols six Deniers
Tournois, and amounted in all to 13 thousand
935 Livres, ten Sols Tournois. That the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
had assured the <hi>Vrsulines</hi> as well by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as by their <hi>Avisoes,</hi> entituled <hi>Important,</hi> that
the house with the improvements would come
to 30 thousand Livres, not adding Messines:
That as to the reparations and improvements,
they produced no Accompt or acquittance of
the workmen who had laboured there; so that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65277:154"/>
it might be truly said that they had none, or
that they were so inconsiderable, they durst not
shew the just summe they amounted to. That
it was true the <hi>Iesuites</hi> agreed not to the value
of Livres Messines, as before reduced to Livres
Tournois, but would by this means have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
the business, and prevent Judgement
at the hearing; but at last upon the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
Calculation by Letters, the 22 thousand
300 Livres Messines were valued at no more
than 16 thousand Livres Tournois; so that
the damage remained still most enormous, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
approached very near the moity of the just
price. As to the fraud and deceit, it was visible
by them that <hi>F. Forget</hi> had great power over
the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sulines,</hi> who placed an intire confidence
in his words and writings; so that it was no
wonder that they gave so easily 30 thousand
Livres Tournois for a house which he assured
them to be worth so much; which he offered
to justifie, laying a Paper on the Table to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the particulars, but never spoke to them
of Livres Messines which was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

instead of shewing the Contracts and Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
he stipulated that after payment of the
purchase-money for the house, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
into the Nunn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Contracts and Evidences concerning the said
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouse: Further, that neither the Nunnes, nor
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65277:155"/>
any person on their behalf had seen the house,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd that there was presented them a modell
which was not agreeable to the house, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the house fairer and more convenient
for Lodgings, and of greater extent than in
truth it was, being 16 fadomes, two feet and
three inches more than the house did effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contain, as appeared by the last process ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
of the view taken by Order of this Court.
The truth is, the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> to defend themselves
against this objection which annulled the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
for that it was an error in the substance
and matter of the Contract, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the modell as a counterfeit thing, and not
delivered by them, had it not been signed in
two places by <hi>Fa. Forget;</hi> so that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themselves of the shift to say, that the
Stair-cases were added in the modell which
are usually left out of designs of Architecture,
and confined themselves at last to the sole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of saying, that the measure of the Stairs
was not taken by the Kings fadom, as in truth
it was, but by the fadom of that Countrey;
which caused a greater Errour, for that the
fadom of <hi>Metz</hi> is almost two foot and a half
greater than the Kings. That true it was, by
the foot it was less than that of <hi>France,</hi> but it
was as true, that it contained ten feet, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
of <hi>France</hi> but six: As to their minority, there
was no difficulty in the case, since it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65277:155"/>
that the Nunnes newly pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est were
Minors not only in respect of their Age, but
of their quality of Nunnes, and as members of
a Community which is alwayes considered in
minority: But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against all those reasons, the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> opposed the prescription of 12 years,
and that it was never heard of, that a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser
should be received to propose damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
thereby to procure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> restitution of the
purchase-money paid, or part thereof. As to the
prescription, it could not be pleaded against
the Nunnes newly profest; for that they could
not be esteemed a Community till they were
of the number of three, according to the Law,
<hi>Ner atius at D. de verb. signif.</hi> Besides, it may
be said, the Community hath not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced,
for that they have not any admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the affairs of the house, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Letter produced by the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by their Superior to <hi>F. Forget,</hi> wherein
she told him she took excessive pains, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
from the new Nunnes the state of the
House, and feared their care in the inqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
would quench in them the spirit of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>As to the restitution, there were some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in it in the state of his Majority, but in
a Minors Case damnification is a sufficient
cause of Restitution: That the <hi>Iesuites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had been relieved in a purchase they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65277:156"/>
made as was observed by the Demandants ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
though they were damnified but a third
part: That in the last place it was opposed on
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> part, that the Contract was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
five or six dayes after the Cloysture of the
Nunnes. But this Act was of no force, for that
it was signed at the Grate, and by Duresie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the terms it contained made it suspicious,
for instead of a pure and simple ratification
they made an Elogy of this House to the Nun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
who upon a visible induction were to say, that
they found it much fairer and more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
than they had imagined it to have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though in truth it be less commodious and
spacious than by the modell it ought to have
been. But though this Act had been drawn
in the best form, it might be said it could not
any wayes oblige the new Nunnes, for that
when the Act was past, not one of them was
then received into the Monastery, and that
since their Entry they had not ratified any Act:
That the last observation to be made, was to
consider the validity of the Contract, which
may be said to be absolutely null, for that no
person is thereby obliged: Not the Nunnes of
<hi>Mascon</hi> who passed it, for that by an express
Clause they had stipulated, that they were not
in any wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be bound in, or lyable unto the
payment of the Principal and Interest of such
sums as might become due in pursuance of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65277:156"/>
said Contract. Not the Nunnes newly profest,
who were never privy to the Contract, nor ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
it afterwards, so that they were in <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntegro;</hi> that they were neither bound perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
nor by reall security: That if it were
objected, that the Nunnes of <hi>Mascon</hi> had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the dowers of the new profest Nunnes, it
were vain, since it would prove to be <hi>Res inter
alios acta quae tertio noc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re non debet.</hi> So that we
may observe an enormous damnification in
this Contract, a considerable surprize, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
minority, against which they could not
prescribe; and three nullities, whereof two
might be drawn from the disagreement of the
house with the modell: The first, by reason of
the error that occurred in the substance of the
thing sold, the other drawn from the defect of
capacity and ability to contract, for that the
permission and Authorization of the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Mascon,</hi> was grounded on the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the modell with the house. And for
the third nullity it might be taken from the
Contract which was null in it self, as not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
obliging any person to the execution.
Therefore he was of opinion, that there was
sufficient reason to receive the Kindred inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the Cause, and to do them right
upon their intervention, together with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of rescision, and allowing them to declare
the contract in suit null and of none effect,

the holy zeal they have for their Greatness put

               <p>The 8. of <hi>March,</hi> 1645. being the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for execution of what they had long
before designed, the first thing they did was
the Arresting of <hi>Villar</hi> the Procurator of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
under pretence of an Assembly and
Consultation they intended to hold, and took
from him all his books of Accompts, Papers
and Registers he had in his Chamber.</p>
               <p>The day following being <hi>March</hi> 9. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
and Rector assembled all their Creditors
in their house of profession, and in presence of
the most considerable persons, and of best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the City, who came to this Assembly,
the Provincial declared the desire they had to
give satisfaction to all the world, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nevertheless at the same time to perswade
them to lose the moity of what was their due.
And though they had caused a Notary to come,
that they who could be made consent to so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
a resolution should sign it before him,
there was not one person would do it: The
small hopes they saw of success in their design,
gave them cause the next day being the tenth
of the same month, by means of their Rector
to suborn a Creditor, who having accepted the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65277:160"/>
Proposal made by the Provincial should call
upon the rest of the Creditors to accept as he
had done, and joyn all together to receive pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
accordingly: Upon this demand a Judge
Conservator named by the Colledge, proceeds
to the sequestration of the Estate of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but acted with so much partiality, and
other defaults in the procedure, that he gave
the Rector of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> way to pay them who
would receive Money, six millions of Marave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
and the Conservator himself paid above
fourteen thousand Ducats, and in all these pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made by the Rector and Conservator,
they followed the Orders given by the <hi>F. F.
Iesuites,</hi> and executed to their power the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials

real securities, and treating with every one how
much he would lose.</p>
               <p>The procuring of a <hi>Conservator</hi> wholly at
their devotion was of so much advantage to
the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> that by assuring him or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of a pension of one thousand Ducats <hi>per
annum;</hi> they made him their Protector, who
ought to have been the avenger of such cheats,
and criminal impostures. The noise of this Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querupt
was so great, and so scandalous, that
all the world was amazed and scandalized at it,
and especially the Creditors who saw no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

for they who had treated with these
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65277:160"/>
Fathers saw themselves involved in great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
for what they had quitted to

which the Licentiat <hi>D. Iohn de Santelices</hi> found
among other papers of the Colledge, which

their Colledge shall possess their

               <p>'Tis, Sir, very remarkable, and merits a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

great sums of money to many private persons

the resolution of your Council, that they
may do as their brethren of <hi>Sevil</hi> have done, if
they come off well in this affair; for their thirst
to amass money, Sir, is so insatiable, that it is
believed, their houses in both <hi>Castilles</hi> owe two
millions of money for things deposited with
them in confidence of fair dealing, for monies
they have borrowed, and for debts they have
contracted on divers pretences.</p>
               <p>'Tis worthy observation of how great sums
they defraud the Church and your Patrimony

Imposts, or part of the Contributions which
are levied for your Majesty on Ecclesiastical
Estates; so that it would be more profitable for
the Church and your Majesty, that these Estates
were possessed by Secular persons.</p>
               <p>You cannot too much consider and reflect
upon these sins, and those crimes which the
ruine and poverty of so many Widows, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and women of quality have caused; and
what strangers not well grounded in our Faith
and Religion may say, to see an affair of this
Nature pass before the eyes of a King so Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

consisting of persons so eminently Christian;
besides what may be apprehended from the
desperate resolutions of so many considerable
persons who find themselves ruined in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and their Estates, which they see in the

               <p>These poor Creditors, SIR, most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech your Majesty with tears in their

which Letters are inserted in the proceedings

might practise on him the Doctrine of their
Father <hi>Amy,</hi> who allows a man of Religion
to kill him who publishes things scandalous
of his Order, as they had practised on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
occasions, and particularly on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Doctor <hi>Iohn D' Espino</hi> whom they
poysoned three times; which is so notorious,
that there is not a person in <hi>Spain</hi> or the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
who fears not their poysons and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies:
This obliged <hi>Villar</hi> to quit the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>

and to marry in the peace and face of the

Now the <hi>Iesuites</hi> give out, that the Cause of
the Banquerupt was the Knavery of <hi>Villar</hi> who
reigns in his roguery, and triumphs, and feasts
himself with the spoils of other men. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
they lye, and refers himself to what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

               <q>
                  <p>Nine and thirty years agoe, a Gentleman,
one of the 24 of <hi>Sevil,</hi> called <hi>Iohn De Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve,</hi>
returned very rich from the <hi>Indies:</hi>
He was not marryed, nor had any Childe, but
a woman sued him who pretended to be his
Daughter, and that he had not only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
her before marriage, but that afterwards
he privately married her mother, so that she
was his daughter, and could not be debarred
from inheriting his Estate. <hi>Iohn de Monsalve</hi>
falling sick of the sickness, whereof he dyed,
while this suit depended, for clearing his
Conscience sent for a <hi>Iesuite</hi> of the Colledge
of St. <hi>Hermenigilde,</hi> with whom he settled
what concerned his Conscience and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and told him the Action this woman
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65277:168"/>
had brought against him was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
and the matter of fact she had alleadged
utterly false, and that he was obliged to
dispose of his Testament so, as this woman
might not know after his death what he
should leave behind him, in Money and
Moveables. Whereupon this Father ordered
his Testament as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn De Monsalve</hi> hath disposed of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveables

and as to his Moveables and Money,
which amounted to eighty five thousand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,
he made a Writing signed by himself
and the said <hi>F.</hi> Jesuite his Confessor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

which he reserved out of this Revenue, to be

Ordaining further, that if any of those to
whom this right of Eldership should descend;
had Children, those works of piety should
cease, but so as provision should be first made
for giving and founding an endowment for
portions, suitable to the Condition and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a number of maidens to be marryed,
and the heirs by right of eldership to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Administrators of this work of
piety: Pursuant to this disposal, the said
summe of 85 thousand ducats, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
were put into the hands of the <hi>F. Iesuite,</hi>
who assured <hi>Monsalve</hi> they should be used ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the declarations above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn De Monsalve</hi> being dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Heirs

of <hi>Billon</hi> or black Money, (a sort of
Base Coyn cry'd down) surceased her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and quitted her pretensions. And
the Woman within a short time after dyed
without Heirs, which had been sufficient alone
to end the suit; so that the <hi>Iesuite</hi> was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as the case stood, to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e published the
writing, and have paid the money to <hi>Monsal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi>'s
heirs: But all this was too little to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to discover the Money and
Writing, either in the life-time of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
or after his death. And thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for above 39 years this summe, out of

which they raised a Rent of three thousand
three hundred Ducats <hi>per ann.</hi> which they have
enjoyed to this present, when Providence hath

               <p>The <hi>Sieur Iohn De Santelices</hi> forthwith
caused a Copy to be made of <hi>Monsalve</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,

no persons deserve Legacies better than

in the last Paragraph of their secret advice, that

joyntly, as they alone doe. This sets them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
to procure Gifts, and severely chastise
such as promote not that design, as destroyers
of the Society; whereof you have a fresh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the following story at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A rich Woman, who had much Kindred in
that City, fell sick: She had for her Confessor
a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> who attended her in her weakness,
and as a faithfull servant of the Company dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
her to make her will in favour of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi>
and leave them all her Estate, without
the least thought or remembrance of persons
whom Nature did strictly oblige to take care
of, being her Nephews: The Confessor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home overjoyed with his success, and
in sport demanded the reward due to them that
bring good newes, as thinking he had done
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65277:171"/>
an heroick Action, having gained the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
so considerable an Inheritance: It so fell
out that one of these Fathers illustriously des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
and as Noble in Disposition as blood,
was moved at this impudence, and desiring to
undoe what the other had done, went to the
sick womans house at a time when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
was absent, his habit procured him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
which had been denyed to one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for 'tis a Maxim of the <hi>Iesuite</hi>
not to admit any of another Religious Order
to the sick they visit, for fear they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
what they have contrived. This good
<hi>Iesuite</hi> brought a Notary with him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to this woman, that in the condition
she was in, she was more obliged to satisfie the
duties of Nature than devotion, and so engaged
her to revoke her Testament, and all the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
she had given the <hi>Society,</hi> and to leave her
estate to her lawful heirs: The woman died,
and the Confessor made himself master of the
house, and all the keys; he caused the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be opened, whereby it appeared that
she made the <hi>Iesuites</hi> sole heirs of all her estate:
But as the <hi>Iesuite</hi> pleased himself in being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of this inheritance, and having compassed
his designs, and behaved himself with great
haughtiness towards the Nephews of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
thinking to make them dance attendance
in waiting his leasure for an inconsiderable Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65277:171"/>
their Aunt had left them, the Chief of the
Nephews presented them the Codicil, took from
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> the keys of the house, and drove
them all out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> made narrow search for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this treason, and having found him to
be the Father of whom we have spoken, the
morrow after they put a billet under his nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
commanding him to retire, for that the

to expell whole Communities for the fault of

This may assure us, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> having

Author, <hi>Cap. 3. Lib.</hi> 2. reports the persecution
raised against them by the Emperour of <hi>Iapan,</hi>
and the cause alledged by the Emperour to
have been, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> were Cheats and

salvation, came to raise the people, and plot
some treason against him, and the Kings of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan;</hi>

they had long since deceived him as they had
done many other Kings and Princes; so that in
six years they had discovered the end they had
in preaching the Gospel, and made it appear to
have been the destruction of Princes.</p>
               <p>It cannot be said the Emperour did this out
of hatred to the <hi>Christan Faith,</hi> who gave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

the <hi>Iesuites</hi> were engaged in trade, that some

brought thither, the commodiousness of
its situation for security of his Vessels, and at

might take it away from the King of <hi>Omura,</hi>

The Emperour followed their advice, and

a Secretary to one of the Emperours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;
but though they gained him to their

other; for the Emperour caused the King to be
beheaded, and <hi>Dayfaqui</hi> burnt, and <hi>Morejon</hi> the

This King is charged with the killing of a Son
he had by a former wife, to make way for the

The Emperour hereupon conceived a

to the second persecution, which was much

him, who thought he had already sufficient to
remedy the pressing necessities of the State, and
was very inquisitive for the Counsels of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
which they gave him.</p>
               <p>The first was, That if the King would give
them all the Chairs of Professors in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of the Kingdom, they would not desire
any Salary for their Lectures; but his Majesty
might impropriate or sell the Salaries of the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65277:178"/>
Professors which amount yearly to above four
hundred thousand Ducats, and were worth to
be sold above eight Millions.</p>
               <p>The second, That the King should prevail
with the Pope to reduce the breviary to a third
part of what it is; when this should be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they would print Breviaries and Diurnals
of the new model to be used; but that they
who would make use of them should pay in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the pleasure they had done
them in abridging their Office ten Ducats for
every Breviary, and five for every Diurnal, as
every Clergy-man payes yearly four Rials for
his Bull of permission to eat white meat in Lent:
By the calculation they made, the profits of this
exceeded the former.</p>
               <p>The third, That whereas they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the rules of their Order to receive
money for their Masses, his Majesty should take
all the money of the Ecclesiastical Fraternities
of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> and oblige them to say

               <p>'Tis evident by these three Advices that the

The design of the Embassy was

not consent, but having taken possession of his

saying, the Society had the priviledge to do so.
This was the occasion of very great scandall,

The Dean of the Church of St. <hi>Foy,</hi>

about a scruple of Conscience, which was that
the Fathers of the Company of <hi>Iesus</hi> in that
Countrey, preached and heard Confessions
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65277:182"/>
without permission from the Ordinary, the
resolution of the Assembly after several meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
was, That it was the Archbishops duty to
demand of the said Fathers, what permission
they had to exercise those Functions which he
did, but had no other Answer, but that they
had Priviledges: The Archbishop not satisfied
with this, endeavoured by way of right and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

power they exercised this jurisdiction, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the permissions or priviledges they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

but the Archbishops enemy, to be their
Conservator. This Conservator proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Archbishop, encouraged by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
occasion he had from the spleen of
the Governour <hi>Don Sebastian Hurtado de Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera</hi>
against the Archbishop, for having refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give the <hi>Iesuites</hi> a House and Garden of
pleasure belonging to the Archbishoprick, and
of the Gift of the <hi>Augustine</hi> Fryars, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
it for a place of retreat and repose for
the Archbishops: And because this House was
very convenient for the Fathers of the Society,
and that the Governour was their particular
friend, as his Confessors and Councellors, they
assembled together, and resolved to chase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Archbishop. The Governour willing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65277:183"/>
to execute this resolution, sate President of the
Audience, without the assistance of any but a
single Councellor, who was found dead on the
morrow without Confession. The Archbishop
demanded leave to make his defence, but the
Governour instead of hearing him, being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> resolved by their advice
to execute upon the place the banishment of
the Archbishop: All the Religious Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
having been informed, that the Ministers
of Justice were gone to the Archbishoprick,
resorted to their Prelate, and with their Tapers
in their hands advised the Archbishop to put
on his Pontifical habit, to stay in the Chappell,
and hold the Eucharist in his hand, to serve
him as a Buckler against the Governours tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and the violence of the <hi>Jesuites:</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
having intelligence of what passed,
commanded Souldiers forthwith to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with Matches lighted, and their Muskets
cocked, to cause all the Fryars to depart the
Chappell, and leave the Archbishop there alone.
And when the Provincials, the Commissaries,
the Priors and Wardens, had answered the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
that they were there to pay their respects
to the holy Sacrament, the Governour gave
the Souldiers new Orders, on pain of death, to
execute his Commands, and dragg them by
force out of the Chappell: The Souldiers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
him, driving out and dragging away all
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65277:183"/>
the Fryars thence; and though some of the
most ancient and venerable amongst them, in
hope to preserve themselves from their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
covered themselves with the Archbishops
Pontifical habit; the Souldiers had no respect
for those Ornaments, but furiously laying hold
on them who had wrapt themselves therein,
they dragged away the Archbishop, who hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holy Pix in his hands fell in the crowd,
and wounded himself in the face. So the Prelate
remained alone, but having five hundred Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
left about him to seize his person as soon
as he should quit the H. Sacrament. In the mean
time one of the Souldiers considering the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
used to make them keep him there, and
that they must on pain of death execute the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
Orders, drew his sword, and falling
upon it, said, <hi>He had rather dye by his own
hands, than see such enormities among Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arch-Bishop having continued so long
in his pontifical habit, found himself so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by reason of his great age, and that he
had taken no food that yielding at last to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
and necessity, and in complyance with
the Advice of the wisest of the Fryars, who sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to him that if he died in that manner his
Conscience would charge him with it as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
he laid by the Holy Sacrament, and
was presently carried away out of the City in a
Coach by the Sergeant Major and Souldiers,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65277:184"/>
and put into a little pitiful bark unprovided of
all things, without permitting any <hi>Christian</hi> to
give him any nourishment, or any of his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
to accompany him, but was conducted by
five Souldiers whom they gave him for his
Guard into a poor desart Island where he had
not as much as a Cabin for shelter.</p>
               <p>And when in all this time Divine Service was
not said in any part of the City, by reason of a

with the respect and sentiments they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to express, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> only kept their
Churches open, preached, confessed and said
Mass there, and went to say Mass in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
house, to whom they administred the
Sacraments.</p>
               <p>They took from the Arch-Bishop the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Diocess, and gave it another by
order of the Judge Conservator and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi>
till the Arch-Bishop was re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which hapned after they had seized all his
Goods, and sold them by Out-cry even to his
Cross to satisfie several fines, and pecuniary
pains, to which they had condemned him.
The people having with great instance demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his restoration, had it granted, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

their desires by means of the Governour.</p>

                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:65277:184"/>
The Arch-Bishop sent two Fryars, the one to

well, that he went directly where they were,

               <p>The Story of this persecution is related by
the Author of the <hi>IESVITICAL THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATRE</hi>
p. 230. where he gives another cause
of the Governours Animosity against the Arch-Bishop,
whereof the <hi>Iesuites</hi> were Authors:
For they perswaded the Governour to send to
hang a man in the Church-yard of the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines:</hi>
The Arch-Bishop not able to endure
such prophanation to punish the Governour
made use of the Arms of the Church, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
censures against him; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
also made use of the Arms of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as appears by the precedent relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:65277:185"/>
It is easie to Judge, sayes the Author of <hi>The
Iesuitique Theatre,</hi> that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> moved the
Governour to execute this violence against the
Arch-Bishop, because the Governour who did
nothing in Secular Affairs without the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
Advice and Consent, in all probability consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in this which concerned Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction, which as a Secular Person he was
ignorant of. 2. Because the <hi>Iesuites</hi> had on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
occasions had very great differences with
this Prelate as they have had with the greatest
part of the Bishops of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and finding a
fair opportunity by the Governours being
wholly theirs, thought it not fit to let it slip,
but with their own hands avenged themselves.
3. Because all the Superiours, and a multitude
of Fryars attended the Arch-Bishop, and left
him not till forced off by violence, but there
was not one Jesuite with him. add hereto the
Common Sentiment of all the people in the

of this Lake, and thought it for their advantage

end, they might draw to themselves the whole

came from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Cochin</hi> to visit the Bishop, an
Apostolical man, and formerly a bare-foot
Fryar of the Order of St. <hi>Francis:</hi> They told
him they were moved with compassion to see

the faith; he made them great welcome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
them as a powerful succour God had
sent him for the good of those of his Diocess;
he told them he had not an estate sufficient to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65277:186"/>
assure them a revenue, but would propose to
the inhabitants of the City to give them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to subsist, and that in the mean time they
should lodge at his house, and make use of
what he had or should have for the future. The
<hi>Iesuites</hi> were satisfied with these offers which
the Bishop performed. For the first two years
these Fathers laboured to good purpose, in
Preaching, in Catechizing, in pleasing all the
people, in composing differences, in winning
the <hi>Indians,</hi> by presents, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sing them with great
gentleness, and testimonies of affection; and
thus became Masters of the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>When they saw themselves so established, they
thought it high time to labour the execution of
the design on which they first came into that
Countrey. To compass it, they perswaded the
<hi>Indians</hi> by good usage and caresses to sell them
the pearls they drew out of the Lake, it being
but just, that they who were their preachers
and instructors should be preferred before the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> Merchants, who came from a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
remote, and at a certain time of the year to
make gain thereof by carrying them into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places: The simple <hi>Indians</hi> discovered not
what lay hid under this malicious proposal, but
easily granted what the subtle <hi>Iesuites</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
so that every week they brought the Pearls
they had taken and sold them the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:65277:187"/>
(whom they looked on as their Masters &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors)
for the same price they were accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to sell them to the <hi>Portugueze;</hi> and having
received their money and other things they
gave them, returned to their houses very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> Vessels coming at their usual
time, there was not an <hi>Indian</hi> now would sell
them any Pearls, so that they returned without
trading, and lost very much by the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
they had brought to give in exchange.
And the year following running the like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
they resolved to come thither no more,
being otherwise informed that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> had
made themselves Masters of the Trade.</p>
               <p>The Fathers seeing they had removed the
<hi>Portugueze,</hi> and made them abandon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
as unprofitable to them, so that they of
<hi>Cochin</hi> knew not whom to sell their Pearls to,
made the inhabitants become suitors to them of
the <hi>Society</hi> to buy them, and told them they
would not without great abatement of the
price; that the <hi>Portugueze</hi> had forsaken the
trade, only because they made no benefit by it,
nor could sell the Pearls at a higher price than
they cost them.</p>
               <p>Under these and the like pretences they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
these poor <hi>Indians</hi> to extream misery, and
constrained them at last to yield to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and when they could not do otherwise to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65277:187"/>
sell the Pearls at a very low rate: they passed
about two years in this manner, exercising vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
over the people; and the most consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
persons of the City murmured against the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> yet some did defend them, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
were joyned with these of the <hi>Iesuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bishop knew the rise of the disorder but
durst not intermeddle for applying the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
necessary, because the Governour of the
City was a Creature of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and it may
be, went snips in the profits; so much will they
do for those that protect them.</p>
               <p>This time elapsed, they resolved to change
their battery, and gain greater advantages in
the Commerce, telling the <hi>Indians</hi> they would
not buy the pearls any more at the ordinary
price, because their gain thereby was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
but they offered them a condition,
as if they would have dealt with them to their
greater advantage, though it was in effect to
make them their slaves, which was, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
should work by the day in the Lake; and
what they took in fishing should be for the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites:</hi>
The poor <hi>Indians</hi> rather than famish ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the condition. The pay was very
short, and the labour excessive, for they made
them begin at break of day, and suffered them
not to come out of the water till noon, and

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65277:188"/>
where they were forced to continue till night.
Many died in the water, because the fathers
would not permit them to come to land when
they had need, which obliged the poor people
to complain to the Bishop; he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
it but could not, for that the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
seeing themselves upheld by the Governour and
others of their <hi>Cabal,</hi> made nothing of the good

               <p>They built a Castle on a little Island in the

of several crimes, but all false. There
came new Bulls, but to no purpose, for the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
persisted in their rebellion. At last the
Bishop seeing no way left to reduce them, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
some <hi>Spaniards</hi> and many <hi>Indians</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and carrying the Cross of Christ in his
Standard with the Armes of the Pope, and of
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> on the sides, marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Lake where the <hi>Iesuites</hi> attended
him with an Army more numerous than his
with the name of JESUS in their flags.</p>
               <p>The Bishop gave them battel, defeated them,
demolished the Castle, and found they had nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up all their Canons when they perceived
themselves unable to resist: they continued ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
in the Island in hopes after the death
of the Bishop to renew their tyranny. But the
Prelate inspired by God put on his pontifical
habit, and coming to the Lake side spoke in
this manner; <hi>Though I be the least and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
of all the Ministers of God, yet I command
thee in his Divine Majesties Name, and by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
not to form or give any pearls till the</hi> Jesuites
<hi>be departed this Countrey; and if thou continue to
produce them, I pray God to give thee his Curse as I
give thee mine:</hi> The Bishop had scarce finished
these words, but the waters retired and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their centre to the astonishment of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators:
The Pearls disappeared, and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
seeing themselves deprived of the profit
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65277:189"/>
they drew from this Commerce and abhorred
by the people quitted their Colledge at <hi>Cochin,</hi>
and returned to <hi>Goa</hi> with their mouths full of
insolent expressions against the Bishop: When
they were gone, the Lake filled again as before,
and produced Pearls in abundance to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
and the <hi>Portugueze</hi> informed of it return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their ancient traffick. This story was told
me at <hi>Granada</hi> by <hi>F. Diego Collado</hi> of the Order

they designed to make themselves masters
of all the Carriages necessary for transporting
merchandizes from <hi>Carthagene</hi> to the Province of
<hi>Quito,</hi> and had they compassed it they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
masters of all the Countrey thereabouts:
The Merchants of <hi>Quito;</hi> and of the new
Kingdom came to <hi>Carthagene</hi> to buy merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
to be carried in the Gallions of <hi>Spain,</hi>
though they arrived there in <hi>Canoes</hi> by the great
River of <hi>Madeleine.</hi> The <hi>Iesuites</hi> who have a
publick bank at <hi>Carthagene</hi> and at <hi>Quito,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if they had some Canoes and beasts for
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65277:189"/>
carriage, they might become masters of all that
Territory, setled themselves on the banks of
the great River, under pretence of confessing
and saying Mass to those who inhabited the
Magazines and Warehouses, where merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
were locked up till they were fetched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
on <hi>Mules</hi> to be carried further into the
Countrey; they found means by good words and
fair carriage to introduce themselves into the
Ports of <hi>Onda</hi> and <hi>Mompoz</hi> where they built
Houses and Chappels on the pretences afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said;
soon after they built Warehouses, and
from <hi>Quito</hi> solicited the Merchants to disem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
their Merchandises there upon colour that
they would give them money at <hi>Carthagene</hi> by
exchange to be paid at <hi>Quito,</hi> whereby they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their desires: The profit they made of
this sharpned their appetite to gain more by
greater matters; they bought a quantity of
<hi>Mules</hi> for carriage of Merchandizes to the port
of <hi>Barranco,</hi> where they were embarked on
Canoes; those who were accustomed to have
the benefit of these carriages began to perceive
the prejudice the <hi>Iesuites</hi> did them, but not
having credit enough to oppose so powerful
enemies, gave them no disturbance, though the
Masters of the Warehouses and Carriages did
every day lose more and more their usual
gains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:65277:190"/>
The <hi>Iesuites</hi> rested not there, but would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
further to take away all the profit from
the traders. To effect this, they built sixty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes
for the great River, and a vessel at <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene</hi>
which they sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> defraying the
charge of the equipage by the profit they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the merchandizes they embarked.</p>
               <p>They Ordered those in the Vessel, when they
returned from <hi>Spain</hi> to pass to <hi>Angola</hi> and take
in <hi>Negroes</hi> to row in their Canoes; they pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
in their design, and in less than a year the
vessel returned to <hi>Carthagene</hi> laden with above
six hundred slaves, of whom they sold some,
and imployed the rest in their Canoes. By the
pleasure they did the merchants in lending
them money, they engaged them to make use
of their Canoes and Mules; so that the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
were intirely satisfied to see nothing escape
them by land or by water: But the Masters of
the Canoes and Carriages were so far dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that they complained to the Councel of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and while they expected judgement
found means to burn all the Canoes of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi>
and, which is worse, the Council prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to have any Canoes or Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses

Mill thereupon in one night.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 388. I am so troubled with these things,
that I would quit <hi>Granada</hi> very willingly, but
am stopped by the way, by the memorable story
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65277:192"/>
of the Mill which the Jesuites of the Colledge
of <hi>Granada</hi> caused to be built at St. <hi>Foy,</hi> two
leagues from the City. The better to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
what I am to say, we must look back to
the time of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and Q. <hi>Isabelle:</hi>
These pious Princes Graciously granted the
first Inhabitants of St. <hi>Foy,</hi> for them and their
Successors, permission to draw a Channell from
the River <hi>Genil,</hi> to flood their Grounds by a
Water-course, with condition that none should
make use thereof without their consent: The
<hi>Iesuites</hi> had several years longed for the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of this Channell, and had used a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
artifices and addresses to that purpose,
but in vain, by reason of the constant oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Inhabitants of the Town, who had
alwayes made a vigorous resistance: The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
were loth to intreat persons so inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and took a resolution worthy the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in confidence of protection in this as in
other affairs, from the Chancery of <hi>Granada,</hi>
the rather because they had already possessed
with the business, and made sure to their side,
almost all the Judges of the Chamber, who
were to take cognizance of the cause. They
bought a pitifull piece of Ground contiguous
to the Territory of St. <hi>Foy,</hi> and not farr from
the Channell whereof they designed to make
themselves so absolute Masters, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Town should not take of the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65277:192"/>
waters without their permission. <hi>F. Fonseea</hi>
then Rector of the Colledge had a Lay-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Great Architect, whom he commanded
to make a Mill of wood, and dispose of all the
Carpenters work, so as in an hour to be erected
and made fit to grinde, which was accordingly
done; and the Timber, Milstones, and other
things necessary carryed in Carts to the piece
of ground above-mentioned. In the evening
they sent thither several servants of their house,
and the Farms they have in those quarters:
These workmen instructed by the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> made
a water-course on that side where the Mill was
to be built, and laboured with such diligence
in the trench, and the <hi>Iesuite</hi> plyed his part in
erecting the mill so nimbly, that at Eleven a
Clock in the Evening it turned, and ground
as if it had stood there several years.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> brought with them a Notary
whom they payd well, and he in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
gave them an act importing he had
seen the Mill grinde in their Land without
contradiction, and took the depositions of above
twenty witnesses, who said the same thing.
The Fathers thought, that being thus in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
and otherwise assured of the Judges,
no man in the world could out them from
thence: 'Twas hardly light the next day but
the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Foy</hi> understood all that
past. The sight of their walls built by K. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:65277:193"/>
and Q. <hi>Isabel</hi> their Founders in a night,
prevented their Astonishment at the nimble
erecting of the Mill: They called an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and by the command of one of their Civil
Officers, a man of spirit and courage, now a
Priest called <hi>Thomas Muros,</hi> they went to the
Mill, rased it to the ground, and filling the new
trench with rubbish turned back the water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ancient Channell: The <hi>Iesuites</hi> seeing
their Mill destroyed, made their Complaints
in the Chancery of <hi>Granada,</hi> treated the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of St. <hi>Foy</hi> with great insolence, and
in pursuance of the instructions received of
their Advocates and procurators, exhibited an
information which they had caused to be
drawn, of the peaceable possession of their Mill.
The Audience of <hi>Granada</hi> caused the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of St. <hi>Foy</hi> to be cited, and some to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested:
They spent much money in the suit,
and scaped but narrowly from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Judges to rebuild the Mill at
their own charges: But <hi>D. Paul Vasquez de
Aguilar,</hi> one of the Judges shewed himself so
Generous in defence of the Inhabitants, that
the rest seeing they had not reason on their
side, durst not contradict him, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
gave the <hi>Iesuites</hi> a Reprimande (at least
check'd their Proctors) condemned them to
pay costs, enlarged the prisoners, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all that had been done.</p>

Money by permission of King <hi>Philip</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,
for one million, to serve for the building of
their magnificent Colledge in that City: They
were not content with one million, but coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above three, but the pieces of four <hi>Marave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>
were so small, that they were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Money. The pleasantness
of it is, that if the King upon information of
their insolence had not prohibited them, they
had continued their work, and would have
been coyning of this million till Doomsday:
Hence came that abundance of their Money in

dying. This is all false, replyes he, for I am the
Governour, and very well in health, and you
are not <hi>Iesuites</hi> but Robbers; and so sent them
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65277:195"/>
to prison, where they continued all night:
The Rector having heard of this Accident in
the Morning, went in search of those of his
Order, found them in prison, and complained
to the Archbishop who proceeded against the
Governour: But the Governour would not let
them goe till they had made an Authentique
information, and proved by the depositions of
several witnesses, that they were men of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Order, and that they were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and commonly reputed such: This
took up a dayes time, and the Rector and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iesuites</hi> bestirred themselves to purpose,
and would have given money to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the mischance, and thought themselves
kindly used that the Governour insisted on no
more satisfaction for delivery of the Prisoners:
The Governour excused himself for what past,
because he knew on one side that the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
stirred not abroad by night, no not to confess
persons that lay a dying, and that on the other
side finding at midnight two persons in the
streets in <hi>Iesuites</hi> habit, it gave him just cause
to suspect that they were Robbers who made
use of that disguise. This story was told me
by a Lay-brother a <hi>Iesuite</hi> named <hi>Pantaleon
d' Almeyda,</hi> who was at <hi>Granada</hi> not many
years since, whom his Superiors have since sent
into <hi>New Spain.</hi>

but 'tis easie to discover by what follows, how
ill they perform it.</p>
               <p>'Tis known, these Fathers take on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the instruction of youth in all parts of
the world, to infuse into them the Principles of
Learning and Good manners. They managed
it so well in the Provinces of <hi>Stiria, Carinthia,</hi>
and <hi>Carniola,</hi> that the Ecclesiasticks who had
studyed under them, led so infamous lives, and
gave such ill examples, that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 5. held
himself obliged by the duty of his Office to
take order for their reformation: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in 1619. he appointed the Bishop of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane</hi>
his Nuntio in the Empire, to be Visitor,
that he might correct and punish the debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery

Priests and Students, as their true disciples,
to discharge their vow of obedience to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
See left no stone unturned to hinder the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation:
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65277:196"/>
But seeing the Nuntio far advanced
in the chastisement and reformation of these
corrupt Church-men, they found a rare expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to hinder the effect of the punishments
given them, and to procure them impunity
in their loose courses of life. <hi>F. Bartholome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Villers a Iesuite</hi> was then Confessor to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke,
and had the priviledge to give his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
first in all sorts of Affairs. He represented
to this Prince, that the Popes design in this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
was to know and procure a Memoire
of all the forces and fortifications of all his
Estate, for some purposes unknown, but such
as there was just cause to suspect; That the
Nuntio being an <hi>Italian</hi> would take with him
some persons of the same Nation to assist in
the Visitation, that it was not fit to give stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
liberty to enter the State, to penetrate its
secrets, and reduce them into Memoirs: Had
this Prince been less pious, he had not needed
greater motives to cross the good intentions
of the Pope. But having discovered these of
the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and the weakness of their reasons,
he seconded the designs of the Pope, and the
Visitation was held throughout these three
Great Provinces, wherein there were found only
fix Priests who used not Concubines, and were
otherwise guilty of scandalous living.</p>
               <p>What shall we now say of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who
would have perswaded this Prince to hinder

Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 6th, at the desire of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles</hi> the 4th, erected in 1348. an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
at <hi>Prague,</hi> whereof the then Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
was made Chancellour, and his successors
for the time being to have that dignity annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

him was not only to bestow the degrees of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,

things belonging to the Jurisdiction of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
by the Canons which have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and extend
even to the inferiour Schools. From hence it
appears, that Secular Princes have no jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in this University, and that by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
he that takes this right from the Bishop
incurs the sentence of excommunication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by the Bull <hi>in Coena Domini</hi> against
those that usurp Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction that
belongs not unto them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> who have the pride of the Devil,
and an extravagant ambition to command;
thought it a good way to please their itch of
Superiority, by bringing under their power the
people, and Ecclesiasticks of <hi>Prague,</hi> and making
themselves Masters of the University, and all
the Schools there; to effect this, they were to
establish him for Chancellour, Rector and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of all the Schools, who should be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of their Colledge, though not feasible
without interessing the conscience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65277:198"/>
which they made no difficulty of; they
perswaded the Emperour as they pleased and
executed their desires accordingly trampling

               <p>The Emperour gave all this Authority (which

They said, that the Ancient Orders of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had lost all their right to their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and rents, ever since the hereticks became
Masters of their Monasteries; and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
having recovered them by Conquest
through the force of his Armes had acquired
a right in domaine to them, and was become
absolute Master thereof, the Patron having lost
all his right. From hence they inferred, that
the Emperour having delivered the University
of <hi>Prague</hi> from the tyranny of the hereticks who
had been Masters thereof for two hundred
years, was of a Protector become Master there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by his Arms, and therefore might give it to
whom he pleased: They framed an Imperial
Constitution on this ground.</p>
               <p>Who ever heard of a villany like this? they

               <p>P. 402. I have long desired to know the
truth of a story I have been often told, and
learnt it at last of <hi>F. Morales</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <p>In 1638. a <hi>Iesuite</hi> called <hi>Francis Matthew
Cyprian</hi> came from the <hi>East-Indies</hi> to <hi>Macao.</hi>
He had scarce set foot on land, but the Bells of
the Colledge rung out so loudly, that they
shook the whole town, and gave the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
reason to enquire the cause: but they were
soon satisfied by the <hi>Iesuites</hi> running all about
and saying; <hi>F. Cyprian is come at last.</hi> He lived
as those whom the <hi>Iesuites</hi> call Saints, and the
people in compliance with them published him
for such; but that you may the better judge of
the person they so unanimously canonized, I
shall relate in few words, not his whole life,
which is too long to be written, but what he
did this time at <hi>Macao,</hi> whereof all the people
have been witnesses, and at the same time He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
to proclaim his impostures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> one day after long intreaty by the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> went up into the pulpit in the Church
of the <hi>Society,</hi> but what is usually said of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Musicians, who must be more intreated
to hold their peace than they were to sing, was
true of him, for he preached three hours by the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65277:200"/>
clock, and notwithstanding all the diligence
used, and signs made to stop his impertinent
pratling, nothing could stay the course of his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>opperies for three hours together.</p>
               <p>The subject of his Sermon was, that of his
folly, That St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> had sent him to
preach at <hi>Iapan,</hi> and in the familiar discourses
often held with him had given him that order.
To authorize what he said, he took to witness
the holy images, the walls and pillars of that
Church, and to perswade his Auditors to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the certainty of his Revelations and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he told them, that if they of the City
opposed his passage from the territories, they
could not hinder it, for he would make use of
his mantle for a bark, his staff for a mast, and
would so pass over with more security than in
a vessel well equipped: These and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in his Sermon gave the people much
trouble, because, if all things fell out as he said,
it would break the Commerce between <hi>Portugal</hi>
and <hi>Iapan</hi> to the ruine of the people. All the
<hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> and <hi>learned persons</hi> assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to consider what might have inclined the
<hi>Iesuite</hi> to talk at that rate, and what remedy
to apply. The most judicious were of opinion,
that he was a fool, but that at that time he <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
dissimulation more than solly; which opinion
had sufficient grounds, for that it was propable
he hid under these appearances of dotage, the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65277:200"/>
design he had to favour the interest of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
who made use of him as an instrument
proper to ruine the City.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyprian</hi> knew what past in this assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by the information of those co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fidents of
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> whom fear or interest ingages to
give them advice of all that is transacted; this
impostor writ in a paper all that past in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
and put it into the hand of a statue of
St. <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> which stood in the Cell of the
Visitor <hi>Manuel Diaz</hi> the Jesuite. One of the
Assembly came to see the Visitor, and <hi>Cyprian</hi>
having notice of it went to his Chamber, and
having whispered him in the ear in the presence
of the Secular person, who came to the Visitor
went his way: When he was gone, the Visitor
forthwith sayes to the townsman; <hi>SIR Know
you what</hi> F. Cyprian <hi>saish? See what that paper
is in the hand of</hi> St. Francis Xavier. The towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
took the paper, wherein he found the
names of all who had been in the Assembly
written with F. <hi>Cyprians</hi> hand, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two months they should all dye, for having
given so disadvantageous a judgement of the
<hi>Iesuite:</hi> The Visitor with great exclamations

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but the event was quite contrary,
for some of those men who were before <hi>Crazy,</hi>
had their health very well for these two months
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65277:201"/>
and a long time after: Perhaps because their
distemper forbore to afflict them out of respect
to F. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who peradventure had given
them some of his reliques, as his gray hairs, his
old shirts, or other like things, which he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
very liberally.</p>
               <p>The common people had a great esteem of
him, and would have torn in pieces his robe to
serve them for reliques, but it was new and of
very fine cloth which made F. <hi>Cyprian</hi> willing to
preserve it, telling the people that the habit he
wore abroad was not a relique considerable
enough, but if they came to his lodging he
would give them excellent new cloth of his
old torn shirts.</p>
               <p>A Pagan <hi>Indian</hi> trimmed him for nothing,
which <hi>Cyprian</hi> said <hi>was an action sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him;</hi> but the truth is, he made great gains
every time that he shaved him by selling every
hair of his beard for a relique, and when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
knew it, he said, <hi>The man must be allowed

               </p>
               <p>They were at last confirmed in the opinion
they had of him, as being a spy, or what fell
out afterwards. A <hi>Iesuite,</hi> simple and devout,
(for such also there uses to be among them)
and to F. <hi>Iohn Baptist Morales,</hi> and told him in
private: <hi>Within two months the Emperour of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
<hi>shall send in search of us, and twelve of the
Colledge, whereof I will be one, will go where requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65277:201"/>
and the first five years we shall suffer three
sorts of punishments, the Sword, the Fire, and the
Cross; and we have seen great miracles done by</hi> F.
Cyprian <hi>in confirmation of this truth.</hi> There past
not only two months but two years, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
may pass before any come in search of
them, or they go to <hi>Iapan.</hi> It is true neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
that F. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had taken his measures to go
to <hi>Iapan</hi> within two months, and had for that
purpose sent two <hi>Iesuites</hi> into a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to build a vessel for his passage; the City was
advertised of it, and sent to destroy it: But F.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> warned them who had commission to
do it, not to put it in execution, foretelling
them that there would fall fire from heaven on
them who would adventure to touch it: He
said truth in some measure, but not altogether,
for fire there was, but not from heaven, and
that burnt not men, but men burnt the barque.
By this they discovered his design, and gave ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to the inquisition of his Revelations, his
Prophecies and Impostures he made use of for
cheating the world, and the inquisitors having
found the truth of the information, ordered he
should be sent back to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and charged
<hi>Anthony Cardin</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> to bring him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but as one who had sucked the same milk,
and learnt the same doctrine, he permitted him
to flee among the <hi>Moores</hi> where he ended his

it to that time. And I doubt not but <hi>Poza</hi> the

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians Chiriguanaes</hi> live beyond the
Mountains of <hi>Peru,</hi> and are a Nation very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
and susceptible of the doctrine of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
but Enemies to those labours and pains the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
now suffer. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> undertook their
Conversion, and in a short time laboured to
good effect; these Infidels receiving the <hi>Gospel</hi>
with very great devotion; when the Fathers
saw them almost all Converted and Baptized,
and that they were dexterous and tractable,
they resolved to propose to them the end of
their preaching, which was not, as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Conversion of the souls of these Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
but to make advantage by their estates.
They told them, that being their preachers they
desired to live amongst them, but wanted lands
and hereditaments for maintenance, and desired
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65277:202"/>
their Ayd for planting some Sugar-Canes,
whereby they might be enabled to live with
Credit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> perceived the Avarice of the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> and were confirmed in their opinion,
wherein all they of <hi>Peru</hi> concurre, that these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are not Ministers of the Gospell, but under
pretence of preaching the faith of Christ, labour
only to establish their tyranny, and deprive the
<hi>Indians</hi> of their Liberty: So that they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to set upon them by night, and to chastise
them so as to make them an example to others.
Though the <hi>Iesuites</hi> had not been long in that
place, they had contracted great familiarity
with the <hi>Indian</hi> women, who had such affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for them, that they made it appear to the
prejudice of that they ought to have exprest to
their Husbands and Kindred; for they gave
them notice of the resolution taken to kill
them, and furnished them with means to flee
away. Six of them escaped, and came to the
City of <hi>Plata,</hi> where they blazed it abroad,
that the <hi>Indians</hi> out of unwillingness to receive
the Gospel had driven them away; And that
their Companion <hi>F. Mendiola</hi> had renounced
the faith, and marryed after the manner and
Ceremonies of the <hi>Indians.</hi> That this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to give Accompt of what past, that
he might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Arms, it being otherwise impossible the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65277:203"/>
should be converted: 1. Because <hi>Mendio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
cherished them in their blindness, for fear
of being punished for his faults: 2. Because
they would be confirmed in their Errour by
the ill example of a Priest and Minister of the
Gospel, who had embraced their Religion,
this made them desire forces of <hi>D. Iohn D'ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saraze</hi>
for the enterprize, and for an evidence
of the truth of their allegations, they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from <hi>Mendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>la</hi> the <hi>Iesuites</hi> habit, as having
apostatized from the Faith.</p>
               <p>The Kings Minister Judged this an affair of
too Great consequence to be hastily engaged
in, and took better advice which was to send
an express to <hi>Mendiola,</hi> to assure him of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and assistance to obtain absolution from
his Crime. This Father was extremely surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at the newes, as having never thought of
Renouncing the Faith, or quitting the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
habit. This made him resolve to be gone forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
and inform himself of all that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him on this occasion: He presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in this condition to the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and by
his presence convinced them of the falseness of
their allegations against him. Declaring that
all this was grounded on their weakness and
wretchedness, which had precipitated them
into Concubinage: And that these <hi>Iesuites</hi>
to cover their fault had attributed his to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And that it was strange, that the fault
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65277:203"/>
being common to all, he alone who was the
least guilty should bear the shame: This obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to quit the Society, and take the habit
of a Secular Priest, with the hatred we may
easily imagine he conceived against them who
had raised such an infamous slander against
him, with design to destroy him among the
<hi>Indians,</hi> left he should discover their villanies,
abhorring that Order, who on such occasions,
and to cover such wickedness will strip their
Fryars of the habit they wear.</p>

               <head>A Jesuite stabbed by the Husband of a Woman he
loved, the Jesuites suborn Witnesses to save their
Credit.</head>
               <p>P. 398. The Colledge of <hi>Jesuites</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi>
hath an Estate in a place called <hi>Caparacena</hi> two
Leagues from <hi>Granada,</hi> the administration
whereof they gave to <hi>Balthazar des Rois</hi> one
of the <hi>Society:</hi> he had such affection for a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
woman of that place, that it was publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, though the Husband was the last
who had notice of it: for the <hi>Iesuite</hi> having
imployed him to work in the Grounds, to
make him more tractable, had doubled his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
At last the poor Cuckold provoked by
the injury done him, studyed a fit occasion of
revenge. The Jesuite doubting nothing, came
one day from <hi>Granada</hi> to the Farm, and went
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65277:204"/>
directly to the Womans house, not knowing
the husband was there. But the man having
hid himself to see what should pass between
his Wife and the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> when he found them
both at their Ease stabbed the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> and left
him dead on the place, having thrown his
Bonnet aloft, and said, <hi>Away Horns.</hi> An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was exhibited of what happened,
and it was constantly affirmed the <hi>Iesuite</hi> was
an Adulterer, that the Husband had often
warned him from seeing his Wife, and had been
blamed by his Neighbours, as having consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his own infamy: The Rector of the
Colledge of <hi>Granada</hi> hearing this, exhibited
a <hi>Plaint Criminal</hi> against the Murtherer, and
designed to make a new Information quite
different from that which had been exhibited,
and took with him a Notary of <hi>Granada</hi> to
effect it: He endeavoured both by promises
and presents to perswade the witnesses exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the first information to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or at least to use ambiguous expressions
in some matters: And 'twill be worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
how he managed the business.</p>
               <p>He that had deposed in the first information,
that as soon as the Husband had killed or
wounded the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> he threw the Bonnett
aloft, and said <hi>Away Horns,</hi> upon the second
Deposition said, He remembred not that he
had mentioned that circumstance, but that if
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65277:204"/>
it was inserted in the Process, the Clark had
put it in of himself: Another desirous to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> to shew that the woman was not
lyable to suspicion, by an Equivocation said,
<hi>She was a Woman of Age,</hi> that is, as he would
have it, <hi>Very old,</hi> though I can affirm on my
own knowledge she was but 28. Most of the
witnesses used like Equivocations, but agreed
all in this, That the <hi>Iesuite</hi> was a Saint, and
that they had often seen him with his Chapelet
in his hand: The <hi>Iesuites</hi> having gotten this
information, vigorously prosecuted the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
and caused him to be condemned (by
contumacy for not appearing) to be hanged,
and when the sentence had been pronounced,
they printed the whole Process and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>verbatim,</hi> with the Definitive sentence, and
distributed it throughout the City, to those who
had known the story. I have a Copy of it by
me. I consider not so much the fault of this
Fryar, as a thing to which others may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but that the Action must be holy, just,
and canonized, because done by a <hi>Iesuite;</hi> and
that it is better cause a man to be hanged, than
acknowledge that the Society consists of men,
and of sinners. Thus their Apologies prove
more scandalous than their Crimes.</p>

               <head>The horrible corruption of a holy Sister by Mena
the Jesuite, her Confessor, who was saved by the
Jesuites from the Inquisition, marryed, and
taught Judaisme.</head>
               <p>P. 25. <hi>Mena</hi> was a Jesuite in appearance, of
very great abilities, he was lean, pale, and his
eyes sunk in his head, wore alwayes a great
head, and a great Chapelet, but it was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to cover his greater hypocrisie: when I was
a Student at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> being very young, I
heard sometimes his discourses and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which he made with such force, that his
Auditors trembled, and so he gained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and esteem of a Saint; but it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he made his Sermons before the exercise
of the Discipline of Penance, practised by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in that Colledge, for which this good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seemed to have no great affection or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
though none needed it more.</p>
               <p>Among many others who confessed to him,
there was a devout woman who was very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to whom he said that God by Revelation
had signified to him that it was his will he
should marry her, and that they should live
together as marryed persons, but it must be kept
secret, and no person to know it. The woman
would not be perswaded without seeing the
opinions of some learned persons in approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65277:205"/>
of <hi>Mena</hi>'s assertions. And as one Crime ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
drawes on another, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> used this
Artifice to make the poor woman believe that
several persons of Learning agreed with him
in opinion; he spoke with the ablest Doctors
of the University, and told them he confessed
a person very spiritual and pious, but withall
very scrupulous, and to that degree, that she
Rested not assured in following the directions
he gave her, without confirmation from other
Learned men; therefore he intreated them,
that if they had a good opinion of him, and his
long experience in the conduct of Souls, they
would appease this unquiet spirit by assuring
her she might safely follow what <hi>F. Mena</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
her: The Doctors who had alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the modesty of this mans behaviour, had
often heard him preach, and knew his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were powerfull, that he spoke of nothing
but eternity, that he repeated almost every day,
that <hi>Iudas</hi> fryed in Hell above 1600 years for
one mortall sin, and should burn there for ever,
with a thousand other expressions of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
granted his request.</p>

his holy Sister, and having made use thereof
to deceive the poor wretch, who thought the
Doctors had approved the pretended Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (the circumstances of this infamous mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

not at the same time to continue his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of piety in the Colledge, but leaving
us to perform the Discipline of Penance we
used in the Church, he retyred to his pleasures
with his holy sister in an Ermitage where he
kept her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inquisition</hi> was advertised of all this,
and caused <hi>Mena</hi> to be imprisoned at <hi>Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid:</hi>
The taking of him made as much noise as
his pretended vertue had gained him reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The Society undertook his defence, and
by their credit and Certificates that <hi>F. Mena</hi>
was sick, and by extenuating his Crime, they
obtained leave to take him into their Colledge,
where he might be in custody of the Officers of
the Inquisition: But they were so desirous to
set him at liberty, that while the Officers of
the Inquisition, who were ordered to attend
the sick man, went to dinner, the <hi>Jesuites</hi> sent
to tolle the Bell, and gave it out that <hi>Mena</hi>
was dead. And to cover this Lie, they made a
face and hands of past-board, and having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted
up a kind of body of Sticks and old
Clouts, they put this wooden <hi>Mena</hi> on a Biere,
and in the mean time mounted the true <hi>Mena</hi>
on a good Mule, which rested not till he came
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65277:206"/>
to <hi>Genes,</hi> where he hath within these twenty
years, publiquely read the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to the
<hi>Iawes.</hi> He married there, and had Children,
and a friend of mine told me he had spoken
with them at <hi>Genes,</hi> and asked them news of
their Father, who was not long before dead:
And those he had by his holy Sister I have
seen Students in the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Colledge of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi>
and very well used: As for the she-Saint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>P. 7. What passed at Alcala whereof Doctor

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65277:209"/>
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to the immaculate conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Virgin is proportioned to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
and increases according to the account
of the profits they draw from it in pleasing
Princes, or gathering money from the people
to keep the feast. They have at <hi>Alcala,</hi> as in
their other houses, Congregations for their
Schollars, and other persons who frequent their
Colledges. They assembled on a Saturday to
make a vow to defend the purity of <hi>Mary</hi> in
her Conception; after which they told them,
now you cannot be <hi>Dominioans,</hi> for they make
a vow quite contrary, which is quite false; this
done, they gathered money from all them that
were to make the vow (which was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part of the Ceremony) under pretence of the
Charges they were to be at, and made some
artificial fires which were like to burn an Image
of the Conception, which served as a Crown
to the <hi>Machine.</hi> When the Congregationists
had supped, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> gave them in their
hands a standard of our Lady, and having
many in company very far on their way, the
squadron arrived between ten and eleven a
clock in the evening at the Colledge of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
D' Alcala</hi> with fearful cryes, and a horrible
bustle mixt with scurrilous, foul, and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
expressions, calling the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Jews,
Hereticks, and enemies of the Virgin; they
threw stones, and discharged pistols against the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65277:209"/>
gates and the windows, brake down the glass,
and wearied at last, and hoarse with crying,
they went with their standard (which they let
fall more than once) to the Convents of St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi>
and the mother of God, where they
play'd the like pranks.</p>
               <p>F. <hi>Oquete</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> preached the next day,
and perswaded them to defend the Conception
of the Virgin with the sword, with the poinard,
with their blood, and with fire, and that if any
opposed them St. <hi>Iago &amp;c.</hi> which is a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Oath by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> or a menace. He forgot
only (which some say was done of malice) to
call those of old <hi>Castile</hi> to the Assembly, who
provoked by the neglect went the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to throw stones at F. <hi>Oquetes</hi> Chamber,
exalting the Virgin, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:

               <p>F. <hi>Oquete</hi> said in this Sermon, that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

wretch, wherein were all pleasures that men
may enjoy without desiring Divine, because by
his tenets beatitude consists in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and other pleasures of sense. Let the wise
judge whether he who dares affirm that there
is a purgatory where men desire not the vision
of God, where there is not any grief or pain,
but sweet scents, pleasant and flourishing fields,
makes any difference between this Purgatory
and <hi>Mahomets Paradise.</hi> It is cause of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that these Authors would corrupt the
sense of the Saints to Authorize their perverse
Opinions, for there is a vast difference between
their Revelations, and the Errour which Dr.
<hi>Aquila</hi> would introduce and defend under the
title of an Opinion. The Saints said no more,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65277:212"/>
but that in their prayers they smelled sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
and saw pleasant fields, wherein were
mens souls; which denotes the comforts they
received from the prayers of the faithful: When
parables are used to express any matter, we must
not stick at the shell but enucleate the meaning;
as when our Saviour compares the Kingdom of
Heaven to a grain of mustardseed, it is not to
be literally understood, for he speaks by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor.
My judgement of this opinion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to that of <hi>Suarez</hi> concerning it, whom
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> so often call <hi>The thrice Sage Suarez,</hi>
who sayes, <hi>Tom. 4. 3. Part. dis. 46. Sect. 1. n.</hi>

               <p>F. <hi>Gabriel de Henao</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> differs little

OF
MONSIEVR*****
to one of his Friends at Paris:
Wherein is seen the base Complaysance of the
Jesuites towards opulent and puissant persons,
and their strange conduct concerning a Regular
Abbot, whom they feared not to absolve on his
death-bed, without obliging him to make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of his Robberies, nor reparation for
his horrible scandals, but took care to interre
him in their Church at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and to extoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu desire an Account of our journey:
And 'tis fit I perform that little you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to give this testimony at least of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to obey you in the most important occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
We had good Weather every day since
we parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> as if Winter had put
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65277:216"/>
off her coming, to afford us the leisure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home with convenience.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, we passed by <hi>Clairvaux,
Auberine, Cisteaux, la Ferte,</hi> and <hi>Clugny,</hi> those
great and vast Houses, which stand famous
Monuments of our Ancestors piety. But 'tis
matter of Lamentation, that the spirit of those
Saints who founded them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being expired al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as soon as their persons, they have left us
nothing but so many heaps of stones; and that
after they were sanctified by poverty and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
their reputation hath gotten their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
riches, which serve only to maintain in
idleness and sloth those that enjoy them. But
because these evils are without remedy, I shall
not insist longer on them, but make a step as
far as <hi>Lyons,</hi> to tell you the story of a little
Conference I had there with a <hi>Jesuite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de M.</hi> one of their good Friends, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our arrivall brought us to see their House
of <hi>Belle-Cour:</hi> Having prayed a while in their
Church, I staid to look on an Epitaph I had
heard of, and hardly then finished; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
late, and my sight short, I could scarce
read any more than these two words, <hi>Piè obiit.</hi>
When I was come forth, I was glad to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
from the Father who accompanied us,
that it was the Elogy of Monsieur the Abbot
of St. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> and as I had known something
of the life of that miserable Abbot, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65277:216"/>
to learn some particularities concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his death. I told this Father, it would be
much to my comfort, if it were true, that this
Abbott dyed piously, as I had read in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph,
but I should be more joyfull to hear
some particulars of his repentance.</p>
            <p>He answered me very simply, there was no
doubt but he dyed in a very good condition,
for that he had been assisted by their Fathers,
in his last sickness. Father, said I, pray tell
me how he came into this good condition? if
after he had scandalized all the world by his
Debaucheries, infamous Avarice and Impieties,
he edified the Church by some marks of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
what penance did he? hath he at
least restored the vast summes whereof he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
his Monastery and the poor? For you know
without doubt that he enjoyed above twenty
years two Benefices whereof he never gave
Almes. And that to gain the greater Revenue,
he let almost all his Monks die without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any: He spent no more in repairs than
in Alms, so that all the Regular plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of his
Monastery are run to ruine; particularly there
is neither Dormitory, Infirmiry, nor Refecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
lastly, not satisfied with all the money he
heaped up by such extraordinary niggardliness,
he hath cut down the best part of the Woods
of his Monastery, and converted them to his use.

The Good Father assured me, the Fathers
took no cognizance of all this; that his Estate
passed to Monsieur his Brother, a person of
Credit, and prime man of a City. I was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and cryed out, Father, What Conduct,
what <hi>Aveings</hi> are here? what, did they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to this Abbot, that a man of Religion
cannot amass Money, without amassing for
himself a treasure of wrath against the last day?
Did they not tell him, the fire must devour th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir
souls, who have been so unhappy as to hide
the Gold and Silver which they had to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for relieving the necessities of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ? Did they not threaten him with
the dreadfull Judgements of God, who hath
no compassion for Robbers and Sacrilegious
persons, who dye in their sins.</p>
            <p>Father, I know they had leisure enough to
declare to him what he was obliged to do, for
that he was above six months sick, and your
Fathers visited him during all that time: If it
be true, that they did not forget to oblige him
to make restitution of his Rapines, that he
might thereby at least satisfie one part of his
sins, but that he notwithstanding continued
obdurate. How could your Fathers give ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to a sinner, who had given no signs of
repentance, but persisted wilfully in his Crimes,
in keeping to the last vast summs of money in
his hands, to which he had no right? St. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:65277:221"/>
hath taught us, with what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>everity they are to
be judged, who divert and retain for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
any part of things consecrate to God.
This Crime was punished by sudden death in
the person of <hi>Ananias;</hi> and it was the Prince
of the Apostles who pronounced that terrible
Judgement: If your Fathers have given any
hope of salvation to a person more criminal
than <hi>Ananias,</hi> what was it but to abuse the
power of Christ, in declaring that a living soul
which was really dead? I confess, Father, that
what opinion soever I conceived of your specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Morality, I see now you surpass it in your
practical. They who write books, and expose
their though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to the eyes of the world, have
commonly some Reserves, and dare not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their wicked opinions barefaced and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
but clothe them with some specious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
of truth; which conceals at least
from the eyes of the people some part of their
lyes. But I perceive by this instance you trouble
not your selves to disguise your detestable Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims;
that you easily dispense with the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
Laws, and will do any thing to
please men: By the ancient custom of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
every Fryar with whom they found
money after his death, was held unworthy of
Christian Buriall, and his body exposed to be
devoured by Birds and by Beasts: But you, my
Fathers, you have fine subtleties and devices
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65277:222"/>
to save all the world, especially those who have
money: The vast summes found with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of St. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> prevailed not with you to
think him unworthy absolution; and though
he dyed without giving any thing to the poor,
which is a sensible mark of his Reprobation,
you were not afraid to interre his miserable
Reliques in your Church, and adorn him with
publick Monuments of piety.</p>
            <p>I begg your pardon, Father, for the liberty
I take to tell you my thoughts: I shall add one
thing more, which doubtless all persons of a
mean understanding, that shall here speak of
this story, will presently inferr: The world
does you the right to take you for persons of
prudence and wisdome, and wanting no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
or dexterity when your interest is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
This well-grounded perswasion will
naturally incline them to believe, that when
you give absolution to sinners, who have done
nothing to merit it, you are well paid for it, as
a thing of your gift, which you owe not in
justice: And that you take to your selves at
least a great part of the Estates of those wicked
rich men, to whom you promise Paradice,
without regard to Gods Word, who excludes
them from thence who never repent. And
certainly <hi>M.</hi> the Abbot of St. <hi>Sulpice</hi> made ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the goodness you exprest
towards him, if he gave you not part of those
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65277:222"/>
Rapines he could not carry with him to the
other world, and were no longer of any use to
him: 'Twere well then, Father, that men
knew your behaviour in this affair: They may
possibly finde some reasons to excuse you, and
justifie the memory of your penitent. 'Tis
possible, he hath made some restitution which
turned to your advantage, and was applyed to
your use, and may advance his salvation as
much as if it had been made to them to whom
of right it belonged: In a word, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there may be reason sufficient to preferr you
before a Rabble of poor Folks and Monks, that
are of no use to the World, who had right to
the Money he bestowed on you.</p>
            <p>This Father being none of the ablest, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sufficiently perplexed at this discourse, but
at last being obliged to say something in Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Company, he assured me this
Abbot had given them nothing, and that for
the Enterrement and Epitaph, whereof they
took care, they had received only Sixty <hi>Lonyses,</hi>
which was little more than what it had cost
them: All this was so simply related by the
poor Father, that certainly he knew no more,
so that I said no more to him, but that I bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them very much for doing so wicked a
work at so cheap a rate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:65277:223"/>
From <hi>Lyons</hi> we went to St. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> where
I was an Eye-witness of the disorder wherein
this wretched Abbot le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the Monastery, both
in its spiritual and temporal Concerns, and
understood he committed enormities which
sufficiently demonstrated he had neither Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
nor Religion: A Fryar he was, but
seldom or never wore the habit of his Order:
A Priest he was but never said Mass, unless
when he was obliged to receive some Nunnes
to profession in the Houses, that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pended of
him, over whom he had Jurisdiction in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Vicar Generall of the Order in <hi>Savoy</hi>
and <hi>Presse,</hi> but before he went from their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he chaffer'd what they were to give him,
and was so punctual and exact in making
them pay, that one of the Nunnes being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to make up the summe they had agreed
upon, he put off his Priestly Ornaments, and
deferred the Mass and Ceremony to another
time: Not to stay any longer in giving you a
Catalogue of all his Disorders, it may be said
in a word, that he wanted nothing to make
him a compleatly wicked man. I was told
upon the place, he had carryed to <hi>Lyons</hi> part
of the most precious things in his possession,
having left almost all the rest in a Castle call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Machura:</hi> That in his sickness his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had sent Horsemen thither, who by
force took away all from the House; and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65277:223"/>
came after to the Abby to do the like, but
that the resistance the Fryars made obliged
them to return without their Errand.</p>
            <p>The report of the Countrey is, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
his Brother is seized of amounts to
above a hundred thousand Livres, which may
be easily believed, for what cannot that man
amass who enjoyed two such fat Benefices,
and was at no charge? He had scarce any
Fryars, and those few he had he gave not any
thing to; no servants, no retinue, yet had he
industry and care sufficient to Revell good
cheap, and pay little for the most scandalous
Debaucheries.</p>
            <p>From St. <hi>Sulpice</hi> we went by the <hi>Grand
Chartreuse</hi> to <hi>Grenoble.</hi> But two dayes agoe
Monsieur <hi>De M.</hi> went to the Brother and heir
of the Abbot, to demand Justice, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to him, that it was not allowable for him
to possess himself of, and retain by force an
Estate that belonged to other men: But we
had no satisfaction from this great Magistrate,
he exprest no repentance for the Robbery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but hath formed his Conscience so in
this matter, that 'twill be no easie thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to let goe such a prey: He told us
in few words, but gravely, that he had done
nothing but what had been approved by twenty
good Casuists, whereof above half were very
able <hi>Iesuites:</hi> And that is <hi>Decisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:65277:224"/>
Before I conclude my Letter, I will propose
a question wherein I should be very glad to
receive your advice. It cannot be unknown,
what the conduct of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> hath been in
regard of this Abbot; to what degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendence
they are fallen, and how apt they
are to flatter sinners in the desires of their
hearts: But the difficulty is to finde out that
which hath particularly obliged them to this
behaviour, on the present occasion. Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these complay sans Directors have got
such a habit of loose complying with all the
wills of their Penitents, that it is not in their
power to contradict them, and are as it were
forced in spite of themselves to do yet more
than their Maxims permit: Is it because they
observe no rule in their practice, but to do
what they list? Do they believe in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
that sinners they guide in this manner,
or rather permit to walk in the broad way
to destruction, may be saved? and that men
need not any more seek the narrow Path?
Have they not had greater regard to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Living, than the Salvation of
the Dead Brother? And since they have been
capable of approving the unjust Usurpation he
made of the Estate left by his Brother, is it
not probable they are capable of demanding
his favour to serve their turn on very ill Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts?
When we meet at <hi>Paris,</hi> we may
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65277:224"/>
discourse of this Affair more at large, and
then if you be not satisfied with my word,
I shall produce you unquestionable witnesses.
<hi>M.</hi> the present Abbot of St. <hi>Sulpice</hi> is fully
informed of all I have told you: <hi>M.</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
will confirm the same, and also his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom the <hi>RR. FF.</hi> cannot suspect of
partiality against them, for that he is their
particular Friend.</p>
