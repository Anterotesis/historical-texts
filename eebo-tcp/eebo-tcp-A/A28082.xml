            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>16. <hi>Henry the 4th of France</hi> his <hi>Queen</hi>
was young with Child; <hi>Count Soisons,</hi>
that had his expectation upon the <hi>Crown,</hi>
when it was twice or thrice thought that
the <hi>Queen</hi> was with Child before, said to

called the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soisons</hi> to him, and
said; laying his hand upon the <hi>Queens</hi>
Belly; <hi>Come Cousin, is this a Pillow?
The Count of Soisons</hi> answered; <hi>Yes Sir,

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42605:7"/>17. <hi>King Henry the</hi> 4th of <hi>France,</hi> was
so punctual of his word, after it was once
passed, that they called him, <hi>The King of
the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. The said <hi>King Henry</hi> the 4th was
moved by his <hi>Parliament</hi> to War against
the <hi>Protestants:</hi> He answered; <hi>Yes, I
mean it: I will make every one of you
Captains; you shall have Companies assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you.</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> observing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
his Speech tended, gave over and
deserted his motion.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was wont to say,
upon the <hi>Commission</hi> of <hi>Sales;</hi> That the
<hi>Commissioners</hi> used her like <hi>Strawberry-Wives</hi>
that layed two or three great
<hi>Strawberries</hi> at the mouth of their pot,
and all the rest were little ones; so they
made her two or three good prises of the
first particulars, but fell straight ways.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> used to say of her
Instructions, to great <hi>Officers; That they
were like to Garments, streight at the first
putting on, but did by and by wear loose
enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. A great <hi>Officer</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi> when my
Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> was first in trouble; and
that he, and those that dealt for him,
would talk much of my <hi>Lords Friends;</hi>
and of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> answered to one of

them; <hi>I will tell you, I know but one
Friend, and one Enemy my Lord hath;
and that one Friend is the Queen, and
that one Enemy is himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. The <hi>Book of Deposing King Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
the Second, and the coming in of
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, supposed to be written by
<hi>Doctor Hayward,</hi> who was committed to
the <hi>Tower</hi> for it, had much incensed
<hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> and she asked Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
being then of her <hi>Counsel learned,</hi>
whether there were any <hi>Treason</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it? who intending to do him a
pleasure, and to take of the <hi>Queens</hi> bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with a merry concelt, answered; <hi>No
Madam, for Treason, I cannot deliver Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that there was any, but very much
Felony:</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> apprehending it
gladly, asked, <hi>How? And wherein? Mr.</hi>
Bacon <hi>answered; Because he had stolen
many of his Sentences and Conceits out of</hi>
Cornelius Tacitus.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> being to resolve
upon a great <hi>Officer,</hi> and being by some,
that canvased for others, put in some
doubt of that person, whom she meant to
advance, called for Mr. <hi>Bacon;</hi> And told
him, <hi>she was like one, with a Lanthorn,
seeking a man;</hi> and seemed unsatisfied
in the choice she had of a man for that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42605:8"/>
place. Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> answered her, that he
had heard that in old time, there was
usually painted in the <hi>Church Walls,</hi> the
<hi>Day of Doom,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> sitting in <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>Saint Michael</hi> by him, with a

<hi>Good Deeds</hi> in the one <hi>Ballance,</hi> and the
<hi>Faults,</hi> and the <hi>Evil Deeds</hi> in the other;
and the <hi>Souls Ballance</hi> went up far too
light: Then was our <hi>Lady</hi> painted with
a great pair of <hi>Bends;</hi> who cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the light <hi>Ballance,</hi> and brought down
the <hi>Skale:</hi> So he said; <hi>Place and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which were in her Majesties hands to
give, were like our Ladies Beads, which
though men, through any Imperfections,
were too light before, yet when they were
cast in, made weight competent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was dilatory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in suits, of her own Nature; and
the <hi>Lord Treasurer Burleigh</hi> being a Wife
Man, and willing therein to feed her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
would say to her; <hi>Madam, you do

him; <hi>My Lord, what a little House have

House is well, but it is you that have made
me too great for my House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. There was a Conference in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
betweeen the <hi>Lords House,</hi> and the
<hi>House of Commons,</hi> about a <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countants,</hi>
which came down from the
<hi>Lords</hi> to the <hi>Commons;</hi> which <hi>Bill</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>That the Lands of Accountants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they were seized, when they entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Office, might be liable to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears
to the Queen.</hi> But the <hi>Commons</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the <hi>Bill</hi> might not look back to
the <hi>Accountants</hi> that were already, but
extend only to <hi>Accountants</hi> heareafter.
But the <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> said; <hi>why, I pray
yru, if you had lost your Purse by the way,
would you look forwards, or would you look
back? The Queen hath lost her Purse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. The <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
was asked his Opinion by my <hi>Lord of
Leicester,</hi> concerning two persons whom
the <hi>Queen</hi> seemed to think well of: <hi>By
my Troth my Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>the one is a
grave Counsellor; The other is a Proper
young Man; and so he will be as long as
he lives.</hi>

            <p>28. My <hi>Lord of Leicester,</hi> Favourite to

day was casting up his charge what it
would come to. Mr. <hi>Goldingham,</hi> a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken

            <p>29. The <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>

            <p>30. My <hi>Lord of Essex,</hi> at the <hi>Succour</hi>
of <hi>Rboane,</hi> made 24 Knights, which at
that time was a great number. Divers of
those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> were of weak and small
Means; which when <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>
heard, she said; <hi>My Lord might have
done well to have built his Alms-house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made his Knights.</hi>

            <p>31. The <hi>Deputies</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>

and some other of the <hi>Counsel</hi> for a Peace.
Both sides were agreed upon the <hi>Articles.</hi>
The question was, upon the <hi>security</hi> for

            </p>
            <p>32. There was a <hi>French Gentleman,</hi>

The <hi>English</hi> answered, <hi>I'le tell you</hi> Sir,

the Answerer gave for his Question, <hi>That
Aristocracy was better than Monarchy.</hi> The

wherein they are practised; and added,

            <p>163. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> that was <hi>Pope Pius

That was, of most of the <hi>Opinions of

            <p>165. It was said amongst some of the

had not been confirmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> yet
was worthy to be received for the <hi>Honestly</hi>

            <p>167. Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> would say; that it

his younger Son was at <hi>Rome,</hi> who

So when <hi>Vespasian</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi>

            <p>171. <hi>Nero</hi> loved a beautiful <hi>Youth,</hi> whom

There was a <hi>Senator of Rome,</hi> that said

            </p>
            <p>172. <hi>Galba</hi> succeeded <hi>Nero,</hi> and his
Age being despised, there was much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
and Confusion in <hi>Rome,</hi> during his

            </p>
            <p>173. <hi>Augustus Casar</hi> did write to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
who was over-sensible of some ill

            </p>
            <p>174. <hi>Chilon</hi> said, that <hi>Kings Friends,</hi>

That sometimes stood for one,

<hi>Thus,</hi> (saith the <hi>Wise man) let that King
