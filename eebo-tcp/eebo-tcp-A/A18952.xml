            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sincerely from my heart, I had suffered the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

there is a faire occasion, I should bee debarred
from regaining my lost honour, and reputation,
in his Maiesties Warres abroad. May it please
your Honours, when I saw all my fellow offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and other Delinquents whatsoeuer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
and sent vpon imployment, I enuied
not their happinesse, but seriously began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how I (who alone was denied that fairest
way of all) might doe my Country some seruice,
euen whilst I continued here, an vnfortunate,
<pb facs="tcp:25812:5"/>
and wretched prisoner. Thus sadly musing (fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
my Conscience burthened,) I resolued to
write this reall <hi>Recantation</hi> of all my euill wayes;
whereby I haue not only disarmed, and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my selfe, from falling into the same lewd
course of life, at any time hereafter; but also so
fully and faithfully instructed all honest Trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that no man that will bee pleased to follow
my aduise, can from hence forth, (that way)
miscarry. Sithence therefore I haue yeelded so
faire a testimonie, both of my contrition, and
conuersion; I most humbly beseech your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to entertaine a fauourable, and good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of me, and (moued thence vnto commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
that you would vouchsafe to grant a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for my discharge, that I may not spend my
youthfull dayes in this miserable and wretched
prison, but may on, vpon my Prince, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
seruice; where I am resolued to acquite my
selfe, by some braue, and notable exploite, or a
worthy death; and whilst I liue, I shall at all
times rest accountable for my libertie, and the

            <p>THe liueliest and best Monuments of men
are their actions, and in those, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
either die before them in infamy,
or suruiue them vnto the farthest extent of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie
in the fullest and fairest Registers of time,
and glorie; both of these retaine their subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
not in the brazen leaues of Sepulchres, nor
in the tongue-failing relation of succession, but in
those Paper Records, which seldome forfeite
them to losse, although assaulted by neuer so
many alterations, as the Stories from the first
World, as well prophane, as diuine, may
wonderfully witnesse to all Obseruers, This
truth may question my discretion, that haue
made mine owne hand the Character of such
actions as Posteritie will blush at, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
might easily haue lost the thoughts of men
in lesse then halfe an age. If thus I had not giuen
<pb facs="tcp:25812:10"/>
it continuance as lasting as the World; It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in respect of my selfe the answere is difficult,
but in respect of God, the World, and mine
owne conscience, I could contriue no fairer or
more reall satisfaction. The sinnes of the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
children of God haue had their like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
<hi>Dauid's</hi> Murther and Adulterie must
haue <hi>Dauid's</hi> written Confession and Contrition,
<hi>Salomons</hi> Lasciuiousnesse must haue his owne
acknowledgement and recantation, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
he that is ashamed to confesse the ills hee
hath beene conscious of, argues too palpably
that he is a great many leagues from repentance,
and is more in loue with his sinne, then his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.
Belieue in Charitie, this is my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that mine owne free detection of this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and common vice, might not only kill the
feare of my impossible relapses, but be a iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrer
of all the worshippers of this course. Nor
can I feare, that such Idolatry of theirs can rise
in Iudgement against this truth of mine, which
hath so honestly condemned them, and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
or that their reuenges, which they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
proclaymed against the innocence of my
Recantation, can reach farther then the counsels
of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> Whose effect extended to selfe
ruine, whilst I shall be happie, to be either censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:25812:10"/>
or forgotten by them; for whose amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I owe my Prayers, and will Religiously
inuoke; that they may, either become new
men like me, or else, that they may know my
resolution hath built me beyond the aspersion
of their poysons Nor can I feare the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
of this worke of mine, they that loue
truth, and reconciliation of wild youth (to
that perfection the first Creation intended)
will loue my expression, more then my
Verse; and hugge my intended innocence,
more then they can in goodnesse condemne
my detected Offences; The rest, that are
Gald, or preuented by this Discouerie must
not dare to Iudge, because all indifferencie is
denied them. Nor can they whose hatreds
against my Person, or Actions, haue drawne,
into a resolued opposing, of my fairest cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
clayme any Language in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

Recantation.</head>
            <l>☞ <hi>STand and deliuer</hi> to your obseruation,</l>
            <l>Right serious thoughts, that you by my relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</l>
            <l>May benefit, for otherwise in vaine</l>
            <l>I write, you reade, vnlesse from hence you gaine</l>
            <l>The happinesse I meane you; blest is he</l>
            <l>That will make vse of others ieopardie.</l>
            <l>Be warn'd by me, so may you purchace hence</l>
            <l>At a cheape rate my deare experience.</l>
            <l>You must not looke from me to haue the straine</l>
            <l>Of your <hi>Black-friers</hi> Poets, or the vaine.</l>
            <l>Of those high flying men, whose rare Muse brings</l>
            <l>Forth births, that Gossipt are by Lords and Kings.</l>
            <l>For though I oft haue seene <hi>Gadd's-hill,</hi> and those</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Red</hi> tops of Mountaines, where good people lose,</l>
            <l>Their ill kept purses, I did neuer climbe</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pernassus</hi> Hill, or could aduenture time,</l>
            <l>To tread the Muses Mazes, or their floore</l>
            <l>Because I knew that they are lightly poore,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:25812:13"/>
And <hi>Shooters</hi> Hill was fitter farre for me,</l>
            <l>Where pas'd releifes for my owne pouertie.</l>
            <l>I neuer rode on <hi>Pegasus</hi> (for then</l>
            <l>I had fled farther then pursuite of men)</l>
            <l>If therefore you expect a loftie straine,</l>
            <l>You wrong your selues, and me, your thoughts are vaine.</l>
            <l>Perchance my Verse may amble, trot, or flie</l>
            <l>As if my frights presented <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Crie</hi>

            <l>My theame is Truth, my selfe the subiect plaine.</l>
            <l>I cannot play the <hi>Satire;</hi> my disguise</l>
            <l>Fairely pluck't off, I am nor grim, nor wise,</l>
            <l>Nor curst enough to scourge, no Beadle I</l>
            <l>To punish you with petilasherie:</l>
            <l>I meane to paint my selfe, and not to be</l>
            <l>The Chronicler of others infamie.</l>
            <l>I will not ayme at Motes within your eyes,</l>
            <l>For I confesse in mine a beame their lies;</l>
            <l>Which I plucke out, and deale as punctually</l>
            <l>As if I spake against mine enemie.</l>
            <l>Let this inuite you then, these newest wayes</l>
            <l>Of selfe inuectiue writing. Now adayes</l>
            <l>Each one commends himselfe, and others blame</l>
            <l>Of faults, when he is guiltie of the same,</l>
            <l>Yea and of worser too, and seeming wise</l>
            <l>As folly will the daintest Wits despise.</l>
            <l>Such has beene my conceite, for I was prone</l>
            <l>To blame each action, which was not mine owne,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:25812:13"/>
Belieuing what I did was good, maintaining</l>
            <l>That my vngodly and worst way of gaining</l>
            <l>Was more legitimate, and farre more fit</l>
            <l>Then borrowing, and thus I argu'd it.</l>
            <l>Who, in the way of loane, takes from his friend</l>
            <l>Whom he findes kinde, and ready for to lend,</l>
            <l>The maine of his estate, with an intent</l>
            <l>(Premeditated basely) fraudulent:</l>
            <l>Betrayes a trust, and in performance slacke,</l>
            <l>Breakes both his word, his owne, and his friends backe,</l>
            <l>Who findes no remedy; but who hath lost</l>
            <l>His purse, repayd is at the Countries cost,</l>
            <l>Besides the theefe sayes not he will repay,</l>
            <l>Nor is't expected from him, and yet they</l>
            <l>That borrow, will a thousand oaths let fly,</l>
            <l>And wish they may be damn'd eternally</l>
            <l>If that they faile, and thus the purse they fill,</l>
            <l>Make light their oaths, and load their soules with ill.</l>
            <l>But hence capitulation, hee's not free</l>
            <l>From ill, that would by ill excused bee.</l>
            <l>Such Sophistrie as this, and such beleefe</l>
            <l>The Prince of darknesse <hi>Satan,</hi> that old theefe</l>
            <l>Did prompt me to; he first perswades to sin,</l>
            <l>Then firmely that we may continue in</l>
            <l>The foule transgressions we commit: he tells</l>
            <l>What faire excuse we may alledge; which quells</l>
            <l>Our good intentions to desist: he saies</l>
            <l>Vnto the quarreller it is a praise</l>

For to affront the meeke, and a great glorie</l>
            <l>To boast thereof, and to repeat the storie.</l>
            <l>The enuious, and the sullen minded man</l>
            <l>That aimes at bloud, and ruine all he can,</l>
            <l>He cherishes, and sayes it is but meet,</l>
            <l>Bids him persist, and that reuenge is sweet.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Satan</hi> pleads, thus he deludes vs all,</l>
            <l>And then at last he glories in our fall.</l>
            <l>☞But horrid <hi>Sire</hi> of Hell, I doe descry,</l>
            <l>And finde thou art the Father of each lie,</l>
            <l>That a delinquent has for his excuse,</l>
            <l>And therein doth consist thy maine abuse</l>
            <l>Vnto mankinde, immediatly next that</l>
            <l>Temptation which made <hi>Eue</hi> to perpetrate;</l>
            <l>For since that damned act of thine, 'tis true</l>
            <l>We sinne by nature, but are borne anew</l>
            <l>Through <hi>Christ,</hi> which blest regeneration</l>
            <l>Has notwithstanding no relation</l>
            <l>To those accursed, that doe want the grace,</l>
            <l>For to appeale thereto: or haue the face</l>
            <l>To iustifie themselues, and with a lie</l>
            <l>As 'twere confront the sacred deity.</l>
            <l>Had <hi>Adam</hi> too, not from his iust God fled,</l>
            <l>Had he confess'd, as otherwaies he did</l>
            <l>Denie what he had done, and had he cried</l>
            <l>For mercy, when himselfe he iustified,</l>
            <l>I doe beleeue the vengeance for his sin</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:25812:14"/>
Thus I debated with my selfe when I</l>
            <l>Was first attach'd, and kept so priuately</l>
            <l>That none must visite me, and euen then</l>
            <l>Not being allowed to haue aduice of men,</l>
            <l>To thee my gracious God I did appeale,</l>
            <l>To thee (who knew'st before) I did reueale,</l>
            <l>Confesse, acknowledge, and bewaile my sinnes,</l>
            <l>Assertained that whosoeuer winnes</l>
            <l>Mercy and fauour from thee, must repent,</l>
            <l>That onely causes thee for to relent</l>
            <l>And stay thy wrath, I said within my heart,</l>
            <l>All idle wandring thoughts first set apart,</l>
            <l>O God most mercifull thou knowest all,</l>
            <l>What is, what was, and what hereafter shall,</l>
            <l>If thy foreseeing knowledge doth descry,</l>
            <l>That if I liue, I will liue wickedly,</l>
            <l>And licking vp the vomit of my sinne,</l>
            <l>The same or a worse way of ill begin</l>
            <l>Now let thy thundring hand my curs'd dayes end,</l>
            <l>But if my euill daies I shall amend,</l>
            <l>And by a true conuersion yeeld thee praise</l>
            <l>And glory, then, O then in mercy raise</l>
            <l>Me from the snares of death, direct me to</l>
            <l>Both what I am to speake, and what to doe.</l>
            <l>Thus I besought my God; what comfort then</l>
            <l>And ease came to my minde, neither my pen</l>
            <l>Can write, nor you imagine, for that blisse</l>

But whilst this contemplation did transport</l>
            <l>My rauish'd minde, behold another sort</l>
            <l>O thoughts assault me, that the Deuill might</l>

            <l>Then <hi>Satan</hi> that had tempted, next comes in,</l>
            <l>And though he fashion'd, yet reueal'd my sinne.</l>
            <l>So that I conscious, all amazed stood</l>
            <l>Betwixt so much of ill, so much of good.</l>
            <l>And as my comforts reached at the Crowne,</l>
            <l>Frozen despaire assayes to plucke me downe.</l>
            <l>At length my sinnes (me thoughts) like clouds did fly,</l>

And to particularize all my offences,</l>

            <l>To satisfie sterne Iustice in each point,</l>
            <l>Vnscruing my disguises ioynt, by ioynt.</l>
            <l>Not caring though this freenesse might depriue</l>
            <l>My being here, and take me from the liue</l>
            <l>To mingle with the dead, if but from hence</l>
            <l>My forfeit life might pay for mine offence,</l>

            <l>That very eas'ly might haue rescu'de beene.</l>
            <l>☞ Now thus much for preuention, here you see</l>
            <l>From point to point, a plaine discouerie,</l>
            <l>Of the theeues policie, I shew'd you how</l>
            <l>You may auoyde it, let me tell you now</l>
            <l>What you haue next to doe, If you espie</l>
            <l>(As you may guesse by my discouerie)</l>
            <l>That there are theeues amongst you, doe not gaze</l>
            <l>On this, and tother side, nor in a maze</l>
            <l>Affrighted stand, as if your only hope</l>
            <l>Were some to rescue you, that will prouoke</l>
            <l>And not dishearten them, then minde it not,</l>
            <l>But be as though all feare you had forgot,</l>
            <l>And looke as bigge as they, and if they proffer</l>
            <l>Be sure to draw, as soon's they make their offer</l>
            <l>Remember then the cause you haue in hand,</l>
            <l>Your reputation, and your money stand</l>

At gage in this, and if you dare not fight,</l>
            <l>It grieues me much to doe you thus much right.</l>
            <l>They, (if they find you resolute and stout)</l>
            <l>Dare euen as wellbe hang'd, as fight it out,</l>
            <l>Not out of cowardize, but that they know</l>
            <l>To their discomforts, that in fighting so</l>
            <l>They striue against a Countrey, Iustice, Law,</l>
            <l>Right, equity, and these keepes them in awe.</l>
            <l>They studie most, how they may bugbeares seeme,</l>
            <l>And who are rob'd, but those that doe esteeme</l>
            <l>Their threats, vnlesse you yeeld without delay,</l>
            <l>We shoot you thorow, they perhaps may say;</l>
            <l>But who thus threatned, yet resisting still</l>
            <l>Can say vnto me that he fared ill.</l>
            <l>Some though are somewhat resolutely bent,</l>
            <l>Tis true, yet is it farre from their intent</l>
            <l>To shed your blood, for they in doing so,</l>
            <l>Should worke their owne immediate ouerthrow,</l>
            <l>They could not then subsist, for though they passe,</l>
            <l>Sought after slightly for the monies losse,</l>
            <l>Should they take life and all, they could not ride</l>
            <l>To any place where they might safely bide,</l>
            <l>But through continuall search they would be found,</l>
            <l>And then pay dearly for each bloody wound.</l>
            <l>This the euent would be, which they well know,</l>
            <l>Rather then hurt you, they will let you goe,</l>
            <l>And stay a while vntill they meet with some</l>
            <l>Which their faire words, or threats will ouercome.</l>

Besides, the right is of your side, and though</l>
            <l>You are o're-match'd, God may enable you so</l>
            <l>Those Caytifes may be vanquish'd by your hand;</l>
            <l>Then what good seruice you shall doe your land,</l>
            <l>Your Prince, and Common-wealth, you may suppose,</l>
            <l>Euen in the act by apprehending those</l>

            <l>Not onely to be rob'd, but let them goe,</l>
            <l>And basely wish they may escape, that so</l>

            <l>One thing more I will tell you, which is true,</l>
            <l>You often double and misname the summe,</l>
            <l>You know the <hi>hundred</hi> willing is to come</l>
            <l>To composition with you, if they doe,</l>
            <l>You cousen both the theeues and Country too.</l>
            <l>And when you tell the story, then although</l>
            <l>You say they were fiue, six, or at least fower,</l>
            <l>You were rob'd fairely, and but two to two,</l>
            <l>And that you fought it out aboue an hower,</l>

            <l>To keepe opinion, falsly vndergone,</l>

            <l>Be what your Images, doe represent,</l>
            <l>Men nobly spirited, 'twas God's intent</l>
            <l>When he created you, not much vnlike</l>
            <l>His Image most diuine, that you should fight</l>
            <l>In a iust cause, because he is all iust,</l>
            <l>And herein failing you betray God's trust,</l>
            <l>Neglect your dutie, and doe animate</l>
            <l>Not curbe, the vild'ones, that doe perpetrate.</l>
            <l>☞ But now suppose through negligence you fall</l>
            <l>Into their clutches, and surpris'd with all</l>
            <l>You are vnthought of, 'tis no fault of mine</l>
            <l>You might haue taken better heed in time.</l>
            <l>Thus yet I will aduise you, if you see</l>

            <l>By searching of your selues, and freenesse too,</l>
            <l>Without a further re-examining goe.</l>
            <l>But if they make an offer, doe not you</l>

Then will they sift you soundly, doe not hold</l>

            <l>I haue obserued many times, when I</l>

            <l>To lead the Passenger aside the way,</l>
            <l>(Because I knew what danger 'twas to stay)</l>
            <l>Fast'ning my clutches on his arme, or thigh,</l>
            <l>With a sad looke, he would begin to cry</l>
            <l>He was vndone, if I tooke what was there,</l>
            <l>Thinking I felt (because my hand was neere)</l>
            <l>His greater summe, which I by that should find</l>
            <l>Hid in his sleeue, or in his shirt behind.</l>
            <l>But now then, if they find not such a summe</l>
            <l>As was expected, they will bid you come,</l>
            <l>Into some corner, then protest, and sweare,</l>
            <l>If patiently a while, you will sit there,</l>

            <l>Here's their maine plot, you are forewarn'd, But say</l>

            <l>And not to faile will there all night abide,</l>
            <l>This is the chiefest Maxime in their law,</l>
            <l>The Subt'lest surely that I euer saw,</l>
            <l>It stands by reason, for they know full well</l>

            <l>The Passages, or to describe the men</l>
            <l>They rest at pleasure, and are gone agen</l>

            </l>

            <l>Next day shall surely see them riding by.</l>

            <l>Whither they can betake them to be free:</l>
            <l>But by the way know thus much, if they light</l>
            <l>On a great summe, then will they ride that night</l>
            <l>Vnto their <hi>Rendeuous</hi> here in the City,</l>
            <l>Which is too sure a shelter, (more's the pitty,)</l>
            <l>But follow my aduise, and marke me well,</l>
            <l>For here a cunning plot of theirs I tell,</l>
            <l>If you are rob'd out in the Easterne quarter,</l>
            <l>When you with <hi>hue and cry</hi> the theeues make after,</l>
            <l>Ride not to <hi>London</hi> in the roade you were,</l>
            <l>Nor raise those parts, you will not finde them there,</l>
            <l>But hie to <hi>Westminster, Holborne,</hi> the <hi>Strand,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And for a speedy search there giue command,</l>
            <l>If Northward they light on you, straightwayes ride</l>
            <l>And search both <hi>Southwarke, Lambeth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Banckeside,</hi>
            </l>

            <l>His purse to theeues, then at the Countries cost</l>
            <l>There is a watch prepar'd to guard that place</l>
            <l>Where the poore man by them surprised was;</l>

            <l>It is impossible, that they should lose</l>
            <l>Their money being guarded thus; and hence</l>
            <l>They grow more carelesse, doubting none offence</l>

So I whose easie youth, with fond admire,</l>
            <l>Was drawne, at first this ill course to desire,</l>
            <l>Hug'd it in dreames, and in my waking fits</l>
            <l>Doted vpon't, to my worse losse of wits,</l>
            <l>Whil'st esteem'd none braue, or good, but this,</l>
            <l>But now I know how farre I was amisse.</l>
            <l>And surfeited, as 'twere to death indeed,</l>
            <l>From which by rare ingredients I am freed.</l>
            <l>I loath my stomacke-queller, and abhorre</l>
            <l>What I in too much louing sufferd for,</l>
            <l>Nor can profession free me from the doome</l>
            <l>Of cruel'st censure and opinion,</l>
            <l>These actuall ills of mine freely confess'd</l>
            <l>Must be in act recouer'd, or exprest</l>
            <l>My faire intentions cannot be, nor I</l>
            <l>Sau'd from the taxe of my first infamie.</l>
            <l>☞ O may my fate so well prouide as now</l>
            <l>That power which knowes, may helpe me in my vow,</l>
            <l>And crowne my resolutions with some way</l>
            <l>Which of the world, and heauen recouer may</l>
            <l>All my lost honour, by some acts of mine,</l>
            <l>That may proue farre more welcome to the time.</l>
            <l>Then my disastrous courses, and expresse</l>
            <l>I am much better then I dare professe.</l>
            <l>And that great king, whose mercy, goodnesse, grace,</l>
            <l>Hath fixt my tottering life in a firme place,</l>
            <l>Whose royall bounty do's I know expect</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:25812:40"/>
Which may a thankfull tribute pay to him,</l>
            <l>And speake the full redemption of my sinne.</l>
            <l>You, mightie Sir, to whom my life I owe</l>
            <l>As debt to that great grace you did bestowe,</l>
            <l>May now command it prostrate at your feet</l>
            <l>In any danger, (I shall haste to meet)</l>
            <l>That so by seruing in your enterprise,</l>
            <l>You may perceiue how true a sacrifice</l>
            <l>Ile make againe, of what you gaue so free,</l>
            <l>And that's the offering must accepted bee.</l>
            <l>I hope (great Sir) it is not your intent</l>
            <l>That I shall spend my dayes in Banishment,</l>
            <l>For happier farre is he condemn'd that dies,</l>
            <l>Then him you saue t'exile from your faire eies.</l>
            <l>For what auailes the blinded man to see,</l>
            <l>If that a dungeon must his prison bee?</l>
            <l>Where doubly curs'd to be debarr'd from light</l>
            <l>He dwells, that knew't not, whil'st he wanted sight,</l>
            <l>O let me liue, where euery day I may</l>
            <l>My most religious offrings truely pay;</l>
            <l>And that the life you gaue me, be not made</l>
            <l>A trouble to me, whil'st my thoughts inuade</l>
            <l>My discontented soule with torments strange;</l>
            <l>Not that I must my aire, and Country change,</l>
            <l>Or (bard inheriting thereby) forgoe</l>
            <l>The temporall fortunes I am borne vnto.</l>
            <l>But that the Shryne I worship should not see</l>
            <l>The constant sacrifice is made by mee.</l>

            <head>To the Kings most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
Iohn Clauell wisheth a long, and
prosperous reigne in this, and in the world to
come, a plenteous share of those peculiar
blessings, which God himselfe (out of his
wonderfull and abundant goodnes)
hath prouided and set apart (euen for
the choisest of his elect) which are
farre beyond the imagniation of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men to conceiue, much more
impossible to be expressed.</head>
            <l>IT grieues my soule, and wounds my troubled minde,</l>
            <l>That onely I alone must be confinde,</l>
            <l>When others are let loose, that they may gaine</l>
            <l>The honour they haue lost, whil'st my foule staine</l>
            <l>Blurres both my birth, and fortunes; had I dide,</l>
            <l>My ignominious death had satisfide;</l>
            <l>But to liue still, and still to liue in shame,</l>
            <l>(Within the summons of vpbraiding fame)</l>
            <l>Is a worse plague then euer Egypt had;</l>
            <l>It may be thought, I that haue beene so bad</l>
            <l>Cannot recant, but very likely may</l>
            <l>Fall to my old rebellion, on the way;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:25812:42"/>
First let this treaty plead; then here I call</l>
            <l>My God aboue to witnesse (who knowes all</l>
            <l>The secrets of my heart) I doe intend</l>
            <l>Whilst these your warres endure, euen there to spend</l>
            <l>My time, in that braue seruice; when that ends</l>

            <l>And a poore fortune of my owne, that can</l>
            <l>Fairely maintaine me, like an honest man;</l>
            <l>If so your Highnesse please, that I may haue</l>
            <l>My gratious pardon, (you so freely gaue)</l>
            <l>What is required of me, I cannot pay,</l>
            <l>If that the meanes wherewith be kept away;</l>
            <l>Confinde within these walls, is it your will</l>
            <l>That I a prisoner here, continue still?</l>
            <l>When I was past the cure, and helpe of men,</l>
            <l>You (that could onely) shielded me, iust then</l>
            <l>When death had taken leuell with his dart,</l>
            <l>Was it that I might feele this greater s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <l>O no; I neuer since haue beg'd that boone,</l>
            <l>But you (great Sir) haue granted it right soone,</l>
            <l>Yet notwithstanding your most royall pleasure,</l>
            <l>I am enforc'd to tarry others leasure,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> in this my hell I see,</l>
            <l>And know the grace you haue bestowd on me</l>
            <l>But may not touch it, and enioy much lesse,</l>
            <l>The more's my griefe, and my vnhappinesse,</l>
            <l>O free me from this lingring lethergie,</l>
