            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And as God hath so ordered this wonderful dependance of his Creatures on each other, so
<pb facs="tcp:110167:3"/>
hath he by a Law Immutable provided a Rule for Men in all their actions, obliging each other to the performance of that which is right not onely to Justice, <note n="†" place="margin">Leg. ut vim D. de just. &amp; jur. n. 7. &amp; 8.</note> but likewise to all other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues; the which is no more <hi>but the dictate of right Reason founded in the Soul of Man, shewing the necessity to be in some act by its convenience and disconvenience in the rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Man, and consequently that it is either forbidden or commanded by the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the Eternal Creator of all things:</hi> And as God hath imprinted this Universal Law in the minds of all Men, so hath he given Men power (Society being admitted) to establish other Lawes which proceeds from the will, the which is drawn from the Civil power, that is, from him or them that Rule the Commonwealth or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Freemen united for their common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, (which is called the <hi>Lawes of Nations)</hi> and which by the will of all or many Nations, hath received force to oblige, and is <note n="*" place="margin">Vasquez. 2.

            <p>And though the Eternal Power hath so Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished this necessity in Mankind, that every man should stand in need of another man, yet so great a Providence is over Industrious men, that scarce any man not disabled by Nature or Accident, Sickness, Impotenoy and the like, but by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and pains may earn more than would supply his necessities; and so much as any man gets by being truly Industrious above what sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes his necessities, is so much beneficial to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and Family, as also an enriching to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or State where he resides: from hence it is, that all Mankind (present or to come) are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Traders by themselves or others; and the ends designed by Trade and Commerce, are Strength, Wealth and Imployment for all sorts of people, (where the same doth most flourish) the end <note n="*" place="margin">Coke 2.

the ensuing Tract, especially when reflecting that among all Nations there is a Common Law which governs the mighty thing of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Commerce, I had some impulses more then ordinary to induce me to the same, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a time when Navigation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce were never (from the erection by Divine instinct that Mighty Proto-Type the Ark, to this present Age,) in greater esteem then now, and by which we have found vast and great easements and discharges from those Royal and Just Rights and Dues which ever were, and of Old justly due to those that Govern'd this Empire; Therefore ought by all wayes and means to be fortified and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, be it by whatsoever Art, Science or thing that does in the least point out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same. Nor was it then wanting in thoughts to promote and incite the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Law, raising and stirring up their Genius to the advancement of the Law in this point; and though I believe many have wish't that such a thing might be, yet none that I can find have ever yet attempted the same: nor is it possible, unless those things which are by Law <hi>constituted and known,</hi> be rightly separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from those that are <hi>natural;</hi> for natural Law is immutable and alwayes the same, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may easily be collected into Art.

               <p>And therefore, having taken a prise, and brought the same <hi>intra Praesidia,</hi> the Captor must exhibite all the Ship Papers, and captived Marriners to be examined in order to adjudication, till when, Bulck ought not to be broken without <hi>Commission,</hi> nor may the Captain of the Captor suffer an imbezlement of the lading, or sell Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">3.

II.

               <p n="4">IV. By the Laws of Nations (as hath been said) it is lawful for every Subject of that Nation in War, to seize upon the enemies Goods and Ships, as also to kill them; for they are after War denounc't by Law, lookt upon as of no account, and if respect be had to natural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal right, it seems granted to every one in a just War, to do those things, which he is confident within the just measure of warring, be advantageous to the innocent party; but though there may be such authority given, yet what tittle can they claim or appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Ships or Goods of enemies (for surely there is nothing owing to such, nor are they lawfully call'd to the same:) unless they can shrowd themselves under the protection of what they do, is only to exact punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the enemy, by the Common right of Men.</p>

               <p n="6">VI. Special Commissions, be such as are granted to those that take pay, and are under Orders; the not obeying of which may be punished with death, though <note place="margin">Leg. Deserto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. D. de rei milit.</note> the act succeeds well.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That this hath been an <hi>Antient Custom,</hi> alwaies wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that Soveraignty, appears by that memorable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord upwards of 400 years since made, where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by King <hi>John</hi> what the <hi>Antient Custom</hi> was, in these words; <hi>That if a Lievtenant in any Uoyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus this <hi>Immemorial Custom</hi> was by that prudent Prince affirmed, the which hath been alwaies before, and

ever since, (without interruption by all Nations) constantly pay'd to the <hi>Ships of War,</hi> bearing the <hi>Royall Standard</hi> and other of his Majesties <hi>Ships,</hi> wearing his <hi>Colours</hi> and <hi>Ensigns of Service;</hi> he knowing that undoubted <hi>Maxim of State,</hi> that <hi>Kingdoms are preserved by reputation, which is as well their strongest support in Peace, as their chiefest safety in time of War, when once they grow dispised, they are either subject to forreign invasions, or domestique troubles,</hi> the which (if possible) that Prince would have prevented, but he lived when those Celestial Bodies which govern the action of <hi>Princes</hi> seem to frown on the most Virtuous and Wise.</p>

               <p>In the Year 1653, after the <hi>Dutch</hi> had measured the length of their Swords with those of this Nation, and being sensible of the odds, and having by their four <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours</hi> most humbly besought Peace, this very Duty of the <hi>Flagg</hi> was demanded by the <hi>15th.

               </p>
               <p>This was so peremptorily demanded, that without the <hi>solemn acknowledging of the Soveraignty over the British Seas,</hi> there was no Peace to be had; that as to the <hi>acknowledging of the Soveraignty</hi> and the <hi>Flag,</hi> they were willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>the Antient Custom,</hi> but that of <hi>Visiting</hi> was somewhat hard: 'tis true the latter Clause was by the <hi>Usurper</hi> waved, <note place="margin">Le ab Atzma. fo. 847.</note> for reasons standing with his private interest; but the first was made absolute, by the 13 <hi>Article</hi> between <hi>Him</hi>

               <p>To the second, the <hi>Confederate</hi> hath a right to compel his confederate to stand to the League, and if he will not, to punish him; for that one may take satisfaction or revenge of him that hath offended; and this happens as well amongst those that have no confederation at all.</p>
               <p>To the third, as in Confederacies equal, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies are wont generally to be brought before an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> of the Confederates; that is to say, such as are <hi>not concerned</hi> in the question, or else before <hi>Arbitrators,</hi> or

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110167:58"/>
                  <hi>Peace,</hi> as that of a hundred years.

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Treaties of Truce</hi> are many times less subject to <hi>Rupture</hi> then a <hi>Peace,</hi> which is made <hi>perpetual;</hi> for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or States that find themselves aggrieved with a Treaty that is perpetual, seek out plausible reasons to forsake it, seeing the grievance cannot be otherwise repaired; but if the time be limited and expired, they may pursue that which they think <hi>ought to be granted,</hi> and the other may oppose; and if they have a desire to continue the <hi>Truce,</hi> there is nothing so easy as to renew it. Hence it is become a <hi>Maxim</hi> in State, that seeing Treaties are grounded on the <hi>Interests of Princes which change with the time, it is necessary to change and settle them at the end of the time, or to break them off:</hi> for it is in vain to trust to a bare Friendship.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Truce</hi> is likewise made to <hi>advance</hi> a Peace, and to treat it; so likewise it is sometimes promoted for the more honest discharge of a <hi>League,</hi> which is made with some other Prince, whom they have accustomed to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend therein: so as a Peace following it, or a Truce not being accepted by him, they take accasion to leave the League, <hi>it being not his fault</hi> that leaves it, that the War was not ended.</p>
               <p>And although it seems that a <hi>Truce</hi> cannot by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition prejudice the <hi>pretention</hi> in the <hi>Principal;</hi> yet it is most certain that if he which is chased out of a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious State, consents, that during the <hi>Truce, the Commerce shall be forbidden to his Subjects, he doth wholly stop the gate,</hi>

               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Princes</hi> who neither love nor hate any thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, seem generally inclined to <hi>neutrality,</hi> and in that govern themselves in their Friendships, according to their interests; and <hi>Reasons of State,</hi> in effect is no other but <hi>Reason of Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neutrality</hi> may be of two sorts; the one with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with either part,</hi> the other <hi>without Alliance,</hi> or so much as the least tie to the one or other, which is that which properly may be called <hi>Neutrality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is governed by the <hi>Treaty of Neutrality,</hi> the latter by the <hi>Discretion of the Neuter Prince,</hi> whose car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ought alwaies to be such, as that he may not give the least glimpse of inclining more to one then to another.</p>
               <p n="7">VII: The advantages of Neutrality, are, that the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110167:59"/>
neuter Prince or Republique is honoured and respected of both Parties, and by the fear of his declaring against one of them he remains Arbitrator of others, &amp; Master of himself.</p>
               <p>And as a Neuter neither purchases Friends, nor <hi>frees himself from Enemies;</hi> so commonly he proves a prey to the Victor: hence it is held more advantage <hi>to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in a Conquest with a Companion, then to remain in a State wherein he is in all probability of being ruined by the one or the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Princes that are <hi>powerful,</hi> have used generally to preserve a <hi>Neutrality:</hi> for whilst Petty Princes and States ruin themselves by War, he fortifies himself with <hi>means;</hi> and in the end, may make himself Judge of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, it hath been conceived, that Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques that are weak, what part soever they take, it will be dangerous unto them, especially if they are in the midst of two more powerful States then themselves; but experience hath made it appear to the contrary, that <hi>Neutrality</hi> is more beneficial to a <hi>weak Prince or Reipublique;</hi> so that they that are at War be not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <note place="margin">Much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Free Princes and States of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </note> or inhumane; for although a Neutrality does not please either party, yet in effect wrongs no Man; and as he doth not serve, so he does not hurt; besides his declaration is reserved till the issue of the War, by which means he is not oblidged that by siding with eiher party, to gain or loose by the War.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But if the Neuter be prest by necessity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himself, he must do it <hi>for the most powerful</hi> of the two parties, following that <hi>Roman Maxime, That either they must make themselves the strongest, or be a friend to the strongest:</hi> So they of <hi>Strasburgh</hi>

However, when he was at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> where the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops and <hi>Praetor</hi> were, they thought they had him sure, by propounding this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it lawfull to pay Tribute to Caesar?</hi> which was as much as to say, We, who are descended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are the peculiar People, to whom God hath given the large Priviledges of the Earth at home, to bath our selves in Rivers of Milk and Honey, to have full Barns and many Children; yea, that GOD himself will be adored in no other place of the World but at this our <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and that abroad we should triumph over the <hi>Barbarous</hi> and uncircumcised World by virtue of that <hi>Militia;</hi> which he never ordered for any but our selves, how are we then in duty or conscience to submit now to the Ordinances of the <hi>Uncircumcised Romans?</hi> or what right can he have to exercise supream Jurisdiction over us, the priviledged <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> by levying of

taxes on our Estates and Lands, which GOD himself laid out for us, by which means the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> hold this very Temple in slavery, and insult over our very Consciences and Religion, by defiling our very Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with the mixture of impure Blood; which as they are the price of our Blood, and a Tribute far above <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> (payable in no other place but this Temple, which GOD himself built) so our Blood ought not to seem too dear to be sacrificed for the liberty of these; and though the <hi>Roman State</hi> could pretend, yet what can this <hi>Caesar</hi> pretend? every Man's Conscience knows that it was but the other day he usurpt over the <hi>Senate,</hi> in which resides the true Jurisdiction of <hi>Rome;</hi> and if that were otherwise, yet how can he pretend to a Title, unless poyson be a pedigree or violent usurpation, a just Election, by which he who is but the greatest Thief in the World, would now pass for the most Soveraign and Legislative Prince? How then are we in conscience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged to pay Tribute to this <hi>Caesar?</hi> Though those Lawyers thought in their Consciences that they were not to pay it, and that <hi>Our Saviour</hi> likewise, as <hi>Jew,</hi> thought so too; yet they supposed he durst not say so much in the crowde; nor yet deny it by shifting it off with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, left the <hi>Roman</hi> Officers should apprehend him: But when <hi>Our Saviour</hi> shewed them <hi>Caesar's</hi> Face upon the Coyn, and bad them <hi>Render to Caesar that which was Caesar's, and to GOD that which was GOD's:</hi> His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer ran quite otherwise, not as some would have it, that by a subtility he answered not to the point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, for then the sense of the whole Text would sound very ill in such tearms, <hi>viz.</hi> If there be any thing due to <hi>Caesar,</hi> pay him it, and if any thing is due from you to GOD, then pay it likewise.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. AN Excellent <hi>Generall</hi> is an evidence of the Fortune of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and the Instrument that occasions the happiness of a Kingdom; and therefore when GOD makes choise of a Person to repair the disorders of the World, or the good of a particular State, then is his care shewed in the furnishing him with necessary Principalls to undertake great matters; the thoughts are put in his Soul by that eternall Commander to execute, he troubles and confounds his Enemies, and leads him as by the hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

II. Hence it is that Souldiers and Mariners draw their lines, either of love even to the mouth of Canons with a good Generall, or mutiny and hate to the main yard end against one that is bad, for to obey them who are not their Soveraigns when they do them hurt, when they insult and are cruell in cold blood, and base, cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, or treacherous in Bataill, is a sad necessity for them, and a hard essay of patience; yet must they be obeyed, and the Souldiers and Mariners must not rebell or repine, but submit till the Soveraign redresses the misfortunes.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Again, <hi>Princes</hi> ought not to listen too much to the mutinous demands of the <hi>Crew,</hi> or any others, whose ambition watches their ruin, whereby to conceive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against this <hi>Commanders;</hi> for it is easier to purge out the choler and discontent that is got under the hatches, then to provide <hi>Commanders of Conduct,</hi> Courage and Faithfulness to govern their Expeditions. <hi>Bellisarius,</hi> that most excellent Commander, who had no other crime then his <hi>Reputation,</hi> and was not culpable, but that he was powerfull, having conquered <hi>Persia,</hi> subdued <hi>Africa,</hi> humbled the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> lead Kings in Triumph, and made appear to <hi>Constantinople</hi> somewhat of <hi>Old Rome,</hi> an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Antient Spendor of that proud <hi>Reipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique;</hi>

               <p>Nor was this cruel and hasty reckoning of <hi>Justinian</hi> let slip, without a cruel payment, for <hi>Narces,</hi> who was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110167:75"/>
as well a Successor in merit as in Authority to <hi>Bellisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who having notice of a disdain, conceived likewise against him upon a single complaint resolved not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself as a Sacrifice to their malice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better to shake off the yoak then stay to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, soon spoiled the affairs of <hi>Justinian,</hi> for the <hi>Goths</hi> revolted, and Fortune would not forbear to be of the party, which <hi>Narces</hi> Follow'd, nor to find the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> where so Brave a Captain was engaged. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not one or many faults are to be listened to against Commanders, but patiently heard and redressed, but not to disgrace or loose them; for such having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a fault, yet being admonished by love, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by future Services to make recompence by some Noble Exploit; but disgraced, become Instruments often of danger and ruin to their Superiors.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Souldiers and Mariners faults are either proper to themselves, or common with others.</p>
               <p>Those are common with others, which other Men fall into, and are corrected with like ordinary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as other crimes of like nature, as Man-slaughter, Theft, Adultery, and such like.</p>
               <p>Those are proper, which do properly appertain to the <hi>Naval Military</hi> part, and are punished by some unusuall or extraordinary punishment: As are these, not to appear at the over musters or calling over the Ship, to serve under him, he ought not to serve, to vage or wander long from a Ship-board, although he return of his own accord, to forsake his Fleet, Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, Ship, Captain, Commander, or Officer, to leave his standing to fly over to the Enemy, to betray the Fleet, Squadron or Ship, to be disobedient to superior Affairs, to loose or sell his Arms, or steal another Man's, <note place="margin">De Castrensi pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culio, &amp; C. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. l. 12.

V. The punishment wherewith Souldiers and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are corrected, are those corporall punishments, or a pecuniary mulct or injunction of some service to be done, or a motion or removing out of their Places, and sending away with shame.</p>
               <p>By Capital punishment, is understood for the most part death, or at least beating with <hi>Cat with nine tayls,</hi> as they commonly term it, <hi>Ducking, Wooden-horse, Gauntlet,</hi> and such like, unless happily it be pardoned, either for the unskilfulness of the Mariner or Souldier, or the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the <hi>Crew</hi> or Company, being thereto drawn by Wine, Wantonness, or for the commiseration or pitty of the Wife and Children, of the party offending; all which is left to the discretion of the <hi>Lord Admiral</hi> and others the Supream Commanders, or Captains.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is necessary that in Armies and Fleets all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of impiety should be prohibited, especially that of Swearing and Cursing; for such are sins so foolish, that they unawares help Men into damnation, rendering Men worse then beasts; by how much the more they court that vanity of sin without any of the appendant allurements; which other vitious actions are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with; the same in the end teaching Men to disavow GOD in their Discourse and actions, by their intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and inconsiderate invoking him in their Oaths: Against such, as also against those that shall give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">13 Car. 2. cap. 9.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110167:76"/>
but from this, that by the same Law every thing is <note place="margin">Ad Leg.

               <p n="8">VIII. Again, it is not lawfull for any, be he friend or neuter, to relieve an Enemy, much less for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <note place="margin">Bartol.

as in the first Chaos, spades ought even to be put into the hands of those who were heretofore adorned with Scepters, all outward tokens of honour and esteem, which even from the first institution of Society seemed by an uninterrupted stream to be continued down to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, (even amongst the most barbarous Nations) was by them totally deny'd; the Hand, the Hat, the Knee (being no other but outward signs of an inward respect) being esteemed equal with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but that unhappy brood, to whom whatsoever was crooked seemed streight, and what was dark to them appears light, are now not to be accounted Men, with whom the question may admit of a debate whether <hi>Salutation</hi> is innocent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and praise-worthy, since nothing of reason can be found in the foundation of their Religion, Honesty or Conscience.—Therefore this Discourse is directed to Men:</p>
               <p n="2">II. First, it is evident by what hath been said, that the <hi>British Seas</hi> before the <hi>Roman Conquest,</hi> ever belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Isle of Great Britain,</hi> they alwaies claiming and enjoying the sole Dominion and Soveraignty of the same, which afterwards accrued to the <hi>Romans</hi> by Conquest, and from them translated with its <hi>Empire</hi> to the succeeding <hi>Saxon, Danish</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Successors, and in all the Reigns of those Princes there was alwaies some markes of Soveraignty pay'd, wherein the right of the same was evinc't and acknowledged.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Now, his Majesty holds not this <hi>Salutation</hi> or Respect, by virtue of the League or of the Article, but as the same is a Right inherent to the <hi>Empire of Great Britain;</hi> and therefore in the first part of the Article it is declared in these words:</p>
               <p>—<hi>That the aforesaid</hi> States General <hi>of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed Provinees, in due acknowledoment on their part of the King of</hi> Great Britain'<hi>s RIGHT, to have his Flagg respected in the Seas hereafter mentioned, shall and do declare, and agree</hi>—</p>
               <p>Now this Right extends and subjects all Nations whatsoever that shall pass through those Seas, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those places meeting with any of his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Ships of War, bearing his Flagg, Jack, or Cognizance of Service, to strike their Top-sail, and take in their Flagg, in acknowledgement of His <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Soveraignty in those Seas, and if any shall refuse to do it, oroffer to resist, they may be compelled <hi>vis manu &amp; forti,</hi> for his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Honour is by no means to receive the least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minition.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If therefore any of his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Subjects should be so negligent or forgetful to pay that obeissance, when it may be done without losse of the Voyage, they are to be seized on, and brought to the Flagg, to answer the contempt, or else the <hi>Commander</hi> may remit the Name of the Ship, <hi>Commander</hi> or <hi>Master,</hi> as also the place from whence, and the Port to which she shall be bound to the Admiral; however before she is dismist, she must pay the charge of the shot, that her negligence or forgetfulness occasioned, and afterwards may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for the same, and severely punished.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. In His Majesty's Seas, none of his Ships of War

are to strike to any, and that in no other part no Ship of His Majesty is to strike her Flagg or Top-sail to any Forraigner, unless such forraign Ship shall have first struck, or at the same time have strike her Flagg or Top-sail to his Majesty's Ships.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But if any of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Ships of War shall enter into the Harbour of any Forraign Prince or Sate, or into the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="8">VIII. A Captain of a Ship of the second rate, being neither Admirall, Vice-Admiral, nor Reer-Admiral, at his first coming and saluting his Admiral or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief, is to give 11 Pieces, his Vice-Admiral nine, and his Reer-Admiral seven, and the other proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably less by two, according to their Rancks; but the Commander or Captain of a Ship is not to salute his Admiral or Commander in chief, after he hath done it once, except he hath been absent from the Flagg two <note place="margin">Artic. 38.</note> Months.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. When a Ship of the second rate, shall carry any Ambassador, Duke, or Nobleman, at his coming aboard, he is to give eleven Pieces, and at his landing fifteen; and when he shall carry a Knight, Lady or Gentleman of Quality, at their coming aboard he is to give seven, and at the landing eleven; and the other Ships are to give
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:110167:90"/>
less by two, according to their Rancks and number of Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="10">X. When an Admiral of any forraign Nation is met with, he is to be answered with the like number by all the Ships he shall salute, if a Vice-Admiral, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral is to answer him with twelve less; but the Vice-Admiral and Reer-Admiral, and as many of the rest as he shall salute, shall give him the like number: if a Reer-Admiral, then the Admiral and Vice-Admiral, to answer him with two less; but if he shall salute the Reer-Admiral or any other, they are to answer him in the like number.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. When a Man of War or Merchant-Man of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Nation, or of our own, salute any of the King's Ships, he is to be answer'd by two less.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. When any of the Captains of his Majesty's Ships shall have occasion to salute any of the King's Castles, he is to give two Guns less then they are directed to give upon saluting their Admiral or Commander in chief, as aforesaid: But this extends only in time of Peace, for if War is begun, no Guns ought to be fired in Salutes, unless to the Ships or Castles of some forraign Prince or State in Amity.</p>

XVII. On the other hand, as War introduces the greatest of evills, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking away of Mens lives, and that which is equivalent to life; so right Reason and Equity tells us that, it ought not to be undertaken without the greatest cause, which is the keeping of our lives, and that without which our Lives cannot be kept; or if they should be kept, yet they would not be of any value to us, seeing there may be a life worse then death, even Captivity; wherefore as we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to go to Law for a little occasion, so we are not to go to War, but for the greatest: Now those things that are equivalent to a Mans life, are such whom <hi>Almighty God</hi> appointed the same equall punishment as well as to those of murderers, and such as were breakers into Houses, breakers of Marriage Fidelity, Publishers of false Religion, and those who rage in unnaturall lusts, and the like.</p>
               <p>However, before Mens Persons or Goods are to be invaded by War, one of these three conditions is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Necessity, according to the tacite contract in the first dividing of Goods, as hath been already observed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Debt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Mans ill merits, as when he doth great wrong or takes part with those who do it.</p>
               <p>Against which If any thing is committed, War may be commenc't, nor is the same repugnant to the Laws of Nature; that is whether the thing may be done not unjustly, which hath a necessary repugnance to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and social Nature; among the first principals of Nature, there is nothing repugnant unto War; on the other hand there is much in favour of it, for both the end of War, the conservation of Life and Members, and the keeping and acquiring of things usefull unto Life is most agreable to those principalls: And if need be to use force to that purpose is not disagreable, since every Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Ulpian. Leg. 1. Sect. vim. vi. D. de vi, &amp; vi arma.</note> thing hath by the gift of Nature strength to the end it may be able to help and defend it self; besides reason and the Nature of Society inhibits not all force, but that which is repugnant to Society, that is, which depriveth another of his right; for the end of Society
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:110167:92"/>
is, that every one may enjoy his own, this ought to be and would have been; though the Dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of possessions had not been introduced for life members and liberty, would yet be proper to every one; &amp; therefore without injury could not be invaded by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to make use of what is common, and spend as much as may suffice nature, would be the right of the occupant, which right, none could without injury take away. And this is proved by that Battle of <hi>Abraham</hi> with the four Kings, who took Arms without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from GOD, and yet was approved by him; therefore the Law of Nature was his warrant, whose Wisedom was no less emineut then his Sanctity, even by the report of <hi>Heathens, Berosus</hi> and <hi>Orpheus;</hi> nor is the same repugnant to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law or <hi>Gospell,</hi> as the same is most excellently proved by the <hi>Incomparable Grotius.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. IN the precedent Book having observed something of the Rights of Persons and of Things in a state of <hi>Nature,</hi> and how necessarily they came at first to be appropriated, and how equitably they are now continued in the possession of those to whom they are consigned by the <hi>donation</hi> of others, and maintained or destroyed by the equity of those various Lawes which rules and governs them, all which is justified by the Scripture it self; It may not now seem improper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the <hi>private causes</hi> changing the same, and of the contingencies and advantages that wait on that which we properly call Commerce.</p>
               <p>The Great Creator no sooner had finished his Mighty Work, and given Man that Dominion which he now enjoyes as well over the Fish in the Seas, as the Beasts in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:110167:94"/>
the Field, he was not forgetful of bestowing on him those things which were necessary for the government and support of the same, creating at the same time Trees which grow as it were spontaneously into Vessels and Canoes, which wanted nothing but launching forth to render them useful for his accommodation, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he by his divine Genius (inspired by that Mighty One) finding Materials, hath since so Compleated and Equipt as to render it the most beautiful and stupendious Creature (not improperly so called) that the whole World can produce, which being not retarded by lett of Winds, or other contingent Accidents, submits it self to plow the unknown paths of that vast Element, to brave all Encounters of Waves and Rocks, to fathom and survey the vast emensities of the very World it self, to People, Cultivate and Civilize uninhabited and Barbarous Regions, and to proclaim to the Universe the Wonders of the <hi>Architect,</hi> the Skill of the <hi>Pilot,</hi> and above all, the Benefits of <hi>Commerce,</hi> so that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this day to find Nations contending who should surpass each other in the Art of Navigation, and to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize if possible the very Commerce and Trade of the World into their hands; and that, all by the means of this most Excellent Fabrick.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence it is, that Ships and Vessels of that kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Aretin. post Joan. Faber. in §. item exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor. num. 3. Instit. de oblig. quae ex quasi delict.</note> originally invented for use and profit, not for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight, to plow the Seas, not to lye by the walls, to supply those of the Mountains as well as those on the Sea Coasts.</p>
               <p>Therefore upon any probable design the major part of the Owners may even <hi>against the consent</hi> though not without the <hi>privity</hi> and knowledge of the rest, Freight out their Vessel to Sea.</p>
               <p>If it should so fall out that the major part <hi>protest</hi> against the Voyage, and but one left that is for the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, yet the same may be effected by that party, especially if there be <hi>equality</hi> in Partnership.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Owners by Law can no wayes be obliged to <note place="margin">Leg. Fin. C. §. pro Socio &amp; poss. inst. &amp; D. cod.</note> continue their paction or partnership without sundering; but yet if they will sunder, the <hi>Law Maritime</hi> requires some considerations to be performed before they can so do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:110167:94"/>
And therefore if the Ship be newly built and never <note place="margin">Leg. in hoc parg. si conveniat pro Sco.</note> yet made a Voyage, or is newly bought, she ought to be subject to one Voyage upon the common outread and hazard, before any of the Owners shall be heard to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and discharge their parts.</p>
               <p>If it falls out that one is so obstinate that his consent <note place="margin">Bart. &amp; Paul. in leg. hec distinctio §. cum fundum. ff. locat.</note> cannot be had, yet the Law will enforce him either to hold, or to sell his proportion; but if he will set no price, the rest may outrigg her at their own costs and charges, and whatsoever Freight she earns, he is not to have any share or benefit in the same. But if such Vessel happens <note place="margin">Such Vessels when Freight ed our against the grain of some of the Part-Owners, the same is under such Provisoes, Cautions and Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the Law in that case requires.</note> to miscarry or be cast away, the rest must answer him his part or proportion in the Vessel.</p>
               <p>But if it should fall out that the major part of the <note place="margin">Gloss. Leg. si navis &amp; juris in leg. utiq. para. culpae dè rei undic. &amp; leg. arboribus. §. navis de usu fruct.</note> Owners refuse to set out the Vessel to Sea, there by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the unequality they may not be compelled, but then such Vessel is to be valued and sold; The like where part of the Owners become deficient or unable to set her forth to Sea.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Master of the Vessel is elegable by the part-Owners not by the majority, yet he that is most able is <note place="margin">Leg. non aliter F. de usu &amp; habi.</note> to be preferred; The wisdome of the later Ages have been such, that few have gone out in that condition, but those as have commonly had shares or parts in the same Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. In the preferring therefore of a Master, his Ability and Honesty is to be considered, since on him rests the charge not onely of the Vessel, but of the Lading; their very Actions subiecting the Owners <note n="†" place="margin">Co. 4.

I. A Master of a Ship is no more then one who for his knowledg in <hi>Navigation,</hi> fidelity &amp; discretion, hath the Government of the Ship committed to his care and management, and by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> by which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">Leg. 1. de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.

                  </note> looks upon him as an <hi>Officer,</hi> who must render and give an account for the whole charge when once committed to his care and custody, and upon failer to render satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and therefore if misfortunes happens, if they be either through negligence, wilfulness, or ignorance of himself or his Mariners, he must be responsible.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If the fault be commited in any Port, Haven, River or Creek, or any other place which is <hi>infra Corpus Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus,</hi> the Common Law shall have Jurisdiction to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the party damnified and not the Admiralty, <note n="*" place="margin">Dowda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And therefore so soon as Merchandises and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are put aboard the Ship, whether she be riding in Port, Haven, or any other part of the Seas, he that is <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer Navis</hi> is chargeable therewith; and if the same be <note place="margin">F.

               <p>If fine goods or the like are put into a close Lighter and to be conveyed from the Ship to the Key, it is usual there the Master sends a Competent number of his Marriners to look to the Merchandize, if then any of the goods are lost or imbezled, the Master is responsible <note n="*" place="margin">Pasch. 26 Car. <hi>rul'd at</hi> Guild-Hall <hi>before L.

               <p n="11">XI. After his arrival at Port, he ought to see that the Ship be well moared and anchored, and after reladed not to depart or set Sail till he hath been cleared; for if any damage happens by reason of any fault or negligence in <note place="margin">18 Eliz. cap. 9. 14 Car. 2. cap. 11.</note> him or his Marriners, whereby the Merchant or the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding receives any damage, he must answer the same.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And as the Law ascribes these things and many more to him as faults, when committed by him or his Marriners, in Ports, so there are other things which the Law looks upon to be as faults in him in his Voyage, when done.</p>
               <p>As if he deviates in his course without just cause, or steers a dangerous and unusual way, when he may have a <note place="margin">Digest. l. cum in debito ff. de Probat.</note> more secure passage: Though to avoid illegal impositions, he may somewhat change his course; nor may he sail by places infested with Pyrates, Enemies, or other places no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously known to be unsafe, nor engage his Vessel among

               <p n="13">XIII. By the maritime Law, he that will charge a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster with a fault as in relation to his Duty, must not think that a generall charge is sufficient in Law, but he ought to assigne and specifie the very fault wherewith he is so charged.</p>
               <p>So, he that will infer, that such or such a sad disaster to have happned or been occasioned by reason of some fault in the Marriners, must not only prove the fault it self, but must also prove that that fault did dispose to such a sad event, or that such a misfortune could not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened without such a fault precedent.</p>

               <p>By the Common Law the Master of a Ship could not impawn the Ship or Goods for no property either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or special, nor such power is given unto him by the constituting of him a Master.</p>
               <p>Yet the Common Law hath held the Law of <hi>Oleron</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:110167:99"/>
reasonable, That if a Ship be at Sea and takes leake, or otherwise want Victual or other Necessaries, whereby either her self be in danger or the Voyage defeated, that in such case of necessity the Master may impawn for Money or other things to relieve such Extremities by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the money to that end; and therefore he being the person trusted with the Ship and Voyage, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reasonably be thought to have that power given to <note place="margin">Leg. Oleron. Cap. 22. Bridgeman's <hi>Case,</hi> Hobart, fo. 10, 11.</note> him implicitly, rather then to see the whole lost.</p>
               <p>But a Master for any debt of his own cannot impawn or Hipothycate the Ship, &amp;c. for the same is no wayes lyable but in cases of neccssity for the relief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the Voyage.</p>
               <p>Nor can he sell or dispose of the same without an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Licence from the Owners; and when he does Impawn or Hipothycate the Vessel or Furniture, he <note n="*" place="margin">Leg.

               <p n="15">XV. And where the Ship is well engaged, she is for ever obliged, and the Owners are concluded thereby, till Redemption.</p>
               <p>But in regard Masters might not be tempted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Owners, or infetter them with such sort of Obligations, but where there is very apparent cause and necessity, They seldome suffer any to go Skipper or Master but he that has a share or part in her; so that if Moneys or provisions be taken up, he must bear his equal share and proportion with the rest.</p>
               <p>The Master cannot on every case of necessity impawn the Vessel or Furniture; for if she be Freighted, and he <note place="margin">Judgment Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Cap. 22.</note> and the Owners are to joyn in the laying in of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for the Voyage, and parhaps he wants money, (a great sign of necessity) yet can he not impawn the Vessel or Furniture, any other or further then for his own part or share in her, the which he may transfer and grant as a man may do an 8th or 5th part in Lands or Houses: But such obligation of the Vessel must be in forreign parts or places where the calamity or necessity is universal on the Vessell.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. If the Vessel happens afterwards to be wreckt

or cast away, and the Marriners by their great pains and care recover some of the ruines and lading, the Master in that case may pledge the same, the produce of which he may distribute amongst his distressed Marriners in order to the carrying them home to their own Countrey; But if the Marriners no wayes contributed to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, <note place="margin">Judgement, Oleron. Cap. 3.</note> then their reward is sunk and lost with the Vessel.</p>
               <p>But if there be any considerable part of the lading pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, he ought not to dismiss his Marriners, till advice from the Laders or Freighters; for otherwise perchance he may be made lyable.</p>
               <p>If Merchants Freight a Vessel at their own charges, and set her to Sea, and then happens afterwards to be Weather-bound, the Master may impawn either Ship or Lading at his pleasure, or at least such as he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently <note place="margin">Leg.

               <p>To assault the Master a shipboard, is a Crime that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <note place="margin">Leg. Oleron, Cap. 13.</note> the Marriner's hand to be cut off, unless he redeems at 5. <hi>Solz.</hi>

               <p n="7">VII.

And this being the Maritime Custome, is allowed by the Common Law as well as the Civil Law.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> have been very favourable to <hi>Marriners</hi> in order to the suing for wages, for at the Common Law they cannot joyn, but must sue all distinct and apart for their wages.</p>
               <p>Yet in the Admiralty they may all joyn, and the Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> will not grant a Prohibition <note place="margin">Not but they may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Resolutions of 8 Car. Cro. 3. Reports, which are not now taken to be Law.</note>: And so it was Rul'd, where one <hi>Jones</hi> a Master of a Ship was sentenc'd in the Admiralty for Wages at the Suit of Poor Marriners, a Prohibition being prayed upon a sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion that the Contract was made at Land, and not <hi>super altum mare:</hi> The Court denyed it, for that he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jones versus</hi> the Poor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners. <hi>Winch.</hi> Rep.</note> came too late, Sentence being given below against him: Yet if the Marriners had onely Libelled, and there had been no Sentence, and the Defendant had prayed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition as above, yet the Court would have denyed it. And this has been and is usually done.</p>
               <p>But the Court will be very well informed that the Libel is for Marriners wages; for some who work Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters work and such like labour aboard a Ship in a <note place="margin">

Law, and not elsewhere,) will libel under that cloake for Marriners wages. But the Court in that case will grant a Prohibition. And so it was done in the like case.</p>
               <p>But if a Ship rides at Anchor in the Sea, and the Master sends his Boat a shoare for Victuals or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for the Ship, and accordingly the <hi>Providore</hi> or the Slopp-seller does bring victuals and provisions aboard; in that case if the contract be made there, it <note place="margin">Latch fo. 11. Hill. 1 Car. in B. R. <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Case.</note> must be sued for in the Admiralty: but if the goods are by the Purser or Marriners contracted for at land, they must sue at Common Law.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. If Goods are so imbezled or so damnified that the Ships Crew must answer, the Owners and Master must deduct the same out of their Freight to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and the Master out of the wages of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for though Freight is the Mother of wages, so is it the very Father of Damage: For before the Marriner can claym his wages out of what the Ship hath earn'd, the Ship must be acquitted from the damage that the Merchant hath sustain'd, by the negligence or fault of the Marriners: And the reason is, for that as the Goods are obliged to answer the Freight, so the Freight and Ship is tacitly obliged to clear the damage; which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing done, the Marriners are then let in to their wages.</p>
               <p n="10">X. If a Marriner be hyred, and he deserts the Service before the Voyage ended; by the Law <hi>Maritime</hi> he loses <note place="margin">leg. oleron,</note> his wages: And the same Custome at Common Law pleaded, it hasbeen conceived will barr him.</p>
               <p>If a Marriner shall commit any wilful or negligent fault, by reason of which the Master, Owners, or the Ship answers damage to the Merchant, an Action lyes well against him.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. If a Marriner takes up moneys or Cloaths, and the same is entred in the Purser's Book; by the Custome <hi>Maritime</hi> it is a discount or a receipt of so much of their wages as the same amounts to: and in an Action brought by them for their wages, the same shall be allowed, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:110167:104"/>
is not accounted mutual, the one to bring his Action for the cloaths, and the other for his wages.</p>

               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Barratry</hi> of the <hi>Marriners</hi> is a Disease so Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical a shipboard, that it is very rare for a master, be his Industry never so great to prevent; a Span of Villany a shipboard soon spreads out to a Cloud, for no other cause but of that circular encouragement that one knavish Marriner gives to another.</p>
               <p>However the Law does in such cases impute <hi>offences</hi> and <hi>faults</hi> committed by them to be <hi>negligences</hi> in the <note place="margin">Justit. de ob. quae ex dilect. §.

               <p>The Reasons why they ought to be responsible, are, for that the Marriners are of his own choosing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">

               <p>If a time is appointed by the <hi>Charterparty,</hi> and either the Ship is not ready to take in, or the Merchant not ready to lade aboard, the parties are at liberty, and the party damnified hath his remedy against the other by Action, to recompence the detriment.</p>
               <p>If part of the Lading be a Shipboard, and it happens some misfortune may overtake the Merchant that he hath not his full Lading aboard at the time, the Master is at liberty to contract with another, and shall have Freight by way of damage for the time that those Goods were aboard after the time limited; for such agreements are of a <hi>Conditional nature precedent,</hi> a failer as to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Lading will determine the same, unless afterwards <hi>affirm'd by consent.</hi> And though it be no prudence for every Merchant or every Master to depart from the Contract if it should so fall out that the Agreement as to the Lading is not performed according to the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party</hi> or Agreement, (seldome ever done if any part be

               <p>And therefore by the <hi>Law Maritime,</hi> chance or some <note place="margin">Per Leg. si ex conducto &amp; leg. si item fundus &amp; leg. haec distinctio.</note> other notorious necessity will excuse the <hi>Master;</hi> but then he loseth his Freight till such time as he <hi>breaks ground:</hi> And till then he sustains the loss of the Ship.</p>
               <p>But if the fault be in the Merchant, he then must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">Per Leg. Oleron.

Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Navalium, Art. 29. eod.</note> happens afterwards, the Merchant must run the risque of that, and not the Master or Owners. But by the Common Law, so long as the master hath the Goods <note place="margin">Rich <hi>versus</hi> Kneeland, <hi>Cro.</hi> 2. part.</note> a shipboard he must see them forth-coming.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If Goods are fully laded aboard, and the Ship hath <hi>broke ground,</hi> the Merchant on consideration after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Ad Leg.

               </p>
               <p>But if the Merchant will not agree to the same, then <note place="margin">Digest. Paulus, l. 14. 2. §. 10.</note> the <hi>Freight</hi> becomes due for so <hi>much</hi> as the Ship hath <hi>earned:</hi> For otherwise the Master is lyable for all da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that shall happen. And therefore if that Ship to which the Goods were transladed perish, the Master shall answer; but if both the Ships perish, then is he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>

               <p>Generally the touching at several Ports by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, imports not a diversity, but a Voyage entire.</p>

Quid ergo Cod. locat.</note> is <hi>tacitly</hi> obliged for the Freight, the same being in point of payment preferred before any other Debts to which the Goods so laden are lyable, though such Debts as to time were <hi>precedent</hi> to the Freight; for the Goods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as it were <hi>bayled</hi> for the same: nor can they be <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached</hi> in the Masters hands (though vulgarly is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved otherwise.)</p>
               <p>Ships deserve <hi>wages</hi> like unto a Labourer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the eye of the Law the actions touching the same are generally construed favourably for the Ship and her Owners: And therefore if 4. part Owners of 5. shall make up their Accounts with the Freighters and <note place="margin">Hill. 26, 27 Car. 2. in <hi>B.

                  </note> receive their proportions, yet the fifth man may sue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly by himself without joyning with the rest; and this as well by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> as the <hi>Law Maritime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. A Ship in her Voyage happens to be taken by an Enemy, afterwards in Battle is retaken by another Ship in Amity, and restitution is made, and she proceeds on in her Voyage, the Contract is not determined; though the taking by the Enemy divested the property <note place="margin">7 R. 2. <hi>Statham</hi> Abridg. 54.</note> out of the Owners, yet by the Law of Warr that posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was defeazeable, and being recovered in Battel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, the Owners became re-invested: so the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <note place="margin">In Jurae Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminij leg. retor'. &amp; leg. in bello §. 1.</note> by fiction of Law became as if she never had been taken, and so the entire Freight becomes due.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. If Freight be taken for 100 Tuns of Wine, and 20 of them leak out, so that there is not above 8. inches from the Buge upwards, yet the Freight becomes due: One reason is, because from that gage the King <note place="margin">bovce <hi>versus</hi> Cole <hi>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:110167:110"/>
Freight, and the Merchant is discharged. But most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive otherwise, for if all had leaked out, (if there was no fault in the Master) there is no reason the Ship should lose her Freight; for the Freight arises from the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage taken, and if the leakage were occasioned through storm, the same perhaps may come into an Averidge; Besides, In <hi>Burdaux</hi> the Master stowes not the Goods, but the particular Officers appointed for that purpose, <hi>quod Nota.</hi> Perhaps a special convention may alter the case.</p>
               <p>Most certain, if a Ship Freighted by the great be cast <note place="margin">When such a misfortune happens, the Ensured com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly transfer those Goods over to the As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="14">XIV. If a Merchant takes Freight by contracting with a Marriner that is not a Master, he must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to sit down without any remedy against the Owners; but perhaps such a Marriner for such act may subject himself to an action.</p>
               <p>But if there be a fault committed by a Marriner which was hired or put in by the Master or Owners, there for <note place="margin">Co. 4. Inst. 146.</note> reparation the Owners become lyable.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The Master is not bound to answer Freight to the Owners for passengers if they are found to be unable <note place="margin">Johannes Loci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius lib. 3. Cap. 8.</note> to pay.</p>
               <p>If a Ship by <hi>Charterparty</hi> reciting to be of the Burden of 200 Tuns is taken to Freight for a sum certain, to be paid at her return; the sum certain is to be paid though the Ship amounts not to that Burden.</p>
               <p>If a Ship is Freighted after the rate of 20 l. for every moneth that she shall be out, to be paid after arrival at the <hi>Port of London;</hi> the Ship is cast away coming up from the <hi>Downs,</hi> but the Lading is all preserved; yet the Freight is become due: for the money arises due monthly by the Contract, and the place mentioned is onely to shew where payment is to be made, for the Ship deserves wages like a Marriner who serveth by the month; and though he dyes in the Voyage, yet his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:110167:110"/>
are to be answered <hi>pro rata:</hi> Besides, the Freight becomes due by intendment on the delivery or bringing up of the Commodities to the Port of <hi>London,</hi> and not of the Ship.</p>
               <p>If the Master enters into a <hi>Charterparty</hi> for himself and Owners, the Master in that case may release the Freigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without advising with the Owners; but if the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers let out to the Freighters such a Ship whereof <hi>J. S.</hi> is Master, though the Master Covenant in the same <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terparty</hi> and subscribes, yet his Release in that case will not bind the Owners, but the Owners release on the other hand will conclude the Master; And the reason is, for that the Master is not made a proper party to the Indenture. And so it was Rul'd, where an <hi>Indenture</hi> of <hi>Charterparty</hi> was made between <hi>Scudamore</hi> and other Owners of the good Ship called the <hi>B.</hi> whereof <hi>Robert Pitman</hi> was Master on the one party, and <hi>Vandenstene</hi> on the other party; In which Indenture the Plaintiff did Covenant with the said <hi>Vandenstene</hi> and <hi>Robert Pitman,</hi> and bound themselves to the Plaintiff and <hi>Robert Pitman</hi> for performance of Covenants in 600 l. and the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Indenture was,—<hi>In witness whereof</hi> the <note place="margin">

Inst. fo. 673.</note> said <hi>Robert Pitman</hi> put his hand and seal, and delivered the same; in an Action of Debt brought upon the Bond for performance of Covenants, the Defendant pleaded the Release of <hi>Pitman;</hi> whereupon the Plaintiff demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And it was adjudged, That the Release of <hi>Pitman</hi> did not barr the Plaintiff, because he was no party to the Indenture. And the diversity in that case was taken and agreed between an Indenture reciprocal between parties on the one side, and parties on the other side, as that was; for there no Bond, Covenant or Grant can be made to or with any that is not party to the Deed, but where the Deed indented is not reciprocal, but is without a <hi>Between, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Omnibus Christi fidelibus, &amp;c.</hi> there a Bond, Covenant or Grant may be made to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers several persons.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN matters of <hi>Wreck</hi> there is as it were a Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them which have lost their Goods by such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and them upon whose Lands the Goods and Merchandize are driven, that the same be restored to them, or those that claym under them. And therefore by the <hi>Civil Law</hi> it is precisely forbid, that no man <note place="margin">L. ne quid ff. de incendio ruina &amp; naufragio.</note> shall meddle with such Goods as are Wreck'd; and such as are proved to have stolne any thing thereout, are holden for Robbers; for that such Goods being cast on Land and recovered out of the Sea, remains still his <note place="margin">Leg. 44. <hi>D.</hi> de adq. ver. dom.</note> who was the owner thereof, and discend upon his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor; neither Escheat to the King, neither to any other to whom the King hath granted such Royal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:110167:111"/>
The reason why the Laws were so strictly declared by the <hi>Romans,</hi> was, for by the Lawes of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> if any Ship had become Wreck, though all the persons were saved and alive, yet the Ship and Goods became seizeable by the Lords: But the same being Barbarous, was afterward repealed and abrogated as well by those <hi>Emperours</hi> in their Territories, as here in <hi>England;</hi> the first by the Judgment of <hi>Oleron,</hi> which provided in such <note place="margin">Per le Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Oleron, Cap. 26, <hi>&amp;</hi> 47.</note> misfortune, That if the Merchant, Marriners or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or any of these escape and come safe to Land, the same was not to be accounted Wreck.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great sayes in this case, if any Ship at any time by any Shipwreck be driven unto the shoare, or touch at any land, <hi>Let the Owner</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Leg. 1. lib. 11. C. de Naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gijs.</note> 
                  <hi>have it, and let not my Exchequer meddle with it: for what right hath my Exchequer in another mans Calamity, so that it should hunt after gain in such a woful case as this is?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet if no Kindred appear within a year and a day, and appearing prove not the Goods shipwracked to be theirs, the Goods come to the <hi>Exchequer</hi> even by that Law: So much that Law condemns carelesness, which is written, <hi>vigilantibus &amp; non dormientibus.</hi> And with this agrees the Laws of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and the Lawes of this Land, as taken out of those Imperial Laws, in that Point, as is conceived.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Civil Law</hi> was ever so curious and careful of the preserving the Goods of such miserable persons, <note place="margin">Leg. 1. in pr. de incend. ruin. leg. in eum cum auth. seq. de surt.</note> that if any should steal such, they should pay four-fold to the Owner, if pursued within a year and a day; and as much to the <hi>Prince</hi> or his <hi>Admiral:</hi> So carefully were, and so exact in requiring restitution, that the very steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Leg. 3. in sin. de incend. ru. nauf.</note> of a Nayl or the worth thereof, obliged the Thief to the restitution of all the remaining Goods. And by the <hi>Emperour Antonius</hi> it was made a Law for such sort of men, that they should be batten'd and banish'd for 3. years; but that was onely for those of a high and <note place="margin">Leg. pedibus cod.</note> Honourable rank: but those that were base and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, should be scourged and sent to the Gallies, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Mines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:110167:112"/>
And the preventing of help to such shipwrackt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <note place="margin">Arg. leg. suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curlarij de Extrod. Crim.</note> was punisht with the same suffering as a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
               <p>The like for those that shall put forth any Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Lanthorn or Light, with intention to subject them to danger or shipwrack, was punish'd with death.</p>
               <p>And though no harm happens, yet he may be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <note place="margin">Per leg. incend. ruin. Naufrag. Leg. ne piscator.</note> hence it is that Fishers are forbidden to Fish with Lights in the Night, for fear of betraying of Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. <note place="margin">And here I cannot omit the Great and Pious Care that His Majestie hath had in his Directions about Light-Houses and Lanthorns, and other special Sea-Marks; but more especially in his Erecting at his own Princely Charge that most excellent Light-House near <hi>Goldston</hi> by <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> which both for Height, Curiosity and Form, not inferiour if not excelling all or most in Christendome.</note>
               </p>

               <p>Where a man, Dogg or Catt escapes alive out of the Ship, neither the Ship or other Vessel, nor any thing therein shall be adjudged <hi>Wreck,</hi> but the Goods shall be saved and kept by the <hi>Sheriff, Coroners,</hi> or the Kings Bayliffs, and delivered to the Inhabitants of the Town where the Goods are found; so that if any within a year and a day sue for those Goods, and after prove that they were his at the time of the shipwrack, they <note place="margin">Westm. 1. c. 4. § <hi>E.</hi> 1.

               <p n="7">VII. As the Common Law looks upon the Goods and Cargo as a pawn or pledge for the Freight, so the <note place="margin">Leg. 1. de Del mal. except. &amp; leg.

The reason that is given, for that otherwise a Skipper might of purpose set an old weak Ship against a strong Ship, and by that means hedge himself into a Contribution and recompence.

               <p>As to the second, It is no question but that the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors shall answer. But whether they shall bring in the first men for contribution, may be some doubt.</p>

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:110167:122"/>
It has been conceived by some, that they ought not, for they delivered their Salt to the Master <hi>tanquam in Creditum,</hi> and was not to expect the redelivery of the same specifical Salt: Besides, the Master must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity <note place="margin">D.

               <p>But by others it has been conceived they ought to contribute <hi>per ratione,</hi> for as Goods of necessity some must be stowed in the Hold, and that such Goods sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fail without a perill of the Sea; so the rest must of necessity contribute to that misfortune, and so make no distinction.</p>
               <p>The Bills of Lading are very useful to settle the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Assuror and assured, of which there are 3. parts, one sent over Sea; the other left with the Master; and the last remaining with the Lader.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The Office of Assurance was Erected by <hi>the Statute of</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz.

               </p>
               <p>The Judges or Commissioners appointed are the Judge of the Court of Admiralty, the Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> two Doctors of the Civil Law, two Common Lawyers, 8. grave and discreet Merchants, or to any 5. of them; and that they or the greatest part of the Commissioners have power to Hear, Examine, Order and Decree all such causes in a brief and summary way without formality of pleading.</p>
               <p>They have power to summon the parties, examine witnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

obedience to their Decrees; they are to meet once a week at the <hi>Assurance</hi> Office, or some other convenient publique place, and no Fees at all are to be exacted by any person whatsoever.</p>
               <p>There lyes an Appeal from their Sentence to the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper (but the party must deposite the moneys decreed, and then (though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be imprisoned he may be discharged) and then it lyes in the Lord <hi>Chancellors</hi> or <hi>Keepers</hi> Breast to affirm or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and to award the party assured double costs.</p>
               <p>No Commissioner being party Assuror can act by vertue of this Commission, nor untill he hath taken his Corporal Oath before the Major and Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, To proceed uprightly and indifferently between party and party.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. This was a good Act, had it been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully penn'd as was intended; for there were many things in which this Act did not extend to.</p>
               <p>First, Any man may at this day make a private Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy notwithstanding this Act, which is as good and effectual in Law to all intents and purposes, as one made and entred in the said Office; and that such a Pollicy might and may be now sued at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The number of Commissioners being so great that there could be no Court without 5. at the least; and without a Court they neither could summon parties or examine witnesses, and that was very difficult to get.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the parties or witnesses refused to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they had no power to punish the party for the delay, with costs or otherwise, which was very mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, No Commissioner could sit before he was sworn: Commissions and the Commissioners being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten renewed, it was a trouble to be attending a Court of Aldermen, which was difficult sometimes of the year to get.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Though they had power to commit the party who refused to obey their Decree, yet they had no power to make any Order against the Ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:110167:123"/>
Which matters being taken into consideration, it was <note place="margin">14 Car. 2. cap. 23.</note> Enacted, That 3. Commissioners, whereof a Doctor of the Civil Law, and a Barrister of 5. years standing to be one should make a Court, and to act as any 5. before might have done.</p>
               <p>They have likewise power now given them to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parties and witnesses, and upon contempt or delay in the witnesses upon the first summons and tender of reasonable charges: and in the parties upon the second summons to imprison offendors or give costs.</p>
               <p>Every Commissioner is now to take his Oath before the Lord Major to proceed uprightly in the execution of the said Commission; and any of them may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster an Oath so as the adverse party may have notice, to the end such person may be fairly examined.</p>
               <p>Commissions may issue out of the Court of Admiralty for examining of witnesses beyond Seas, or in remote places by directions of the Commissioners, and Decrees may be made against body and goods, and against Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and Administrators, and Execution accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and assess Costs of Suit as to them shall seem just.</p>
               <p>But Execution cannot be against Body and Goods for the same debt, but the party must make his Election as at the Common Law.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. But these Statutes took not away that Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance <note place="margin">Oyles <hi>versus</hi> Marshall, Styles <hi>Rep.</hi> 1654.</note> which the Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> claymed upon such Contracts by the Common Law; but onely gave this new erected Court a concurrent Jurisdiction with those at the Common Law: for though the loss happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Realm, yet they had Jurisdiction of the Cause. And therefore if an Action is brought upon a Pollicy of Assurance, though the loss happened at Sea, <note place="margin">

               <p>The Admiralty have likewise put in if not for an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Jurisdiction, yet at least a concurrent one; yet <note place="margin">38 H. 8. <hi>Crane</hi> and <hi>Beil, Co.</hi> 4. Inst. 138, 139.</note> both have been denyed them, notwithstanding that the Judge of the Admiralty is Judge of the Court of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. By the making of an Office Pollicy according to the Statute, these advantages will follow.</p>

1. If the Pollicy be lost, if the same be entred with the Register of the Office, the Entry is effectual to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the matter both at the Common Law, as well as in the same Court; but a private Pollicy lost is like a Deed burnt, unless that there be very strong evidence, as a Copy and the like, it will be of little value. So that then there will remain nothing but an Equitable relief in <hi>Chancery,</hi> for the satisfaction the party.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a man Freights out a Ship from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Cales,</hi> and assures here, he may write to his Correspondent to make an assurance there of the same; if the matter comes before Commissioners, they may examine the Ensured upon Oath, and determine therein according to Law and the Custome of Merchants: But at the Common Law the same cannot be, but relief must be had in that point according to Equity in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The same is a Court of Equity as well as a Court of Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may decree against 20 Assurors at one time, but at Law they must be sued distinctly; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compel the Defendants to put in Bayl.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They may proceed out of Term as well as in Term; and (if the matter will bear it) they may finish a Cause in a fortnights time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Judgments there given are generally upon mature deliberation, and by persons well skilled in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime affairs; and if their Sentence is thought to be unreasonable, the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper may on Appeal determine the same.</p>

               <p n="1">I. BY the Lawes of <hi>Oleron</hi> after that the Pylot hath brought the Ship to sure Harbour, he is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound or lyable; for then the Master is to see her bed and to her lying, and bear all the rest of her Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, charge and danger, except that of the act of God; So that before she comes to her place or bed, and while she is under the Pylot's charge, if she or her Goods perish, or be spoyled, the Pylot must make good the same.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the Lawes of <hi>Oleron,</hi> if his fault is apparantly gross that the Ships Crew sees an apparent Wreck, they <note place="margin">Leg. Oleron, Cap. 23.</note> may then lead him to the Hatches and strike off his head; But the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> allow no such hasty execution.</p>
               <p>By the Lawes of <hi>Denmark</hi> an ignorant Pylot is to pass thrice under the Ships Keel.</p>
               <p>The Master generally in the Charterparty covenants to find a Pylot, and the Merchant covenants to pay him his Pilotage.</p>

III. But if a Ship should miscarry coming up the River under the Charge of the Pylot, it has been a Question, Whether the Master should answer in case of the insufficiency of the Pylot; or whether the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant may have his remedy against both? It hath been conceived the Merchant hath his Election to charge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if the Master, then he must lick himself whole of the Pylot.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Wharfage</hi> is money paid for landing Wares at <note place="margin">27 H. 8. cap. 26. 22 Car. 2. cap. 11.</note> a Wharfe, or for shipping or taking in Goods into a Boat or Barge, they commonly keep Boats or Lighters of their own for the carrying out and bringing in of Goods, in which if a loss or detriment happens, they may in some cases be made lyable.</p>
               <p>An Action of the Case grounded on the Custome of the Realm was brought against the Defendant Master of a Wharfe, for not safe delivering of Goods, &amp;c. The Case appeared to be thus; The Master unladed a Bale of Silk into the Wharfingers Lighter, and sent part of his Marriners to convey it ashoare; it happened <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Randall</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <hi>Hilton</hi> and <hi>Butler.</hi> Pasch. 26 Car. in B. R.</note> that the Goods were stole: The Question was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wharfinger or the Master should answer? Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tryal at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> before my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hale,</hi> it was there Rul'd, That the Master was lyable, and not the Wharfinger; for till they are landed, the Master hath them under his power: but if goods are to be sent aboard, there if they miscarry in their passage, the Wharfinger must answer.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Primage</hi> and <hi>Petilodmanage</hi> is likewise due to the Master and Marriners for the use of his Cables and Ropes to discharge the Goods; and to the Marriners for loading and unloading of the Ship or Vessel, it is <note place="margin">32 H. 8. cap. 14.</note> commonly about twelve pence <hi>per</hi> Tun.</p>
               <p>If the Ropes break in hoysting of Goods out of the <note place="margin">Leg. Oleron. Cap. 10.</note> Ship into the Lighter or Boat, the Master must answer if the Goods be damnified or lost.</p>
               <p>But if the Roapes break at the Crane in taking them out of the Lighter, (although till they are landed, they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:110167:127"/>
are not out of the Masters custody) yet the Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger <note place="margin">Co. Entry, fo. 2.</note> shall answer.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Petty Averidge</hi> is another little small Duty which Merchants pay to the Master when they onely take Tunnage, over and above the Freight, the which is a small recompence or gratuity for the Masters care <note place="margin">Some conceive that the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Bills, is that which is the Averidge or Contribution for losses.</note> over the Lading; and in the Bills of Lading they are exprest after Freight, together with <hi>Primage</hi> and <hi>Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> accustomed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ships commonly term the Gratuity <hi>Hatt-Money,</hi> and our <hi>English</hi> Merchants pay it our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters over the Freight, it is sometimes more, sometimes less; two or three Pieces.</p>

               <p>The Hire is called <hi>Loadmanage,</hi> the which the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late receives of the Master for conducting the Ship up the River, or into the Port to her convenient Bed.</p>
               <p>If two Ships lye in a Harbour, and the Anchor of one is feared may occasion to damnifie the other, if after request and refusal (and there be probable cause, the other may take up the same, and let the same down at a further distance, and the same is opposed or hindred, if any damage happens they are to make full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so it is if they lay out an Anchor and neglect the <note place="margin">Per Leg. Oleron Cap. 15.</note> placing of a <hi>Buoy</hi> to the Anchor, and damage happen thereby, they are not onely subject to be punished in the Admiralty, but likewise to render satisfaction to the party damnified.</p>
               <p>If two Ships be in the River, and the one falls foul on the other both being laden, by the Law Maritime the Contribution is to be in Common, and to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:110167:127"/>
divided and apprized half by half; but then the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners</hi> must swear there was no fault in them: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Per Leg. Oleron. Cap. 14.</note> one that hath an old rotten Vessel which he can no wayes dispose of, may so order the matter as to lay her in the way of a good Ship under sayl, so that the same may be answered in damage: but when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution is made equal, then the contrivance will be avoided.</p>

II.

VI. <hi>Cambio sicco,</hi> or dry Exchange, is when a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant hath occasion for 500 l. for a certain time, and would willingly pay interest for the same; the Banker being desirous to take more than the Statute gives, and yet would avoid the same, offers the 500 l. by Exchange for <hi>Cales,</hi> whereunto the Merchant agrees; but the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant <note place="margin">This Usury was first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the <hi>Jewes</hi> here in <hi>England.

               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Cambio fictitio,</hi> when a Merchant hath occasion for Goods to Freight out his Ship, but cannot well spare money; The Owner, of the Goods tells him he must have ready money; the buyer knowing his drift it is agreed, that the seller shall take up the moneys by Exchange for <hi>Venice,</hi> or any other parts; but then the Merchant must pay for Exchange and re-exchange.</p>
               <p>So likewise where the Merchant is become indebted to the Banker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are contented to stay, the Merchant paying Exchange and re-exchange; the which he will most certainly compel him to do.</p>

               <p>If one receives 100 l. in <hi>London</hi> to pay 100 l. in <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> this by the <hi>Par.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a Merchant receives 100 l. in <hi>London</hi> to pay 100 l. at <hi>Paris,</hi> there the party is to examine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the <hi>English</hi> weight with the weight of <hi>France,</hi> the fineness of the <hi>English Sterling</hi> Standard with the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>French</hi> Standard; if that at <hi>Paris</hi> and that at <hi>London</hi> differ not in proportion, then the Exchange may run at one price, taking the denomination according to the valuation of the Moneys of each Countrey; but if they differ, the price accordingly rises or falls: and the same is easily known, by knowing and examining the real fineness of a <hi>French</hi> 5 s. piece, and an <hi>English</hi> 5 s. piece, and the difference which is to be allowed for the want of fineness or weight, which is the Exchange, and so proportionably for any, Sums or Moneys of any other Countrey; the which is called <hi>Par,</hi> or giving va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for value.</p>
               <p>But this Course of Exchange <note n="*" place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some are of opinion, that there can be no certain rate set on the <hi>Par</hi> in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, to answer justly the value of the Coyns of Forraign Parts, by reason of the diversity of them, and of their intrinsical values. <hi>Vide</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cottens</hi> Posthuma, <hi>fo.</hi> 306.</note> is of later years abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and now Moneys are made a meer Merchandize, and does over-rule Commodities, and Moneys rise and fall in price according to the plenty and scarcity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

Cap. 3.</note> and over, by which means the same hath obtained the force of a Law, and not the bare and single opinion of some half-fledg'd Merchants: For Bills of Exchange are things of great moment as to Commerce, and are neither to be strained so high, as that a man should not cast his eye on them but the same shall be taken to be an acceptance: nor on the other hand having duly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted them, the same should be rashly and unadvisedly avoided, by the shallow fancy of such nimble pated shufflers; but they are soberly judged and governed, as the same hath generally been approved of and adjudged of in former Ages.</p>

               <p n="17">XVII. A protest is no more but to subject the drawer to answer in case of non-acceptance or non-payment; nor does the same discharge the party Acceptor, if once accepted; for the Deliverer hath now two remedies, one against the Drawer, and the other against the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor.</p>
               <p>To entitle the party to an Action at Law in <hi>England</hi> against the Acceptor, it matters not whether there be a Protest; but to entitle the party to a recovery against the Drawer beyond the Seas or elsewhere, there must be a Protest before a Publique Notary.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. A Bill drawn on two joyntly must have a <note place="margin">Per Jasonem in lege allegantur ff. de conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus indebiti.</note> joynt acceptance, otherwise it must be protested, but to two or either of them, <hi>è cont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then if the same be accepted by one, it is pursuant to the tenour of the Bill, and ought not to be protested, but in case of non-payment; and in that case the person acceptor is lyable to an Action: but if it be on joynt Traders, an acceptance by one will conclude and bind the other.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. A Factor of the <hi>Hamborough, Turkey,</hi> or <hi>India</hi> Company drawes a Bill on the same, and a member ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the same, this perhaps may make him lyable, but not another member.</p>
               <p>So it is if 10 Merchants shall imploy a Factor at the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and the Factor drawes a Bill on them all, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:110167:133"/>
one of them accepts the Bill, and then refuses payment; this will not oblige the rest.</p>
               <p>But if there be 3. Joynt Traders for the common stock and benefit of all there, and their Factor drawes a <note place="margin">Mich. 19 Jao. C. B. <hi>Vanheath</hi> versus <hi>Turner,</hi> Winch. 24, 25.</note> Bill on them; the acceptance of the one will oblige the residue of the Company.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. A small matter amounts to an acceptance, so that there be right understanding between both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; As, <hi>Leave your Bill with me and I will accept it:</hi> Or, <hi>Call for it to morrow, and it shall be accepted;</hi> that does oblige as effectual by the Custome of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and according to Law, as if the party had actually subscribed or signed it, (which is usually done.)</p>
               <p>But if a man shall say, <hi>Leave your Bill with me, I will look over my Accounts and Books between the drawer and I, and call to morrow, and accordingly the Bill shall be accepted;</hi> this shall not amount to a compleat accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for this mention of his Book and Accounts, was really intended to see if there were effects in his hands to answer, without which perhaps he would not accept of the same. And so it was Rul'd by L. Chief Justice <note place="margin">Trin. 20 Car. 2 in B. R.</note> 
                  <hi>Hale</hi> at <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Bill may be accepted for part, for that the party <note place="margin">The receiving of part of the Moneys upon the Bill, does no wayes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Bill.</note> upon whom the same was drawn had no more effects in his hands; which being usually done, there must be a protest, if not for the whole sum, yet at least for the residue: however, after payment of such part there must be a protest for the remainder.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Any time before the money becomes due, the Drawer may countermand the payment, although <note place="margin">Per leg. publia in si ff. depositi &amp; per Bart. ibidem, &amp; per Romanum sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulari, 474.</note> the Bill hath been accepted.</p>
               <p>The Countermand is usually made before a Notary; but if it comes without, so it comes under the parties hand, it is well enough.</p>
               <p>If the Bill be accepted, and the party desires to have the money before it be due, and it is paid, and then
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:110167:134"/>
there comes a countermand; it hath been conceived, that he ought not to be allowed, for as he could not enlarge the time, so he could not shorten it, but his duty is to follow his Order.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>Note,</hi> The Drawer is bound to the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, <note place="margin">Words are made to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie things; Therefore by the word, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer,</hi> is meant he that payes the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: he that drawes the Bill is called the <hi>Taker</hi> or <hi>Drawer:</hi> And the party upon whom, is called the <hi>Accepter.</hi>
                  </note> and the Acceptor to the party to whom the Bill is made payable; yet both are not bound to one man, unless the Deliverer be a servant to the party to whom the money is made payable; or the party to whom the money is made payable be servant to the Deliverer: yet both Taker and Accepter are lyable till the Bill is paid.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Therefore when you bring your Action, be sure to draw your Declaration accordingly, and make the same part of the Custome as you set it forth; for if you vary, you must expect to be nonsuited: and the party is not bound to alledge a particular place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <note place="margin">

               <p>If a Bill be returned protested for want of payment, the Drawer is to repay the money and damage, or else he may procure a security, which is no more but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person of value subscribes the Bill, in these or the like words, <hi>I here underwritten do bind my self as Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, according to the Custome of Merchants, for the summe mentioned in the Bill of Exchange whereupon this Protest is made, Dated, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Drawer by vertue of this supplymental agreement hath as much time again to pay the Moneys as there was given him in the Bill when it was first drawn; so that if the money is not then paid, together with the Rechange and Charges of the party, the party may recover the same on the Principal or Security.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. Beyond the Seas the protest <note n="*" place="margin">That is for not payment, the Bill being once accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's hand is sufficient to shew in Court without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the very Bill it self. But if a Bill in <hi>England</hi> be
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:110167:134"/>
accepted, and a special Action grounded on the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome be brought against the Acceptor, at the Tryal the party Plaintiff must produce the Bill accepted, and not the Protest; otherwise he will fail in his Action at that time.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is safe that a Bill once accepted be kept, and onely a Protest for non-payment be remitted; but a Bill protested for not acceptance must be remitted.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. If a Bill is lest with a Merchant to accept, and he loses the Bill (or at least it is so mis-lade that it cannot be found;) if the party shall request the Merchant to give him a Note for the payment according to the time limited in the Bill of Exchange. Otherwise there must be two Protests, one for not acceptance, the other for non-payment; but if a Note is given for payment, if there happens to be a failer, yet in that case there must be Protest for non-payment.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. A Bill is remitted to <hi>J. S.</hi> who owes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to <hi>J. D: J. S.</hi> delivers the Bill to <hi>J. D,</hi> and on the back-side subscribes his name; if <hi>J. D.</hi> receives the moneys, he may fill up the blanck as if the moneys had been actually paid to <hi>J. S:</hi> This is practised amongst Merchants, and by them reputed firm and good. But certainly the Common Law looks upon this filling up of Blanks after a man hath once signed or sealed, to be no better then a harmless forgery.</p>

                  <hi>Note.</hi> No person be it Wife or Servant, can accept of a Bill of Exchange to bind the Master without a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority, as a Letter of Attorney, and the like, which must be under-hand, unless that it has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and usually done by the Wife or Servant in such case, when the Master hath been out of Town; who hath approved of the same and answer'd payment: it must be usually done; but one Partner may for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> That which will oblige the Master, will be the <note place="margin">And though the same seems an act of Wisdome for Merchants and others so to take, yet it oftentimes proves the destruction of many a Family; The Father puts out the Son perhaps with no less then 2 or 300 l; and is himself become bound for his Truth and just Accounting, &amp;c. The Servant is immediately trusted with his Cash, and then he too young experienc'd in the World, either neglects keeping a iust account, or keeping that, subjects his Masters Cash to be spent by himself and those who make it their sole Trade to betray such Youths: The Master finding the consumption, calls his Servant to account, who conscious of the act, forsakes his Service, dares not see his Relations, and then as a general consequence falls into a Company, the which nothing but Providence can preserve from taking their wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The Father is called to answer, (what ever the Master does say the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath spent or imbezled) none being able to contradict him, he must with a heart full of grief submit to and pay, besides the loss of the Moneys advanced upon the Servant's first putting forth: Which sometimes proves a great affliction in a Family. On the other side, if Servants were not to be entrusted, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery could not be learnt, nor the business dispatched; and therefore faith must be given: but then it were Justice and Honesty that as a Father puts perhaps the Child of his love to one in whom he reposes a faith and trust, that the Master should be then as a Parent, so they should prevent all occasions that might sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to Temptations, and not be over-hasty in Trusting them with the Cash: which is the very Bait our <hi>London</hi> Gamesters catch such Gudgeons.</note> authority and liberty which he usually gives the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; therefore such a power devolved, ought to be secured by the prudent'st way that may be; which is generally done by Bonds and Obligations.</p>
               <p>If a Bill of Exchange by contrary Wind or other occasions be so long on the way that the Usance or time limited by the Bill be expired, and being tendred, both acceptance and refusal are denyed; protests for both

               <p>If a Bill is not accepted to be paid at the exact time, it must be protested; but if accepted for a longer time, the party to whom the Bill is made payable must protest the same for want of acceptance according to the tenour: yet he may take the acceptance offered notwithstanding.

               <p n="30">XXX. Merchants generally allow 3. dayes after a Bill becomes due for the payment; and for non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">London.</note> within the 3. dayes protest is made, but is not sent away till the next Post after the time of payment is expired.</p>

                  <hi>Munday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. The use of the Protest is this, That it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <note place="margin">There are two Protests, 1. For non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led intimation. 2. for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment.</note> to the Drawer that the party upon whom he drew his Bill was unwilling, not to be found or insolvent, and to let him have a timely notice of the same, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the party to recover against the Drawer,</p>
               <p>For if one drawes a Bill from <hi>France</hi> upon a person in <hi>England,</hi> who accepts and fails, or becomes insolvent at the time of payment, if there be not a Protest and <note n="*" place="margin">Which is look'd upon to be the third day.</note> timely notice sent to the Drawer there, it will be difficult to recover the money.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> they are not altogether so strict, yet there must be a reasonable time of notice; the reason is, for perhaps if he had reasonable and timely notice, the Drawer then might have had Effects or other means of his upon whom he drew, to reimburse himself the Bill; which since for want of timely notice he hath remitted or lost. And the general Rule is, That though the Drawer is bound to the Deliverer till the Bill is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet it is with this proviso, that protest be made in due time, and a lawful and an ingenious diligence used <note place="margin">There is no danger, be the party never so responsible, to protest imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately if the money be not paid when it is due <hi>i. e.</hi> the third day; but there may (especially beyond Seas) be great hazard for want of protesting.</note> for the obtaining payment of the Moneys; for it were unreasonable the Drawer should suffer thorough his neglect.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. Where a Merchant hath accepted, and before the same became due, he becomes insolvent, or at least
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:110167:136"/>
his credit publiquely blasted, a Protest ought to go; but <note place="margin">In leg. pno de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito in fine C. de bonis author. Judi. possiden.</note> then there is usually a demand made, which once come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Drawer is compellable to give better security; and if a second Bill comes if no protest, then Drawer and Security lye at stake.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. If a Merchant drawes a Bill, and there is a Protest for non-payment; if another person hearing of the same declare, that he for the honour of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will pay the contents, and thereupon subscribes; he is obliged thereby: and in this case it has been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the party that received the money hath put his name on the back-side of the Bill in blanck; but the receipt is sometimes taken on the Protest, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole proceeding is turned into an act, and the same being drawn by the Notary, is remitted to the Drawer by him who gave honour to the Bill.</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV. If a Bill be accepted, and the party dyes, yet there must be a demand made of his Executors or Administration; and in default or delay of payment, a Protest must be made: and although it may fall out that the Moneys may become due before there can be <note place="margin">14 dayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from the death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration can be committed, unless there be a Will.</note> Administrators, or the Probate of the Will be granted; yet that is delay sufficient for a Protest in case of non-payment.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, if the party be dead to whom the Moneys are made payable, and the Moneys are ready to be paid, and there is no person that can legally give a discharge; yet a protest ought not to go for not payment: The reason is, because there is no person that <note place="margin">But an Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to go, and that the Acceptor is willing to pay according to Order.</note> hath any authority either in deed or in Law to make it, and a Notary ought not to make it; if he does, and the party hath received any prejudice thereby, an Action of the Case perhaps may lye against him for his pains: nor does it avail, that if security be offered to save him harmless against the Executors or Administrators, for that is an act left to his own discretion; for perhaps the security may not be lik'd: but whether good or bad, makes nothing as to oblige him in Law.</p>
               <p>But if a man is bound in a Bond to pay a sum of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:110167:137"/>
money to <hi>J. S.</hi> his Executors, Administrators, &amp;c. and the Obligee dyes intestate the day before the sum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes due, yet the Bond is not forfeited if not paid at the day, because there was no body to whom the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor could pay to save his Obligation: But as <hi>Littleton</hi> sayes, if it be to pay to <hi>J. S.</hi> generally, you must hunt him out all over the Kingdom, if you'l save the penalty.</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. A man not found, or being found not met withal either at home or the <hi>Exchange,</hi> is cause suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a protest; but in that there must be diligence used in the finding him.</p>
               <p>A Bill returned protested for non-payment being once satisfied by the drawer to the deliverer, the drawer is discharged and so is the Accepter to him to whom the Moneys were to be paid: but, the Accepter by vertue of his acceptance makes himself a debtor <hi>secundum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem Mercatoriam</hi> to the drawer.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI. Moneys may be had on Exchange by way of Letters of Credit, the which are in two respects, the first general, the other especial.</p>
               <p>The general Letter is open directed, <hi>To all Merchants and others that shall furnish my Servant or Factor, or any other with such and such Moneys;</hi> for repayment of which he binds himself to answer and pay all such Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change as shall be drawn on him upon the receipt of the value, by his Servant, Factor or other person: If there be really Moneys advanced on this Letter of Credit and paid to the Factor, Servant or other, and Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change are sent to the party that sent such Letter of Credit, and if he refuses to accept, yet according to the customes of Merchants he is bound to pay; the reason is, for there was no respect had to the ability of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker up, but to him that gave his Letters of Credit: and therefore in such case if an Action at Law be brought, the particular custome as to that point must be carefully set forth.</p>
               <p>The special Letters of Credit, where one writes a Letter to furnish another mans Factor or Agent; and there is in this the same remedy as above.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:110167:137"/>
As Bills of Exchange seldome come without Letters of Advice, so ought they to be pursued: If a Bill shall express, <hi>And put it to the account of A;</hi> and the Letter of Advice sayes <hi>B;</hi> this must be protested against, for it cannot safely be paid; at least running the risque of an equitable Suit.</p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII. If one payes money on a Bill before it be due and the party breaks, it has been conceived that the party ought to answer the drawer: The reason hath been, because the drawer might have countermanded the same, or ordered the Bill to be made payable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> if Money is paid to a Banker's Servant, and if the Master subscribe, <hi>Pagate com si dice,</hi> this binds the Master as effectually as if he had subscribed it with his own hands.</p>
               <p n="38">XXXVIII. A Bill drawn by a Merchant in <hi>London</hi> payable by another person beyond Seas, such Bills in most Countreys are assignable over from Merchant to Merchant, and the last person may sue and recover the same upon an acceptance: But in <hi>England</hi> onely the first person mentioned in the Bill, and to whom the Money is made payable may recover. 'Tis true, such person to whom the Money is made payable, may for valuable consideration deliver this Bill to another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and he may endorse an Order on the back-side; but if the party afterwards refuses payment of the same, it may be sued in the parties name to whom the same was transferred, laying the same by way of Custome.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Most certain it is, that neither the stupid simplicity of the Woods, nor Poverty it self are any part of Virtue, and therefore are not reckoned Blessings, as Riches were to <hi>Solomon,</hi> (he who built Gods first Temple, and put his Religion in lustre) and as they likewise were to <hi>Numa,</hi> from whom Money was called <hi>Nummus:</hi> He likewise built the first Temple at <hi>Rome,</hi> and kindled first the Vestal fire, <hi>&amp; ferocem populum deorum metu mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. We know how God conversed with <hi>Abraham</hi> who was the first that had Money, and made use of it to buy a Property: It is true, they with whom he inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted called him a Prince, but that was no argument to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:110167:139"/>
him to disown their properties, but for the contrary, lest they should think that Dominion or a right to things was founded in grace.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But to come more close to the Question, and to examine the reason and necessity of this measure; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is like a Law or Government, which are all consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the same extream necessity; therefore the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting or attempting to destroy any of these by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate means is every where Treason. Now this measure is two-fold, either Natural or Civil, or rather natural, and the Instrument which expresses the natural by equal Permutation: The natural measure is proportioned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Want,</hi> or <hi>Plenty;</hi> In <hi>Want</hi> we consider whether the thing be useful or necessary; things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary are best, but of least price; as a Loaf of Bread is more necessary, but infinitely cheaper than a Diamond. One man hath Cloathes, another man hath Leather; those two possibly have no need one of another, and therefore there will be no Permutation betwixt them; but if one had need of another, then he who were most prest, would come to the price of the other: And therefore <hi>Want</hi> or <hi>Plenty</hi> is the measure of estimating things, and is the bond of Society, whereby one man shews he is or may be useful to another; and Nature hath so ordered it, that no man is so Rich who hath not some need of the Poor; and no man is so mean and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but he may be some wayes useful to the Rich.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Civil Measure or rather Instrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Money is like the middle term of a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisine, of which it is said, <hi>Quo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio conveniunt inter se.</hi>
                  </note> the Natural expresses it self, is <hi>Money,</hi> which hath but a feigned value, and therefore it is sometimes higher and lower in esteem as men please; which could not be, if its value were natural which is unalterable. If I have Cloath at such a price, and you have Wines at the same price, then we regarding the same price may make an equal Permutation: Or if I give to you so many pieces of Gold for your Cloath at the same price, the Sale is equal again, whether it be an incovenience that in some Countries <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Poland</hi> and generally in most of those Northern Countries.</note> is sometimes at a higheer value than at another, is not a consideration of this Discourse; for
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:110167:140"/>
the price of things themselves change more than any Money doth daily.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Money</hi> is an invention onely for the more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite Permutation of things; but it doth not follow that men may 'not make any Permutations but by Money, even as well now as if we were in our natural state; if they who digg now in waste Hills had their Harvest of their Beans well gathered in, but had need of Wine for the Stomachs sake, or of Druggs for healths sake, if the Vintner, or Apothecary have no need of Beans; what use will they make of the natuaal value of their Beans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money? Or if need be, what would they do till their Beans are gathered? Money therefore hinders not Permutation and Commerce of natural things, but assists them; nay, it is therefore an Instrument of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for he who hath Money may buy things which he need not use but sell, thereby to get other things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for his use. There is no Nation or People so barbarous, but have Money or a publique Instrument of Permutation either in Metals or Fish-bones, &amp;c. for it imports not so much of what matter it is, provided it be durable, not counterfeitable, and difficult to come by.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Take away this fungible Instrument from the service of our necessities, and how shall we exercise our Charity, which is a branch of Religion and Justice, as well as of humanity? He who goes to Church passeth as it were thorough two Temples, the Poor at the Porch, and the Temple it self: and the giving at the Porch is called Sacrifice, Offering and Gift, as well as that at the Altar. God would be sacrificed to onely in one Town of the World, <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> But could that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Chap. of Exchange, §. 1.</note> have been, if <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Money-changers</hi> had not been allowed? How could they who came from such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places have by any other means brought their Oxen, Calves, Goats and Doves to the Altar? If there were nothing further to shew, but that one piece, which our Saviour himself coyned miraculously in the mouth of a Fish, it were Argument sufficient that the use
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:110167:140"/>
of <hi>Money</hi> may be both good, just, and necessary.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Things being thus stated, and that <hi>Money</hi> is both good, just and necessary, it will be demanded loudly, That admitting a reasonable advantage may be made by way of Usury, <hi>quo jure</hi> it is that an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon the same more than what the Law allowes, is taken?</p>
               <p>The distinction is great between <hi>Moneys</hi> lent to be <note place="margin">Leg. 3. D. de Naut. faen. l. 1. eod. l. 62. D. de rei Vindic. Locinius, lib. 2.

In the first, the Lawes of the Realm have set marks to govern the same, whereby the Avaritious mind is limited to a reasonable profit; The reason of that is, because the Lender runs none, but the borrower all the hazard whatever that <hi>money</hi> brings forth. But <hi>money</hi> lent to Sea, or that which is called <hi>pecunia</hi>

                  <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectitia,</hi> there the same is advanced on the hazard of the Lender, to carry (as is supposed) over Sea, so that if the Ship perishes, or a spoliation of all happens, the Lender shares in the loss without any hopes of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Moneys; and therefore is called sometimes <hi>usura Maritima,</hi> as well as <hi>Faenus Nauticum;</hi> the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage accrewing to the Owners from their Money, arising not from the loan, but from the hazard, which the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der runs; the which is commonly reduced to a time certain, or one or more Voyages, according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and respective agreements.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. If the Bonds be sealed and the <hi>money</hi> is advanced, if the Ship happens to miscarry by Storm, Fire, Enemy, or any otherwise before the Voyage begun, then the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower runs the Risque, unless it be otherwise provided generally, as that if such a Ship shall not arrive at such <note place="margin">Vide Passim ad leg. de Faen.

               <p n="10">X.

               <p>And therefore by the Laws Maritime, if the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower detains any such lent Moneys beyond the term appointed for the repaying, he shall at his return not only pay the profit agreed on before the Voyage, but also augment the same according to the time that hath <note place="margin">Art. 18.</note> accrued since the day of payment.</p>

               <p>Moneys that are advanced are upon two Securities, the one is on the bare Ship, the other upon the person of the Borrower, sometimes upon both: The first is where a man takes up Moneys and obliges himself, that if such a Ship shall arrive at such a Port, then to repay (perhaps) double the sum lent; but if the Ship happens to miscarry, then nothing.</p>

that if that Ship shall not arrive at such a place within 12 months, the money agreed on to be paid shall be paid; but if the Ship shall arrive, then nothing. The first of these is honourable and just according to the laudable practice among Maritime persons; and though the advantage runs high, as 20, 30, nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> without consideration of time; for the Moneyes are to be paid within so many dayes after <note place="margin">Toto lit.

Complaints being afterwards made to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she answer'd, <hi>That as she would not innovate any thing, so she would protect them still in the Immunities and Condition she found them.</hi> Hereupon their Navigation and Traffique was suspended a while, which proved very advantageous to the <hi>English,</hi> for they tryed
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:110167:145"/>
what they could do themselves herein, their adventures and returns proving successful, they took the whole Trade into their own hands, and so divided themselves to Stapters and Merchant-adventurers; the one resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding constant at one place, the other keeping their course and adventuring to other Towns and States abroad with Cloth and other Manufactures: This so nettled the <hi>Hans,</hi> that they devised all the wayes that a discontented people could to draw upon our new <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers</hi> or <hi>Adventurers</hi> the ill opinion of othhr Nations and States: but that proving but of too small a force to stop the Current of so strong a Trade as they had got footing into, they resorted to some other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they applyed themselves to the Emperour, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Body incorporated to the Empire; and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint obtained Ambassadors to the Queen to mediate the. business: but they returned still <hi>re infecta:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Queen caused a Proclamation to be published, <hi>That the Merchants of the</hi> Hans <hi>should be intreated, and used as all other Strangers within her Dominions in point of Commerce, without any mark of distinction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This enflamed the more, thereupon they bent their Forces more eagerly, and in an Imperial Dyet at <hi>Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> they procured that the <hi>English</hi> Merchants who had associated themselves in Corporations both in <hi>Embden</hi> and other places should be adjudged <hi>Monopolists;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there was a Comitial Edict procured against them that they should be exterminated, and banished out of all parts of the Empire; which was done by <hi>Suderman</hi> a great Civilian.

this made so little impression on the Queen, that the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Politique Princess in recompence of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge commanded another Proclamation to be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the <hi>Hansatique</hi> Merchants should be allowed to Trade into <hi>England</hi> upon the same Conditions as they formerly did, Provided the English Merchants might have the same Priviledges to reside and Trade peaceably in <hi>Stode</hi> or <hi>Hamburgh;</hi> or any where else within the Precincts of the <hi>Hans.</hi> This so incensed and nettled them, That all endeavours were made to cut off <hi>Stode</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> from being Members of the <hi>Hans,</hi> or of the Empire: But the Design was suspended till they saw the Success of 88, King <hi>Philip</hi> having promised to do them some good Offices in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p>But the Queen finding that the <hi>Hans</hi> were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that Equality she had offered to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and her own Subjects, but were using such extraordinary means; put forth another Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That they should transport neither Corn, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, Arms, Timber, Masts, Cables, Metals, or any other Materials or Men to <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Portugal.</hi> And not long after the Queen growing more redoubled and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by the Overthrow of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Invincible Armada, (as the Pope christned it) the <hi>Hans</hi> began to despair of doing any good, especially they having about some 60 Sayl of their Ships taken about the River <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> by her Majesties Frigats, that were laden with <hi>Ropas de contrabanda.</hi> She notwithstanding had thoughts of discharging this Fleet by endeavouring a reconcilement of the differences: but she having intelligence of an Extraordinary Assembly at <hi>Lubeck</hi> which had purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met to consult of means to be revenged of her, she
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:110167:146"/>
thereupon made absolute prize of those 60 Sayl, onely two were freed to carry home the sad Tydings of their Brethrens misfortune. Hereupon the <hi>Pole</hi> sent a rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Embassador in the behalf of the <hi>Hans,</hi> who spake the Injuries done to the <hi>Hans</hi> in a high tone. But the Queen her self suddainly answered him in a higher, with a satisfaction no greater than what she had done to others of the like quality before.</p>
               <p>This fortunate Clashing for the 19. <hi>per Cent.</hi> on the Customes, has proved ever since advantageous for <hi>England,</hi> our Merchants have ever since beaten a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an uninterrupted Trade into <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low Germany;</hi> and by their constant Trade in those Parts have found a way thorough the <hi>White Sea</hi> to <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> and <hi>Mosco.</hi> The return of all which hath since vastly encreased the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Strength of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. HAving in the foregoing Three Chapters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served somewhat of <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Impositions</hi> laid <hi>de facto</hi> within the Realm, and that by Acts of Parliament, or the consent of the Three Estates, it may not seem amiss to enquire what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position the King of his Prerogative may impose on Strangers and their Goods passing thorough his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and Seas; and in that to enquire of the same as in reference to Persons and Goods.</p>
               <p>Beside the right of necessity which seems to be excepted in the first Institution of Dominion, there is another Relique of old Communion, namely, the Right of harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Utility; For why should not one (saith <note n="*" place="margin">De Offic. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero)</hi> when without his own detriment he may communicate to another in those things that are profitable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and to the Giver not chargeable. Therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">De Benef. 4. Symps. 7.</note> saith it cannot be called a benefit to give leave to another to light his Fire by yours. We read in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>

it is not lawful to spoyl our Victuals when we have more then enough, nor to stop nor hide a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when we have drunk our fill; nor to abolish the Way marks either by Sea or Land which have been useful to us: So a River as a River is proper to that <hi>Prince</hi> or that <hi>Lord,</hi> or that <hi>People</hi> within whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Royalty it runs, and they may make a Mill on it, (unless it be Common as a High-way) and may <note place="margin">Leg. quaeda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">II. Again, Lands, Rivers, nay if any part of the Sea be come into the Dominion or Property of any People, it ought to be open to those that have need of Passage for just causes, namely, being expelled by force out of their own Country they seek void places, <note place="margin">Bald. 3. cons. 293.</note> or because they desire Commerce with remote Nations; The reason here is the same which hath been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence it is, That those that will <hi>yield</hi> up their persons, or <hi>promise</hi> Servitude, are accounted <hi>Slaves;</hi> so likewise all that are <hi>taken in Publick War,</hi> and brought within the Guards of their Conquerors; nor is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression necessary, but the Lot of all is equal, after the War is begun, even of those whose ill fortune subjected them to be deprehended within the Enemies Bounds; nor are they Servants only themselves, but all their Posterity for ever.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. Now all these Priviledges and Immunities were introduced by the <hi>Laws of Nations,</hi> for no other reason, but that their Captors, tempted by so many Immunities, <hi>might willingly abstain from that cruel rigour of slaying their Prisoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, That the Captors Dominion is extended to the Children; for should such <hi>use their highest Right, they would not be born;</hi> but Children that are born before that calamity, and were never taken Prisoners, are freed from that unhappy state.</p>

                        <item>1. <hi>Immediate,</hi> as in lineals from Father to Son.</item>

                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Collateral as in lineal from Uncle to Nephew, or <hi>e converso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this meditae descent, or meditate Ancestor, though to many purposes it be immediate; for the Father dying in the life of the Grand-father, the Son succeeds in point of descent in the Lands immediately to the Grand-father; and in a writ of <hi>Entry</hi> shall be supposed to be in by the Grand-father, and not in the <hi>post &amp; cui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is called a mediate descent, because the Father is the <hi>medium</hi> through whom the Son derives his title to the Grand-father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:110167:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In immediate descents there can be no impediment, but what arises in the parties themselves: For instance, the Father seized of Lands, the impediment that hinders the descent must be in the Father or Son, as if either of them attaint, or an Alien.</p>
               <p>In mediate descents, a disability of being an Alien or Attaint, in him that is called the <hi>medius antecessor,</hi> will disable a Person to take by descent, though he himself have no such disability.</p>
               <p>In <hi>lineal</hi> descents, if the Father be Attaint, or an Alien, and hath issue a <hi>Denizon</hi> born, and dye in the life time of the Grand-father, the Grand-father dyes seized, the Son shall not take, but the Land shall <hi>escheat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Collateral</hi> descents A. and B. brothers, A. is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien <note place="margin">Dyer 274<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grayes.</note> or attaint, has issue C. a Denizon born, B. purchases Lands and dyes without issue, C. shall not inherit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause A. which was the <hi>medius antecessor</hi> or <hi>medium diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> is uncapable.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But in any descents, the impediment in an Ancestor that is not <hi>medius antecessor,</hi> from whom and to whom will not impede the discent.</p>
               <p>As for instance, the Grand-father and Grand-mother <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Courtneyes c.</hi> Com.

               <p>The Law does not hinder, but that an <hi>Alien is of the same degree and relation of consanguinity, as natural born Subjects or Denizons born,</hi> the Son, Father and Brother though Aliens; the Son, Father, and Brother our Law takes notice of as well as natural born Subjects, and so it was adjudged, for he shall be preferred in <hi>Administration,</hi>

               <p n="1">I. Though the descent from one Brother to another Brother be a <hi>collateral descent,</hi> yet it is <hi>an immediate des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and consequently if no disability or impediment can be found <hi>in them,</hi> no impediment <hi>in another Ancestor</hi> will hinder the descent between them:</p>
               <p>That this is an immediate descent appears,</p>
               <p>First, In point of pleading, one Brother shall derive himself as Heir to another, without mentioning any <hi>other Ancestor.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>According to the <hi>Civil Law</hi>

               </p>
               <p>According to the <hi>Canon Law</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Laws prohibiting marriage between Kindred in the <hi>fourth degree,</hi> takes Brother and Sister to be the <hi>first degree</hi> of the four.</p>

                  </note>, which though in some cases differs from the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> yet herein and in divers other particulars touching des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, they agree.</p>
               <p>Another evidence to prove that the descent between Brother is immediate, is this <hi>(viz.)</hi> the descent between Brothers differs from all other collateral descents what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <note place="margin">* <hi>Browns</hi> case <hi>Mic.</hi> 1656. <hi>B.

               <p>The Uncle of the part of the Father has no more of the blood of the Mother, than the Brother by the second venter, the Brother by the second venter has the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate blood of the Father with the Uncle <hi>(viz.</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Brother) has not but only as they meet in the Grand father; the Brother of the half blood is nearer of blood then the Uncle, and therefore shall be preferred in <hi>Administration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is apparent that if in the line between Brother and Brother, the Law takes notice how the Father was the <hi>medium</hi> thereof, the Brother of the second venter should rather succeed the other Brother, because he is Heir to the Father, therefore in a descent between Brothers the Law respects only the <hi>immediate relation of the Brothers as Brothers,</hi> and not in respect of the Father, though it is true, the foundation of their consanguinity, is in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother.</p>
               <p>Again, if the Father, in case of a descent between Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were such an Ancestor as the Law lookt upon as the <hi>medium</hi> that derives the descent from the one Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the other, then the Attainder of the Father would hinder the descent between the Brothers: But the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of the Father does not hinder the descent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Brothers, the reason is, because <hi>the Father is not such a medium or nexus</hi> that is look'd upon by the Law, as the means deriving such a descent between the two Brothers; As for instance of three cases, two whereof evince the first preposition. <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That although the descent from one Brother to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brother, though it be a Collateral descent, yet is an immediate descent, <hi>and that if no disability or impediment arises in them,</hi> no impediment in another Ancestor will hinder them.</p>
               <p>The younger Brother has issue, and is attainted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">10 Eliz. Dyer. 274. Grayes <hi>case.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Courtney</hi> had issue <hi>Edward,</hi> and was attainted of Treason and dyed, <hi>Edward</hi> purchased Lands and dyed <note place="margin">Com. placit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. so. 241. Henry Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys <hi>case.</hi>

               <p>But if the Grand-father, of <hi>Edward</hi> had been attainted and not <hi>Henry,</hi> this would not have hindred the descent from <hi>Edward</hi> to the Aunts, because that <hi>Attainder had been paramount,</hi> that consanguinity which was between <hi>Henry</hi> and his Sister, and that is proved by this third case.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="1">I. THe Father and the Mother are the fountain of the blood natural, and as it is that that makes their Issue, Sons, or Daughters, so it is that that makes them Brothers and Sisters; but it is the civil qualifications of the blood that makes them inheritable one to the other, and capable of enjoying the immunities and priviledges of the Kingdom; but that is from another fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law of the Land, which finding them legitimate, doth transplant them into the Civil rights of the Land, by an Act called Naturalization; which does superinduce
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:110167:185"/>
and cloath that natural consanguinity with a Civil here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary quality, whereby they are enabled not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit each other, but also to enjoy all the immunities and priviledges that meer natural born Subjects may, or can challenge.</p>
               <p n="2">II. According to the Laws of <hi>Normandy</hi> the Prince <note place="margin">Servien lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> might <hi>naturalize;</hi> but such <hi>naturalization</hi> could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest the descent already vested.</p>
               <p>But according to <hi>our Law</hi> by no way but by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and that cures the defect as if they had been born in <hi>England,</hi> and no man shall be received against an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to say the contrary.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Father an <hi>Alien</hi> has issue a <hi>Son</hi> born <hi>here,</hi> and then the Son is naturalized, the Son shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Relative</hi> terms, as if <hi>born</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is generally used to supply the <hi>personal defect</hi> of the parties naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, arising from their <hi>birth out of England,</hi> and therefore shall never be carryed to a <hi>collateral</hi> purpose, nor cures a disease of <hi>another</hi> nature, as <hi>half blood, illegitimation</hi> and the like; but all diseases, whether in the <hi>parties</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or <hi>resulting</hi> from the Ancestor, it cures.</p>

                  <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> of this nature may be so pen'd, as to cure defects in the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Ancestor,</hi> or in the parties <hi>themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>restitution</hi> in blood be granted to the <hi>Son</hi> by Act of Parliament, this cures that <hi>disability</hi> that resulted from the <hi>Fathers</hi> Attainder, and that not only to the <hi>Son,</hi> but also to the <hi>collateral Heirs</hi> of the Father; the true reason of this is, because <hi>the corruption of the blood by the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is only of the blood of the Father, for the Sons blood or</hi>

               <p>And therefore such <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> as take no other notice but of the <hi>Person naturalized</hi>'s <hi>Forreign birth,</hi> the same cures not any disability of <hi>transmission hereditary</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father, Brother, or any other Ancestor, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting</hi> from the disability of them without <hi>actually na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of them:</hi> As for instance, the Father an Alien the Son naturalized by Act of Parliament, the Father or any other Ancestor an Alien purchases Lands and dyes, the Son shall not take by reason of the disability in the Father, but there <hi>may be words</hi> inserted in the Act that may take away the impediment.</p>

Those that are born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and those that are born in <hi>Scotland</hi> are all alike, for their birth are within the Kings Dominions, and they are born under the like subjection and obedience to the King, and have the like band of <hi>allegeance ad fidem Regis;</hi> yet if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> comes into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by the <hi>Parliament</hi> is there natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized, though perhaps this may qualifie and cloath him with the title of a <hi>natural born</hi> Subject of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet it has been conceived that it will not make him a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural born Subject of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the union of <hi>Ireland</hi> to that of <hi>England;</hi> is different from that of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for the first is dependant, as a <note place="margin">My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> so conceives, but Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> denyes that ever there was any such <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus tenendi,</hi> but the same is an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <hi>Vide</hi> his Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>fol.</hi> 708. 710, 718. to 721.</note> Kingdom conquered, the latter independant: Though <hi>Henry</hi> the II. after his Conquest of that Nation, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit over from <hi>England</hi> the Ancient <hi>modus tenendi Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> enabling them to hold Parliaments, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was confirmed by King <hi>John;</hi> yet that was by no other sorce then bare Letters Patents. Now when a Nation is once conquered, there remains no Law, but that of the Conqueror; and though he may incorporate such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Nations with his own, and grant unto them their ancient Parliamentary wayes of making of Laws; yet the Conqueror can no wayes grant unto them a power, by vertue of such Grant or Confirmation, as to impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Countrey, for he himself before such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, could not make a natural born Subject without Act of Parliament, and most certainly his Conquest adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his power, though it does increase his Dominion.</p>

               <p n="1">I. HAving in the first Chapter of this Book discoursed, of the original of property deducing its inception, to that which we call possession, or <hi>meum,</hi> and how the same may be altered by War; it may not seem unnecessary to discourse of the acquiring of property, in the new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of those vast immensities of <hi>America,</hi> which being prepossess'd, seem to deny us legally that title which we pretend to.</p>
               <p>Possession by Law, is esteemed the highest title that men can pretend to what they enjoy, which is nothing else but <hi>positio pedis;</hi> as if the Ancients had no other seal to confirm their tenures, but the prints of their feet; and good reason, seeing the mind is not able to take up a place so well as the Body; for many mens wills may concur in (wishing and liking) the same thing, but many bodies cannot concur to the possessing it: Besides the mind cannot set an outward mark on what it likes,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:110167:193"/>
that thereby others might be warned to abstain from it, all which the Body properly doth. <hi>Abrahàm</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> going to plant, declared no more then this, <hi>there was room or vacancy enough;</hi> and therefore, without further examination, or scruple, they knew they might turn to the right hand or to the left, to possess what they would to themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Vacancy, which gives us a right to plant, is to be considered in two respects, 1. Natural; 2. Civil, the first is in things which may be possess'd, but actually are not, neither in property, nor use; such a Vacancy which is <hi>nullius in bonis,</hi> might be occupied by <hi>Switzers,</hi> who as <hi>Caesar</hi> sayeth, would fain have changed their rough Hills for some nearer Campania; and Deserts or Places un-inhabited, may be possess'd and appropriated to the first Planter, and that without all controversie, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially by those who being expulsed from their own Seats or Estate, seek entertainment abroad: The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebarians</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> cry out, <hi>As the Heaven to the Gods, so</hi>

                  <hi>is the Earth granted to Mortals, and what is void is publique:</hi> Looking up to the Sun and Stars, they did openly as it were enquire of them, <hi>Whether they were pleased in beholding any ground empty, and without Inhabitants, they should rather cast forth the Sea, and overwhelm the Spoilers of the Earth.</hi>

But we must press this Argument of <hi>Grotius</hi> very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, least by the same reason others conclude, that those Estates which are not competently improved, are derelict and occupiable by others, which would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce perpetual confusions, and easily perswade every man that he could husband his Neighbours Lands better then himself: However this is a clear Case for all Planters, that those wastes, or <hi>asperi montes,</hi> which the Natives <note place="margin">Recte facta est concessio, quae est sine damno al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius.</note> make no use of, nor can receive any dammage by their being possess'd by others, may lawfully be impropriated by them.</p>

But admitting that Planters may appropriate a Plantation for their living, whether such may dispose of the same by Will (we supposing the Possessor having no Heir) for that he might seem to have but a usufructuary possession, till a descent had been cast, which then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may turn the same into a right <note n="*" place="margin">As it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that my share of subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which was before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain should now be fixed, so it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the consent which others gav eto this at first, should stand fixed, especially if there was no obligation, or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the first to the contrary. <hi>Vide Selden de Jure Na: &amp; gen. ad men.

               <p n="5">V. Again Persons having arrived in those Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and planted, but before they have reapt the fruits of their labour, necessity is found within their Huts, and a supply of things for the support of humane life is wanting, whether such may seek the means of subsistance, by the Laws of nature, and in case of refusal (after request) force them from their Neighbour Planter? Surely that which is necessary for any natural subsistance, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to another, belongs justly to me, unless I have merited to loose the life, which I seek to preserve. There were a defect in Gods creating our natures such as they

               <p>Man were of all living Creatures most miserable, if he might not during this life have that measure, which God would not have an Ox defrauded of; thus hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Dung-hill-fly a right to live, and to remain inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile, which besides existence hath sence, and may not justly be deprived of that its chiefest felicity, unless it be importunate to a nobler Creature.</p>

The will of those who first consented mutually, to divide the Earth into particular Possessions, was certainly such as receded as little as might be from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural equity; for written Laws are as near as possible may be, to be interpreted by that, and therefore in cases of such extremities we are not without examples, of taking the goods of one to supply the necessities of many; And therefore at Sea, if Provisions begin to fail in a Ship, <note place="margin">Grotius de Jure Belli ac Pacis lib. 2. cap. 2. §. 7, 8, 9.

VIII. The reason of this Christian Charity, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is as far above the natural, as Christ himself was above Nature, this requires an equal beating of all pulses, that as Fellow-Members we have a <hi>Homogenial</hi> sence, and palpitation; we are to divide a Cruze of Oil, and a few handfuls of meal, with one of Christs Flock, with an abandoned Creature; and what can be in more extremity than a poor Planter, in a strange Place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute <note place="margin">Ne quicquam funde suspirat nummus in imo</note> for the present of the supports of humane life?</p>
               <p>And surely the violation of this <hi>Jus Charitatis,</hi> is no less then theft, in those who having extended fortunes, never defalcate a <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Crust perhaps for a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Angel, these steal even the Ship-wrack'd mans picture from him, which as his whole inheritance he carried at his back, to move compassion, and by the insatiable Sea of their Avarice, and Luxury, they wreck him over at Land.</p>

               <p>Wherefore in the midst of that primitive Communion, we find that the Apostles went <hi>Domatim,</hi> from house to house breaking of bread, therefore they even then retained by their houses in property; which property is supposed by the eighth Commandment, as well as it is by Christian Charity: For no man can steal, but by inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the right of another; and as for Charity, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary he have something of his own, to be able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil its commands, and to make a dole at his door; and it is very convenient that he give it rather with his own hand, then by some publique Collectors, <hi>For Charity is</hi>

under the Law, Jews were commanded, <hi>to love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as themselves;</hi> yet this Command took not away property then, therefore it takes it not away now; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we own the use, or usufruct of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties to the distressed, though our selves be at the same time in distress; just as we are commanded, by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of our own lives, to endeavour to secure our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours life, which is yet a Charity more transcendent then the other, by how much life is above livelyhood? And though the various Laws of Countreys, have variously provided punishment, for those who out of meer neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity take something out of anothers plenty; yet that proves not the Act to be sin, or repugnant to equity, or conscience, but rather repugnant to the conveniency of that Kingdom, or Republique, where the Act is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and the true reason of the same is, least there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a gap might be laid upon to Libertinism; besides Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of State, we know, considers not vertue, so much as publick quiet, and conveniency, or that right which is <hi>ad alterum.</hi>

Hence will grow many advantages, both to the publique, and private; To the publique, for that they that should deal in Commerce, having means, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and sufficiency for this conduct, it would be far greater in the furnishing more Ships to Sea, and better armed, the which the Estate at need might make use of for the safety of the Publick; and would add to the reputation of the Nation in all parts, they knowing that an indignity, or dammage offered to such, would require satisfaction with a strong, and powerful hand; the which they cannot do, who being poor, and having but small stocks, or what they borrow from Banckers, or are indebted for the Cargoe which they send forth,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:110167:197"/>
have not the courage to hazard themselves, and their all in an enterprize that is great: Besides such who have honour, riches, and courage, would keep up the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their several Commodities, by the not les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening the Market, the which the poorer sort, to pay Customes, Freight, Bills of Exchange, and other contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and necessary charges, which accompanies the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, they are often forced to mortgage the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe to the Bankers, at excessive usury, or else to sell for ready money, for an inconsiderable gain, nay some ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their wants to be known, for ready money will sell for loss; all which would be prevented, if such Persons of value would apply themselves, to a prudent management of the same; for whatsoever hazard they run, there would be more gotten by such in 2. voyages, then the smaller sort in three, or four Voyages, and by that means it would be the occasion of preventing of many expenses, or importuning their Prince with demands; nay perhaps, they might get more at Sea in one year, then in ten at Court. Besides experience hath taught, and doth daily manifest, that where the richest have dealt in this of Commerce, it hath enriched both them, and the Estate under which they lived; and at this day the Examples of the <hi>Venetians, Portugals, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> have made it known unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The consideration of which, first gave light to that industruous Nation the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> to procure the Association, or Incorporation by <hi>John,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> of that Ancient Company of the Adventurers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1248, which were then called the Brotherhood of Saint <hi>Thomas Becket of Canterbury;</hi> which being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards translated into <hi>England,</hi> was by <hi>Edward</hi> the III. confirmed, and by his Successors <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. <hi>Henry</hi> V. <hi>Ed.</hi> IV. <hi>Henry</hi> VI. <hi>Richard</hi> III. and King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who gave them the name of Merchant Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, and from him successively hath their Charter been confirmed down, to his sacred Majesty that now is; and as this Society is of Ancient estimation, so is their Government very commendable.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Society of the Company, trading to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> differ from others, both as in reference to
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:110167:198"/>
Persons, Members which are at this day many of the principal Nobility of <hi>Engalnd,</hi> as also for that their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers run all into many stocks, and is governed, and carried all jointly upon benefit, and loss, they were incorporate Anno 1599. and since then they surrendred their Charter, and accepted a new one; and are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by the name of <hi>Governour, and Company trading to the East-Indies;</hi> their Adventurers run all into one Stock, and is governed, and carried on upon bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and loss; the same being at this day, according to the subscriptions, about four hundred thousand Pounds, which the several Persons Subscribers may sell, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and dispose of; but they can no wayes take out the same: The great Stock may be encreased, if the Company shall see occasion so to permit; but they are very cautious of the same, for that the greater the dividends, the more reputation the Stock bears, which above all things is to be maintained; however direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his own account, no Person can have above ten thousand Pounds Stock there, nor can he have a compleat title, till he is made a Free-man of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; their returns are very profitable, and of late very rich, and have wany Places of great importance in <hi>India,</hi> as <hi>Meslopotam</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Cormondel, Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, Suratt,</hi> Fort St. <hi>George, Bantam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>Dutch</hi> having found relief in their distress, from the <hi>British</hi> shoar, against their powerful Enemy, found also a pattern to carry on Commerce, they not being wanting in the imitating the Incorporation of a Company, trading to those Places which they possess'd in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> and therefore in the Year 1602. leave was granted from the Estates, to Traffique into those Parts before all others, during the space of one and twenty years, the which was granted them, in consideration of five and twenty thousand Florens, which they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to pay to the Estates during the first ten years; thus reduced all into into one Company, <hi>Amsterdam</hi> had one moyety, <hi>Midleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> a fourth part, <hi>Delph, Rotterdam, Horne,</hi> and <hi>Enchusen</hi> had either of them a sixth part; and the whole Stock of this Union amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to six millions of Livers, or six hundred thousand pound Sterling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:110167:198"/>
For the direction of this Trade, and the interests of the Associates, they have established, in either of those Towns, a certain number of Administrators, at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> twenty, at <hi>Midleburgh,</hi> twelve in either of the rest seven; and if any one dyes, the Chamber of the Place names three, of which either the Estates General, or the Magistrate of the Town chooseth one.</p>
               <p>Those Chambers choose Seventeen among the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrators, that is to say, <hi>Amsterdam</hi> eight, <hi>Middleburgh</hi> four, <hi>Delph</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam</hi> two, <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Enchusen</hi> two, and the Seventeen are chosen alternatively, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Midleburgh,</hi> sometimes at <hi>North-Holland,</hi> the which are called together to resolve jointly of how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ships, and of what Equipage, and Furniture they shall make the Fleet, which they mean to send, and to what Fort, or Coast they should go: This Assembly is held six years together at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and afterwardr two years at <hi>Midleburgh,</hi> and then again at <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> by the Conditions of the accord, the Ships must return to the same Port from which they parted; and the Spices which are left at <hi>Midleburgh,</hi> and other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is distributed amongst them by the weight of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> and the Chamber which hath sold her Spices, may buy from other Chambers.</p>
               <p>By this Order they have hitherto continued this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with reputation, not as simple Merchants only, but as if they were Soveraigns, they have made in the Names of the Estates, Alliances with many of the Princes of those parts; as with the Kings of <hi>Sian, Quadoen, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, Johor,</hi> the Heir of <hi>Mataca, Bornean, Achin, Sinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, Baretan, Jocotra,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Jatta;</hi> they have made themselves absolute Masters of the Island of <hi>Amboina,</hi> but by what means?—Where they have a President, which governs in their name; at <hi>Banda</hi> they have a Fort for a retreat; where they must deliver them the Spices at a certain price; in <hi>Trinate</hi> they have another a mile distant of that of the <hi>Portugales;</hi> at <hi>Magniene</hi> they have three; at <hi>Motire</hi> one; at <hi>Gilele</hi> they have taken that which the <hi>Portugales</hi> have built; and indeed whatsoever either can, or may consist with their interest in those parts, they have engrossed, and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:110167:199"/>
by that means almost the Trade of the whole Spices of the <hi>East.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. So likewise the Most Christian King, hath within few years established such another Trading, to those <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>England</hi> we have several others, as that of trading to <hi>Turkey,</hi> that of <hi>Affrica,</hi> to <hi>Guiny,</hi> and several others, dividing the several Trades according to the Coasts, and Places where they are appointed; forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to intrench, or incroach on each other, so likewise to all other his Majesties Subjects, on severe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now it is not the dividing of the Trade into Companies, that can answer the expectation, but it is the dividing the Trade into Companies, where the Places may bear it; as that to the <hi>Indies, Turkey, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourough,</hi> and some others; But to some others, as the <hi>Canaries, France,</hi> or any of those Places on this side the Line, it has been conceived, the Trade will not bear it, but the same would be better distributed, either into the Trade of voluntary Associations, or single Traders; others perhaps would result into Monopolies, if incorporated; however the Standard rule is, to know whether the Trade of the Place will bear a Company, or not.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. A Factor is a Servant, created by a Merchants Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and taketh a kind of provision called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorage, such Persons are bound to answer the loss, which happens by over-passing, or exceeding their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but a simple Servant, or an Apprentice can only incur his Masters displeasure. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb: <hi>Quien passa Commission pier de Provision; He that exceeds his Commission, shall loose his Factorage:</hi> But time and experience hath taught them to know better things, for now it is: <hi>Subolca la paga, His Purse must pay for it.</hi> The gain of Factorage is certain, however the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the Voyage proves; and it is the prudence of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to chuse honest, and industruous Persons, for otherwise the Factor may grow rich, and the Merchant poor; the first being sure of his reward, the latter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of his gain.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In Commissions they now generally incert these
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:110167:202"/>
words: <hi>Dispose, do, and deal therein as if it were your own;</hi> by which the actions of the Factor are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, though it turns to his Principals loss, because it shall be presumed he did it for the best, and according to his discretion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But bare Commission to a Factor, to sell and dispose, will not enable him to trust, or give further day of payment; for in the due execution of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he ought on a Sale to receive <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and as he delivers one receive the other, for otherwise by that means, as they may trust six Moneths, they may trust sixteen years: Nor by the vertue of that clause, of <hi>Doing as if it were their own,</hi> may they trust out to an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable time, as ten or twenty years instead of one, two, three Moneths, which is the Customary time for <note place="margin">I Jac. B. R. Rott. 416. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton &amp; Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docks Bolstr. 1. part 103.</note> the like Commodities: And so it was adjudged, where one had remitted Jewels to his Factor in <hi>Barbary,</hi> who disposed of the same to <hi>Mulleshack</hi> the Emperor, for a Sum certain to be paid at a time, which being ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psed, the Factor not obtaining it, was forced to make the same good to his Principal.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Again, one and the same Factor may act for several Merchants, who must run the joynt risque of his actions, though they are meer Strangers to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; as if five Merchants shall remit to one Factor five distinct Bales of Goods, and the Factor makes one joynt Sale of them to one man, who is to pay one moyety down, and the other at six Moneths end; if the Vendee breaks before the second payment, each man must bear an equal share of the loss, and be contented to accept of their dividend of the Money advanced.</p>
               <p>But if such a Factor draws a Bill of Exchange, upon all those five Merchants, and one of them accepts the same, the others shall not be obliged to make good the payment. <note place="margin">Mich. 17 Jac. C. B. Van Heath versus Turner Winch 24, 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. And as the Authority, and trust reposed in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors is very great, so ought they to be provident in their actions, for the benefit of their Principals; and therefore if Factors shall give time to a Man for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moneys contracted on Sale of their Principals Goods, and after the time is elapsed, they shall sell
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:110167:202"/>
Goods of their own to such Persons for ready Cash (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Principals unreceived) and then such Men break, and become insolvent, the Factor in equity and honesty ought to make good the losses, for they ought not to dispense with the non-payment of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals Moneys, after they become due, and procure pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own to an other mans loss; but by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> they cannot be compelled.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Yet if Goods are remitted to a Factor, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arrival he shall make a false Entry at the Custom-house, or land them without the Customer, whereby they shall incur a seisure or forfeiture, whatsoever <note place="margin">Levison versus Kirke Trin. 7. Jac. in <hi>B.</hi> R. Lane Repor. 65.</note> the Principal is endammaged, he must inevitably make good, nor will such general clause help him as above: But if a Factor makes his Entry according to the Envoice, or his Letter of Advice, and it falls out the same are mistaken, if the Goods shall be lost, yet the Factor is descharged.</p>
               <p>And as fidelity, diligence, and honesty are expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Factor, so the Law requires the like from the Principal, judging the act of one to be the act of the other; and therefore if a Merchant shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Counterfeir Jewels to his Factor, who sells and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposes them for valuable considerations, as if they were right, if the Factor receives any loss or prejudice thereby, by imprisonment or other punishment, the Master shall not only make good the dammage to the Factor, but also render satisfaction to the Party damnified; and so it was adjudged, where one <hi>How</hi> was possessed of three Counterfeit Jewels, and having Factors in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and knowing one <hi>Southern,</hi> a Merchant, was resident on the Place, consigns those Jewels to his Factor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, intreated <hi>Southern</hi> to sell those Jewels for him, telling him they were good Jewels; whereupon <hi>Southern,</hi> not knowing they were counterfeit, sold them to the King of <hi>Barbary</hi> for eight hundred Pounds (they <note place="margin">Hill 25 Jac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  </note> being worth really but one hundred Pounds) and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Money to the Factor, who remitted the same to <hi>How;</hi> the King of <hi>Barbary</hi> not long after finding himself couzened, committed <hi>Southern</hi> to Prison till he repaid the eight hundred Pounds: Whereupon <hi>Southern</hi>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:110167:203"/>
coming for <hi>England,</hi> brought his action against <hi>How,</hi> and had Judgment to recover his dammage; for the Principal shall answer for his Factor in all cases where he is privy to the act or wrong: And so it is in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, if a Factor shall buy Goods on the Account of the Principal (especially if he has used so to do) the Contract of the Factor will oblige the Principal to a <note place="margin">Hill 43. Eliz. B. R. Petties &amp; Soames <hi>case</hi> Goldsbr. fol. 137.</note> performance of the bargain.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. When Factors have obtained a provenue or prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for their Principal, they must be careful how they dispose of the same, for without Commission or order they must be responsible. Goods remitted to Factors, ought in hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to be carefully preserved, for the trust is great that is reposed; and therefore a Factor robbed in an Account, brought against him by his Principal, the same shall discharge him <note n="†" place="margin">Southels <hi>case.</hi> Coke lib. 4. fo.</note>. And so it is if a Factor buyes Goods for his Principal, which afterwards happens to be damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Principal must bear the misfortune: But if a Factor shall dispose of the Goods of his Principal, and take Money that is false, he shall there make Good the loss; yet if he receives Moneys, and afterwards the same is by Edict, or Proclamation lessened in value, the Merchant, and not the Factor must there bear the loss.</p>
               <p>Again, in Letters of Credit, the Factor must be sure to see, whether the Commission is for a time certain, or to such a value, or not exceeding such a Sum, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in which he must have a careful eye.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. A Merchant remits Goods to his Factor, and about a Moneth after draws a Bill on him, the Factor having Effects in his hands, accepts the Bill, then the Principal breaks, against whom a Commission of Banckrupts is awarded, and the Goods in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quere,</hi> If equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in such case.</note> hands are seized; it has been conceived, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor must answer the Bill notwithstanding, and come in a Creditor, for so much as he was enforced by reason of his acceptance to pay.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. If a Factor enters into a Charter Party with a Master for Freightment, the Contract obliges him; but if he lades aboard generally the Goods, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals and the lading are made liable, and not the Factor, for the Freightment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:110167:203"/>
The Principal orders his Factor, that as soon as he hath laoded (he having Moneys in his hand) to make an Assurance on the Ship and Goods, if the Ship happens to miscarry by the Custom of Merchants, he shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the same, if he hath neglected his Commission; so it is, if he having made an Assurance, and loss hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, he ought not to make a Composition without orders from his Principal.</p>
               <p>Generally the actions of Factors do depend on Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Selling, Freighting, and all other the Heads that have been treated in the Second Book, by which their employment is universal in matters Maritime, and of Commerce; and the questions which would arise touching the same, if treated on, would be <hi>infinitum:</hi> However these are to be the Standard rules, which should govern their actions; <hi>viz.</hi> honesty, faithfulness, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and observing of Commission, or Instructions, which being considered, and weighed by those that shall be Judge of their actions, a right understanding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terming of the matters, arrising between them and their Principals, would soon be ended.</p>
               <p>But those sort of Factors that have wanted those things, seldom or never render any other account, but long, and tedious Chancery Suits; by which they not only have endammaged their very Trade, but seek to marry their Principal to a double affliction, by oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to sue either a Beggar, or that which is worse, a naughty man.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Factors that behave themselves worthily, and prudently in the service of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, ought after their tedious service be numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those that justly challenge that worthy deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Merchant:</hi> And such was he who never made breach of Commission, in the service of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, but once; that was, when Wines were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him to dispose of, but the price (by reason of a glut) fell, advice being given to the Principal of the same, who immediately in passion writes to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, to take a hammer and knock out the heads; but the Factor considering (that leave must be given to loosers to speak) knew better things, and kept the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:110167:204"/>

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:110167:205"/>
which their excessive number, they cannot be foreseen while Men are making Laws: Hence we may understand, wherefore it is said, <hi>Omnis definitio in jure est periculosae,</hi> and that <hi>summum Jus</hi> at some time may be found <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum injuria;</hi> as to render a Man his Sword, when he is actually mad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as circumstance hath power to change the matter, so in the form of the action, it leaves in the middle a latitude, sometimes enclining to one extream, sometimes to another.</p>
               <p>For Example, betwixt that which by precept we are commanded ever to do, and that which we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded act ever to do, is plac'd that which is lawful for <note place="margin">Non ide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> us now and then to do, or not to do, in matters of our own right, so far as they seem expedient, or not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us: Thus <hi>Joseph</hi> is called a just Man, because he thought of divorcing himself from <hi>Mary,</hi> though upon circumstances he would not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which perplexes us all here is, that this <hi>licitum</hi> leans sometimes more to the one hand, sometimes more to the other, sometimes more to that which is absolutely good, sometimes more to that which is absolutly bad; from whence grow scruples &amp; doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, whether in such twilight we really participate more of light then of darkness, that is more of good then of bad.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Humane Laws grow most out of these middle things, <hi>ex mediis licitis;</hi> and upon right examination we find, that a Man hath nothing else to dispose, for we <note place="margin">Vasqu. 11. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov. 54. 4:</note> (poor subordinate Vessels) cannot so much as deliberate <hi>de absolute debitis,</hi> and <hi>absolute illicitis,</hi> for they were in force before Man, Prince or People were in being, and God <note place="margin">Grotius de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Belli ac Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, lib. 1. cap. 1. §: 14.</note> himself cannot now alter them, they flowing intrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, either from his Sanctity, Wisdom, and Justice, as he is a Creator and Governour; or else they flow from Nature, whose rule (according to Gods making it by that which is in himself) is right reason and honesty: This upright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ess of Nature, together with that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have to be subject to it, was not a moment after us, and therefore we could not determine any thing about it; for which cause we have not a legislative power to alter or diminish any of Nature's Laws.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, of those <hi>who without any after knowledge of Gods revealed will or Laws to Man, were</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:110167:205"/>
                  <hi>condemnable by those of Nature alone, in the punishing the Breakers whereof:</hi> No Man is naturally more a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate then other; otherwise what meant <hi>Cain,</hi> when after his murther he cryed, <hi>whosoever shall find me, will slay me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. And though humane Laws remember us of those things, yet it is not as if they gave their original and primary force of obliging; yea, reason of State is not busied so much about inward piety and virtue, as it is about publick quiet and repose, or those actions which regard another Mans receiving right or wrong; and hence it is that great prodagility is not so severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a little robbery; and that <hi>malus homo potest esse bonus Civis,</hi> the reason is, because though he may do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wrong in his own rights, yet he may alwayes do other men right in theirs; neither is there any clear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherefore those lesser sins and impieties, should be punished by any but God, who is wisest to know them, justest to weigh the merit of them, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest to punish them.</p>
               <p>This is the State of Gods, and of Nature's Laws, to which we are all equally obliged, but our floating and circumstantiated Laws are only to give a rule, for an equal and mutual community in things, which God and Nature gave us to dispose of as we would our selves.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Hence it is that Kings and such as have equal power with Kings, have a right to require punishment, not only for injuries committed against themselves or their Subjects, but for them also that do not peculiarly touch themselves, whatsoever the Persons that do unmanly violate the Law of Nature or of Nations, for the liberty by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to provide for humane Society (as hath been <note place="margin">Grotius de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Belli ac Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, lib. 2. cap. 21.</note> already mentioned) was in the hand of every man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but after Common-wealths, and Courts of Justice were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, it resided in the hand of the highest Powers, not properly as they are over others, <hi>but as they are under none:</hi> For subjection to others hath taken away that right; yea so much more honest is it to vindicate other mens injuries then our own, by how much more it is to be feared, that a man in his own by too deep
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:110167:206"/>
a resentment may either exceed a measure, or at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his mind; however, his right of punishing an equal, remains still in those places where the People remain as in great Families, and not in Cities, or under some Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and therefore those that have now possessions of any Parts of the New World, or <hi>American</hi> Isles, till they have either voluntarily submitted to a Government, or put them and their discovery into the hands, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of some Prince that may exercise power, there remains the old and natural right of punishing for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: So likewise where Persons shall be assaulted by Pyrats on the Seas, if they be overcome, they may be immediatly executed by the Law of Nature; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there would be a Failer of power to punish such: Besides the old natural Liberty remains in all Places, <note place="margin">Vide Chap. <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> §. 11, 12.</note> where are no Judgments; so where they are taken and brought to a Port, and the Judge openly refuses the <note place="margin">10</note> Trial of them; or that a Trial of them cannot be had, without an apparent detriment, and loss to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Justice may be done upon them by the Law of <note place="margin">Leg. extat. D. quod metus.</note> Nature.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Two Pyrats resolving to assault, and rob the next Vessel they meet with, (not knowing each others condition or design,) encounter, and the one happens to be overcome by the other; the question is now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the above mentioned right so far remains, as that the stronger may execute him that he hath overcome? Right reason dictates, that the evil doer may be punished, <note place="margin">Non reddit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendo quod debet, reddet patiendo quod debet <hi>Philo,</hi> peccare dum festinatis, ad. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>erendas festinatis.</note> not who should punish him; but that Nature sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sheweth, that it is most convenient to be done by him that is Superior; yet doth it not demonstrate this to be necessary, except Superior be taken in that sence, that the evil doer be thought to have made himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inferior to any other, and to have as it were degraded himself from the order of men, into the number of Beasts subject to no man, and such are Pyrats, who have no other denomination but Night-wolves, or Beasts of Prey. By Nature it is ordained, <hi>That the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the worse;</hi> And <hi>Aristotle</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">7 Pol. 14.</note> saith, <hi>The worse are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the use of the better, as well in Naturals as in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificials,</hi>  It follows hence, that at least a guilty Person
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:110167:206"/>
ought not to be punished by another equally guilty, to which purpose is that saying of Christ, <hi>VVhosoever of you is without sin</hi> (that is such sin) <hi>let him throw the first stone.</hi> Pertinent is that saying, <hi>The Sentence can have no authority, where he that judgeth is to be condemned;</hi> From whence, it follows, that the right of punishing in such case at such time ceases.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Kingdoms which are equal in power, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no dependance on each other, cannot be commanded nor corrected of another; but if there be a question, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Decree or Judgment of one in the Territory of the other, there may issue forth a Commission of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, under the Seal of that Court where the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given, or at least under the great Seal of the Prince, directed to the Judges in that place where the the Defendant is resident, and the Judge to whom the said Commission is directed may award execution, according to the Laws of Nations: And so it was adjudged, where one having recovered a Debt before the Governour of <hi>Freisland,</hi> Defendant upon that fled for <hi>England,</hi> the Governour at the Request of the Plaintiff, issued forth his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Request, directed <hi>Omnes Magistratus infra Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Angliae rogans,</hi> to make execution of the said <note place="margin">5 <hi>Jac. in B. R.</hi> Rolls Abridge ment, <hi>wiers</hi> case upon a <hi>Haheas Corpus. fo.</hi> 530.</note> Judgment; upon which the Judge of the Admiralty in <hi>England</hi> issued forth, an Execution of that Sentence, and the Defendant was taken, upon which he brought his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and adjudged the Sentence well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Laws of Nations, and according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of this Realm.</p>
               <p>So likewise if a Dutch-man takes up Goods at the Port of <hi>London,</hi> and gives a Note under his hand for the payment of the same, and then flyes into <hi>Holland,</hi> the Vendor may apply himself to the <hi>Lord Major of London;</hi> and upon proof of the delivery, and Sale of the Goods, the <hi>Lord Major</hi> making a Certificat of the same, and sending it under the City Seal directed as above, they of <hi>Holland</hi> will, and do execute the same upon the Party.</p>
               <p>Herein this last Case differs from the first; for by the former, if there should fall a question about the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Judgment or Sentence, the same can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:110167:207"/>
be done, for they are not to examine the same; and the reason is, least the Stranger be induced at another time to do the like, and so dissolve the Judgments whereof they should demand the execution, the which would be done more through jealousy of the State, then for any injustice in them; besides the Judgments or Sentences, which are matters of Record and of the greatest security in a Kingdom, the presumption that they were justly given shall alwayes be understood.</p>
               <p n="9">IX But in the latter the same may be examined, that is, the Merchant may be heard as to his legal defence, either to the lessening or discharging the debt or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but against the testimony certified, no obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can be made, but the same is admitted as legally proved.</p>
               <p>But if there be a question of honour or life, there they may not execute the Judgments of Forraign Judges, especially if they have not kown the merit of the causes or seen the Informations, or heard the Witnesses; but more especially in <hi>England,</hi> for there can in no respect whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the life of a Man, (let his offence be never so hainous) be brought to punishment without a legal Tryall, <note n="*" place="margin">Coke 4 Inst. so. 38.</note> and that by the producing of Witnesses <hi>viva voce</hi> to his face, yet Princes for the respect they bear each other, and for the Good of Justice, though they cannot at the bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Judges of another Prince, put them to death; yet they may for exemplary punishments (which ought to be made upon the places were the fact was committed) yield the natural Subject to his natural Prince, unless the Prince to whom the fugitive is fled findes that he <note place="margin">Soto de Just. &amp; Jure lib. 5. qu. 1. Art. 7.</note> is unjustly pursued, for in such cases he is not bound to yield them; yea, he is forbidden by the Law of God to restore a bound-Man, which is fled into another Mans <note place="margin">Satius judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus esse paucos aliquos mala ferre quam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensam multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem, <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naras.</hi>

               <p n="10">X. And as the same is in cases Forraign, so likewise in those Estates that are under the <hi>Crown of England;</hi> and therefore if a Man recovers against <note n="†" place="margin">Pasc. 24 Car. 2 in <hi>B. R</hi> in Hibern. inter <hi>Warde and Moore.</hi>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:110167:207"/>
the party may bring his Action of Debt on the same; so the like has been done for Decrees given in the <hi>Chancery</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which have been exemplyfied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal, directed to the Kings Lievtenant, for the putting the same in execution there; but in no case a Judgment given in <hi>England</hi> may be certified over under any other Seal, but that of the Great one.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Scotland</hi> it is otherwise; for that is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom absolute, and not like <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is a <hi>Crown</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed by <hi>Conquest,</hi> but the other is by Union; and though they be united under one Prince <hi>ad fidem,</hi> yet their Laws are distinct, so as if they had never been united; and therefore the execution of the Judgments in each other, must be done upon Request, as above, and that according to the Laws of Nations.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But in <hi>Collonies</hi> or <hi>Plantations,</hi> which are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the condition of great Families, have not this Right of Requesting, for they are governed by the Laws prescribed by the Souveraign of the same, who may set Jurisdictions, &amp; make them places priviledged not to have the Persons attached or arrested in any other places, but within their own bounds; so likewise upon their first forming or Institution, may so declare that for any debt or Contract made or done in any place but in that of the same <hi>Plantation,</hi> they shall not be impleaded; and therefore in <hi>Virginia</hi> at this day, if a Man contracts a debt in <hi>England,</hi> flies to the same, she cannot be there impleaded: But if a Man takes up Goods, and carries the same over thither, there he may be sued in the place; so likewise if it can be proved he carryed over the money borrow'd, and this amongst others of the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of those <hi>Plantations,</hi> is preserved inviolably, the same being as it were a pledge and general safety, which is given to those Inhabitants, that shall resort thither, and there plant themselves for the good of the Place; and although those that thither flie, by reason of great and unreparable losses, have contracted debts far beyond their ability to satisfy, a failer of which, in strictness of Law, may (if the Creditor pleases,) oblidge their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Imprisonment; yet doth it not thence follow
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:110167:208"/>
that the same ought to exacted; for though the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass</hi> of Men may gratify the revenge of the Creditor, yet it never can pay the debt; wherefore if those ends by themselves in a morall estimation be not necessary; or, if other ends on the opposit part occur, not less profitable or necessary; or, if the ends proposed by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment may be attained another way, it will then follow that if there be nothing of obligation on the Debtors part, to render himself a Prisoner to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; that then if the same can or may be avoided by flight, the same in conscience may be done; according to that of <hi>Cicero</hi>
