            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT being of the Lord so ordered, that a publick dispute was appointed betwixt <hi>Thomas Dance</hi> Priest in <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and those called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which was upon the twelfth and thirteenth daies of the second moneth, in which many weighty things, concerning Religion was discoursed of; in which it was first proved by us, according to the Scripture, that Christ Jesus the true light, hath enlightened every one that commeth into the World, <hi>John, 1. 9.</hi> and <hi>John, 12.</hi> and another weighty matter, concerning Religion, discoursed upon was, the righteousnesse by which man is justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, which by us was witnessed and proved, to be onely by the righteousness that was in Christ Jesus, being also made manifest in us, the everlasting righteousness, being brought in, according to <hi>Dan. 9. 24.</hi> again upon the tenth day the discourse was, <hi>whether the Scriptures were the word of God;</hi> the Answer was, that the Scriptures were writings, and the writings was not the word, but the thing written of was the word of God; unto which the Priests also consented: Another thing was concerning the call to the Ministry, whether theirs or ours was according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and according to the Scriptures, the heads of both which calls, is declared as followeth, that all people may judge according to their measure of the gift of Christ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is according to Scripture Testimony.</p>

            <head>A Call to the Minstery according to the Scriptures, held forth in these few words following; Contrary to that Call which is of man, and by man.</head>
            <p>THat by which the Apostles were called into the work of the Ministry, having gifts differing according to the measure of the manifestation of Christ, by the same am I called: which is also according to the Scriptures, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gifts of Christ, by which gift according to the measure of it, were they made; <hi>Some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. And this was by the Power, Vertue and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gift of Christ in them: and as then, so now; for there is not another way to be called into the Ministery by, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any profit the people at all, but they who minister from the power, &amp; moving of that gift which they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Father, by Jesus Christ; by which gift was I called out of the World, and separated for the work of the Gospel; by which gift I saw that which had corrupted the earth, &amp; by it was moved, to minister against it; which gift is that, which hath the power in it, both to convince &amp; convert unto God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> (who was unlearned in the Letter) wa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made a Minister by the gift of the Spirit of Christ; and saith, 1 <hi>Pet. 4 10. As every one hath received the gift, even so let him minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold Grace of God;</hi> (And) <hi>If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracle of God,</hi> (and) <hi>if any man Minister, let him do it, as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified.</hi> So that that Ministery by which God is glorified and people converted, is that, which proceeds from the operation and power of his own gifts in them; which is that Ministery which perfecteth the Saints, edifies the body of Christ; <hi>Brings into the unity of the Faith, unto the knowledge of the Son of God, and unto a perfect man, and unto the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56588:3"/>
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi> But they which gather Scriptures together in their earthly wisdom, and from that which they have gathered, minister unto others; this ministery doth not perfect the Saints, nor edifie the body of Christ, nor bring to the unity of the Faith (but into strife and divisions) not to the knowledge of the Son of God, but leads from his knowledge; not unto a perfect man, but pleads against per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; not into the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; (no) not unto the measure of the least Saint, so that Ministery is to be ceased from, which proceeds not from the measure of the Fathers gift; &amp; that onely continued unto the end of the World which his gift calleth into, and carrieth on in; So I, by the measure of his free Spirit, being called and made a Minister of it unto others <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot of the Letter, but of the Spirit)</hi> in which in all ages the true Ministery stood; <hi>having not received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation and manifestation of the life of Christ in me.</hi> Which Spirit in me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its measure is as true and as infallible as it was in them, which by it were made Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets and Teachers formerly, being the same in power, vertue and operation as it was, as able to reveal and make manifest, to teach, edifie and perfect as it was, and to beget people out of the World into the Covenant of Light and Life; and all who are Ministers of Christ, for the gathering of his seed from the ends of the earth, into the Kingdom of his dear Son, must from the same Spirit witness their Call and separation to that work; and all other calls, are false, and their ministery profits not, which doth not singly proceed from the measure of that gift: but all, who do abide in the measure of his gift, and from it minister, by it, they are manifest to be of God; and in that Ministery they commend themselves unto every mans Conscience in the sight of God, and this is the calling and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, in which as every one abide, they glorifie God. And this is the Ministery of reconciliation, which was committed unto the Apostles, and is unto his Ministers now; by the power of which, the Devils works comes to be destroyed, <hi>and then all things reconciled in one, things in heaven and things in earth</hi> but that ministery which is received from man and taught by man, never reconciles any thing unto God, but doth sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

from God, and beget into enemy; but that which proceeds from the measure of the gift of God, brings every one to know the truth in their own particular; which truth as they abide in it, sets them free from sin, and this Ministery hath the power in it, in all them that have received it, to save them that preach it, and them that hear it and obey it; and no other Ministery doth profit the people at all, but that which from the gift of God is ministred; so that this Call and Ministery here declared, is one with, and according to the Apostles, and the Scriptures.</p>

            <head>The Heads of Priest <hi>Dance,</hi> his Professed Call to the Ministery, as followeth.</head>
            <p>Pr. <hi>If I should speak non-sence (as others do) then I might say, that I am made a Minister by the measure of the gift of Grace, and then I should be accounted a Minister, as well as they, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I do not pretend unto any infallibility in my Ministery, but as these</hi> Act. 6. 6. <hi>Which when the Apostles had prayed, laid their hands upon them;</hi> although (saith he) <hi>that laying on of hands, is not of such necessity, but that a man may be a Minister without it; and as</hi> Timothy, <hi>although he had some extraordinary gifts, yet he was not infallible,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. And (saith he) <hi>I desire the office of a Bishop; which he that desireth, desireth a good work, according to</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1. <hi>And as for his qualifications they are such as whereby he might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged himself, more abundantly in the World, as to outward means, and might have been cloathed in scarlet, &amp;c. But did rather chuse, and incline himself, to be a Minister of the Gospel, and that the outward means, was not his end in chusing to be a Minister; but if that he could be satisfied, or see that there did not want Labourers in the Lords work, he could freely leave off, &amp;c.</hi> And further, he said, <hi>That God had made his preaching effectual for the converting of many, and that there were many, though not in that place, yet some in that place, of whom he could say, as the Apostles said, that they were the seal of his Ministery, &amp;c.</hi> These being the Heads of the Particulars.</p>

            <head>Objections against this Call.</head>
            <p>WHereas thou saiest, <hi>That it is non-sence to say that a man is made a Minister by the gift of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Then the Apostles spoke non-sence, when they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed forth their Call to the Ministery; for to every one of them was given Grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, from which Grace they did Minister, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. But the Apostles spoke sensible truth; therefore he that contradicts it speaks; non-sence and ignorance, as will further appear in saying, <hi>that he pretends unto no infallibility in his Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Then he pretends to nothing of the Spirit of God; much less, to be a Minister of the Spirit, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. For every measure of the Spirit is infallible, or undeceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but that which is fallible is deceiveable, and whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is taught by that Spirit, is deceived; and <hi>Thomas Dance</hi> pretends to have no other Spirit, but that which is deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fallible, so that it is time to turn away from such.</p>
            <p>Again, he chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he was not infallible, which is a false charge; for wherein was he fallible, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable, but he was so infallible, that he not neglecting the gift of God that was in him, he by it, was able to save himself, and those that heard him, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 16. And he Ministred from the gift of God in him, which he had received by Prophesie; and so not from a fallible spirit, but from the infallible; and so is accused falsly by <hi>T. Dance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Tho. Dance</hi> saith, <hi>That he desireth the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But consider what such a one must be (which is) blameless, vigilant, sober, not rude and scornful; but of good behaviour, apt to teach, not apt to laugh and jear, and cause the people to be light and vain, <hi>must he not be given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</hi> but patient, not a brawler, not covetous (as it doth appear those Priests are guilty of, which have nothing to preach from but the fallible spirit, which doth alwayes deceive people) <hi>but one that ruleth his own house well, having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house will, how shall he take care of</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56588:4"/>
               <hi>the Church of God?</hi> but it is manifest that <hi>Thomas Dance</hi> ruled not his own Church, or people well, but rather provoked them to wantonnesse, rudenesse, and laughter, which is madnesse; <hi>Not a novice, least being lifted up with pride, he fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Devil;</hi> but <hi>T. D.</hi> was so lifted up in the pride of his heart, that he gave two meanings to one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so falls into the condemnation of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Pr. And whereas, <hi>Thomas Dance</hi> saith; <hi>That his qualification is such, that he might have been cloathed in scarlet, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What mightest thou have been; A <hi>Lawyer</hi> or <hi>Doctor,</hi> as one of thy brethren said? which if thou had, by that the Nation is deceived, though not in so high a measure, as by professing the ministery, but that is taken up as the most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table trade, to get means, and live in pride; What if thou hadst been cloathed in Scarlet, in Velvet, in Purple, or any other gorgeous apparel? and in that apparel which thou art already cloathed with, wilt thou be condemned, when thou comes to know any measure of the gift, of the true Ministry to be thy guide.</p>
            <p>Pr. Again whereas; <hi>Thou takest the people to be a seal of thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> All the people that were in place, and some more may seal it, to be fallible and deceiveable, as thou hast confessed it to be; but there is not one that can set to their seal, that it hath brought them to a <hi>perfect man;</hi> nor to the knowledge of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> nor to the measure of the stature of the <hi>fulnesse of Christ</hi> and so it hath not effected any of the work of the true Ministry; but when thou comes to be searched narrowly, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre will be found to be the end, for which thou Ministers, without which, thou would be silent.</p>
            <p>And now further to manifest that, he pretends not to any thing of the infallible spirit in his Ministry, these his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or doctrines, declare as followeth, with the answer of truth to them.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>That every individual man was not enlightened by Christ.</hi>

would but deny the form of sound words, and the plain Scripture; the first was this, <hi>That Christ enlightened every man that is enlightened</hi> or else Secondly, <hi>that he enlighteneth some in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation:</hi> Now let people consider how that this can be the meaning of the Holy Ghost, as he said it was, seeing, that here is two meanings, and it is either the one or the other, but he knowes not which, doth plainly manifest, that he hath not the mind of the spirit, which is but one, and speaks as it means, but the Scriptures cannot be broken by such mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which saith, <hi>That every man is enlightened with the true Light.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Then by what shall those Gentiles be condemned, who are not enlightened, seeing that Christ was given for a light to the Gentiles, as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, but he doth not say to some of the Gentiles, and not to the whole body, and though the Gentiles, were <hi>once darknesse, Eph</hi> 5. yet the light shined <hi>in the darkness,</hi> and the Apostle turned them unto that light which shined in the darknesse, that the eye which was blinded might be opened; he did not come to give them eyes, but to open the blind eyes, not to give them light, but to turn them to the light that was in them, as <hi>Acts,</hi> 26. 18.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Which is contrary to the Apostles doctrine, which saith, the Gospel <hi>is the power of God, Rom.</hi> 1. which is not exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nor visible, but invisible, and shined <hi>in their hearts, 2 Cor. 4. 6. and it was hid unto those that were lost,</hi> but that, which was visible, they could see and hear, with the visible eyes and ears; but both the Gospel which is the <hi>power of God,</hi> and the eye that sees, are invisible.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Scriptures cannot be broken, <hi>John.</hi> 10. 35. but is reconciled, and at unity in themselves, and in all those that know them, but he that gives two contrary meanings to one Scripture, he doth not go about to reconcile, but rather to pervert them, and to take away the plain testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of truth, (which they give) from peoples understandings; but the key of knowledge is found again, which opens the Scriptures in the mystery of them, and herein is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of teachers and people, in saying the Scriptures are not reconciled; It is they that are not reconciled to God, nor the Scriptures, and so they utter forth their blindness, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and errour.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>That the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ, was not the Law of the spirit in the Saints; but that they were two Laws. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> This is a false distinction, for God hath said that he will <hi>write his law in their hearts, and put his spirit in their inward parts,</hi> and the same law of the Spirit <hi>of life in Christ Jesus,</hi> being in the Apostles hearts, had set him free from <hi>the Law of sin and death, Rom.</hi> 8. 2 so it was not two lawes, but one Law.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>That there are two righteousnesses of Christ, the one without the Saints, to justifie them, and the other within the Saints, that did sanctifie them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christs righteousnesse is but one, and that by which they were both sanctified and justified was but one thing, even the Spirit of our God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. and Christ <hi>in them,</hi> was Gods righteousnesse, and the <hi>hope of Glory,</hi> who was made unto them righteousness; and if Christ was <hi>in them,</hi> then his righteousnesse was <hi>in them</hi> or else he, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is divided, as this Priests doctrine, would make them.</p>
            <p>Pr. The said Priest denied, <hi>that the Saints were justified by that Christ that was in them,</hi> (when he was questioned about it.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If they were not justified by that Christ that was in them, then by another Christ, which is no less then to Preach two Christ's, and so he hath preached another Gospel, then the Apostles preached, which whosoever doth, is accursed.</p>

Pr. <hi>That David, when he was guilty of adultery, and murther, was not in a condemned state but in a justified state.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here he would make God a justifier of the wicked in his wickednesse, but in that <hi>state David</hi> was condemned of the Lord, and suffered his anger, and terrors, when his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities went over his head, and were too heavy for him to bear, and he was not justified, until that thorow judgement, he was redeemed from the guilt of murther and adultery, and other sins which came over his head; so such teachers as he, who would have God account them just, who are unjust, and them holy, who are unholy and unrighteous, are as the false Prophets, who put no difference between the holy and prophane, and spoke peace to the wicked, where there was no peace, counting them good, who did evil, saying they that doe evil are good in the sight of the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15. as the Priests now say, though they be sinners, yet they are righteous in Gods account, so they would make God a lyar, accounting men to be that which they are not, and to be in Christ, when they are in sin, in the Devils work.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus by his false meanings, he hath often perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Scriptures, calling his false meanings, the meanings of the Holy-Ghost; but these mentioned in <hi>Heb</hi> 12 were them the Apostle wrote unto upon earth, for he did not write to men after they were deceased, and these that he wrote unto, were come unto the <hi>innumerable company of Angels, and to the city of the living God, and to the spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> Christ is the justifier of them that believe in him, and his doctrine is, <hi>I in them and they in me</hi> so Christ and his righteousnesse is in the Saints, and God hath brought in the everlasting righteousnesse, which justifieth, which is not at a distance, separate from the Saints, as these false teachers have Imagined.

               <hi>Ans</hi> Then you cannot contain the righteousnesse of God, for it is infinite, and everlasting, as in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9 24 and then you cannot contain Christ in you, who is Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and who is infinite, and so by this doctrine, he makes all reprobates, as all are who know not Christ in them; for they who did not retain <hi>God in their knowledge,</hi> were given up to a reprobate sence.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> He hath here counted that false doctrine, which the Saints witnessed fulfilled in them, for the righteousnesse of God was imputed to the Saints in the true belief, whereby they did partake of Gods righteousness through faith, before <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
