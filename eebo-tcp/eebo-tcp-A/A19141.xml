            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Emember firſt of all (vertuous reder) that it is highe wiſedome and great perfection, thy ſelfe to know, and then thy ſelfe to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyſe. Thou muſt knowe that thou haſte no thing that good is of thy ſelfe, but of god: For the gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and al other temporal giftes of this world, which ben lawfully and truely obteined, wel conſidered, ben come to thee by the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and grace of God, &amp; not of thy ſelfe. But in eſpecial it is neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:18786:3"/>
for thee to knowe that God of his great grace hath made thee his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, hauing regarde to thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, vnderſtanding, and free wil, and that God is thy maker, &amp; thou his wretched creature, &amp; that thou art redeemed of God by the paſſion of Chriſt Ieſu, and that God is thy helper, thy refuge, and thy deliuerer from all euyl, and to conſider and knowe the goodly order which god of his infinite wiſedome hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned thee to be ordered by. As to haue theſe temporal goodes for the neceſſitie of thy body: the body and ſenſual appetites to be ordered by thy ſoule: thy ſoule to be ordred by reaſon and grace: by reaſon and grace to knowe thy duetie to God and to thy neighbour, &amp; by all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon if thou kepe this conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient order to god &amp; his creatures, they ſhal kepe their order to thee:
<pb facs="tcp:18786:3"/>
But if thou breake thine order to them, of likelyhood they ſhal breake their order to thee. For how ſhould thy wife, children, ſeruauntes, and other creatures, with the whiche thou haſt dooings, doo their dutie, and kepe their order to thee, if thou doeſt not ſo to God and to them? And alſo thinke thou of a ſuretie, that if thy ſenſuall appetite be not ordred by reaſon &amp; grace, thou art worſe ordred than a beaſt: for then thou liueſt out of order, and ſo doth not a beaſt, which is a great ſhame and rebuke to thee a reaſonable creature, and without the great mercy of god, it ſhalbe to thine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation. And therfore think and thanke God, and vtterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe thy ſelfe, and thinke thy ſelfe a great wretch, in that god hath done ſo muche for thee, and thou haſt ſo oft offended his highneſſe, and alſo
<pb facs="tcp:18786:4"/>
done him ſo little ſeruice. Surely it is alſo great wiſedome to thinke, that if it had pleaſed god for to haue giuen to all other men (aſwel beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as other) like grace as he hath giuen to thee, that they would haue ſerued his goodnes better than thy ſelfe haſt done: Wherfore thinke thy ſelfe a wretch of al wretches, except the mercy of God: And therfore by his infinite mercy and grace, call vnto thy remembraunce the degree or dignitie whiche almightie God of his goodnes hath called thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and according therevnto yelde thy debt, and doo thy duetie.</p>
            <p>¶ Firſt and principally, honour God as thy maker, loue him as thy redeemer, feare him as thy iudge. Secondarily, thy neighbour which is thy ſuperiour, obey: Haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and peace with them which be euen with thee in degree: &amp; haue
<pb facs="tcp:18786:4"/>
mercy and pitie on thine inferiours. Thirdly, prouide thee to haue a cleane hart, and a good cuſtodie of thy tong. Pray and take labour, by grace to haue wiſedome &amp; cunning to do thy duety to God and to thy neighbour. And in all thy words &amp; dedes haue euer in minde, that god and his angels heareth and ſeeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, and that nothing is ſo priuily done, but it ſhal be made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. And in eſpecial haue in minde that thou ſhalt dye ſhortly, &amp; howe Chriſt died for thee, the ſubtiltie and falſenes of this temporal world, the ioyes of heauen, and the paynes of hell. And euery morning, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy meditations and prayers, pray vnto thy Lorde God, that the day folowing, thou (according to the degree which he of his infinite goodnes and mercy hath called thee vnto) mayſt vſe this temporall
<pb facs="tcp:18786:5"/>
wretched world in thy thoughtes, words, and deedes, that by them and the merite of Chriſtes paſſion, thou mayſt eſchewe the paynes of hel, and come to the ioy euerlaſting. And in executing thereof kepe truth in wordes and deedes. Defende no man, nor no matter, agaynſt the trueth. In all thinges thinke and truſt in God, and he ſhal direct thy wayes. Truſt not to thine owne witte, but feare God, and he wyl keepe thee from euyl. If thou truſt more in thine owne witte than in the grace of God, thy policie ſhall be ſoone ſubuerted. Be content to heare good counſayle, though it be contrary to thy will: For he is a very foole that will heare nothing gladly, but that is according to his mind. Do thou no man harme, leaſt thou ſuffereſt the ſame. As thou wouldeſt be done vnto, ſo do
<pb facs="tcp:18786:5"/>
thou vnto other. Be ſuche to other, as thou deſireſt they ſhoulde be to thee. If thou be religious, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the due execution of true religion is not in wearing of the habite, but with a cleane mynde in very deede to execute the rules and ordinances of religion: For ſo it is, that to weare the habite and not to execute the rule and order of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is rather to be deemed hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, or apoſtataſie, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. If thou be lay and vnmaried, keepe thee cleane vnto the time thou be maried. And remember the ſore and terrible puniſhmente of <hi>Noes</hi> ſtood, and of the terrible fyre and brimſtone and ſore puniſhment of Sodome and Gomor, done to man for miſuſing of the fleſhe. And in eſpecial call to remembrance the marueylous and horrible puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abhominable great pocks
<pb facs="tcp:18786:6"/>
daylye appearing to our ſightes, growing in and vpon mans fleſhe, the which ſore puniſhment (euery thing wel remembred) can not be thought, but principally for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate miſuſe of the fleſhe. And if thou intende to mary, or be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and haſt a good wife, thanke our Lord therefore, for ſhe is of his ſending. And remember that three thinges in eſpeciall bene pleaſaunt to the ſpirite of God, that is to ſay, concord betwene brethren, loue and charitie betwene neighbours, and a man and his wyfe wel agreeing. And if thou haue an euyl wife, take pacience, and thanke God, for all is for the beſt, well taken: Howbeit thou art bounde to doo and pray for her amendement, leaſt ſhe go to the Deuyl, from whom ſhe came. And haue in remembraunce, that the intent of mariage is not in the
<pb facs="tcp:18786:6"/>
beaſtly appetite or pleaſure in the thing, but the intent thereof is, to eſchewe the ſinne of the fleſhe, or els to haue children. And if thou haue children, as muche as thou mayeſt bring them vp in vertue, to be the ſeruauntes of God: for it is better for thee and them not to be borne, than to be otherwiſe. In thine auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, buſie thee rather to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of thine inferiours, than to be dreaded. Let thy ſubiectes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes rather ſerue and obey thee for loue, than for dread or neede: With ſuche a ſoueraigne goodnes gouerne thy ſubiectes, that they may be glad to ſerue thee both in puniſhing and in cheryſhing. Keepe a manerly meane. Be not to ſtraite. Forgiue not to ſoone. Keepe a conuenient meaſure in all thy works. Go not to meate as a beaſt, but as a reaſonable man, ſay thy
<pb facs="tcp:18786:7"/>
grace, and then remember that mo be ſicke and dye by ſuperfluities of meates, then otherwiſe. Wherefore eate with meaſure, to liue in health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At thy meate haue none other but honeſt communication, and ſuche as is according to thy cunning. Backbyte no man. Be mery in honeſtie: For ſorowe and care hath killed many, and no profite therin. In no wiſe ſweare, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the lawe: For where as is great ſwearing, from thence is neuer the plague of God. In no wiſe braule, ne chyde without an vrgent cauſe: For Salomon ſayth, better is a little with ioye, than a houſe ful of vitayle with brawling. Alſo he ſayth, An euyl perſon is euer chyding, and therefore the Angell of God ſhall be ſent agaynſt him. Be content at thy dynner, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at other times, to geue part of
<pb facs="tcp:18786:7"/>
that which God hath ſent thee: For he that wyl not heare the cry of a poore man, he ſhal cry to God, and not be heard. After thy meat thank God of that he hath ſent thee, or els thou doſt not as a reaſonable man, but like a beaſt, which in eating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth nothing but his meate. With good prouidence and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſee the time wher, when, how, why, or wherefore thou ſpeakeſt, doeſt, or byddeſt any thing to be done. When thou demeſt or iudgeſt any, be he poore or riche, behold and conſider the cauſe, and not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Be as meke in other mens cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and offences, as in thine owne. Sit neuer in dome and iudgement without pitie or mercy. For while thou haſt pitie, and art mercyfull to other mens offences, thou haſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye on thy ſelfe: For in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thou meaſureſt, it ſhal be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb facs="tcp:18786:8"/>
to thee. Yet thou muſte exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iudgment, but it muſt be with pitie or mercy: For (of a ſuretie) to do mercy and iuſtice, is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt to God, than to pray or to doo ſacrifice vnto him. Deeme no man by light ſuſpections. Firſt proue, and then deeme. In doubtes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſentence to Gods might. That thou knoweſt not, commit it to God. Haue little or none affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loue to theſe earthly and temporall thinges: For bleſſed is the riche man that truſteth not in his money and treaſure. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as a man loueth, ſo he is: For the louer is in the thing loued more properly, than in him ſelfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if a man loue earthly things, he may be called, An earthly man. And if he loue principally heauenly thinges or God, he may be called, An heauenly or a godly man. And
<pb facs="tcp:18786:8"/>
therefore loue God and heauenly thinges, for vndoubtedly that is beſt and moſt aſſured loue, for they be, and euer ſhal be permanent, and all earthly thinges be ſoone vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ended, and ſo the loue of them is in vayne. Alſo it is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to feare God: For as he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him ſelfe, Feare not him that may kill the body, and can not hurt the ſoule: but feare him that can kill the body and alſo the ſoule, and commit them to euerlaſting payne, Wherefore, euery euening ere thou go to bed, cal to remembraunce (as much as thou canſt) thy thoughts, words, and deedes, ſayd and done that day. And if any haue bene to thine owne profite and to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, hartily thanke him, for by his grace it was done. And if any haue bene contrary to hys pleaſure, aſke hartily mercy, and
<pb facs="tcp:18786:9"/>
               <hi>reconcile thy ſelfe ſhortly by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, to eſchewe the euerlaſting and terrible paynes of hel, For (as</hi> Saint Auſtine <hi>ſayth) there is not a greater madnes, than for a little temporal delectation (which is ſone done) to leſe the eternall ioye, and to be bounde to euerlaſting paine: from the which the almightie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his infinite power and mercy, and bytter paſſion and infinite wiſedome of Ieſu Chriſte, and by the infinite goodnes and charitie of the holy Ghoſt, keepe vs. Amen.</hi> Deo gratias.</p>
