         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Worthy Friends;</salute>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have at length yielded to your
Importunity; and do here offer
these Sermons to publick view,
and your own; which were, one day the
last Summer, preached under your
roof; attributing more to your pious
design herein, than to my own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against it. I no farther insist
upon the incongruity, having divers
years ago published a small Treatise
of <hi>Self-dedication,</hi> now again to
<pb facs="tcp:56200:3"/>
send abroad another on the same
Subject. For the way of Tractation
is <hi>here</hi> very different; <hi>this</hi> may fall
into the hands of divers, who have
never seen the <hi>other;</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they who have read the other,
have it in their choice whether they
will trouble themselves with this or
no. And tho' your purpose which you
urged me with, of lodging one of these
little Books in each family of the
hearers, might have been answered
by so disposing of many a better Book
already extant; yet you having told
me how greatly you observed them
to be moved by these plain Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
considering the peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of reading what had been, with
some acceptance and relish heard
before (through that greater vigour
that accompanies the Ordinance of
<pb facs="tcp:56200:3"/>
Preaching to an Assembly, than doth
usually the solitary first reading of
the same thing) I was not willing to
run the hazard of incurring a guilt,
by refusing a thing so much desired,
and which, through God's blessing,
might contribute something, tho' in
never so low a degree, to the saving
of mens Souls. I could not indeed,
as I told you, undertake to recollect
every thing that was spoken, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that latitude, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of expression, wherewith it was
fit to inculcate momentous things,
to a plain Countrey-Auditory. But
I have omitted nothing I could call
to mind. Being little concern'd
that the more curious may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
with dislike, how much, in a
work of this kind, I prefer plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(tho' they may call it rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
<pb facs="tcp:56200:4"/>
of speech, before that which
goes for <hi>wisdom of words,</hi> or the
most laboured Periods.</p>
            <p>May you find an abundant <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on your Houshold,</hi> for the
sake of <hi>the Ark,</hi> which you have so
piously, and kindly received: And
whereas, by your means, the parts
about you, have an help for the
spreading <hi>the Knowledge of God</hi>
among them, added to what they
otherwise more statedly enjoy; may
the blessing of Heaven succeed all
sincere endeavours of both sorts;
to the more general introducing of
the <hi>new man which is renew'd
in knowledge—where there is
neither Jew nor Greek, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
nor Uncircumcision, but
Christ is all, and in all:</hi> To whose
<hi>Grace,</hi> you are, with sincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb facs="tcp:56200:4"/>
and great sense of your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
earnestly recommended, by</p>

               <bibl>Rom. 6 part of the 13th verse.</bibl>
               <q>—Yield your selves to God.—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese are but a few words, but I
can speak to you of no greater
or more important thing than
I am to press upon you from
them this day. We are above taught
how absurd it is to continue in sin,
whereto we are avowedly dead, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.
as is signified by our Baptism; together
with our entrance into a new state of
life, and that in both we are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto the Death and Resurrection
of Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5. so that sin ought
now no more to have a new dominion
over us, than Death can again have over
him, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We are therefore
exhorted so to account of our selves, and
of our present state, <hi>That we are dead to
sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ
our Lord;</hi> and thereupon never more to
let sin govern us, or reign over us, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56200:6"/>
yield to it, <hi>verse 11, 12, 13. former part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what then? How are we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to dispose of our selves? If we may
not yield our selves to the service of sin,
what are we then to do with our selves?
The Text tells us, and the very reason of
the thing shews it; <hi>But yield your selves
to God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Subject to be discours'd of is an
<hi>express Precept,</hi> charging it upon us all as
our unquestionable duty, to <hi>yield our selves
to God; which therefore</hi> it can only be our
business in speaking to this Text, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain</hi>
and <hi>apply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We are to explain it. Whosoever
shall charge upon others such a duty, not
obvious, perhaps, at the first view, in the
full extent of it, to every ones under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
may well expect to be askt; But
what do you mean by this Precept? or
what doth this <hi>yielding our selves to God</hi>
signifie?</p>
            <p>And here are two things to be opened
to you.</p>
            <p>1. How, or under what notions, we
are to consider God and our selves in this
matter.</p>
            <p>2. What our <hi>yielding our selves</hi> to <hi>him,</hi>
so consider'd, must include.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56200:6"/>
1. How we are to consider or look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>God</hi> in this affair? You are to consider
him both as <hi>he is in himself,</hi> and according
<hi>to the relations he bears to you;</hi> whether
before your yielding your selves to him,
or in, and upon your so doing.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As he is in himself:</hi> You that have
heard, or now read what I have said, and
do write, here make a stand, and bethink
your selves a while!</p>
            <p>What! Are you about yielding your
selves to God? Sure you ought to be
thinking of it as soon as you hear his
claim laid to you.</p>
            <p>But do you now know with whom you
have to do? Too many have the Name of
God, that great and awful Name! in their
mouth or ear, and have no correspondent
thought in their mind; it passes with
them as a transient sound, as soon over as
another, common, word, of no greater
length; and leaves no impression. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there is less in their minds to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it, than most other words which
men use in common discourse. For they
have usually distinct thoughts of the
things they speak of; otherwise they
should neither understand one another
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56200:7"/>
nor themselves, but might speak of an
Horse, and mean a Sheep: Or be thought
to mean so. And it would no more move
a man, or impress his mind, to hear or
mention a Jest, than a matter of life
and death. But the <hi>holy and reverend Name
of God</hi> is often so slightly mentioned, as
in common Oaths, or in idle talk is so
meerly taken in vain, that if they were
on the sudden stopt, and askt what they
thought on, or had in their mind, when
they mentioned that word, and were to
make a true answer, they cannot say they
thought of any thing: As if the Name
of God, the <hi>All!</hi> were the name of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!</hi>
Otherwise had they thought what
that great Name signifies, either they
had not mentioned it, or the mention of
it had struck their hearts! and even
overwhelm'd their very souls! I could
tell you what awe and observance hath
been wont to be exprest in reference to
that sacred Name, among a people that
were called by it; and surely the very
sound of that Name ought ever to shake
all the powers of our souls, and presently
form them to reverence and adoration.
Shall we think it fit to play or trifle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56200:7"/>
with it, as is the common wont? My
Friends, shall we <hi>now</hi> do so, when we are
call'd upon <hi>to yield our selves to God?</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to hear and think, and act intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
and as those that have the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of men. And now especially in
this solemn transaction, endeavour to
render God great to your selves: Enlarge
your minds, that as far as is <hi>possible</hi> and
<hi>needful,</hi> they may take in the <hi>entire notion</hi>
of him. As to <hi>what he is in himself,</hi> you
must conceive of him as <hi>a Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 24.</note> as his
own Word, which can best tell us what
he is, instructs us; and so as a Being of
far higher excellency than any thing you
can see with your eyes, or touch with
your hands, or than can come under the
notice of any of your senses. You may
easily apprehend <hi>Spiritual Being</hi> to be the
source and spring of life, and self-moving
power. This World were all a dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
lump, if there were no such
thing as Spirit; as your bodies when the
soul is fled. You must conceive him to
be an <hi>Eternal, Self-subsisting Spirit,</hi> not
sprung up into Being from another, as
our souls are: But who from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his own Being, was necessarily
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56200:8"/>
               <hi>of,</hi> and <hi>from</hi> himself; comprehending
originally and eternally in himself the
fulness of all Life and Being. I would
fain lead you here, as by the hand, a few
plain and easie steps. You are sure that
somewhat now is, of this you can be in
no doubt; and next you may be as sure
that somewhat hath, <hi>of it self,</hi> ever been:
For if nothing at all now were, you can
easily apprehend it impossible that any
thing should ever be, or of it self now
begin to be, and spring up out of nothing.
Do but make this supposition in your
own minds, and the matter will be as
plain to you as any thing can be, that if
nothing at all were now in being, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could ever come into being;
wherefore you may be sure, that because
there is somewhat now in being, there
must have been somewhat or other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in being, that was eternally of it
self. And then to go a little farther,
since you know there are many things
in being that were not of themselves,
you may be sure that what was always
of it self, had in it a sufficiency of active
power to produce other things, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
nothing that is not of it self could
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56200:8"/>
ever be. As you know that we were not
of our selves; and the case is the same as
to whatsoever else our eyes behold.</p>
            <p>You must conceive of God therefore as
comprehending originally in his own
Being, which is most peculiar to himself,
a power to produce all whatsoever Being,
Excellency and Perfection is to be found
in all the whole Creation. For there can
be nothing which either is not, or arises
not from, what was of it self. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he is an absolutely, universally,
and infinitely perfect Being, and therefore
that <hi>Life, Knowledge, Wisdom, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Holiness, Justice, Truth,</hi> and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
other <hi>conceivable Excellencies,</hi> do all
in highest perfection, belong, as necessary
Attributes, unchangeably and without
possibility of diminution unto him. And
all which his own Word (agreeably to
the plain reason of things) doth in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of places ascribe to him; as you
that are acquainted with the Bible can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know. You must therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of him, as <hi>the All in All.</hi> So great,
so excellent, so glorious a One he is, to
whom you are to surrender and yield
your selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56200:9"/>
You are to conceive of him as <hi>most
essentially One,</hi> for there can be but one
<hi>All.</hi> And so his Word teaches you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
<hi>Hear,</hi> O Israel! <hi>the Lord our God
is one Lord,</hi> Deut. 6. 4. <hi>We know there is
no other God but one,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4, 5, 6.
Your thoughts therefore need not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
within you, nor your minds hang
in doubt, to whom you are to betake and
yield your selves: there is no place or
pretence for halting between two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
He most righteously lays the sole
claim to you, <hi>a just God and a Saviour,
and there is none besides him, Isa.</hi> 45. 21.
(And so we are told often in that and
the foregoing Chapters. He whose far-discerning
eye projects its beams every
way, and ranges thorough all infinity,
says, <hi>he knows not any, ch. 44. 8.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet again you are to conceive of him
as <hi>Three in One;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> in your yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your selves to him; as the prescrib'd
form, when this surrender is to be made
in Baptism, directs; which runs thus, <hi>In
the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. You are not to be
curious in your enquiries beyond what
is written in this matter, how far the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56200:9"/>
Subsistents in the Godhead <hi>are</hi> three, an
in what sense one; they cannot be both
in the same sense. But there is latitude
enough to conceive how they <hi>may be</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from each other, and yet agree in
<hi>one Nature;</hi> which in none of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon <hi>will and pleasure,</hi> sets each
of them infinitely above all <hi>created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
which for the Divine <hi>pleasure only
was and is created, Rev.</hi> 4. 11. And that
we so far conceive of them <hi>as three,</hi> as to
apprehend some things spoken of one,
that are not to be affirm'd of another of
them, is so plain, of so great consequence,
and the whole frame of <hi>practical Religion</hi>
so much depends thereon; and even this
transaction of yielding up our selves
(which must be introductive, and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to all the rest) that it is by no
means to be neglected in our daily course,
and least of all in this solemn business, as
will more appear anon. In the mean
time, set this ever blessed, glorious God,
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost before
your eyes, as to whom (thus in himself
consider'd) you are now to yield your
selves.</p>
            <p>2. You must conceive of him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56200:10"/>
to the relations which he bears to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, partly before your yielding
your selves to him, and partly in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your doing it. That is,</p>
            <p>1. Before you do any such thing, you
must conceive of him, as</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Your Creator,</hi> the Author of your
Beings,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> 
               <hi>of whom, and through whom, and to
whom all things are.</hi> He that made you,
demands you for himself. You are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to yield your selves to him that
gave you breath.</p>
            <p>2. As the continual Sustainer of your
Being; and who renews your life unto
you every moment;<note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> 
               <hi>in whom you live, and
move, and have your Being</hi> continually; so
that if he should withdraw his supports,
you immediately drop into nothing.</p>
            <p>But these are things common to you
with all other creatures; and signifie
therefore his antecedent right in you,
before you have yielded your selves, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which</hi> you ought to do it, and cannot
without great injustice to him decline
doing it. There are other considerations
also you ought to entertain concerning
him in this your yielding your selves to
him, <hi>viz.</hi> of some things which are partly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56200:10"/>
and in some sense before it, and which
it supposes, but which partly also, and in
a more especial sense would follow and
be inferr'd by it. Principally, this fourfold
consideration you should have of him in
your yielding your selves to him, <hi>viz.</hi> as
your <hi>Owner,</hi> your <hi>Teacher,</hi> your <hi>Ruler,</hi> and
your <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and all these with the
addition of <hi>Supream,</hi> it being impossible
he should have <hi>a Superior;</hi> or that there
should be any one above him in any of
these. And he is in some sense all these to
you before you can have yielded your
selves (as may in great part be collected
from what hath been already said;) But
when you yield your selves to him, he
will be all these to you in a far higher,
nobler, and more excellent sense; and
you are to yield your selves to him <hi>as
such,</hi> or that <hi>in your so doing,</hi> he may actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>become such</hi> to you.</p>
            <p>1. As your <hi>Owner:</hi> The God <hi>whose
you are</hi> (as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Act. 27. 23.
and whom,</hi> as it there follows, and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
consequent, <hi>you are to serve.)</hi> You
were <hi>his</hi> by a <hi>former right,</hi> as all things,
being made by him, are. But you are to
yield your selves to him, that you may
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56200:11"/>
be <hi>more peculiarly his,</hi> in a sense more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in it self, and more comfortable
to you; as <hi>Exod. 19. 5. If you will obey—
you shall be to me a peculiar treasure above
all people, for all the Earth is mine.</hi> Of such
as fear him, the great God says, <hi>They shall
be mine in the day when I make up my
Jewels, Mal.</hi> 3. 17. Your yielding your
selves adds nothing to his right in you;
you therein only recognize, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the right he had in you before, but
it adds to you a capacity and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both by the tenour of his Gospel-Covenant,
and in the nature of the thing,
for such nobler uses as otherwise you
cannot serve for. As the more contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
lumber about a man's house may
be as truly his, as the most precious
things; but neither doth he intend, nor
can such meaner things admit to be the
ornaments, either of his Person, or his
House. The great God intends his devoted
peculiar People to be to him <hi>a Crown and
royal Diadem, (Isa. 62. 3.)</hi> when <hi>he puts away
the wicked of the Earth like dross, Psal. 119.
v. 119. In a great house there are not only
Vessels of Silver and Gold, but also of Wood,
and of Earth, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 20. But 'tis only the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56200:11"/>
purged and sanctified soul (which is also
a self-devoted one) that shall be the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
unto honour, being made meet for
the Master's use, and prepared to every
good work, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Persons and things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a sacredness by being devoted to
God. Persons especially, that can and
do devote themselves, are highly ennobled
by it; he hereupon (besides their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
holiness) really more and more san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies
and frames them for his own more
immediate service and communion. Of
such a People he tells us, that he hath form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them for himself, and they shall praise
him; and to them he saith (intending it
manifestly in the more eminent sense)
<hi>Thou art mine, Isa.</hi> 43. 1, 7, 21. Such may
with a modest and humble, but with a
just confidence freely say, <hi>I am thine, save
me—Psal.</hi> 119. 94. In yielding your selves
consider therefore first, that he <hi>is your
Owner</hi> by an unquestionable former right,
and let that effectually move you to do
it with all your hearts. For will you not
give him his own? When you account
duty to your Prince obliges you to <hi>give
to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's, will
you not <hi>give God the things that are God's?</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56200:12"/>
And will you not know him for your
Owner? <hi>The Oxe knows his Owner, Isa.</hi>
1. 3. Or will it satisfie you to be in no
other kind <hi>his,</hi> than brutes and Devils
are, that either through an incapacity of
Nature cannot acknowledge him, or
through a malignity of Nature will not?
O yield your selves, with humble desire
and expectation that he will vouchsafe
<hi>otherwise to own you!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>As your Teacher;</hi> so indeed he also
is to <hi>all men,</hi> tho' they never yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to him. He that <hi>teaches man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
shall not he know? <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 10.
There is a spirit in man, and the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Almighty gives him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
Yea and inferiour creatures,
as they all owe their Natures, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Instincts to him, may be said to have
him for their Teacher too. But will it
content you to be so only taught by
him? There is another sort of Teaching,
which, if you yield your selves to him <hi>as
your great Instructor,</hi> he will vouchsafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. The things you <hi>know not,</hi> and
which it is necessary you should know, <hi>he
will teach you, i. e.</hi> such things as are of
real necessity to your true and final wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56200:12"/>
not which only serve to please your
fancy, or gratifie your curiosity. For his
Teaching respects an appointed, certain
end, suitable to his Wisdom and Mercy,
and to the calamity and danger of your
state. The Teaching requisite for <hi>perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinners,</hi> was, <hi>what they might do to
be saved.</hi> And when we have cast about
in our own thoughts never so much, we
have no way to take but to <hi>yield our
selves to God,</hi> who will then be our most
undeceiving Guide. To whom it belongs
to save us at last, to him only it can belong
to lead us in the way to that blessed end.</p>
            <p>Many anxious Enquiries, and fervent
Disputes there have been, how one may
be infallibly assur'd of the way to be
sav'd. They are to be excus'd who think
it not fit, but upon very plain grounds, to
venture so great a concernment; or to run
so great a hazard in a meer Complement
to any man, or party of men. Confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
as, <hi>My soul for yours,</hi> and such like,
signifie nothing with a cautious consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, except that such as them care as
little for his Soul as their own. The <hi>Papal
Infallibility</hi> some would have us trust to at
a venture, &amp; would make us think it rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56200:13"/>
to doubt it; when no body stands upon
good manners <hi>in endeavouring to escape a
ruine;</hi> when a great part of their own
Communion trust not to it<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. And some
of them have written strongly against it<note n="†" place="margin">Du Pin, &amp;c.</note>.
The accurate stating and discussing of
the Controversie, how far, or in what
sense any such thing as <hi>Infallible Light</hi>
may belong to the Christian Church, are
not fit for this place, nor for a Discourse
of this nature. 'Tis enough now to say
that this claim hereof to the Pope or
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as such,
<list>
                  <item>1. Cannot be prov'd.</item>
                  <item>2. May be plainly disprov'd.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. It cannot be prov'd. For since no
Principles of common Reason are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
sufficient to prove it of any man,
or of him more than another, it must be
prov'd by supernatural Revelation, if at
all. But in the written Word of God
there is no such thing. Pretences from
thence are too vain to be refuted or
mention'd. And if any other Revelation
should be pretended, 'twill be a new, and
as impossible a task to prove the Divinity
of that Revelation, so as to infer upon
the World an obligation to believe it.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56200:13"/>
Nor is it necessary to insist upon this;
because,</p>
            <p>2. It may be plainly disprov'd; for the
same thing cannot be both true and
false. And it sufficiently disproves <hi>such a
man</hi>'s Infallibility, or the impossibility of
his erring, that it can be evidently prov'd
he hath err'd.</p>
            <p>As when he hath determined against
the express Word of Christ, forbidding
them (to take one or two Instances among
many) to drink of the Eucharistical Cup,
whom he hath commanded to drink of
it. Or (to mention a more important
one) when <hi>Believers in Christ,</hi> or <hi>Lovers
of him,</hi> are pronounced damned, who he
hath said shall not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life, and the Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Or when on the other hand pardon
of sin and eternal life are pretended to be
given to such, whom the Evangelical
Law condemns to death.</p>
            <p>When one to whom this priviledge
hath been asserted to belong, hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
against another, to whom upon
the same grounds it must equally belong.
As 'tis well known in the Christian
Church, that Pope might be alledged
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56200:14"/>
against Pope, and one Papal Constitution
against another. Not to insist on what
might be shewn out of their own History,
that the same Pope hath, being so, chang'd
his judgment in a point of Doctrine, and
left us to divine when he was the fallible,
and when the infallible Pope. And again,</p>
            <p>When there have been determinations
against the common uncorrupted senses
of mankind, as that what their sight, and
touch, and tast assures them is Bread, is
said to be the flesh of an humane body.</p>
            <p>For if you cannot be sure of what both
your own, and the sound senses of any
other man would tell you, you can be
sure of nothing at all: You cannot be
sure you see one another, or hear me
speaking to you; nor be sure when you
heard the transforming words, <hi>This is my
Body;</hi> or much less that they were ever
spoken, if you heard them not; or that that
was Bread and not a Stone, or a piece of
Clay that is pretended to be transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
by them. The foundation of all
certainty were upon these terms taken
away from among men on Earth; and
upon the same <hi>common grounds</hi> upon
which it is pretended you ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56200:14"/>
that which is shewn or offered you
to be the flesh of a man, and not bread
any longer, you must believe or judge the
quite contrary, that it is bread still, and
not flesh, and consequently that he is far
from being infallible, but doth actually
err, upon whose authority you are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to believe otherwise.</p>
            <p>And indeed the claimed Infallibility is
by this sufficiently disprov'd, that there
is no imaginable way of proving it. For
if there were any such thing, it must be
<hi>by God's own immediate gift, and vouchsafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
How otherwise should <hi>a man</hi> be
made infallible? And if so, it must be
for an end worthy of a wise and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
God; whereupon for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for which he should have made such
a man infallible, he should have made it
infallibly certain to other men, that he
hath made him so. Whereas there is no
<hi>one point</hi> wherein his infallible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
can be pretended to be necessary,
<hi>against</hi> which there is more to be said
than against the pretence it self of his
Infallibility; Nor <hi>for which,</hi> less is to be
said than can, with any colour, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
highest and most just contempt be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56200:15"/>
said <hi>for it.</hi> The most weighty thing that
I have known alledg'd is, the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency
of an <hi>Infallible Judge.</hi> But if we
will think that a good way of arguing,
that things are <hi>in fact</hi> so or so, because we
can fancy it would be better if they
were; we may as well prove that all
mankind are sincere Christians, or there
is no sin in the World, nor ever was, and
a thousand things besides in the natural
World, that never were, or will be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it appears to us 'twould be for the
better. So much is the follishness of man
wiser than God.</p>
            <p>Besides, that <hi>Sanctity</hi> must be judg'd as
necessary to the final salvation and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the souls of men as <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi>
or <hi>exemption from doctrinal Errour,</hi> by all,
with whom either Christian Religion, or
common Reason signifies any thing. For
the same reason therefore for which it
can be thought necessary God should
have put it into the power of any man
to <hi>make others not err,</hi> he should have put
it equally into his power to <hi>make them
holy,</hi> to renew and change their hearts
and lives. But what man hath this
power? And one would reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56200:15"/>
if <hi>either</hi> were, that <hi>both powers</hi>
should be lodg'd in the <hi>same man;</hi> which
if they should pretend, who assert the
other unto one man, their own Histories
might make them blush, unless they can
think it more probable that he can and
will effectually sanctifie another, and
make him holy, who is himself most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famously
impure and unholy, than that
he can secure another from erring in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Doctrine, who cannot secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>But then it may be said, If such sure
light and guidance is not to be found or
had from one man, it must be from some
community or body of men in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. For, can it be thought God
should have taken care to settle a Religion
in the World, on purpose for the saving
of mens souls, that yet affords no man
any certainty of being saved by it?</p>
            <p>I answer, yes, there is a certain, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Light afforded by it to the whole
body of sincere Christians sufficient, and
intended, not to gratifie a vain humour,
but to save their souls, and which you
can only, and may confidently expect
by <hi>yielding your selves to God as your
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56200:16"/>
Teacher.</hi> As it cannot agree with the
absolute perfection of his Nature to be
himself deceiv'd in any thing, it can, you
may be sure, as little agree with it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you, or let you mistake your way,
in the things wherein he hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
and induc'd you to commit and
entrust your selves to his conduct and
guidance: Will he let a soul wander
and be lost, that hath entirely given up
it self to be led and taught by him? His
Word hath at once exprest to you his
Nature, and his Good-will towards you,
in this case. <hi>Good and upright is the Lord,
therefore will he teach sinners in the way,
Psal.</hi> 25. 8. But what sinners? the next
words tell you, <hi>the meek</hi> (self-resigned
ones, humble, teachable learners) <hi>he will
guide in Judgment,</hi> or with Judgment (as
that particle admits to be read) he will
guide them judiciously, and surely, so
that your hearts need not misgive, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
or doubt to follow; <hi>The meek will
he teach his way, v.</hi> 9. Who would not
wish and be glad to have such a Teacher?
<hi>You shall know</hi> (how express is his Word!)
<hi>if you follow on to know the Lord;</hi> for, <hi>his
going forth is prepared as the morning,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56200:16"/>
Hos.</hi> 6. 3. You do not need to devise in
the morning how to create your own
Light, 'tis prepar'd and ready for you;
the Sun was made before you were, and
it keeps its course, and so constantly will
God's own Light shine to you, without
your contrivance or care, for any thing
but to seek, receive it, and be guided
by it.</p>
            <p>Know your advantage in having such a
Teacher.</p>
            <p>1. He will teach you inwardly; <hi>even
your very hearts,</hi> and so as his Instructions
shall reach the center, the inmost of your
spirits. <hi>God that made light to shine out of
darkness, hath shined into our hearts,</hi> &amp;c.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. And when that holy good
man, had been solacing himself with
highest pleasure in considering this, that
God was his portion, so contentful and
satisfying a one, that he cannot forbear
saying, <hi>The lines are fall'n to me in pleasant
places, and I have a goodly heritage, Psal.</hi>
16. 5, 6. He presently adds, <hi>I will bless
the Lord who hath given me counsel; q. d.</hi>
I should never else have thought of such
a thing: it had never come into my
mind to think of chusing God for my
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56200:17"/>
portion. I should have done like the
rest of the vain World, have follow<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
shadows all my days. <hi>My reins also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
me in the night season.</hi> He will so
teach you, as to make you teach your
selves, put an abiding word into you,
that shall talk with you when you sit in
your houses, and walk by the way, and
when you lie down, and when you rise
up, and whereby you shall be enabled to
commune with your own hearts upon
your beds, while others sleep, and revolve,
or roll over in your minds, dictates of
life. You will not need to say, Who
shall ascend into Heaven, to bring down
Christ from above?<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> Or, Who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
into the deep, to bring Christ again
from the dead?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8.</note> For the Word will be

God will be in your heart, so as none of
your steps shall slide.<note place="margin">Psa. 37. 31.</note> This is our Lord's
own interpretation of divers words of
the Prophets, that in the days of the
more general diffusion of holy, vital, light,
which was to be after his own appearance
in the World, <hi>They shall be all taught of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56200:17"/>
God, John 6. 45. i. e.</hi> so as to have their
hearts inclin'd towards himself, and
drawn to him, as the reference of these
words to those of the foregoing verse
shews. Wherein,</p>
            <p>2. Lies your further advantage, <hi>That
by him you shall be taught effectually.</hi> Other
Teaching, as it doth but reach the ear,
or only, at the most, beget some faint
notions in the mind, that you are little
the better for, <hi>his</hi> shall produce rea
fruit; <hi>He is the Lord your God who
teaches you to profit;</hi> and who by gentle
and unforcible, but by most prevailing
insinuations, shall slide in upon your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
win them by light and love, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
them to a compliance with what
shall be in the end safe and happy for
your selves. He will instruct you, tho'
not with a violent, yet with a <hi>strong
hand,</hi> so as not to lose his kind design.
Others teach you, and leave you what
they found you; convinc't perhaps, but
not chang'd; unable to resist any ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
or your disinclination to that
which was good. <hi>Power</hi> will accompany
his Teaching; a conquering power that
will secretly constrain and captivate your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56200:18"/>
hearts; and how pleasant a Victory
will that be to your selves! O the peace
and joy you will find springing up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, when once you feel your selves
overcome! The most that a man can
say to you is, what the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi>
once said, (so great, and so good a man)
<hi>God forbid I should sin against the Lord in
ceasing to pray for you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 23.</note> 
               <hi>but I will teach you
the good and the right way:</hi> He could only
shew that way, and pray that God would
do the rest; which implies God only can
so teach it you, as to make you walk
in it.</p>
            <p>I am not persuading you to slight hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Teaching; you will need it; and
'tis among the gifts which your glorious
Redeemer <hi>being ascended on high</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to men,<note place="margin">Psal. 68. 18.</note> 
               <hi>viz. Pastors and Teachers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11.</note> But
understand their Teaching to be only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
and Ministerial. <hi>Without,</hi> or
<hi>against</hi> God, you are to call no man Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or Teacher upon Earth.</p>
            <p>And thus far their Teaching is to be
regarded, as it agrees,</p>
            <p>1. With what God doth inwardly
teach you, by that common light which
shines in every man's own bosom, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56200:18"/>
with a sincere mind, attends to it, and
which is too little attended to. There are
<hi>Truths</hi> too commonly <hi>held in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
seated generally in the Minds and
Consciences of men; by which, tho' they
have not another Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>they are a Law to
themselves;</hi> and for the stifling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
whereof, <hi>the wrath of God is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Heaven against them.</hi> And from
such Truths they might infer others, and
where God affords external helps, come
to discern a sure ground whereupon to
understand that what is contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in the frame of Christian Doctrine
is true; being enabled to judge of the
evidences that prove the whole Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof to be from God; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being in it self more evident than
that what he hath revealed is true. And
withal God is graciously pleased to shine
into Minds that with upright aims set
themselves to enquire out and understand
his Mind; and so farther light comes to
be superadded to that which is common.
Now take heed how you neglect what a
man teaches you, agreeably to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
light which is already (one way or
other) in your own Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56200:19"/>
Hither in some part, and in
great part we are to appeal in our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you: So the more early Christian
Teachers did;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Not handling</hi> (say they)
<hi>the Word of God deceitfully, but by manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of the Truth commending our selves
to every man's Conscience in the sight of God.</hi>
In the most deeply fundamental things
that concern your practice every day, we
may appeal to your selves, and your own
Consciences. If we say to you, Ought
you not to live according to his Will that
gave you breath? Should you not above
all things fear and love, and trust and
obey him that made you and all things?
Should you not do as you would be done
unto? Should you not take more care
for your immortal Souls, than for your
mortal flesh? You must every one say, I
believe in mine own Conscience this is
so. If I appeal to you in the very thing I
am speaking of, should you not yield
your selves to God whose Creatures you
are? I doubt not you will any of you
say, I think in my very Conscience I
should. We have you witnesses against
your selves, if you will not hear us in
such things. And again, it being a matter
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56200:19"/>
very capable of plain proof, that those
writings which we call the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
were from God, our Teaching
ought so far to be regarded by you as,</p>
            <p>2. We can manifest to you that it
agrees with the Scriptures. And we
are sure he will never teach you inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against what he hath there taught.
Will the God of Truth say and unsay the
same thing? That were to overthrow the
design of all his Instructions, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Authority which he requires
men to reverence. <hi>No man</hi> could expect
to be regarded on such terms. And by
this Rule freely examine all that we
teach you, as our Saviour directed the
Jews to do, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. And for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, the Apostle commended the
<hi>Berean</hi> Christians, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. And we
have here the same advantage at length,
tho' not so immediately, upon your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
which cannot but judge that
whatsoever is found in that Word which
you confess to be Divine, must be most
certainly true.</p>
            <p>And if within such limits you take the
help of men for your Instruction; having
yielded your selves to God as your su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56200:20"/>
and highest Teacher, you are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
safe terms. Only be sincere in listen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his dictates, whether internal or
external. Let not a prepossest heart, or
vicious inclination be their Interpreter.
<hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of
the Doctrine whether it be of God,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>John</hi> 7. 17.</p>
            <p>3. You must consider God, in your
yielding your selves, as your <hi>Sovereign Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
For to whom you yield your selves ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to obey, his servants you are to whom
you obey;</hi> as by <hi>v.</hi> 16. Tho' Teaching and
Ruling may be diversly conceiv'd of, they
cannot be separate in this case. The nobler
and final part of God's Teaching you, is
teaching you <hi>your duty;</hi> what you are to
<hi>practise and do.</hi> And so when he teaches
you, he commands you too; and leaves
it not arbitrary to you whether you will
be directed by him or no. What is his by
former right, and by after-consent, and
self-resignation, shall it not be govern'd
by him? if it be a subject capable of
Laws and Government, as such consent
shews it to be? Your yielding your selves
to God is not an homage but a mockery,
if you do it not with a resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56200:20"/>
the Law from his mouth: and that
wherein soever he commands, you will
to your uttermost obey. But in this, and
the other things that follow, my limits
constrain me unto more brevity. Only let
not this apprehension of God be frightful,
yea let it be amiable to you, as in it self
it is, and cannot but be to you, if you
consider the loveliness of his Government,
the kind design of it, and how suitable it
is to the kindest design; that it is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
first and principally over minds,
purposely intended to reduce them to an
holy and peaceful order, wherein it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but continue them, when that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
comes to be setled there; which
stands <hi>in righteousness, peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost,</hi> and all the Laws whereof are
summ'd up <hi>in Love;</hi> being such <hi>also as in
the keeping whereof there is great reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. You are to consider him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to yield your self, as your <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Benefactor,</hi> or rather as your <hi>best and
supream good.</hi> Indeed you cannot sever his
being your <hi>Ruler</hi> from his being your
<hi>Benefactor</hi> (more than his being your
Teacher from his being your Ruler) when
the tendency and design of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56200:21"/>
is understood. For it is a very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of our felicity to be under his
Government, and he doth you the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
good by ruling you, when otherwise
nothing is more evident than that you
would run your selves into the greatest
of evil, and soon be most miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
You are now so far happy as you
are subject to his Government, and that
which it aims at is to make you finally
and compleatly happy. For it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his Government, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
your actions, but your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and principally towards himself.
You have been <hi>alienated from the life of
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note> were become strangers to him, yea
and <hi>enemies in your very minds;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>for the
carnal mind is enmity against God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
business of his Government is in the
first place to alter the temper of your
minds;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7. <hi>latter part.</hi>
               </note> for <hi>continuing carnal,</hi> they <hi>neither
are subject to the Law of God, nor can be,</hi>
as the same place tells you. Therefore if
his Government take place in you, and
you <hi>become subject,</hi> you <hi>become spiritual, the
Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> having now the
possession and the power of you. Nor was
it possible he should ever be an <hi>effectual
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56200:21"/>
Benefactor</hi> to you, without being thus an
<hi>over-powering Ruler,</hi> so do these things,
run into one another. To let you have
your own will, and follow your carnal
inclination, and cherish and favour you
in this course, were to gratifie you to
your ruine, and concur with you to your
being for ever miserable: Which you
may see plainly if you will understand
wherein your true felicity and blessedness
must consist, or consider what was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
concerning it, in the proposal of
this <hi>head;</hi> that he is to be your <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi>
in being to you <hi>himself,</hi> your <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and only satisfying Good.</hi> He never
doth you good <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>to purpose,</hi>
till he overcome your <hi>carnal inclination.</hi>
For while that remains, will you ever
mind him? Can you love him? desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him? or delight in him? The first
and most fundamental Law which he
laies upon you is, that <hi>you shall love the
Lord your God with all your heart, and soul,
and mind, and might.</hi> What will become
of you if you cannot obey this Law?
This World will shortly be at an end, and
you must, 'tis like, leave it sooner; you
are undone, if your hearts be not before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56200:22"/>
so framed as that you can savour and
take complacency in a better and higher
Good. You will shortly have nothing
left you but himself; you will be pluckt
away from your Houses, and Lands, and
Friends, and all your outward comforts;
and now in what a case are you, if you
can take no pleasure or satisfaction in
God! You are therefore to yield up
your self to him in full union, as with
your most grateful and delectable Good;
with this sense possessing your Soul,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Whom
have I in Heaven but thee? or whom on
Earth can I desire besides thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you are to look upon God
in your yielding your selves to him.</p>
            <p>You are to yield your selves to his
<hi>Claim</hi> as your rightful Owner.</p>
            <p>To his Instruction, as your undeceiving
Teacher.</p>
            <p>To his Government, as your Gracious,
Sovereign Ruler. And</p>
            <p>To the enjoyment of him, as your best
and most satisfying Good. Or your self-communicating
Benefactor.</p>
            <p>But it also concerns you to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and right thoughts of the state of
your case, and how things are between
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56200:22"/>
him and the Sons of men, that you may
duly apply your selves to him in so great
a transaction. The Gospel under which
you live tells you, he treats with men in
and by a Mediator, his own Son, who
came down into this wretched World of
ours, in great compassion to our miseries,
and took our Nature, was here on Earth
among us an incarnate God. God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in the flesh. Because we were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of flesh and blood, he took part
with us likewise of the same, and in that
Nature of ours died for us, to make way
that we might yield our selves to God,
and be accepted.<note place="margin">John 14. 6.</note> 
               <hi>No man now comes to the
Father but by him.</hi> He must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
with great reverence; and a most
profound homage must be rendered to
him.<note place="margin">1 John 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>He that denieth the Son hath not the
Father.</hi> And it being his pleasure, to treat
with us by his <hi>Son,</hi> and the case requiring
that we apply our selves to him, we are
to take notice of him according to those
capacities wherein Scripture represents
him to us. And it represents him agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to those same notions according to
which we have shewn we are to consider
God the Father in this matter; so as that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56200:23"/>
Christ being the Mediator between him
and us, when we yield our selves to him
ultimately, and finally, under the notions
that have been mention'd, we are first to
yield our selves to his Son, Christ Jesus
our Redeemer, under the like notions. For,</p>
            <p>1. Being to yield our selves to God as
<hi>our Owner,</hi> we must know, the Father hath
<hi>given</hi> all things into <hi>the hands of the Son,
John</hi> 13. 3. and that <hi>He is Lord of all, Acts</hi>
10. 36. which, <hi>in the first sense,</hi> signifies
him to be, by the Father's constitution,
the Owner of all things, even as he is the
<hi>Redeemer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 5.</note> For, <hi>he therefore died and rose
again, that he might be Lord of dead and
living; i. e.</hi> of both Worlds; agreeably to
what he himself speaks immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his resurrection from the dead; <hi>All
power is given to me both in Heaven and
Earth, Matth.</hi> 28. 18.</p>
            <p>2. And for those other notions of God
under which we have shewn, we are to
yield our selves to him, as our Teacher,
Ruler, and Benefactor, they correspond
to that threefold Office of Christ, of
which you cannot but have heard much,
<hi>viz.</hi> of Prophet, King, and Priest, so that
we are to commit our selves to him, when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56200:23"/>
we yield our selves to God, as a Teacher
come forth from God, and who reveals
him to us whom no man hath seen at
any time: As one that must reign over
us, and over the greatest on Earth, <hi>Luke</hi>
19. 14. and 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and
by whom we are to be reconcil'd to
God, and restor'd to the enjoyment of
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>And because our blind minds, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
hearts need light and grace from
above, to direct and encline us hereto,
therefore hath the Spirit of the Father
and the Son a great work to do in us to
this purpose. Whereupon we are to yield
our selves to that blessed Spirit also, as
our enlightner, and sanctifier; which
our being directed to <hi>walk in the Spirit,
Gal.</hi> 5. 25. and our being told that <hi>they
that have not the Spirit of Christ are none
of his, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. and, <hi>that as many as
are the Sons of God, are led by his Spirit,
v.</hi> 14. do plainly shew.</p>
            <p>You see then we are to yield our selves
to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
which also our having those great names,
nam'd upon us in our Baptism (as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told you) doth import.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56200:24"/>
And how necessary all this is, you will
see, if</p>
            <p>2. We consider how we are to look
upon <hi>our selves</hi> in this transaction; <hi>i. e.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We are to consider our selves as
God's creatures, being, as you have
heard, to consider him as our Creator;
and so we must reckon we owe our
selves to him, and do but yield him what
we owe, and what was his before. For,
how can you but be <hi>his,</hi> who of his meer
pleasure hath rais'd you out of nothing?</p>
            <p>2. We must remember we have been
<hi>apostate creatures,</hi> such as had faln, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from him; and so our yielding
our selves to him, is a giving our selves
back to him, having injuriously with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
and with-held our selves from
him before. And because the injury was
so great as we could never make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for, therefore it was necessary
such a Mediator should be appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us, for whose sake only
we can expect to be accepted when we
yield our selves. So great a Majesty was
not to be approacht by offending crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
without so great a Days-man, and
Peace-maker.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56200:24"/>
3. We must consider our selves as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
and every way unfit for the Divine
Presence, Service, and Converse, and who
did therefore need the power of the Holy
Ghost to be put forth upon us to make us
fit; and that therefore our case required
we should put our selves into such hands
for that purpose.</p>
            <p>4. We are to consider our selves <hi>as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel, as sinners invited and call'd
back to God;</hi> as such whose case is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate;
or who need to abandon our
selves to ruine, tho' we have greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
as if there were no hope. We are
to consider our selves with distinction
from the condition of other faln crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The Angels that fell and kept not
their first station, have no Gospel sent to
them to invite them back, and persuade
them again to yield themselves to God;
you have. Into what a transport should this
thought put you! how should it mollifie
you! oh what a yielding temper and
disposition of spirit should it work in you
towards this gracious call, and just chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
which the great God now gives
you, and makes unto you!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56200:25"/>
Thus far then you see how you are to
consider God and your selves in this your
yielding your selves to him.<note place="margin">Second Sermon.</note> You are now
next to consider,</p>
            <p>2. What your yielding your selves to
God according to such considerations
must include, or be accompanied with.
For it is not reasonable to think you have
no more to mind in this matter, than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what is contained in the bare abstract
nature of such an act; but looking upon
your case in its circumstances, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the state of things between God
and you, it greatly concerns you to see
to it, that the matter be suitably carried
to this state of your case. Whereupon,</p>
            <p>1. Your yielding your selves to God
must be accompani'd with very deep and
serious repentance. 'Tis a most penitential
surrender you are now to make of your
selves to him; for you are to remember
that you are but now coming back out
of a state of Apostacy from your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and most rightful Lord. Yea tho'
you are but renewing your surrender of
your selves, having done somewhat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
before, you are yet to consider this
<hi>was</hi> your case; and perhaps some never
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56200:25"/>
have yet seriously thought of any such
thing, but liv'd in this World hitherto as
if you were your own, and there were no
Lord over you: O then with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
remorse, with what brokenness of
heart, with what relentings and self-accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
should this thing now be done! you
should come, smiting upon the thigh, and
saying within your selves, What have I
done? So long Lord, have I liv'd in this
World of thine, which thou mad'st,
and not I, as if I might do in it, and with
my self, what I pleas'd? I have usurpt
upon thy unquestionable right in me,
have liv'd to my self, and not to thee; I
am now convinced this was a very undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
unlawful way of living. Let him
hear you (as he once heard <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or
shall do) <hi>bemoaning your selves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 31. 18, 19.</note> and saying,
<hi>Turn me and I shall be turned, thou art the
Lord my God,</hi> &amp;c. How can you think of
yielding your selves now at length to
God, without being deeply sensible of
your having deferr'd it so long, and that
you have not done it sooner? and how
great the iniquity was of your former
course? that you have all this while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a continual robbery upon him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56200:26"/>
that gave you breath. <hi>Will a man rob God?</hi>
And if you say, <hi>Wherein have I robbed
him?</hi> you have <hi>rob'd him of your self,</hi> a
greater thing than of <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Offerings.</hi>
And this robbery was sacriledge. For
every thing due and devoted to God,
hath a sacredness upon it; and consider,
were you not, upon his just claim, in your
Baptism devoted to him? how should this
startle you? you have constantly aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from him a sacred thing! You
have been in a continual contest with
him about one of the highest rights of
his Sovereignty, yea and of his Godhead,
for <hi>to that,</hi> nothing is more peculiar, than
to be <hi>Lord of all.</hi> So that the controversy
between him and you hath been, <hi>who
shall be God?</hi> You have refus'd him his
own creature; How high a crime was
this? Know then you have been a great
transgressor, a grievous revolter, and now
therefore yield your self to him with a
melting broken heart, or you do nothing.</p>
            <p>2. It must be done with <hi>great delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
not as the meer effect of a sudden
fright. What is done in a rash haste, may
be as soon undone. Leisurely consider,
and take the whole compass of the case;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56200:26"/>
weigh with your selves the mentioned
grounds upon which you are to yield
your selves, and the ends you are to do
it for, that things may be set right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and you, that you may return
into your own natural place and station,
that you may be again stated in that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to your Sovereign Lord which
fitly belongs to you; that he may have
his right which he claims, and you the
mercy which you need. Here is place for
much consideration. And when <hi>Israel</hi> is
complain'd of as less willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God for his Owner and Master, than
the Oxe and Ass were to acknowledge
theirs, all is resolved into this, that the
people <hi>did not consider, Isa.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>3. It must be done <hi>with Judgment,</hi>
which is the effect of such consideration.
When all things have been well weigh'd
that belong to this case, then let this
formed Judgment pass, <hi>Lord, I ought to be
thine, and no others.</hi> Say to him hereupon,
with a convinced Judgment and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
O God, I surrender my self, as now
seeing none hath that right in me that
thou hast; when the Love of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
constraining upon Souls, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56200:27"/>
they <hi>thus judge,</hi> that <hi>they ought no
longer to live to themselves, but to him,</hi> &amp;c.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. 15. These things last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
will imply a rectifi'd mind, which
must be ingredient into this transaction,
else it will be defective throughout.</p>
            <p>4. It must be done with a <hi>fulness of
Consent;</hi> and herein it chiefly consists,
when the Soul says, Lord, I am now most
entirely willing to be thine: This <hi>is</hi> your
<hi>yielding your selves.</hi> And hereby the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is struck between God and you;
which consists in the expressed Consent of
the parties covenanting in the matters
about which the Covenant is. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is about the Parties themselves, who
covenant, as the Conjugal Covenant is,
which resembles it; <hi>viz.</hi> that they shall be
one anothers. God hath exprest his consent
in his Word and Gospel, making therein
the first overture to you. When you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
your own consent, the thing is done:
This being the sum of his Covenant, <hi>I
will be your God, and you shall be my People,</hi>
as in many places of Scripture it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up. When therefore, as God hath
openly testified his willingness to be their
God who shall accept, and take him to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56200:27"/>
so, you also are willing, and do consent
too, you do now <hi>take hold on his Covenant,</hi>
matters are agreed between him and you;
and you may take those words as spoken
to you particularly; <hi>I have entred into
Covenant with thee, and thou art become
mine, Ezek.</hi> 16. 8.</p>
            <p>But then you must take notice that this
is to be done with a <hi>full</hi> consent, which
that is said to be which determines you,
tho' it be not absolutely perfect. No grace
in any faculty is perfect in this life. But
as in <hi>humane affairs,</hi> that <hi>will</hi> is said to be
<hi>full,</hi> which is the spring of answerable
following actions, so it is here. If a man
have some inclination to do this or that,
and do it not, it goes for nothing; if he
do it, his will is said to be full, tho' he
have some remaining disinclination. You
may be said to yield your selves to God,
with a full consent, when you live after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as one devoted to him.</p>
            <p>5. Your yielding your selves to God
<hi>must carry life in it,</hi> as the following words
signifie; <hi>Yield your selves to God as those
that are alive from the dead.</hi> It must be a
<hi>vital act,</hi> and have vigour in it. You must
be capable of making that true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56200:28"/>
of your case, as 'tis <hi>v. 11. of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly that you are dead to sin, but alive to
God through Jesus Christ.</hi> Do it as feeling
life to spring in your souls towards God
in your yielding your selves to him.
What! will you offer God a carcass?
not the <hi>living Sacrifice,</hi> which you see is
required, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. Beg earnestly for
his own Spirit of life and power, that
may enable you to offer up a living Soul
to the living God.</p>
            <p>6. There must be <hi>Faith in your yielding
your selves.</hi> For it is a <hi>committing,</hi> or <hi>entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
your selves to God, with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being sav'd, and made happy by
him. So Scripture speaks of it, 2 <hi>Tim.
2. 12. I know whom I have believed</hi> (or
trusted) <hi>and that he is able to keep what I
have committed to him against that day.</hi> 'Tis
suitable to the gracious nature of God,
to his excellent greatness, to his design,
to the Mediatorship of his Son, to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and Gospel-Covenant, and to your
own necessities, and the exigency of
your own lost, undone state, that you so
yield your selves to him, as a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ready to perish, expecting, not for
your sake, but his own, to be accepted,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56200:28"/>
and to find mercy with him. You do
him the honour which he seeks, and
which is most worthy of a God, the
most excellent, and a self-sufficient Being,
when you do thus. You answer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of the whole Gospel-constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which bears this Inscription, <hi>To the
praise of the glory of his grace,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to him when you take his
Word, that they that believe in his Son,
shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
You herein set to your Seal that he is
true, and the more fully, and with the
more significancy, when upon the credit
of it you yield your selves, with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that he will not destroy or reject a
poor creature that yields to him, and
casts its self upon his mercy.</p>
            <p>7. Another Ingredient into this yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your selves must be <hi>Love.</hi> As <hi>Faith,</hi>
in your yielding your selves to God, aims
at <hi>your own welfare</hi> and salvation; so
<hi>Love,</hi> in doing it, intends <hi>his service,</hi> and
all the duty to him you are capable of
doing him. You must be able to give
this as the true reason of your act, and
to resolve it into this Principle; I yield
my self to God, because I love him, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56200:29"/>
from the unfeigned love I bear to him;
to tell the World; if there were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he hath captivated my heart with
his Excellencies and his Love, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
having nothing else, I tender my
self to him, to tell himself, <q>
                  <hi>Lord, thou
knowest all things, thou knowest that I
love thee;</hi> and because I do, I present
my self to thee; 'tis all I can do. I wish
my self ten thousand times better for
thy blessed sake; and if I had in me
all the Excellencies of many thousand
Angels, I were too mean a thing, and
such as nothing but thy own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
could count worthy thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance;
because I love thee, I covet
to be near thee, I covet to be thine,
I covet to lead my life with thee,
to dwell in thy presence; far be
it from me to be as without thee in
the World as heretofore. I love thee,
O Lord, my strength, because thine own
perfections highly deserve it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast heard my voice, and
hast delivered my Soul from death,
mine Eyes from tears, and my Feet from
falling, and I yield my self to thee,
because I love thee. I make an offer of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56200:29"/>
my self to be thy servant, thy servant, O
Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds; and
now I desire to bind my self in new
ones to thee, that are never to be loosed.</q>
And you can make no doubt but that
it ought to be done therefore with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and a temper suitable to the
<hi>state</hi> you are now willing to come into,
that of a <hi>devoted Servant; viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>With great reverence and humility.</hi>
For, consider to whom you are tendering
your self; to the <hi>high and lofty One that
inhabiteth Eternity:</hi> To him that hath
<hi>Heaven for his Throne, and Earth for his
Footstool;</hi> and in comparison of whom
all the inhabitants of the World are but
<hi>as Grashoppers,</hi> and the <hi>Nations of the
Earth as the drop of a bucket, and the dust of
the Balance,</hi> &amp;c. Yea to him against whom
you have sinn'd, and before whose pure
eyes, you cannot, <hi>in your self,</hi> but appear
most offensively impure; so that you have
reason to be ashamed and blush to lift up
your eyes before him.</p>
            <p>9. And yet it surely ought to be <hi>with
great joy and gladness of heart,</hi> that he
hath exprest himself willing to accept
such as you, and that he hath made you
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56200:30"/>
willing to yield your selves. The very
thought should make your heart leap
and spring within you, that he should
ever have bespoken such as we are to
yield our selves to him! when he might
have neglected us, and let us wander
endlesly, without ever looking after us
more. How should it glad your hearts
this day, to have such a message brought
you from the great God, and which you
find is written in his own Word, to yield
your selves to him! Should not your
hearts answer with wonder; <q>And blessed
Lord! Art thou willing again to have
to do with us! who left thee having
no cause, and who returning can be of
no use to thee!</q> O blessed be God that
we may yield our selves back unto him!
that we are invited and encourag'd to
it. And you have cause to bless God,
and rejoyce, if this day you feel your
heart willing to yield your selves to him,
and become his. Do you indeed find
your selves willing?<note place="margin">Psa. 110. 3.</note> You <hi>are willing in
the day of his power.</hi> This is the day of
his power upon your hearts. Many are
<hi>call'd and refuse;</hi> he <hi>often stretches out his
hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and no man regards.</hi> Perhaps you
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56200:30"/>
have been call'd upon often before this
day to do this same thing, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, had no heart to it; and he might
have said to you; Now I will never
treat with you more; if you should
call, I will not hear; if you stretch
out your hands, I will not regard it,
but laugh at your destruction, and mock
when your fear cometh. But if now
he is pleased to call once more, your
hearts do answer; Lord, here we are, we
are now ready to surrender our selves;
you may conclude he hath <hi>poured out his
Spirit upon you:</hi> The Spirit of the Lord
is now moving upon this Assembly, this
is indeed a joyful day,<note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> the day which he
hath himself made, and you ought to
rejoyce and be glad in it. When the
people in <hi>David</hi>'s days offered of their
substance to God for the service of his
house, 'tis said, <hi>The people rejoyced for
that they offered willingly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 9.</note> And <hi>David,</hi>
we are told, <hi>blessed God before all the
Congregation</hi>—saying, <hi>Thine, O Lord, is
the greatness and the power—But who am
I, and what is my people, that we should
be able to offer so willingly after this sort?
for all things come of thee, and of thine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56200:31"/>
own have we given thee.</hi> If you are this
day willing to offer <hi>your selves,</hi> how
much is this a greater thing! and it
<hi>comes of him,</hi> and <hi>'tis of his own</hi> you
are now giving him; for he had a
most unquestionable right in you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">See the Treatise of <hi>Self-dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> from p. 71. to 103.</note>
            </p>
            <p>10. <hi>You should do it with solemnity.</hi>
For, have you ever had a business of
greater importance to transact in all
your days? If you were to dispose of
an <hi>Estate,</hi> or a <hi>Child,</hi> would you not
have all things be as express, and clear,
as may be? and would not they insist to
have it so, with whom you deal in any
such affair? And is there not a solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
belonging to all such transactions?
especially if you were to dispose of
<hi>your self;</hi> as in the Conjugal Covenant?
tho' that is to be but for this short un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
time of life; so as that the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you enter into to day, may be by
death dissolv'd and broken off again to
morrow: How much more explicit,
clear, and solemn, should this your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
with God in Christ be?
wherein you are to make over <hi>your Soul</hi>
to him? and <hi>for eternity.</hi> You are to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56200:31"/>
become his, under the bond of an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant.</hi> You are entring a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
never to be broken off. This God
is to be your God for ever and ever,
and upon the same terms you are to be
his. Is your Immortal Soul of less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with you than the temporal
concernments of a mortal Child, that
you are placing out but for a term of
years that soon expires? yea or than a
piece of Ground, or an Horse, or a Sheep,
about which how punctual and express
are your Bargains and Contracts wont
to be? Or are only the matters of your
Soul, and wherein you have to do with
the great God, to be slightly managed?
or to be huddled up in confusion? or to
be slid over in silent intimations? 'Tis
true, that so express and solemn dealing
in yielding and giving up your selves to
God, is not needful on his part, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
sincerity without any expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of yours; but 'tis needful on your
part, that a deep and lasting impression
may be made upon your Spirits; which
if you be sincere, you will not only feel
your selves to need, but your own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and inclination will prompt you to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56200:32"/>
it; accounting you can never be under
bonds strong and sure enough to him:
You will not only apprehend necessity,
but will relish and tast pleasure in any
such transaction with the blessed God,
in avouching him to be your God, and
your self to be his. The more solemn
it is, the more grateful it will be to
you.</p>
            <p>Do so then; Fall before his Throne;
Prostrate your self at his footstool; and
having chosen your fit season, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may interrupt you; and having
shut up your self with him, pour out
your Soul to him; tell him you are now
come on purpose, to offer your selves
to him as his own. O that you would
not let this night pass without doing
so! Tell him you have too long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
him, and forgotten to whom you
belong'd; humbly beseech him for his
pardon, and that he will now accept of
you, for your Redeemer's sake, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through his grace resolv'd never to
live so great a stranger to him, or be
such a wanderer from him more. And
when you have done so, remember the
time; let it be with you a noted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56200:32"/>
day, as you would be sure to
keep the day in memory when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
such a ones Servant or Tenant,
or your Marriage-day: Renew this your
agreement with God often, but forget
it never.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some may say, But what
needs all this? were we not once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
and given up to God in Baptism?
and is not that sufficient? To what
purpose should we do again a thing
that hath once been so solemnly done?</p>
            <p>But here I desire you to consider, Are
you never to become the Lords by your
own choice? Are you always to be
Christians, only by another's Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
not by your own? And again,
Have you not broken your Baptismal
Vow? have you not forgot it for the
most part ever since? I am afraid too
many never think of any such matter
at all, that ever they were devoted to
God by others, but only upon such an
occasion as this, to make it an excuse
that they may never do such a thing
themselves. And consider, were these
Christian <hi>Romans</hi> on whom the Apostle
presses this duty never Baptiz'd, think
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56200:33"/>
you? Read over the foregoing part of
the Chapter, wherein you find him put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in mind that they had been
<hi>baptiz'd into Christs death,</hi> and <hi>buried
with him in baptism,</hi> and that therefore
this was to be an argument to them
why they <hi>should yield themselves to God;</hi>
not why they should not.</p>
            <p>Wherefore our way is now plain and
open to what we have further to do,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To apply this practical Doctrine,
and press the Precept further upon you,
which hath been open'd to you, and
prest by parts in some measure alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in our insisting on the several heads,
which you have seen do belong to it;
and are one way or other comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it. Which will therefore make
this latter part of our work the shorter,
and capable of being dispatch't in the
fewer words; and with blessed effect,
if the Spirit of the living God shall
vouchsafe to co-operate, and deal with
your hearts and mine. Shall we then
all agree upon this thing? Shall we
unite in one resolution, <hi>We will be the
Lords?</hi> Shall every one say in his own
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56200:33"/>
heart, For my part, I will, and so will
I, and so will I? Come now, <hi>one and
all.</hi> This is no unlawful confederacy,
'tis a blessed combination! <hi>Come then,
let us join our selves to the Lord in a
perpetual Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 50. 5.</note> 
               <hi>not to be forgotten.</hi>
With whatsoever after-solemnity, you
may renew this Obligation, and Bond
of God upon your Souls, as I hope you
will do it, every one apart, in your
Closets, or in any corner, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it too fully, or too often; yet
let us now all <hi>resolve the thing; and
this assembly make a joint-surrender, and
oblation of it self to the great God our
Soveraign rightful Lord, through our blessed
Redeemer and Mediator, by the Eternal
Spirit,</hi> (which I hope is breathing and
at work among us,) <hi>as one liuing sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as all of us, alive from the dead,
to be for ever sacred to him?</hi> O blessed
Assembly! O happy act and deed! With
how grateful and well-pleasing an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
will the kindness and dutifulness
of this Offering ascend, and be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above! God will accept, Heaven
will rejoice, Angels will concur, and
gladly fall in with us. We hereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56200:34"/>
our selves in relation, and in heart
and spirit, to the <hi>general Assembly, to the
Church of the First-born Ones written in
Heaven, to the innumerable Company of
Angels, and to the Spirits of just men
made perfect,</hi> and within a little while
shall be actually among them. Is it
possible there should be now among us
any dissenting Vote? Consider,</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis a plain and unquestionable
thing you are prest unto: A thing that
admits of no dispute, and against which
you have nothing to say, and about
which you cannot but be already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't.
And 'tis a matter full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and upon which tremendous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
depend, to go on in any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
or in any neglect, against a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Judgment and Conscience.
For your own Heart and Conscience
must <hi>condemn</hi> you if you consider, and
it <hi>betrays</hi> you if you consider not. How
fearful a thing is it for a man to carry
his own Doom in his own Bosom! to
go up and down the World with a
Self-condemning Heart, if it be awake,
and which if it be not, yet cannot sleep
always, and must awake with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56200:34"/>
terror at length. And in so plain
case 'tis most certainly Gods Deputy,
and speaks his Mind; <hi>If our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>God is greater than our hearts,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis that therefore the refusal
whereof none of you would avow. Who
among us can have the confidence to
stand forth and say, <hi>I will be none of the
Lords?</hi> Would any man be content to
go with this writ upon his Forehead
from day to day? And doth not that
signifie such a refusal to be a shameful
thing? That must needs be an ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Mind which one would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
any one should know.</p>
            <p>3. And 'tis a <hi>mean thing</hi> to dissemble,
to be willing to be thought, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what we are not, or to do what
in truth we do not.</p>
            <p>4. And considering what inspection
we are under, <hi>'tis a vain thing.</hi> For
do we not know that <hi>eyes which are as
a flame of fire,</hi> behold us, and pierce
into our very Souls? Do we not know
<hi>all things in us are naked and manifest
to him with whom we have to do?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> And
that he discerns it, if there be any heart
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56200:35"/>
among us that is not sincere in this
thing?</p>
            <p>5. Consider that this is the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Gospel you live under. What
doth it signifie or intend, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Apostate Creatures back again to
God? What is the Christian Religion
you profess, but a State of devotedness
to God, under the conduct, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the mediation of Christ? You
frustrate the Gospel, and make your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
a nullity, and an empty name till
you do this.</p>
            <p>6. And how will you lift up your
heads at last in the great day? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this <hi>God the judge of all?</hi> You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now plead ignorance. If perhaps
any among you have not been formerly
so expresly call'd, and urg'd to this
yielding your selves to God; now you
are: and from his own plain Word 'tis
chargd upon you. Will not this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
hereafter? What will you
say when the great God whose Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you are, speaks to you with the
<hi>voice of Thunder,</hi> and bids you gird up
<hi>your Loins,</hi> and give him an answer?
<q>Were you not on such a day, in such
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56200:35"/>
a place demanded and claim'd in my
Name? Were you not told, were
you not convinc't you ought to yield
your selves to me, and yet you did
it not? Are you prepar'd to contest
with your Maker? Where is your right,
where is your power, to stand against
me in this contest?</q>
            </p>
            <p>7. But if you sincerely yield your selves,
the main Controversie is at end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Great God and you. All
your former sins are pardon'd and done
away at once. Those glad-tydings you
have often heard that import nothing
but <hi>glory to God in the highest, peace on
earth, and good will towards men,</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew that the Great God whom you
had offended, hath no design to destroy
you, but only to make you yield, and
give him back his own. Though you
have formerly liv'd a wandering life,
and been as a Vagabond on the Earth
from your true Owner, it will be all
forgotten. How readily was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turining
Prodigal receiv'd! and so will
you. How quiet rest will you have
this night, when upon such terms there
is a reconciliation between God and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56200:36"/>
you! You have given him his own,
and he is pleas'd, and most of all for
this that he hath you now to save you.
You were his to destroy before, now
you are his to save. He could easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
you against your will, but 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with your will, he having made you
willing, that he must save you. And
his bidding you yield, implies his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to do so. O how much of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is there in this invitation to you to
yield your selves to God! consider it as
the voice of Grace. Will he that bids
a poor wretch yield it self, reject or
destroy when it doth so?</p>
            <p>8. And how happily may you now
live the rest of your days in this World.
You will live under his care, for will he
not take care of his own, those that are
of his own House? An Infidel would.
You are now of his Family, under his
immediate Government, and under his
continual Blessing.</p>
            <p>And were you now to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
where you have been to day, and
what you have been doing: If you say,
you have been engag'd this day in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
treaty with the Lord of Heaven
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56200:36"/>
and Earth, <hi>about yielding your selves to him:</hi>
And it be further askt; Well, and what
was the issue? Have you agreed? Must
you, any of you be oblig'd by the truth
of the case to say, No; astonishing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer!
What! Hast thou been treating
with the Great God, the God of thy
life, and not agreed? What, man! Did
he demand of thee any unreasonable
thing? Only to yield my self. Why
that was in all the World the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
thing. Wretched Creature, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now wilt thou go? What wilt thou
do with thy self? Where wilt thou lay
thy hated head? But if you can say,
Blessed be God I gladly agreed to the
Proposal: He gave me the Grace not to
deny him: Then may it be said this
was a good days work, and you will
have cause to bless God for this day as
long as you have a day to live.</p>
