            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49451:3"/>
Idle People in City and Countrey; the great, and 'tis fear'd, irrecoverable decay of our Ancient Trade for Woollen Cloth; the vaſt Charge we are yearly at in purchaſing Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from other Nations, whereby our Treaſure is exhauſted, and our Lands fall for want of being improved ſome other way, beſides planting Corn, breeding for Wool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which are become of ſo low a price, as ſcarce to turn to Account: And underſtanding, that for remedying thereof, the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Manufactory of Linnen is now under Debate, I have taken the boldneſs to Offer the following PROPOSAL, which if thought fit to be put in practice, will (in my opinion) infallibly conduce to all the good Ends deſired and intended; <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That there may be Erected in every County according to its Extent or Populouſneſs, a greater or leſſer Working-Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſe, <hi>wherein the Poor may be continually employed in the Manufactory of</hi> Linnen Cloth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Advantages whereof are evident; For,
<list>
                  <item>I. This Manufactory is an Employment for the weakeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not capable of ſtronger Work, <hi>viz.</hi> Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and decrepit or aged people, now the moſt chargeable; as likewiſe for Beggars and Vagrants, who live idly, and by the ſweat of other mens Labours, and can no way ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually be brought to Induſtry and Order, as when reduced into ſo narrow a Compaſs or Conſinement under fitly qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rulers, Officers, and Regular Government.</item>
                  <item>II. Theſe Working-Alms-Houſes may raiſe and ſupply the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yearly with a ſufficient Stock of Linnen Cloth (the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſort excepted) if true meaſures be taken, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign effectually proſecuted; As for example, 1352000 pounds worth of Cloth may yearly be ſpun in; them only, beſides what is made in private Families—Thus demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated;</item>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49451:3"/>
                  <item>1. 'Tis well known by experience, that three quarters of a Pound of Thread worth 12<hi>d. per</hi> Pound ſpinning, will make one Ell of Cloth worth 2 <hi>s. per</hi> Ell; which Three quarters of a Pound two Spinners may ſpin in one day; Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</item>
                  <item>2. That 2000 Spinners will ſpin Thread enough in one day to make 1000 Ells of Cloth, worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> And working but 260 days in the year, may ſpin 26000 Pounds worth of Linnen Cloth in a year.</item>
                  <item>3. Suppoſe then there be as many publick Work-houſes, as there are Counties, which are 52, and in every Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, one with another, 2000 Spinners (though in ſome more, ſome leſs) then according to theſe reaſonable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, there will be the forementioned Sum of 1352000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Cloth ſpun in one year; which is what we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to demonſtrate.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This or ſome ſuch prodigious Sum of Money might yearly be raiſed to the Nation, whereby a Treble Benefit would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, Firſt, we might ſave ſo much Money now yearly ſent out of the Nation for Linnen, which, as computed by very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Intelligent perſons, has of late coſt us more than a Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>per Annum.</hi> Secondly, By employing thoſe hands, which for the greateſt part are idle, it being reaſonably ſuppoſed that there are at leaſt 100000 Beggars or others who want a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Employment. Beſides, almoſt all both Men, Women and Children that can but pull Tire or Tow from the Diſtaff, or ſuch eaſie work, may be ſpeedily employed and removed from being chargeable; ſo that there will be no fear of any Pariſh in the Kingdom being oppreſſed, or indeed charged, ſave only in caſe of extream Age, or Children in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, neither of which continues long. And Thirdly, Much Land throughout <hi>England</hi> will be greatly improved by ſowing Hemp, Flax,<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49451:4"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It may be objected, <hi>That if the Houſe ſtockt with ſo many weak, ancient people and Children, this will croſs the great Deſign, becauſe they will not be capable to ſpin their quantity of Cloth, nor ſo finc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to Fineneſs, it matters not, if but one in five be employed in it to an exquiſite degree; for there is enough occaſion for courſer, for Sacking, Sails, Ticking, Common Table-Linnen, Sheets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to Quantity, it may not be the leſs, becauſe the moſt laborious thing in Spinning is turning of the Wheel.</p>
            <p>Now for the better effecting a Deſign ſo profitable and honourable to the Kingdom, I have improved my ſmall Genius to the utmoſt, notwithſtanding I above all Projectors, have been moſt diſcouraged: And I know whoever will attempt any thing for publick Benefit, may expect theſe Three things. (The firſt is Neceſſary, the ſecond Cuſtomary, and the third Diabolical) <hi>viz.</hi> To be the Object of wiſe mens Cenſure, other mens Laughter, and if advantagious to himſelf, Envies implacable diſpleaſure; of which laſt, I have had ſhare to the higheſt degree that Revenge could expreſs; and this too from a pretended loving Brother, a perſon of an honeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and of as debauched a Conſcience; yet I ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch diſcouragements, I have ſpent ſome time for Publick Advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> To find out an Expedient both for Eaſe and quick Diſpatch, ſo as that the weak may do as much as the ſtrong, and the ſtrong much more than before.</p>
            <p>As thus; One man may turn 50 Spinning Wheels, which ſhall ſerve 100 perſons to Spin with at once; ſo that the Spinners ſhall have nothing to do but employ both hands to draw Tire from the Diſtaff. The Demonſtration of the In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fallibility of this Invention may be eaſily made when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>As alſo, An Engine by which 50 men may, without ſtriking a ſtroke, beat as much Hemp in one day, as 100 ſhall do in two days,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49451:4"/>Beſides the Advantage of this Spinning Engine in Eaſe, Its expedition will alſo be conſiderable; For if (as we doubt not) by this help Spinners can earn 9 <hi>d. per</hi> day, as eaſie as 6 <hi>d. per</hi> day without: By that means compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only 1000 Spinners in each of the 52 Work-houſes, in one years time will be gained the Sum of 163968 Pounds and upwards, as by Calculation appears; and the Invention for Hemp-beating (which is the hardeſt work of all) will likewiſe in its kind be very conſiderably advantagious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 2.</hi> But ſome will be ready to object, and tell us<hi>, That we talk of brave things, if words would do the Work; but where's the Money for the Building of ſuch great Hoſpitals? and providing all Tools and Materials will coſt many Thouſand Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs here's the Knot, which ſeems knit by Magick Art; but if it can be untied without cutting or breaking the Thread, then I hope our Propoſals will not be rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this therefore I humbly Anſwer, That it may be done by a County-Charge, with as much Satisfaction, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Advantage, as to part with 5 <hi>l.</hi> to prevent paying 50 <hi>s. per An.</hi> which I think no wiſe people will judge to be an hard Bargain; eſpecially if they conſider the other vaſt profit to the Nation, and that thereby they purchaſe (in the Country) 50 <hi>s. per Annum</hi> more by improvement of their Lands for Hemp or Flax.—As thus;</p>
            <p>Suppoſe every Pariſh, one with another, throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, relieves as many poor People, Beggars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as doth amount to 12 <hi>d.</hi> in the Pound, ſo that every 100 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> pays 5 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to the poor; Now if every 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> towards Building ſuch Hoſpital, then whereas more than half their poor conſiſts of Children, Women, and decrepit weak perſons, unfit for any other Employment, but ſuch as may fitly be removed to this Hoſpital; it follows, more than half their Charge will for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49451:5"/>
the future be abated; yea, many Pariſhes have ſcarce any poor to provide for.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as for raiſing Money, we will take our meaſures thus; In <hi>England</hi> there are commonly accounted 9725 Pariſhes, and 52 Counties; ſo that one with another, there are 187 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes to each County, and each Pariſh ſuppoſed to be worth 1500 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> (ſome more, ſome leſs) at the Rate of 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound, it will amount to the Sum of 14025 <hi>l.</hi> in each County, which undoubtedly will compleat the Houſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials.</p>
            <p>Obj.<hi>3. But this Method will not hold, becauſe one County hath not ſo many Parishes aſ another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It matters not; Let each County build proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their Money as it will ariſe at 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound, we doubt not but it will be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 4.</hi> It may further be Objected as impoſſible, <hi>That the Spinning Engine ſhould turn to account, becauſe as oft as one Spinner has occaſion to stop, all the reſt muſt be idle; and again, ſince every Wheel hath its motion alike, and ſeveral Spinners work ſome faſter, ſome ſlower, therefore all conſidered, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will make but a Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I reply; Any one may ſtop, and the reſt work on, and alſo may vary the motion of each Spinning Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as the nimbleſt and the ſloweſt may have their deſire: Nor may theſe Inſtruments be contemned, ſince they are as cheap as the other, and ſo ordered that the Spinners may ſit or ſtand when they pleaſe; which doubtleſs will be a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</p>
            <p>The Invention of theſe Engines is wholly mine, and if they prove effectual, I hope I ſhall not be deprived of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome benefit thereof; becauſe I am ſo free, as in effect to diſcover it beforehand. However, I ſubmit to what the Pleaſure of Authority ſhall allow: And to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49451:5"/>

            <p n="2">2.

them out with a Brand to commit freſh Villanies, or tranſport them, whence they preſently return: And this the rather to be heeded, for that Foreign Plantatious have now ſo little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for them, that Merchants refuſe to take them off the She riffes hands, without being paid for their Paſſage; ſo that above 80 Convicts in <hi>Newgate</hi> lately obtained a General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon on that very ſcore, becauſe they knew not what to do with them: Beſides, how many overſtockt Trades are there that complain for want of Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe may quickly learn to weave, and never fear an employ.</p>

               <hi>Obj.</hi>8. There ſtill remains one Objection; and that is, <hi>What ſhall we do for Hemp And Flax?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer, That Hemp or Flax (one or the other) may plentifully be had in every County of <hi>England</hi>: Take <hi>Suſſex</hi> as an example; any indifferent good Land, Chalky, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the foot of the <hi>Downes</hi> to the Sea-ſide, with double Folding or Dunging, and twice Plowing, will produce Hemp in abundance; yet though their Land be rich enough, dry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will not produce good Flax: But to ſupply that, many Thouſand Acres of the <hi>Wild</hi> of <hi>Suffex</hi> will produce Crops of Flax, worth ſome four, ſome five, ſome ſix Pounds an Acre, and that kind for Hemp, as aforeſaid, worth as much. Beſides, for encouraging the Planting the ſame at home, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to lay an Impoſition of Four or Five Shillings in the Pound, or upwards, upon all Hemp, Thread, Cordage, or Linnen Imported from Foreign parts; by means whereof, we may raiſe it at home cheaper than buy them abroad, and then everybody will Plant Hemp and Flax abundantly, as a thing of courſe, enriching thoſe that promote it.</p>
            <p>But why 4 or 5 Counties ſhould (as ſome have propoſed) enjoy this great Wealth and Advantage of promoting the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Manufactory and Improvement of Lands, and not the reſt, I cannot underſtand; nor for what reaſon ſo many people ſhould be drain'd out of all the Nation into four or five Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Counties, ſince thoſe Counties next adjoyning to the Sea, ought to be kept moſt populous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to what purpoſe ſhould ſo much Hemp be planted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Hemp is of greater ſtrength than Flax, therefore of more excellent uſe for great advantage, as Cables, Ropes, and all kinds of Cordage, Sails, Sacking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo Thread for all Nets for Fiſhery; for which, and other purpoſes, we now buy yearly ſeveral hundred Thouſand Pounds worth from beyond the Seas; ſo that without controverſie, there's as much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49451:7"/>
Hemp to be uſed as Flax, and conſequently the Hemp-Mill may be as uſeful as the Spinning-Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>Having, we hope, ſatisfactorily Anſwered all Material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the main Body of this Deſign, it remains to conſider of the Order and Method of Governing theſe great Families or Corporations; but the Particulars thereof we leave to the deeper Wiſdom and judicious Care of Authority; only in general propoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That for the better encouragement and ſupport of ſo many poor people labouring in ſo profitable a Manufactory, each Alms-houſe be provided with and allowed a publick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, for ſtocking themſelves with Corn when it is cheapeſt, againſt the time of Dearth; a priviledge we conceive not to be ſo properly adviſable for other Companies or Handicrafts (as ſome propoſe and deſire) becauſe that would always keep Corn too cheap, and conſequently undo the Tenant, or Landlord, or both: For what makes Wheat as often at 4 <hi>s.</hi> a Buſhel (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it is known the Farmer cannot live) as at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> but becauſe all people in the Nation that have occaſion, muſt buy of the Land-Occupiers at the ſame time when it is ſcarce? But by ſuch general Granaries the hopes of 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Buſhel will be baniſht the Markets; but in our caſe painful Husbandry, that ancient Employment may well allow Granaries, both becauſe this Manufactory and Deſign eaſes their Charge to the poor, and is of more advantage to the Publick, than ſome 20 Trades beſides; and particularly, becauſe it helps to improve their Lands by Flax and Hemp, that now they need not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon Corn for raiſing their Rent: Beſides, if other over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtockt Trades want Bread, let them quit their Station, and come to Weaving, and then they may enjoy the benefit of theſe Granaries alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Maiden-Children brought up in this Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may after they attain to the Age of 15 Years, or other fit time, be permitted to go forth to Service to learn good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49451:7"/>
Huſwiſry, and the Lads to Husbandry or Trades, if they think fit; nor will there be need of ſo great caution to prevent the Marriages of the meaner fort, ſince now the Pariſhes need not ſo much fear a Charge, knowing a means how to employ all their Children as faſt as they come to be five or ſix Years old; nor can a young man have better choice for a Wiſe than here, amongſt ſo many, all bred up induſtriouſly under ſtrict Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and in a way to live: And therefore this Method will be ſo far from cauſing any depopulation, that it may encreaſe our Inhabitants; and the more, the better, ſince we know how to diſpoſe of them in ſuch laudable Employments: Moreover, hereby the diſtracting cares of poor honeſt Parents, oft occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a foreſight of their incapacity to provide for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will be removed; ſo that they may paſs their time in peace, knowing that a good honeſt comfortable Employment and Education is provided for their Children, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children; nor may this leſs remove the Temptations both in Parents and Children, which cauſe them to be guilty of ſuch Miſdemeanors as ſometimes bring them to the Gallows; ſo that the Expedients offered for the accompliſhing this Manufactory, will produce a happy change in the whole Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> no more want of Work or Bread for the poor, no more Pariſhes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, no more Beggars, a great abatement of Felons, Thieves, Cheats, Nurſes of Debauchery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many Lives preſerved, and (which is an hundred thouſand times more than all the reſt) many Souls ſaved: Much more might be ſaid in this cafe, to ſet forth the excellence of this Deſign; but I leave it as a work more deſerving the skill of the moſt Learned and Godly Divine, and ſhall only add,</p>
            <p>In order to that laſt mentioned incomparable end, and for the better Education and Inſtruction of this great Family, That there may be placed in each Houſe an Able, Honeſt, Godly Miniſter, of a good, peaceable, kind diſpoſition and exemplary Converſation;that ſo no means may be wanting for promoting Gods Glory and their Edification: To which purpoſe, on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidays

and other ſpare times, all or the moſt docible part of the People train'd up here, may likewiſe be taught to read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>So may our moſt Great Prince, and Worthy Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors become further Inſtruments for the Nations Proſperity, and the Salvation of many Souls: Thus may the Bleſſing of Heaven crown all their Honourable Enterprizes and Prudent Counſels with moſt proſperous Succeſs; which that it may be ſo, is the hearty Deſire of</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49451:9"/>Which is a plain Demonſtration, that the laying out of 5<hi>l.</hi> towards the building and furniſhing theſe Hoſpitals, will purchaſe above 20<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> or bring in 450<hi>l.</hi> And this is the loweſt Calculation that may be made of the Profits and Advantages that may ariſe by Planting of Hemp, and Flax, if well Husbanded.</p>
            <p>And moſt true it is, there's no one Manufactory in <hi>England</hi> ſo generally profitable as this may be made, eſpecially to be raiſed from Land, with ſo little hurt done to the ſame; as may be Demonſtrated thus;</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Crop of one Acre, as it ſtands on the Ground to be worth 7 <hi>l.</hi> (which is a very moderate ſuppoſition.) This Seven Pounds worth being well Dreſt fit for the Spinners, may be worth 14<hi>l.</hi> This Fourteen Pounds worth being well Spun and made into good Cloth, may be worth from 40<hi>l.</hi> to 60<hi>l.</hi> Yea I have been inform'd beyond the Seas, that the Cloth which might be made of one Acre of Flax well Dreſt, and well Spun, might be worth more than a 100<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us not forget, that we have idle hands enough in our Nation to perfect this moſt profitable Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and alſo, that little more than half the Money which in one year goes out of the Nation for Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, will pay for accompliſhing the ſame: Nay, if the thing were rightly conſidered, it might be eaſily Demonſtrated, That the Money which goes out of the Nation for Linnen in one year, will pay for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all the Cloth that may be made in 20 years; although in every year of that twenty, there be as much made, as now we buy in a Year of other Nations: As thus;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49451:10"/>
Money being kept at home within the Body of the Nation, is (as it hath no leſs aptly, than frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been reſembled) like the Blood in its Circulation in the Body of Man, which is not the leſs for its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Motion; but the whole Body thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupplyed, ſtrengthened and nouriſhed in every Part. So it is with our Money; For, ſuppoſe Twelve hundred Thouſand pounds goes out of the Nation in one year (which, ſome ſay, is much more) This never returns again; But if the ſame ſum be paid for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo much Cloth at home, there's not one Groat the leſs at the years end; So that the very Money which pays for one years work, may pay for two years; and conſequently for 20 years, and yet paſs through all neceſſary Trades, and as well to the Land Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, as any.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis very true: But firſt, I am confirm'd in my Judgement, that the riddance theſe Engins will make, cannot be leſs than what I have already propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>pag.</hi> the 5 <hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the worſt,<hi>viz.</hi> that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49451:10"/>
fail; What then; If every 100 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> in each County contribute 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Week, which would undoubtedly be ſufficient to maintain good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt them? Nay, what, If for the better Incouragement, and more Comfortable maintainance of all the whole Family, ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Week be paid, it would amount but to 26 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> to be allow'd out of the Profits which each 100<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> will reap thereby; which according to our loweſt Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, is not leſs than 22 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> a year: And I hope the great wiſdom of the Nation will not think it too much to part with 5 <hi>l.</hi> for the Building these Hoſpitals, and after they are built, to allow 26 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> for the maintainance of good Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince by ſo doing, the whole Nation is enrich'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: The truth is, theſe Hoſpitals and Government is ſo Eſſential, that the thing cannot be brought to paſs without them; for whatever we may promiſe our ſelves; yet the Work is otherwiſe as unlikely to be effected, as a great Multitude of unhappy Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to learn their Books, where there is neither Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nor Tutor, to Rule, Teach, or Govern.</p>
            <p>And who knows, but in very few Ages, each Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital may have a plentiful Revenue beſtow'd thereon: For what can be a fitter object for the Charity of ſuch well diſpoſed People, who out of their Abundance, may pleaſe to leave a Legacy behind them for Pious and Charitable uſes, ſeeing here it will ever be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to the comfort of diſtreffed Widows; the Maintainance and good Education of Fatherleſs Children; The Feeding the Hungry; Cloathing the Naked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, the Poſterity of the Donor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49451:11"/>
(according to the Revolutions of humane things) and the Poſterity of his Relations, may reap ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by theſe deeds of Charity, as that they may be ever preſrerved from Extremity.</p>
            <p>Or, why ſhould we think it too much out of rool. <hi>per Ann.</hi> to eaſt 5 <hi>l.</hi> a year into the Treaſury of this Houſe, to be ſcatter'd amongſt the Poor; ſince it is but a fourth part of what we gain by them: By this means, I am confident the Poor of each Pariſh would be ſo few, that there would be ſcare enow to eat the ſpare Meat that comes from other mens Tables: Howbeit, it were good, that a Law were made, that every perſon that gives any Almes to any idle Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, or wandring People, (the Poor of their own Pariſh only excepted) ſhould forfeit 5 <hi>l.</hi> to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the Hoſpital of that County in which they dwell, which would be no violation of the Precepts of Charity; but an effectual expedient to reſtrain all Beggars and idle people for the future.</p>
            <p>If we believe (as I hope we all do) that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Nation hath its dependance on the good Will and Pleaſure of God Almighty, and that the more we pleaſe him, the greater Bleſſings we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him. Let it then be conſidered, How acceptable an Offering it would be to the moſt High, when by ſo pious an Act of Our Gracious King and Parliament, together with the free Will Offrings of all able godly diſpoſed people, ſo many Thouſands, yea Thouſands of Thouſands, in proceſe of time, may be reſtrained, and prevented from living in that broad way of Idleneſs and Lewdneſs, in which is all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Debauchery. And now by this Reformation, from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49451:11"/>
from Generation to Generation, may become atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Hearers of his Holy Word, which is the moſt Infallible Directory to being them to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>You talk of great Profits made of Flax in other Countries: But some are of the Opinion, That to raiſe the Linnen Manufactory here to that degree, is utterly Impracticable; as well, becauſe our Domeſtick Flax is not ſo good as that which comes from beyond the Seas; as alſo, because our people cannot work it ſowell.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection, (which ſome are pleas'd to think very conſiderable) conſiſts of two Branches: The firſt is an Exception to the goodneſs of our Flax; The ſecond, to the Skill and Dexterity of our People.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt; <hi>Whether ours be as good as Outlandiſh Flax?</hi> It muſt be conſidered, and cannot be denied, but, that the far greateſt part of the Flax which we Import from beyond the Seas, is <hi>Eaſt-Country Flax,</hi> I ſay, the far <hi>greateſt</hi> part, ten to one in proportion; Now I am credibly informed by ſeveral well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Flax-Men (who have dealt in both Sorts) That <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flax is <hi>full as good,</hi> to all intents, as this <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Country</hi> Flax, and do not doubt, but it will appear ſo upon Examination; So that the Objection, as in Compariſon with ſuch <hi>Eaſt-Country</hi> Flax, vaniſhes; of which yet, (although we have but little Cloth made in <hi>England</hi>) there is, (as I am inform'd) ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds worth yearly Imported.</p>
            <p>But then, as to <hi>Dutch</hi> Flax, indeed the Caſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more difficult: It being a common opinion, that their Flax, in its nature, is better for making of Fine Cloth, than ours generally is: But even this is denied by perſons of great Judgement and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49451:12"/>
who affirm, that much Land in <hi>England</hi> may produce as kind Flax, to the full: Beſides, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Flax Imported, is but little, and comparatively In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, as is indeed the Uſe and Conſumtion of very Fine Cloth, in reſpect of the vaſt quantities of Courſe and Ordinary Cloth; ſo that, if the Trade be Encouraged, we need not fear, but we may find ground enough in <hi>England,</hi> fit to produce as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Flax as any now brought from <hi>Holland,</hi> I mean, <hi>ſo much</hi> as we have occaſion for; And conſequently, may make as good Linnen; <hi>If we do not ſpoil it in Working</hi>: Which is the ſecond Charge of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That I have credibly been inform'd by ſome perſons, that they have, and can now already make as good Cloth here, as that which we commonly Buy for 5,6,7, or 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Ell: And why ſhould not our people, when they find the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Incouraged, and eſpecially by the Emulation and deſires to out-vie each other in good Work-man-ſhip in theſe publick Working Alms-Houſes; Why, I ſay, May we not arrive at as great Perfection in the Myſtery as any people in the World? The <hi>Engliſh</hi> once had the Reputation of the only excellent Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for Wollen Cloth; other Nations knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little of it; yet now we find, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy experience, they equal, if not exceed us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Why may we not retaliate, and out-ſtrip them in another Myſtery? Or, Why ſhould we more ſcandal our ſelves with ſuggeſtions of Dullneſs and Indoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, than our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But to give more full ſatisfaction, That this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49451:12"/>
eſpecially that part which is moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the Nation, as being moſt Conſumptive of our Hemp and Flax, and moſt promoting Trade and Imployment for the Poor; which indeed is common and ordinary Cloth, of which there is a Thouſand Ells to one Tranſported into all His Majeſties Plantations.</p>
            <p>That this I ſay is ſuddainly to be perfected, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but give a ſignal Inſtance, from the laudable practice and experience of that worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>The. Firmin,</hi> Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who at this time Imploys in his Houſe (built for that purpoſe) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Flax-men, <hi>Weavers, &amp;c.</hi> And alſo above 600 Spinners abroad. This Judicious perſon ſhew'd me more than 500 <hi>l.</hi> worth of very good ſubſtantial Cloth, of his own working. And in truth, I have convers'd with many; but never found any man ſo able and free to reſolve all doubts in this caſe; who told me for a Truth, that a Child of 5 or 6 years old, that had its Health, and a moderate Apprehenſion, might be taught in 6 Weeks to earn its living in Spinning; Which, if ſo, as from the Veracity and Experience of the Relator, I have no reaſon to doubt. It is moſt plain, that the moſt profitable part of this Manufactory may be both eaſily and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily accompliſh'd, and perfected, to the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of many Thouſands, who now live by Begging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> giving ſcarce any thing for whatever they Eat, Drink, or Wear.</p>
            <p>Beſides, let it be conſidered, How greatly this Manufactory will quicken and revive our decayed Markets and dying Trade, eſpecially, that of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; which may eaſily be domonſtrated, thus;</p>
            <p>As the Caſe now ſtands, every Family in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49451:13"/>
either directly or indirectly, ſend their Money every year to the <hi>Drapers</hi> for Linnen, the <hi>Drapers</hi> they pay it to the Merchants, and away it goes every year beyond Sea, and never returns; whereby our Wealth is made a Prey to other Nations, whoſe Poor are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd and maintain'd thereby, whilſt in the mean time our Nation is in a Conſumption, our Poor live by Begging, Poverty increaſes, and our Lands lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved, for want of this Manufactory.</p>
            <p>But now under this Reformation, every Family that ſends their Money to the <hi>Drapers,</hi> the <hi>Draper</hi> ſends it to the Maſters of theſe <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> and they ſcatter it amongſt all the Trades in the Nation; eſpecially to the Farmers, and Tillers of Land, ready Money for Hemp and Flax; ready Money for Corn and Fat Cattle of all ſorts; and the like for Butter and Cheeſe, or any thing they have to ſpare: And all this, or the greateſt part, from thoſe who before lay a Begging at their Doors, or were maintained by Contribution; and now, the more people Increaſe, the better it will be for the whole Nation: And doubtleſs, if an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſufficient were laid on Foreign Linnen, Hemp and Flax, and Incouragement due to ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and induſtrious people given, (as in this Caſe, the Nation might well afford) then to be ſure, our Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals would be ſuddenly ſtock'd with curious Artiſts, by which our new Manufactory would ſpeedily be brought to perfection.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth conſideration alſo, how great, an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides the great Wealth theſe Hoſpitals would be to His Majeſties Kingdom, and how much they would add to the Trade, Wealth, and greatneſs of thoſe Towns near which they are erected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49451:13"/>13. Obj. <hi>You talk much of Charity, Let Charity begin at home with good Husbandry: If this courſe be taken, we ſhall pay dearer for Linnen, than now we do, and it muſt needs be beſt Husbandry to Buy where we may have it Cheapeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If we ſend our Money beyond-Sea for what we want, then the more we Buy, the leſs Money we have to pay, which cauſes ſcarcity of Money, and alſo, want of Trade, whereby to get more; but if we beſtow our Money for Commodities made at home, our Money and Trade will continually In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and though for a little while we pay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, yet it is eaſier to part with 9 <hi>d.</hi> when Money and Trade are plenty and increaſing, than to part with 6 <hi>d.</hi> when Money and Trade is both wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; eſpecially, ſeeing the 9 <hi>d.</hi> remains at home, and returns again, but the 6 <hi>d.</hi> is carried into another Nation, and loſt irrecoverably.</p>
            <p>14. Obj. In <hi>pag. 5.</hi> you ſuggeſt<hi>, That by your Engin, one Spinner may, earn 9</hi> d. <hi>as eaſily as 6</hi> d. <hi>without it; But how can that be? ſince every Spinner, now, may have a Wheel to turn with her foot, and ſo have both hands at liberty, as well as with your Engins: And again, its a more uſual fault to over-twiſt the thred, than to do it too ſlack; therefore no need of help to turn the Wheel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I Anſwer, Firſt, That the thing we chiefly deſign, is to imploy and maintain ſuch as cannot any other way earn half their living by any other Imploy, ſo that more than half the Spinners would be very young, and of little ſtrength, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to imploy one foot all the time they Spin, will be very tireſome; nay, the ſtrongeſt: body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it, without eaſing the ſame, neither can they imply both hands ſo freely, as when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49451:14"/>
of that burthen, or incumbrance.</p>
            <p>As for Example: Two men of equal ſtrength, skill, and nimbleneſs in all points, were to run a long Race, and one of them muſt carry ſuch a weight in his hand, as is more tireſome to him than the motion of his Legs, and oft-times, muſt eaſe the Burthen with his foot: May not the other, who hath all his Limbs free, be at the end of the Race and half-way back again as ſoon, and more eaſily than this can get to the end of the Race. Poſſibly ſome may ſay, <hi>This Simile is not parallel, and that I make it better on my ſide than it is.</hi> To which I ſay, for the Reſolution of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Do but inquire of thoſe that Spin, which of the Two is moſt tireſome, The turning of the Wheel, (either by the Foot or Hand, no matter which) or the other part of the Work. I have almoſt as often ask'd the Queſtion, as I ſee any a Spinning (ſince I invented this Engin) and the Anſwer has always been, The turning of the Wheel; although they imploy both hand and foot by turnes to do it: Beſides, it is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, and alſo injurious to the body; eſpecially for youth, which are growing, to be from Morning till Evening, always ſitting.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although it be true, <hi>That over-twiſting the Thred is commonly a fault, rather than ſlack twiſting the ſame</hi>; yet the Cauſe of this fault is, that they do not draw the Thred faſt enough: But to the better advantage, this will be eaſily cured, for now all the aforeſaid inconveniencies being removed, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Work moſt burthenſom; they may for their eaſe ſtand or ſit, when, and as often as they pleaſe, and freely imploy both hands from morning to evening, much more eaſily than they could one hand before;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49451:14"/>
and the faſter they draw the Thred from the Diſtaff, the more they Spin, with leſs danger of over-twiſting the ſame; ſo that I do not know, but thoſe that are ſome-time uſed to this eaſie way, may Spin as much in one day, as now in two.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, theſe Spinning Inſtruments may in like manner be for Expedition very ſerviceable for Spinning of Wollen, I mean Serges, Worſted, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Stockings, which being well made, are much more to be incouraged than Hair and Silk, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Foreign Commodities, the other of our own Growth, eſpecially, ſince it is ſo, that our home Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for Wool, and Foreign Markets for our Cloth grow worſe and worſe and in the opinion of moſt, ſcarce ever to be recovered; which, if ſo, it muſt needs be the beſt Husbandry to promote ſuch Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories, as may be for the Conſumption of our own Materials.</p>
            <p>Obj<hi>. If you intend theſe Hoſpitals for the Imployment of ſuch as have Families of their own to maintain, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs will be confuſed and Impracticable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Poſſibly ſo, at leaſt, in ſome reſpects and circumſtances; but that was never intended, the main deſign of theſe Hoſpitals being only for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all oppreſſed Parents Families, and Pariſhes, by taking off their young Children, and ſingle peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have neither Habitation, nor Pariſh willing to receive them, there to be comfortably maintain'd well educated and inſtructed in all good manners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Man; Nor are any of them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to this Houſe longer than untill they can well earn their Livings by other means; unleſs it be ſuch as are committed as perſons deſerving perpetual or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49451:15"/>
temporary Confinement, which is far better than to Hang or Tranſport, except it be for Capital Crimes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Benefit aimed at, is the procuring the moſt Fine and curious Cloth, as well as quantities ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of Courſer, for Domeſtick and Foreign Trade, to be obtained with great expedition: For ſo it is, That when ſo many are imploy'd in ſight of each other (eſpecially, where incouragement is given, and good Diſcipline maintain'd) the ſtrife of all, both ſmall and great, will be to excell each other, both in quantity and curioſity of Work.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>This Manufactory being thus incouraged, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of His Majeſties Revenue now ariſing by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom for Linnen Cloth will be diminiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I humbly Anſwer, That the ſame may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily compenſated another way, it being (with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) conceived, That it would be happy for this Kingdom, if an Impoſition of 12 <hi>d. per</hi> quart more than now is, were to be paid for all <hi>French</hi>-Wine and Brandy; As alſo 5 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound for all Hemp, Flax, and Linnen, that is Imported.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible ſome may ſuppoſe, that my being thus intent and tedious, is only an itch of Fame; but I can juſtly aſſure the World, I am ſo far from any ſuch contemptible Vanity, That I am rather a beggar for the Poor and Diſtreſſed, and for their ſakes, would imitate the importunate Widow, in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel, who obtain'd her requeſt meerly for the ſake of her Importunity; only this difference there is, Her ſuit was for Revenge, Mine for an Act of Charity; ſhe made her ſuit to ſuch a Judge as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared God, nor regarded man; but my humble, though, earneſt ſuit is, To the Moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49451:15"/>
               <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi>; as alſo to the Great Wiſdom of a <hi>Chriſtian Nation,</hi> all which ſtrengthens my hopes, that I ſhall not be more unfortunate than was that importunate Widow.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould I doubt it, ſince it is ſo, that even an unjuſt and ungodly Judge will redreſs the Grievances of the Oppreſſed, ſhall not the Beſt and Moſt Chriſtian Government exerciſe its power, for ſuppreſſing and reforming intollerable Evils, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Diſorders, ſeeing the Wellfare and Proſperity of the whole Nation is as it were Intail'd to ſuch an Act of Juſtice and Mercy. It is ſaid of Faith, Hope, and Charity, That the greateſt of theſe is Charity; yes, if a Man had all Faith, and all Hope, (both which are moſt excellent and neceſſary) yet it availeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if Charity be wanting. And ſince 'tis a Maxim, <hi>That the beſt of Men cannot be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable</hi>: I chearfully hope, that my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Propoſals for an Act of Charity, will not be contemn'd by our Greateſt Worthies, ſince now in our view, the Wealth and Proſperity of the Nation, is in purſuit of the ſame.</p>
            <p>I would not flatter my ſelf or others, but do confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That what with the Decreaſe of Poor People, The happy Reformation, and total Reſtriction of Beggers, Vagrants, Nurſes of Debauchery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The yearly increaſe of Ten or Twelve Hundred Thouſand Pounds, which now will be kept at home, that before went beyond the Seas for Linnen; The great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lands; The Exportation of Linnen of our own growth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The worth and advantage of the whole cannot amount to leſs than Two or three Millions Sterling, <hi>per Annum,</hi> to the Nation: and over and above many lives preſerved, and (with Gods bleſſing on the means) many ſouls ſaved; which, if ſo, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it will be the beſt Bargain and happieſt that ever the Nation made, all circumſtances conſidered; Becauſe where ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is disburs'd as will compaſs this great Wealth (without which it is almoſt impoſſible to be attain'd,) our Poſterity will have it for nothing; yea, the preſent Inhabitants have their Purchaſe Money ſtill amongſt themſelves, as it were, <hi>in their own Sacks with their Corn,</hi> ſeeing we Buy not this profitable Expedient of other Nations; which, if we were obliged to do, to be ſare they would make us pay <hi>dearly</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe neither of theſe Advantages were to be reap'd for our Money, only the Poor provided for, and Reformation of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants

accompliſh'd, Muſt we do nothing for Charity? Suppoſe any Oppoſers of this Dſign, were worth 5000 <hi>l.</hi> or 10000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> a piece, Can they be certain, that none of their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may within 200 years come to Poverty? Why then ſhould they be unwilling now to contribute freely, ſeeing the Method pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, may ſecure both Rich and Poor from Extremity? And how diſhonourable is it to this Kingdom, that ſo fruitful a Soil as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which by the Induſtry of its moſt unuſeful Inhabitants might ſo eaſily become the Garden of Europe, ſhould, by their ſloth and obſtinacy, lie unimproved? How many Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Beggers, Vagrants, Drones, Nurſes of Debauchery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are not only a Dishonour, but a great Diſadvantage to the Nation, living in continual ſinful Practices againſt the Laws of God and good Government, depriving themſelves of all means of Religious and Civil Education, to the great danger of their own Souls; Ill Example of others; and deſtruction of their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being neither ſerviceable to the Publick, nor capable of raiſing themſelves to any better condition, might by this Method, be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reform'd, or prevented?</p>
            <p>Wherefore upon theſe ſeveral <hi>weighty</hi> conſiderations, and for that, beſides the <hi>Princely</hi> Encouragement before-mentioned, I have had the Approbation of that great lover of Ingenuity, The Right Honourable, the Lord Viſcount <hi>Brouncker,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> who was pleas'd to peruſe my Propoſals, and expreſs his Sentiments very favourably thereupon; As alſo having received by letter ſome conſiderable and preſſing Incitements, to proceed from an Eminent publick ſpirited Divine, the Reverend, Dr.<hi>John Beale,</hi> one of His Majeſties Chaplains, and a Member of the ſaid <hi>Royal Society.</hi> I am therefore embolden'd, particularly to entreat the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> conſideration of the moſt <hi>grave and pious Divines,</hi> and all the Honourable and Ingenious Aſſociates of that <hi>Auguſt Society</hi> in this matter, and accordingly, to give their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Approbation, and Aſſiſtance; or otherwiſe to diſcover my miſtakes, and rectifie any falſe Meaſures, which through Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, or over-zeal, to the deſign I may have committed, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſome more <hi>Feazible Methods</hi> from their better improved Reaſon, whereby I ſhall at once be confuted and inſtructed; and though failing in the means, ſhall not miſs of my deſired End, <hi>viz.
