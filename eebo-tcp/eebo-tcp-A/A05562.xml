            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that it falls out in good experience, that thys tytle of Vertue, is of many men desired, but of very few truly deserued.</p>
            <p>Vertue maketh a stranger grow natural in a strange Country, and vice maketh the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a stranger in his owne Country.</p>

            <p>Vertue is the Queene of labours, Opinion the Mistresse of fooles, Vanity the pryde of Nature, and Contention the ouerthrowe of Families.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The first step to vertue, is to loue vertue in another man.</p>

            <p>Vertue cannot perfitly bee discerned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her contraryes, nor absolutely perfect, without aduersity.</p>
            <p>Vertue is better, and more certayne then any Art.</p>

            <p>Truth is a vertue that scaleth the heauens, illumineth the earth, maintaineth iustice, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth common-weales, kils hate, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth loue, and discouereth secrets.</p>
            <p>Truth is a sure pledge, not impaired, a shield neuer pierced, a flower that neuer dyeth, a state that feares not fortune, and a port that yeelds no danger. <hi>Cicero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truth is health that is neuer sick, a life that hath neuer end, a salue that healeth all sores, a sunne that neuer setteth, a moone that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eclipsed, an hearb that is neuer withered, a gate that is neuer lockt, and a voyage that neuer breeds wearines.</p>
            <p>Truth is such a vertue, that without it, our strength is weakenes, our iustice tyrannous,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9006:14"/>
our humility trayterous, our patience dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, our chastity vaine, our liberty cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and our piety superfluous.</p>

            <p>By truth the innocent smyleth before the Iudge, and the traytor is discouered before he is suspected.</p>

            <p>It falleth out in loue as it doth with Vines, for the young Vines bring the most wine, but the old the best.</p>

            </p>
            <p>He that hath sore eyes, must not behold the Candle, nor he that would leaue his loue, fall to the remembrance of his Lady, for the one causeth the eyes to smart, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the hart to bleede.</p>
            <p>A louer is like the hearb <hi>Helitropiam,</hi> which alwaies inclineth to that place where the sun shyneth, &amp; beeing depriued of the sun dyeth.</p>

            <p>There must be in euery triangle three lines, the first beginning the figure, the second aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth the figure, and the third concludes it.

            <p>Loue can neuer be truly fixed, when in him that is beloued there wanteth merrit.</p>
            <p>It is conuenient in loue to be discreet, and in hatred prouident and aduised.</p>
            <p>Loue is a frantick frenzie, that so infects the mindes of men, that vnder the tast of Nectar, they are poysoned with the water of Stix.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9006:23"/>Loue brings one lewd lookes, to command by power, and to be obeyed by force.</p>

            <p>Louers oft tymes proceed in theyr sutes as Crabs, whose paces are alwayes backward.</p>
            <p>As affection in a louer is restlesse, so if it bee perfect, it is endlesse.</p>
            <p>Loue is a sweet tyrannie, because the louer endureth his torments willingly.</p>
            <p>The mind of a louer is not where he liueth, but where he loueth.</p>
            <p>Loue fixed on vertue, increaseth euer by continuaunce.</p>
            <p>The passionate Louer, if he sayle, loue is his Pilot, if he walke, loue is his companion, if he sleepe, loue is his pyllow.</p>
            <p>Loue is onely remedied by loue, and fancie must be cured by affection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sophocles</hi> being demaunded what harme he would wish to his enemy, aunswered, that he might loue where he was not fancied.</p>

            <p>Louers othes are like fetters made of glasse, that glister fayre, but couple no constraint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:9006:23"/>Loue maketh a man that is naturally addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vice, to bee endued vvith vertue, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to apply himselfe to all laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises; that thereby he may obtaine his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers fauour, coueting to bee skilfull in good letters, that by his learning he may alure her, to excell in musicke, that by his melodie hee may intice her, to forine his speech in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect phrase, that by his learning &amp; eloquence he may perswade her, and what nature wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, he seeketh to amend by nurture, &amp; the onely cause of thys vertuous dysposition, is loue.</p>
            <p>Loue be it neuer so faythfull, is but a Chaos of care, &amp; fancie though neuer so fortunate, is but a masse of myserie. <hi>Chilo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loue is to be dryuen out by reason, not to be thrust out by force.</p>
            <p>Amidst the naturall passions of man, loue is the fountaine of all other.</p>
            <p>The louer being angry, doth flatter hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with many lyes.</p>
            <p>The louer knoweth what hee dooth desire, but he knoweth not what he should desire.</p>
            <p>Loue may wither by little and little, but the roote will not be remooued on a suddaine.</p>
            <p>It is a profit for young men, and a fault for old men to be in loue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9006:24"/>The best Phisition to cure loue, is shee that gaue the wound.</p>
            <p>Secret loue burneth with the fiercest flame.</p>
            <p>The first steppe to wisedom, is not to loue, the second, so to loue, that it bee not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>As a King is honoured in his image, so God in man is both loued and hated; hee cannot hate man who loueth God, nor can hee loue God, who hateth man. <hi>Bernard.</hi>

            <p>Hee that gathereth Roses, must be content to pricke his fingers, and he that will winne a womans good will, must be content vvith sharpe words.</p>
            <p>The cause of loue is delight, vvhich by the aspect and sight of beauty is first taken; but whosoeuer in viewing &amp; beholding of others taketh no pleasure, can neuer be mooued to loue.</p>

            <p>Learning is the display of honour, &amp; humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is sister vnto true nobility; the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as needfull in a housholder, as the other in a man of Armes is profitable.</p>

            <p>The conquest of Timotheus wonne by ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and sweet words, was good, so were the out-cryes of Demetreus effected with sword, but in an absolute Commaunder, let both the one and the other be resident.</p>

            <p>Learning is the temperance of youth, the comfort of oldage, standing for wealth vpon pouerty, and seruing for an ornament to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. <hi>Cicero.</hi>

            <p>A man cannot be better accompanied then

            <p>Like as a fielde, although it bee fertile, can bring forth no fruite, except it be first tilled: so the mind, although it be apt of it selfe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without learning bring foorth any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>If thou desire to be good, endeuor thy selfe to learne to know, and to follow the truth, for he that is ignorant therein, &amp; will not learne, can neuer be good. <hi>Cicero.</hi>

            <p>Labour not for a great number of bookes, but for the goodnes that in them is to be ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for learning consisteth not in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but in the goodnes.</p>
            <p>Learning maketh yong men sober, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth old men, it is wealth to the poore, and treasure to the rich. <hi>Aristippus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Defi.</hi> Eloquence, or oratorie, is an Art which teacheth the laudable maner of well speaking; it is the ornament of the braine, and the guilt somtimes to an ill reputed matter.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe speech of man is a diuine worke, and full of admiration, therefore we ought at no time to pollute our tongues with vild and filthy talke.</p>
            <p>Breuity is a great praise of eloquence. <hi>Cice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speech is the nourishment of the soule, which onely becomes odious and corrupt, by the wickednes of men. <hi>Isocrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a speciall vertue to speake little &amp; well.</p>
            <p>Silence is a sweet eloquence, for fooles in their dombnes, are accounted wise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:9006:53"/>Many throgh eloquence, make a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seeme bad, and a bad matter seeme good.</p>
            <p>Eloquence hath a double fountaine, the one internall proceeding from the minde, called the diuine guide, the other externall, vttered in speech, called the messenger of conceits and thoughts. <hi>Cic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Internall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Externall eloquence aymes at friendshippe towards others, causing vs to speak &amp; teach, whatsoeuer is fruitfull and profitable for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one.</p>
            <p>Internall speech, maketh a man alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vvith himselfe, it causeth him neuer to complayne, neuer to repent; it maketh hym full of peace, full of loue and contentation in his own vertue, it hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eth him of euery rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious passion which is disobedient to reason, and of all contentions betweene wit and will; Externall carrieth vvith it all the force &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecacie to perswade.</p>
            <p>Eloquence is made by ayre; beaten &amp; fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with articulate &amp; distinct sound, yet the reason thereof is hard to bee comprehended by humane sence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9006:54"/>VVords are the shadowes of workes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence the ornament to both.</p>
            <p>Eloquence is like a cloath of Arras, figured and set forth with stories, because both in the one and the other the thinges fashioned, are then seene when they are opened, &amp; are not subiect to sight, neither bring delight when they are folded vp and hidden.</p>
            <p>VVhen the lyps of perfit eloquence are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, we behold, as it were in a Temple, the goodly similitudes, and images of the soule.</p>
            <p>Vertue hath no instrument so gracious or familiar as eloquence, which seconded with action, is of great force and effecacie.</p>
            <p>It is not so necessary that the Orator &amp; the Law should agree in one, and the same thing, as it is requisite, the lyfe of a Phylosopher should be conformable with his doctrine and speech. <hi>Plato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eloquence is a profession of serious, graue, and waighty matters, and not a play vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly vttered to obtaine honour onely.</p>
            <p>All oratorie ought to haue reason for a fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and the loue of our neighbour for a marke to ayme at.</p>
            <p>The tongue is a slypperie instrument, and bringeth great danger to those that eyther neglect, or defile it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:9006:54"/>If eloquence bee directed vvith a religious vnderstanding, it will sing vs a song, tuned with all the concords of a true harmonie of vertue.</p>
            <p>Eloquence ought to be lyke gold, which is then of greatest price and value, vhen it hath least drosse in it.</p>
            <p>A dry &amp; thirstie eare must be watered with eloquence, which is good to drinke, and that eloquence grounded vppon reason onely, is able to content and satisfie the hearing.</p>
            <p>The goodliest assembly in the world, is where the Graces &amp; Muses meet togethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Right and reason are inuincible, being vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with true eloquence, because the soule is induced to beleeue their reasons, through the delight which is ioyned with them.</p>
            <p>Vnprofitable eloquence is like Cipres trees, which are great and tall, but beare no fruite. <hi>Aurelian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Babling Orators are the theeues of tyme, and compared to empty vessels, which gyue a greater sound, then they which are full.</p>
            <p>The tongue by eloquence serueth both to perfect &amp; instruct others, and likewise to hurt and corrupt others.</p>
            <p>There be two only times for a man to shew eloquence, the one when the matter is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
<pb facs="tcp:9006:55"/>
the other, when a man speaketh that which he knoweth.</p>
            <p>Great men ought to be considerate in their speech, and to bee eloquent in sententious words, of another phrase then that of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort, or else to be silent, wanting the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of eloquence.</p>
            <p>Men ought to be more considerate in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then in speaking, because a rash &amp; indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete word may be corrected presently, but that which is written, can no more be denied or amended, but with infamy.</p>
            <p>Let eloquence be pleasant and sweet, not head-strong, and when wee discourse, let vs not be so long, that wee hinder others from speaking; for eloquence of all other thinges ought to be mutuall, and equall.</p>
            <p>Oratory is the spurre to armes, for the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent oration of <hi>Isocrates,</hi> was the first trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet that gaue <hi>Phillip</hi> an alarum to the Asian warres, which <hi>Alexander</hi> his sonne, without intermission ended.</p>

            <p>Liberality taketh his name of the substance of the same person from whence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for it consisteth not in the qualitie or quantity of the things that be giuen, but in the true and naturall disposition of the giuer.</p>
            <p>That bounty is the best &amp; most approued, that without perrill of renowne is past.</p>

            <p>A liberall hart causeth beneuolence, though some-times through misfortune, abilitiy be wanting.</p>
            <p>It is a token of righteousnes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge heauens liberality, and to giue praises to God for so great benefits.</p>
            <p>Liberality, when it lauisheth out of reason,

is called prodigality, and being nothing at all extended, it purchaseth the name of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>IT is great commendation in the giuer, to bestow many benefits vppon him which deserueth well, and desireth nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9006:82"/>He that mindeth to giue, must not say, will you haue any thing.</p>

            <p>The liberall man doth daily seeke out occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to put his vertue in practise.</p>
            <p>The memory of a benefit doth soone va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away, but the remembrance of an iniury sticketh fast in the hart.</p>
            <p>He is a conquerer which bestoweth a good turne, and he vanquished which receiueth it.</p>
            <p>As the Moone dooth shewe her light in the world, which she receiueth from the sunne, so we ought to bestow the benefits receiued of God, to the profit and commodity of our neighbour.</p>

            <p>As giuing and receiuing of benefits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie one to another, so the one is much more often vsed then the other.</p>
            <p>It behooueth a man in receiuing of benefits to be thankfull, though he want power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them.</p>

            <p>Iustice is painted blinde, with a vaile before her face, not because she is blinde, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to signifie, that Iustice though she do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that which is right and honest, yet will shee respect no person.</p>

            <p>There are two kinds of iniustice, the one is, of such as do wrongfully offer it, &amp; the other is of those, who although they bee able, yet will they not defend the wrong from them vnto whom it is wickedly offered. <hi>Cic.</hi>

            <p>Hee that politiquely intendeth good to the Common-weale, may well be called iust, but he that practiseth onely for his owne profit, is a vicious and wicked person.</p>
            <p>Too much licence in punishment, is the cause of too much hatred.</p>
            <p>VVe ought to obey the Iudge, though hee be corrupt; for <hi>Socrates</hi> although hee were vniustly condemned, yet thought it were far better for him to die, then open iustice should be violated.</p>

            <p>A Iustice ought to doe that willingly which hee can doe, and deny that modestly vvhich hee cannot doe.</p>

            <p>Seruaunts ought not to obey with eye-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice onely, but also with singlenes of hart.</p>

            <p>Princes must be serued both with lyfe and goods, and that is the personall seruice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery naturall subiect.</p>

            <p>All kinde of mockery ought to be shunned, which is a reproch couered with some fault, and which accustometh the mocker to raile and lye, and mooueth more then an iniurie, when it proceedeth from a will to outrage &amp; a malice without necessity.</p>
            <p>An Adder keeps his venome in his taile, but the poyson of a scoffer is in his tongue.</p>
            <p>VVhat is sweet in the mouth, is bitter in the

            <p>Scoffes without feare, proceed of folly.</p>

            <p>To iest is tollerable, but to doe harme by iests, is insufferable.</p>

            <p>Mocking is an artificiall iniurie.</p>

            <p>It is better to play with eares then tongues, for the one heares, but the other bites.</p>

            <p>Delicate fare is the mother of sicknes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The soule despiseth all worldly busines, and being occupied onely about heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, she reioyceth greatly vvhen she is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from these earthly bands.</p>
            <p>VVhile the soule is in the company of good people, it is in ioy; but vvhen it is among e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men, it is in sorrow and heauines.</p>
            <p>As the body is an instrument of the soule, so is the soule an instrument of God.</p>

            <p>YOuth that heeretofore delighted to try theyr vertues in hard Armors, take nowe theyr whole delight and content in delicate and effeminate amors.</p>
            <p>VVantonnesse, libertie, youth, and riches, are alwayes enemies to honestie.</p>
            <p>The deeds that men commit in their youth were neuer yet found so vpright and honest, but it was thought more praise-worthy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them then declare them.</p>
            <p>Youth going to warres, ought to feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good and euill renowne. <hi>Eurip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the old time there were certaine persons chosen out of diuers good Townes, which they called <hi>Sophronists,</hi> who had a continuall charge and care, to controle moderate, and rule the manners of youth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:9006:198"/>It is very requisite, that youth bee brought vp in that part of learning which is called hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</p>
            <p>A man followeth all his life long his first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing in his youth; as if a tree blossom not in the spring, it will hardly beare fruite in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne.</p>
            <p>As the Cipres tree, the more it is vvatered, the more it withereth, &amp; the oftener it is lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the sooner it dyeth; so vnbridled youth, the more it is by graue aduise counsayled, or due corrections controled, the sooner it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to confusion.</p>
            <p>VVhere vice is imbraced in youth, there commonly vertue is neglected in age.</p>
            <p>Youth for the most part followeth wanton vvit too vvilfully, neuer preuenting perrils while they are past, nor dreadeth dangers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they be halfe drowned.</p>
            <p>Youth fiereth his fancie vvith the flame of lust, and old age fixeth his affections with the heate of loue.</p>
            <p>Young yeeres make their account onely of the glistering shew of beauty, but gray haires respect onely the perfect substance of vertue.</p>
            <p>The minde of a young man is momentarie, his fancie fading, his affections fickle, his loue vncertaine, &amp; his liking as light as the winde;
<pb facs="tcp:9006:199"/>
his fancie fiered with euery new face, and his minde moued with a thousand sundry moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lothing that which of late hee did loue, and liking that for which his longing minde doth lust, frying at the first, and freezing at the last.</p>
            <p>The follies that men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit in their youth, are causes of repentance in old age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cupid</hi> alloweth none in his court, but young men that can serue, fresh &amp; beautifull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, wise that can talke, secrete to keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, faithfull to gratifie, and valiant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his mistresse iniuries.</p>
            <p>It is not loue, but sorrow, not mirth, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, not tast, but torment, not delight, but despight, not ioy, but annoy, not recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but confusion, when in a louer there is not both youth and libertie.</p>
            <p>The prime of youth, is as the flowers of the Pine tree, which are glorious in sight, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauorie in the smell.</p>
            <p>Youth, if it blush not at beautie, and carrie antidots of wisedome against flatterie, follie will be the next hauen he shall harbor in.</p>

            <p>The better that a child is by byrth, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought he in his youth to be instructed.</p>
            <p>The impression of good doctrine stampt in youth, no age nor fortune can out-weare.</p>

            <p>The humor of youth is, neuer to think that good, whose goodnes he seeth not. S. P. S.</p>
            <p>The death of youth is a shypwrack.</p>
            <p>Youth ought to vse pleasure and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as naturall ease and rest.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>VSurie is compared to fire, vvhich is an actiue and insatiable element, for it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and consumeth all the wood that is laid vpon it; so the Vsurer, the more hee hath, the more he desireth, and lyke hell gates hee is neuer satisfied.</p>

            <p>Loue wanting desire, makes the mind des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and fixed fancie bereft of loue, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into fury.</p>
            <p>Desperate thoughts are fit for them that feare shame, not for such as hope for credit.</p>
            <p>Sighes are the emblazers of thoughts, and melancholy the messenger of dispaire.</p>
            <p>There is no offence so great, but mercy may pardon, neyther is there any thing so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate which time cannot cure.</p>

desperatly aduenturous, and what perswasion could not make constant, misery hath made desperate.</p>
            <p>Resolution is grounded on honour, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenes on danger.</p>

            <p>Fortune desperatly attained, is as desperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie lost, and dispaire suddainly entertayned, is a token of a wretched conscience.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt be accounted valiant, let ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaunce nor griefe make thee desperate.</p>
            <p>Dispaire comes of the feeblenes of courage, and the lack of wit.</p>
            <p>To him that is subiect to passion, dispayre is euer attendant.</p>
            <p>He that is desperatly inclined to his ovvne will, is euer most neere to the wrath of God.</p>

            <p>Despayre and reuenge, depriue men of the mercy of God, and cleane blotteth out the memory of their former good deeds.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater wonder, then to see a wise-man become desperate.</p>
            <p>Of all the perturbations of mans mind, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire

            <p>If he be a wicked homicide which killeth a man, then is he the same vvhich killeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; because he killeth a man.</p>
