         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration, Or Reſolution of the Countie of HEREFORD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Kingdome for many yeares paſt hath groaned under Taxes of Loanes, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, and the like diſmall effects of an Arbitrary Government, and a high ſtretcht <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:</hi> for the Cure of which diſtempers a <hi>Parliament</hi> was held to bee the onely good old way of <hi>Phyſicke</hi> to clenſe the Body Politique from oppreſſing Crudities (which was heartily deſir'd) but not by over-ſtrong Purgations to weaken it in the principall Part, charging it to receive a diſpoſition to the like diſtemper, or a Relapſe into the ſame, or a worſe Diſeaſe, which in ſtead of reſtoring it to its primitive vigour and health, muſt needs drive it to a fatall Period. Such is our miſery, ſuch the iuſt Iudgement of God upon our Sinnes.</p>
            <p>This wholſome <hi>Phyſicke</hi> hath not wrought in us that bleſſed effect as was either believed by ſome, or hoped for by all men: but as if God had anſwered our importunity for a PARLIAMENT as he did the old <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for a <hi>KING</hi> in his anger; we drive on with much more haſte then good ſpeed to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, which portends no leſſe Symptomes of ruine and deſtruction than the former. So that having maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what hath proved deſtructive to this or other <hi>Parliaments,</hi> we may the more eaſily avoid thoſe Rocks upon which others have ſplit themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The venting of particular ends of Avarice and Ambition in the publique Cauſe. 2. Private Combinations or Chamber-Conventicles to reſolve be forehand what ſhall be done in the <hi>Houſe.</hi> 3. Hindring the freedom of ſpeech by impriſonment of their Perſons. 4. Denying information by the humble way of Petitions from the <hi>County,</hi> as that moſt excellent Orthodox <hi>Petition</hi> of our Brethren of <hi>Kent</hi> and of reiecting informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Letters to our Knights and Burgeſſes. 5. The ready ſwallowing of informations and iealous rumors againſt his <hi>Ma:</hi> ſtyling them the malignant partie and enemies to the State which were only truely and conſonably his friends. 6. The private if not publique mutinous rabble, which ill Spirit was ready at all times to be raiſed by a whiſper from any of thoſe worthy Members, Emphatically ſo called, if not excluſively, as if all Iuſtice, Reformation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were onely to be expected from them. 7. The new unheard of State Law and Logick to ſtile and beleeve that a Parliament that is divided in it ſelfe, is ſevered from the King the Head thereof: if they may be remedied (as we hope they are not paſt cure) we ſhall rather deſire to change ſome of our Phyſitians then Phyſicke, there being no better way, nor more neceſſary to preſerve the health of a Common-wealth than a well temper'd <hi>Parliament.</hi> Wherefore we as faithfull Subiects to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as free-borne Engliſh-men, do ioyne in an unanimous Reſolution to maintaine.

                  </item>
               </list> For the firſt, <hi>The Proteſtant Religion;</hi> we cannot but with griefe of heart remember how it hath beene aſſaulted in the In-workes and skirts of it, the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and decent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law; yea in the very body of it the 39. <hi>Articles.</hi> In what a danger this Church of <hi>England</hi> hath beene, to be overcome with <hi>Browniſme</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> let all the world iudge. For the ſecond, <hi>The juſt power of the King;</hi> God knowes hee hath beene ſo farre unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that from violence, as it was Gods great goodneſſe rather then his owne Power which ſecured, or rather preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Perſon from violence, What their ayme was, who to pleaſe the vulgar rabble would uphold and not puniſh them for their inſolencies, as we feare and imagine for the preſent; ſo we cannot but with horror and amazement doubt the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Not can we conceale our ioy of heart, or thankes to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> good Subiects of the Countie of <hi>York,</hi> for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to ſecure his Perſon with a Guard (being of much more value then many thouſands of us) and putting him in a poſture of defence, which ſome have ignorantly or maliciouſly interpoſed by ſuggeſting it an intenſion of Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Parliament, wherby it is plaine enough his <hi>Majeſties</hi> deſires are onely to ſecure himſelfe and ſervants from prodigious tumults and diſorders as have endangered his ſacred Perſon: Nor can we blame him conſidering Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> Act at <hi>Hull,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Ludlowes</hi> Speech in Parliament.</p>
            <p>For the two laſt, <hi>The Lawes of the Land,</hi> and <hi>The Libertie of the Subject</hi> which muſt not be ſeparated, how have they beene violated after by ſome of thoſe who were choſen to be Conſervators of them, by impriſonment of mens Perſons, contrary to the Petition of <hi>Right?</hi> aſſeſſing of the Clergie without a Body of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> ſhuffling the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation into a <hi>Synod,</hi> or an Aſſembly, or Conventicle, without the Choyce, Conſent or Election of the Clergie; as if they were neither the Kings Subiects, nor Gods ſervants.</p>
            <p>As we conceive our ſelves obliged by the Law of God, the Law of the Land, by the Dictates of Natures reaſon to maintaine all theſe; ſo by Gods grace aſſiſting us, we hope we ſhall not be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>errified or compelled to yeeld any active obedience to any diſioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned part of <hi>Parliament</hi> without the conſent of the whole (which we heartily deſire may be united) or to any uncertaine Debates, Votes or Ordinances, that are not digeſted or ſettled into Lawes; nay, which ſeemes to contradict former Lawes, and yet are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to us with ſo much earneſtnes, as ſome dare hardly deny them with ſafety, or obey with Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we ever yeeld our ſelves ſuch Slaves, or ſo betray the liberty purchaſed by our Forefathers blood, and bequeathed unto us as to ſuffer our ſelves to be ſwayed by an Arbitrary Government whatſoever, nor ſtand with too much contention of Spirit to caſt off the yoake of one Tyranny to endure many worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſeeing his Majestie is graciouſly pleaſed to maintaine the true</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion; His owne</hi> juſt Power, <hi>the</hi> Lawes of the Land, <hi>The</hi> Liberty <hi>of the</hi> Subjects, <hi>and that theſe waters of</hi> Reformation, <hi>having beene long ſtirred; we want onely the favour of his Princely</hi> Majeſtie <hi>to let us in and heale us: So we doe reciprocally declare that we conceive our ſelves bound to maintaine him in all the Premiſſes with our Lives and Fortunes.</hi>
