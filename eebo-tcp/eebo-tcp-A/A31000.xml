            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bold Truths for ſome tender Ears. The
Men of Moderation will accuſe Him of
Intemperate Zeal; The downright Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
of Popery. In Their abuſive ſenſe
of the words, He owns both parts of the
Accuſation. By Intemperate Zeal, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
a Conſtant, Hearty, and unreſerv'd
Affection for the KING and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and by Popery, a ſtedfaſt unfeigned
adheſion to the Church of</hi> England <hi>in all
Her Heights, and under the greateſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
which He thanks God He
always hath, and ever will be Guilty of.
He hath already taſted of Their civility in

the Deliverance of our Preſent Sovereign
from the</hi> Rye <hi>Aſſaſsination, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
as Great and Miraculous as
that of His</hi> ROYAL <hi>Grandfather was

care, being well aſſur'd could he either

He might then have Commenc'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Moderate man or a Gifted brother;
And conſequently thriv'n, as well as ſome of

hath been ſerviceable to the Publick) in
an humble contented State; than Riſe to
great Preferments with a Guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

Gentlemen, I muſt not turn a Dedication

when I ſhould be reciting Your Merits, which
are ſo great and well known, that His</hi>

<hi>and Country. Happy</hi> KING! <hi>in ſuch

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt ſeveral other excellencies,
which did at firſt recommend
Chriſtianity to the unconverted
world, theſe Three at leaſt may
challenge our approbation; the
purity and ſimplicity of its Doctrines; the
integrity and ſincerity of thoſe who firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
them; and their exact complyance
with all the conveniences and neceſſities of
humane affairs. As for their purity, they
flowed from the fountain of all truth, and
therefore without any the leaſt mixture of
fraud or falſehood; they were neither ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
with ſecular intereſt; leaven'd with
the vanity of Philoſophical pride; nor in
the leaſt to be ſuſpected of any mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of gaining popular applauſe, or praiſe
amongſt men: As for the integrity of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48058:6"/>
firſt Deliverers, I need ſay no more than that
they were perſons ſo mean and deſpicable in
the eſteem of the world, ſo altogether incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
both by birth and education, that
though they had had a mind, yet they could
not either have altered the Doctrines which
they had receiv'd, or invented new; for
the world was ſcarce ever yet ſo credulous
as to be impos'd upon [eſpecially in affairs
of the greateſt importance] by any but thoſe
whoſe acquired abilities, reputation and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
gave them great advantages over the
reſt of mankind. In the propagation of the
Goſpel, they were as far from corrupting
the pure word of Truth, as they were from
defrauding thoſe whom they had made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes
to it: that which they chiefly aim'd
at was the imprinting upon mens minds a
lively hope of a reſurrection to bliſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and the convincing them, there
was no way of coming to the fruition of
their Hopes, but by conforming their lives to
the purity of the Goſpel. In order to this
end they did indeed in ſome ſenſe become
all things to all men, but 'twas ſtill out of
a generous deſign to gain the more. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Jews they cryed up <hi>Abraham</hi>
for the Father of the Faithfull, that ſo they
might make his infidel children believe in
the onely begotten Son of God; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48058:6"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, that they might
the better recommend Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
they approved whatſoever was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in their Law, that they might with
more eaſe win them into a complyance
with the Goſpel. In reference to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
they laid upon them no other burthen
than was neceſſary, and were ſo far from
ſiding with thoſe troubleſome Phariſees who
would needs have had them circumcis'd,
and brought under that heavy Yoke, which
neither they nor their Fathers were able to
bear; that, after the moſt mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they onely commanded them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from groſs pollutions; ſo far from any
rigorous impoſitions, that they ſtudied to
bring them over by the moſt ſutable and
endearing methods. Witneſs that ſermon
which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd to them at <hi>Athens,</hi>
where finding an Altar dedicated to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
God; from this their ſottiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
he preſently takes occaſion to inſtruct
them in the knowledge and worſhip of the
True: From the confeſſion of one of their
own Poets that they were all his Offspring,
He demonſtrates how unreaſonable it was for
them to imagine that the Great Creatour
of the Univerſe could be confined within
the narrow compaſs of a ſhrine; and now
leſt a ſad reflection upon their former Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48058:7"/>
ſhould create a deſpair of pardon, in
the cloſe he tells them that at the times of
their former ignorance God would wink,
provided they would now repent and turn
unto the Lord their Creatour. By this their
warrantable Court, and prudent condeſcent,
they captivated the ſtubborn Jews, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the prouder Greeks. They brought
Chriſtianity into the Synagogues, and turn'd
Idolatry out of the Temples. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this their prudent Execution of that
great Commiſſion their Lord and Maſter
had entruſted them with, there ſoon aroſe
falſe Teachers and falſe Prophets, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
men of unſtable minds, either by
intermixing Judaiſme with Chriſtianity, or
elſe what was far worſe, perſwading them
that an impure converſation was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of their hopes of a bleſſed Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
And ſo they would have made
them ſwallow the moſt palpable contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
as that juſtice and unrighteouſneſs
were conſiſtent, a communion might be held
of Light with Darkneſs, a concord effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
between Chriſt and Belial, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the Temple of God and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
that they might be Partakers of
that Celeſtial. Banquet the Lords Supper,
and yet not ſin in Epicurizing upon the
Reliques of thoſe impure Beaſts which had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48058:7"/>
been offer'd unto Devils. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a moſt malign influence they poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
the Sovereignty of Chriſtianity, and
under pretence of advancing Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
promoted that of the Prince of
Darkneſs. In ſhort they either wronged men
in their Eſtates, whilſt they pretended the
welfare of their ſouls; or elſe under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of furthering their intereſt in this
world, they infected their minds with
ſuch pernicious Principles, as did certainly
cut off all their Right to an Inheritance
in the world to come, and ſo under ſhew
of inſtructing they made a prey of their
Auditours, and by a moſt unparallell'd
piece of cruelty endeavour'd at once to
deſtroy both their ſouls and bodies. In
oppoſition to theſe falſe Teachers, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul;</hi>
Courts his <hi>Corinthians</hi> to receive the true
ones, and one would think his Addreſs
ſhould eaſily prove ſucceſsfull, eſpecially
conſidering how mightily it tends to the
advantage of thoſe to whom 'twas made,
which is plain enough from the Addreſs
it ſelf. <hi>Receive us, we have wronged no man,
we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no
man.</hi> Setting then aſide the particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> had thus to accoſt the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and taking the words in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſenſe, as they concern all thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48058:8"/>
who are lyable to be ſeduced by falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, they afford
theſe three following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. That 'tis the duty of all men, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of thoſe in authority to receive all
ſuch, and only ſuch, as preach the word in
ſincerity and truth.</p>
            <p>2. The danger of tolerating thoſe who do
not preach the word in ſincerity and truth.</p>
            <p>3. The ſureſt expedient to prevent the
miſchiefs which are ſure to ariſe from ſuch
a toleration.</p>
            <p>I. That 'tis the duty of all men, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

            <p>That Religion is abſolutely neceſſary to
the more orderly Government of the world,
is ſo undeniable a truth, that they who have
been its greateſt Deſpiſers as to the concerns
of the other world, have been forc't to own
themſelves its greateſt Votaries for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and promoting Empire in this; and a
man may as ſoon hope to reconcile the
greateſt contradiction in nature, as blot the
ſenſe of Religion out of the minds of the
people, who rather than have none at all,
will debaſe themſelves to the worſhip of
the meaneſt of Creatures, even ſtocks and
ſtones. Now ſince amongſt the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48058:8"/>
opinions, which through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the enemy, and the perverſeneſs of
men have aroſe concerning the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Religion; the people are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of themſelves to judge which are true
and which falſe, but are herein wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd
and guided by their Teachers. Nay
ſuch is the pravity of humane nature, ſuch
its affectation of novelty, and deſperate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
againſt the truth, that 'tis odds but
the falſe Teacher gains the greater number
of Diſciples. For inſtance ſhould an <hi>Arian</hi>
or a <hi>socinian</hi> be permitted publickly to preach
and teach the people; I am afraid the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chriſt would be much endangered,
and the merits of his Paſſion ſoon render'd
ineffectual; the caſe will be much the ſame,
though we mould inſtance in any other
Sect, which ſtands in oppoſition to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by Law eſtabliſh't, ſuppoſe either in
the independency of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> or the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
of <hi>Corah.</hi> What outrages would not
theſe reſtleſs Sectaries commit, were they
once eſtabliſh't by Law, who had like to
have brought an utter deſolation upon this
our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for want of putting the Laws
in Execution againſt them? Since the caſe
ſtands thus, do's it not mightily concern
thoſe who are in Authority, to ſee that the
Doctrines and Practices of ſuch as inform
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48058:9"/>
the people, are conformable to the eſtabliſh't
Religion, and to be well aſſured, that that
be no other than what the Apoſtles taught
the Church, than what Chriſt taught the
Apoſtles, than what Chriſt receiv'd from
God the Father, That ſuch is the Religion
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we dare appeal
to our greateſt Adverſaries to alledge any
one conſiderable argument to the contrary.
Let them if they can convict Her of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
or Errour in Doctrine, of Diſorder or
Tyranny in Government, of Indecency or
Superſtition in Her publick forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>I am not altogether ignorant of the ſeveral
Reaſons which have been formerly alledged
for Toleration, <hi>i. e.</hi> in effect for indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Religion. But that which is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
and is at this day chiefly inſiſted on,
is, that by this means all heats about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
would be allayed, the diſcontents of the
people appeas'd, and conſequently the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſecured from thoſe Broils and
Commotions which do ariſe from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
put upon men in the worſhip of
God. I cannot but with horrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
reflect upon thoſe diſmal Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which <hi>Beautefeus</hi> in Religion have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
in all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this Nation. But that this is not a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48058:9"/>
means to prevent the like outrages, is moſt
apparent to all that are not willfully blind:
for was it not Toleration that gave life,
ſtrength, and maturity to the late Fanatick
Conſpiracy? and ſo long as there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
left in <hi>England,</hi> ſo long will there be
a ſeminary of Schiſm and Sedition.</p>
            <p>But the Religion which we contend for,
and that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> would have received
is altogether conſiſtent with the civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and has aſſerted the Rights of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
beyond any Syſteme of humane Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
whatever; for therein we are taught
that the ſeat of all Dominion is originally
in God; there is no Power, no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
but of God, which is implied in the very
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> all along uſed in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
to ſignifie lawfull Power, for that
comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> who is <hi>Lord of Lords and
King of Kings.</hi> To ſecure obedience to this
Power it has made Rebellion no leſs a
crime then fighting againſt God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
Damnation upon the Rebel; <hi>He that
reſiſteth the Power reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and
they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi>
And for the ſupport of this Power, it has
commanded men to pay tribute <hi>and give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar's. On what
a ſandy foundation does the <hi>Malmesbury</hi> Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
ſet his Almighty <hi>Leviathan,</hi> when he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48058:10"/>
makes love of eaſe, and the fear of Death
and wounds the Principle cauſes which diſpoſe
men to obedience; Princes would be in a
very uneaſie condition, did not Religion
tye up mens hands more then their natural
diſpoſitions; for if this were all they had
to truſt to, they muſt expect aſſiſtance from
none of their ſubjects, but ſuch as are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
uſeleſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Sluggards and Cowards.</p>
            <p>Conformable to this Doctrine of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
was the practiſe of the beſt and
moſt primitive Chriſtians, when they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under the moſt perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and then too when they were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
enough, to have made the <hi>Roman
Eagles</hi> ſtoop to the Croſs of Chriſt by
force of Arms; had not they had other
motives for their obedience beſides thoſe
of the aforecited Author, they muſt have
been Chronicled for the very Princes of
Rebellion; for they were ſo far from
the love of eaſe, that they voluntarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
themſelves to all kind of hardſhip,
ſo far from fear of wounds, that they
courted Death in her moſt terrible ſhapes.
No they had learn't obedience from a
higher and more divine principle; they knew
that Emperours were by Gods appointment,
and therefore ſolely accountable to him,
<hi>à quo ſant primi, poſt quem ſecundi,</hi> they knew
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48058:10"/>
that to them belonged the ſole Power and
uſe of the ſword, and therefore that it was
not lawfull upon any occaſion to unſheath
it againſt them, and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
Rebellion, not only as inconſiſtent
with the Imperial Laws, but moreover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of the Doctrine of the Croſs, and
thereupon inſtead of raiſing a band of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
to dethrone their perſecuting Emperours,
they rais'd an Army of Glorious Martyrs, who
reſiſted unto bloud ſtriving againſt ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
their enemies by dying for the Truth.</p>
            <p>Conformable to the Doctrine of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
and the practice of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
is both the Doctrine and the practice
of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> She dares not own
them any longer for Her Genuine Sons, whom
either ambition, avarice, or any allurements
whatſoever can tempt to a diſloyal thought,
much leſs to an Actual Rebellion. Then as
to Her conſtitution, does not Hierarchy in
the Church agree well with Monarchy in the
State? on the contrary, may not a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
parity endanger it? Independency quite
overthrow it? and what hopes that he ſhould
ever become a good ſubject, who diſputes
the lawfulneſs of his Superiours commands,
till he finds himſelf free to obey? If then we
reſpect the peace and proſperity of the nation,
regard that beauty, order and unity which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48058:11"/>
ought to be preſerv'd in the Church, if we
conſider that tranquillity and happineſs which
will neceſſarily follow from the maintaining
the eſtabliſht Religion in its Juſt Rights and
Priviledges, or would avoid thoſe miſeries
and confuſions, which will ariſe from a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of different Religions under the ſame
Monarchy, then certainly 'tis the Duty of
all men, but eſpecially of thoſe in Authority,
to receive all ſuch, and only ſuch as preach
the Word in ſincerity and truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe
who can come up to all the Heights of the
Diſcipline, Doctrine and Publick Worſhip of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I come to conſider in the ſecond
place the Danger of Tolerating thoſe who do
not preach the Word in Sincerity and Truth.</p>
            <p>And the danger will appear to be very great,
Firſt, from their numbers: Secondly, their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
Thirdly, their Zeal in propagating, and
reſolution to put their Principles in Execution.</p>
            <p>Firſt from their Numbers, where we are to
reckon all thoſe who profeſs and openly avow
a diſlike and hatred to the Government; thoſe
who are ſecret Friends and well Willers to
theſe bold Profeſſors: And Laſtly, Thoſe
who ſteer the whole courſe of their Actions
by a cowardly treacherous Neutrality; And
we are to look upon all theſe as one united In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
When ever they get an advantage againſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48058:11"/>
the Government. They have often boaſted of,
and threatned the Government with their
Numbers, and a late dying Enthuſiaſt, In the
Name of the Party pronounces, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
three Parts of the City would have been
concern'd in the Inſurrection; I hope he has
much overſhot himſelf in his accompt, but
at preſent let us take him at his word, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
their Legions as Formidable as they
would make us believe they are; But tho'
they were leſs numerous, yet their Principles
render them very dangerous, which muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
either the Church or the State.</p>
            <p>If the Church, they have made ſo many
and ſuch deadly wounds in that ſeamleſs coat,
that perhaps <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his cenſure of the old
Hereticks will be found defective, both as to
the Number and the Malignity of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Schiſmaticks. Later ages increaſing the
Number, and this laſt ſtill improving the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
of theſe filthy dreamers, who defile
the fleſh, deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak evil
of Dignities. <hi>Aetas parentum pejor Avis tulit, nos
nequiores:</hi> but I ſhall inſtance in two, and thoſe
very obvious, yet ſuch as charge the whole
Party of Diſſenters with a dangerous Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Firſt, their averſion to all Eccleſiaſtical
Order and Diſcipline, their irreconcileable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Epiſcopal Government; with publick
ſolemn Forms of Worſhip, adminiſtration
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48058:12"/>
of the Holy Sacraments, all preſcrib'd decent
Ceremonies; without which 'tis impoſſible
to maintain that one Holy Catholick and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick
Faith, which was once deliver'd
to the Saints, that Chriſt's Spouſe the
Church, ſhould become all Glorious within
according to his own promiſe, or that the
peace of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the proſperity of <hi>sion</hi>
ſhould be laſting and undiſturb'd.</p>
            <p>2. That tho' they are multiplied into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
almoſt innumerable Sects, yet each
would be thought the Elect of God, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars
of Heaven to the uttter excluſion and
reprobation of the reſt, and ſo 'twill be I Saint,
thou Reprobate to the end of the Chapter,
and yet this <hi>Cadmean</hi> Progeny always agree
in a curſed Conſpiracy to perplex and deſtroy
the Religion by Law eſtabliſh't.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we conſider their Principles
relating to the State; whatever Rebellious
Antimonarchicall poſitions have been forg'd
in the Schools, by the ſubtle Diſciples of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius
Loyola,</hi> broach'd by the more Factious Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of the Factious <hi>Calvin,</hi> practis'd by the
Holy Leaguers of <hi>France,</hi> the Diabolical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> have been all of them
faithfully tranſcrib'd and improved by our
late Atheiſtical Aſſociators, who are ſo far
from owning the Divine Right of Kings,
that they account Monarchy an Antichriſtian
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48058:12"/>
Inſtitution, and Monarchs <hi>quâ</hi> Monarchs, the
worſt of Tyrants. And there are three Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
as much believed by them, as any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of their Creed, which makes it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for any Kingdom to entertain them.
Firſt, That Dominion is founded in Grace,
the avowed Doctrine of all Enthuſiaſts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That the original of all Power is in
the People, the received Tenet of all Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans.
Thirdly, That 'tis Lawfull to reſiſt
in the caſe of Religion, a moſt Dangerous
and Impious Doctrine, and yet ſeems to be
maintain'd with the laſt breath of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Gentleman, who deſervedly fell an
early Sacrifice to Juſtice in the late Horrid
Conſpiracy. And are we not arriv'd to a fine
paſs in Divinity, when the Doctrine of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
contrary to the Expreſs letter of the
Text, ſhall be fetch'd from the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
that of Paſſive Obedience laugh'd at as
the Doctrine of the Bowſtring, and impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exploded, as if condemn'd by the practiſe
of the Primitive Chriſtians, contrary to the
whole current of Antiquity. By the help of
theſe Devilliſh Principles they can deſpiſe
Dominions, overturn Kingdoms, and trample
upon the necks of Imperial Princes; for what
King can defend his Dominions againſt ſuch
Saints, as claim under the Title of irreſiſtible
Grace, for if they alone have a right to poſſeſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48058:13"/>
the Earth, it were great Injuſtice not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
at their demand? what Prince can be
ſecure of the fidelity of His People, when a
fawning Demagogue ſhall come and tell them,
the Power which is exercis'd over you was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
yours; you paſs'd it over condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with a Power of Revocation, and ſince
'tis abus'd you are the betrayers of your own
Rights, if you do not reſume? What villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
will not they attempt, who can derive
arguments for Tumult and Rebellion from
the Goſpel of Peace and Obedience, turn Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Tears, the only weapons of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Chriſtians, into Swords and Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes,
and make the Croſs of Chriſt the
Standard of Rebellion?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Danger appears as from their
Principles, ſo from their Zeal and Induſtry
in propagating, and their reſolution to put
their Principles in execution; and here to give
them their due, they have ſtoutly born the
heat and burthen of the day, they have been
very laborious and left no ſtone unturn'd to
carry on the good Old Cauſe; and to make
the work ſure, they raiſe the ſuperſtructure of
a Fanatical Conſpiracy upon the Foundation
of a Popiſh Plot, which tho' in all the parts of
it (thoſe only excepted which have undergone
the Teſt of Authority) moſt<note n="*" place="margin">Saltem accuratè.</note> inartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
laid, in moſt attended with ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48058:13"/>
great improbabilities, and in ſome with ſuch
notorious contradictions and Moral impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
that the moſt fabulous Legend might
have ſeem'd a leſs fiction; was nevertheleſs
thro' the fears, prejudice, or popularity of
the diſaffected Laity; the credulity, indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and intemperate Zeal of ſuch Pulpiteers
as ſtil'd themſelves the men of Moderation,
carry'd on to that height, that both King
and People, Church and State were brought
to the very brink of Deſtruction. For 'twas
this Monſter of a Plot, that deluded and
frighted the unthinking multitude out of their
Wits and Allegiance; afforded a clear Stage
for deſigning Republican Gladiators once
more to play a Prize for the Crown and the
Mitre; This gave an advantagious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to diſcarded and diſcontented Statesmen,
to wreak their Malice upon their Injur'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
to deſtroy thoſe Councils which they
could not govern; and hopes to old caſhier'd
Officers to regain their Commands, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by Martial Law; This put the whole
Nation into ſuch a diſtraction and conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we became a moſt Myſterious Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to our ſelves, and a laughing ſtock to our
Neighbours. Being thus affrighted and acting
like men in a dream, what wonder if we
became an eaſie prey to our watchfull Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries?
Hence Sons of Perdition, the Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48058:14"/>
of the Innocent, were paſt upon us for the
Saviours of the Nation, and to carry on the
Blaſphemy of the Metaphor, theſe Sons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial
became ſo much the Idol of the Faction,
that in their Opinion 'twas leſs criminal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
an Article of the Chriſtian Faith, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
the depoſition of a paltry lying Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.
Hence they who refus'd tumultuous
Petitions were voted Abhorrers, Loyal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers
made Papiſts and Penſioners, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe Titles expos'd to Contempt and
Danger. Hence it became ſafer to Libel,
than Act in defence of the Government, to
talk and write Treaſon againſt the King, than
oppoſe the Arbitrary Tyrannical proceedings
of the Commons. In ſhort 'twas this Helliſh
Plot that ſet up Republican Clubs, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens't
popular Tumults, that gave Birth to
Sheriffs caſes, Guides to Juries, and rais'd ſuch
a curſed Band of <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s, as were ſure to
call light darkneſs, and darkneſs light, to find
the Innocent and acquit the Guilty: by this
they wickedly aſſault the Succeſſion, aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
erect themſelves into Treaſonable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and deliberate upon the Methods of ſuch
a Diabolical Aſſaſſination, as would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
the cruelties of either the <hi>Iriſh</hi> or the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian</hi>
Maſſacres. In one word 'twas this
that conſecrated Subornation Perjury, Schiſm
lying Viſions, Rapine Blaſphemy, Tumult
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48058:14"/>
Rebellion, and made all manner of Villany
meritorious. And now certainly after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and dire effects it may well be call'd a
Helliſh Popiſh Plot. You have heard how
great their Zeal was to propagate their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
and their Reſolution to Execute will
appear no leſs: Elſe what makes them even
to this day deny, leſſen, palliate or excuſe the
late Horrid Conſpiracy, which has been
ſo ſignally prov'd by a Judicial ſtroke from
a ſelf-murdering hand, by the Tryals, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations,
Confeſſions and Executions of
ſo many of the Conſpirators, by the flight
and Outlawries of the reſt. If they would
have us believe that their Reſolutions are
chang'd, and their Judgements alter'd, why
do they not give us ſome ſigns of true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
confeſs the ſeveralShams they have put
upon the Nation, take upon them that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſhame which is due to ſuch Notorious
Offenders, and make ſatisfaction for five years
Oppreſſion and Confuſion, and let their Zeal
appear as beneficial, as it has been prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Government? Why do they yet
Juſtifie the Treaſon, by protecting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the Traytors? But alaſs! what hopes
is there, that they ſhould change their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
when the Chief of thoſe who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
ſuffer'd for the Conſpiracy, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
the living to perſevere in it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48058:15"/>
ſhew'd a greater Affection for the Cauſe,
then for their own Souls. And have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
more ſollicitous for the procuring an
Act of Oblivion for their accomplices, than
pardon of God Almighty for thoſe crimes
which they were to anſwer for the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Elſe why did they trifle away their
laſt precious minutes, in adviſing or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Government? or why has one of
them, tranſcrib'd the very cauſe and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Faction into his Bible, and left
it as a Legacy to his beloved Siſter. Good
God! that that ineſtimable Jewell ſhould be
thus profaned and trampled upon by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
ſwine.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewn the danger of Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Diſſenters, from their Numbers, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Zeal and Reſolution, I come in
the laſt place to conſider the beſt expedient
to prevent the miſchiefs which are ſure to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from ſuch a Toleration; Which is in ſhort
a conſtant, vigorous and reſolute Execution
of all the Laws which are in force againſt
them; which I ſhall leave to thoſe whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Province it is, the Honourable my Lords
the Judges, and the worthy Miniſters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
hoping that wofull Experience has at
laſt convinc't us that all other methods will
prove vain and ineffectual; for had the Bill
for uniting Proteſtant Diſſenters paſt into an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48058:15"/>
Act, like other projects, it might have look't
plauſibly in the Theory, but would certainly
have fail'd, when reduc'd to practiſe: And
ſuppoſe out of a Balſamick Temper, and
wonderfull tenderneſs to our ſcrupulous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
we had reſign'd the Croſs in Baptiſm,
Kneeling at the Holy Euchariſt, the uſe of the
Surplice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This would have been ſo far
from giving ſatisfaction, that I fear we had
afforded them too Juſt an occaſion of Inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the nakedneſs of their Mother the
Church, which in all the heights of Her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate, is ſo far from being too Gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
apparell'd; from having too many, or
thoſe too Pompous, ſuperſtitious Ceremonies,
that She has retain'd no more than what
ſerves to keep Her decent and cleanly. He
knows nothing of the <hi>Genius</hi> of our Puritans,
who does not know they always grow Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and preſumptuous by conceſſions, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
by Toleration, Intolerable by Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
cruel and Ingrate under M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rcies, and
in a true Proteſtant way of civility, always
improve Graces and Favours to the diſgrace
and ruin of the State that beſtow'd them. But
in this critical minute, a bare ſuſpenſion or
relaxation would prove Fatal, for tho' they
are diſarm'd, yet they are not ſubdued, their
practiſes are reſtrain'd, but their Inclinations
are the ſame; And ſhould they be admitted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48058:16"/>
to another Tryall, they'd be for a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch;
former diſappointments would put
them upon a ſuddain Revenge, and like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't
Furies, they'd make you ſeverely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the bloud of their Martyrs, and
perſecution of their Confeſſors, for ſo they
blaſphemouſly call thoſe Miſcreants, who for
Treaſon have been Juſtly condemned to the
Ax and the Gibbet; or high Miſdemeanors
ſentenc'd to the Pillory, Fin'd or Impriſon'd.
They are at preſent Maſter'd by the Laws,
and the Laws will for ever keep them under,
and I hope the Juſtice of the Nation will
prevent them for ever ſaying, <hi>this is our Hour
and the Power of Darkneſs,</hi> for if that ſhould
ever happen, we can expect nothing but the
<hi>Abomination of Deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now inſtead of applying my ſelf to my
Lords the Judges (who know their Duty's
much better then I can inform them) The
Councel, the Jury, or the Witneſſes (the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Formality of this exerciſe) before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this imperfect Diſcourſe, give me leave
to make this one Remark; That when ever
theſe true Proteſtants cry out for Liberty and
Property, that then they are contriving to
bring upon us ſlavery and oppreſſion; When
ever they Alarm us with the fears of the
Growth of Popery, that then they are ſetting
up a Fanatical Licentiouſneſs, upon the Ruins
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48058:16"/>
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the beſt and pureſt
Church in the world; whenever they pretend
an extraordinary Zeal and Tenderneſs for the
Safety of His Majeſties Sacred Perſon, the
Preſervation of His Crown and Dignities, that
then they are Plotting the Deſtruction of His
Perſon and the ſubverſion of His Government.</p>
            <p>And now in the Cloſe of all, let us pray
that we may never live to ſee thoſe days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when the lives of the Innocent ſhall
lye at the Mercy of the ſtinking Breath of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mercenary, abject Wretch, that there may
be no more raking of Goals, and compaſſing
Sea and Land, to gain an incoherent contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Evidence, to take off, after a Tedious
Impriſonment, an aged unbefriended Noble:
and God reward that Honourable Bench who
had the Courage to do Juſtice to his Fellow
Priſoners; whom the crafty Managers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
and affrighted at the Deformity of
their own proceedings, (tho' often preſt to't)
never durſt bring to Tryal: To ſee Majeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
by Inſolent Petitions and Seditious
Votes; Tumults give Law to Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
Juries threatned for giving in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
according to the Truth and their own
Conſciences; Judges arraign'd and told of
Writs of Eaſe for not believing Impudent, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
contradictions; and riotous Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
more frequented than our conſecrated
Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48058:17"/>
And finally, let us bleſs God that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
to behold our Gracious Sovereign in the
quiet Poſſeſſion of His Imperial Rights and
Prerogatives, reſtraining the madneſs of the
People and the fury of their Leaders, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the intended Execrable Parricide
of the <hi>Rye</hi> Aſſaſſins., and the wicked Deſigns
of the Council of Six; ſecur'd, as in His own
Innocent Breaſt, ſo in a well choſen Loyal
Guard, and the Hearts and Affections of His
Dutifull Subjects: To ſee the Lawfull Heir
excluded by a Vote of the Factious Senate,
Eſtabliſh't in His Juſt Rights of Succeſſion,
the Injur'd Prince reſtor'd to His former
Greatneſs, and once more become (next under
God and the King) the Support of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and the Pledge of our Future Happineſs.
To ſee the <hi>Caytiff</hi> Traytor dragg'd to the Place
of Execution, the Laws triumphing over
Schiſm and Faction, the Bench Honour'd with
Upright Loyal Judges, and inſpir'd with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Noble Reſolution; to ſee Rewards
and Puniſhments, the due diſtribution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is the very Soul of Government, run in
their Proper Chanels; to ſee our Religion, our
Monarchy, our Liberty ſecure, and in a word,
the Publick Adminiſtration of all our Affairs
in ſuch Hands, as will neither Rob God of His
Honour, Defraud <hi>Caeſar</hi> of His Dues, and ſcorn
to wrong or corrupt His Faithfull Subjects.</p>
