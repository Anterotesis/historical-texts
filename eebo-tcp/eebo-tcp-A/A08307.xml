            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And endowed with many large priuiledges and dayly augmented and successiuely confirmed, by the charters of many Kings of this Land<note place="margin">The Kings auncient confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>Such were the priuiledges of this place, that the King coulde make no secular officer ouer them, but by their owne consent.</p>
               <p>They were acquitted of all <hi>Toll</hi> through England.</p>
               <p>They made Iustices <hi>ad audiendum et terminandum,</hi> within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

and no other Iustice could call them for any matter out of their libertie.</p>
               <p>They made also Bayliffes and Corroners.</p>
               <p>No Bishoppe had any Iurisdiction to correct any person among them for any matter spirituall or temporall.</p>
               <p>They had the execution and returne of all writs, and the goodes of all Outlawes: and that is yet continued to the Towne by the<note place="margin">Present Priuiledges of the town</note> graunt of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. And no man may bee impanelled out of the Towne.</p>
               <p>They had gayle and gayle deliuerie within the towne: and the towne at this day hath the like, namely one gayle for the libertie,<note place="margin">Gayle and gayle deliuerie.

               <p>The towne is gouerned by a Maior and 10. Burgesses, a stewarde and a Chamberlaine.</p>

               <p>There was sometime a great Meere or stagne, betweene this towne and olde <hi>Verolamium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and many haue constantly, but idlely affirmed, that the <hi>Thames</hi> hath had issue that way, and nauigable so farre, a thing meerely fabulous, though it be true, that an ancker

was sometime founde there. It was indeede <hi>Stagnum maximum</hi> an ample and large fishpoole of the Kinges, and belonged to his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Kingsberie before spoken of: And the Kinge for his recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and delight lying there, did often passe by boate, to and fro within the same, according to the order of the noble men and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did vsually, make fayre fishpondes aboute their houses, to recreate themselues therein: and these with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cost, as <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> wryteth especially of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full large and costly fishpondes of <hi>Hortentius, Hircius</hi> and <hi>Lucullus.</hi> And of these, and such other princely Romans, did these <hi>Verlame</hi> Citizens, take president for this great ponde, which comming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes to the king of the land, he often tooke his repasle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, accompanyed commonly with no smalle troupe of his nobles, and therefore the boates, were prouided of large hull, furnished with cable and ancer, that at the kings pleasure, the boate might be moared in any parte of the poole, whereby, how easie it is to loose an ancre in the meere reason may iudge, and this was the occasion of the losse, of the ancre doubtlesse that was found there, and not ordinarie recourse of shippes as some vainely suppose. And yet as <hi>Ouid</hi> sayth: <hi>&amp; vetus inuenta est in montibus anchora summis.</hi> This fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole<note place="margin">The ponde bought of the king &amp; drained dry</note> continued in this pryde, till the time of <hi>Alfric</hi> the seuenth Abbott of this Monastery, who bought the same of the king, and by industry and charge caused it to be drayned drie: And the more to argue it to be but a fishpoole there remayneth yet one witnesse, a streete in the towne lying towardes it called FISHPOOLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STREETE.<note place="margin">Fishpoole streete.</note>

There is indeede a feilde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe S. <hi>Albans</hi> called <hi>key feyld,</hi> and belowe <hi>Rickmansworth,</hi> a place vpon the riuer called <hi>Westhythe,</hi> which may in sort argue some such passage for boates, but for the first it may bee aswell <hi>pascuum, vacci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> a pastour for kye, or kyne, as a strande for fastening of boates or ships &amp; more like. And <hi>Westhithe</hi> may be as wel taken for a house as for a harbour of ships. And yet these simple probabilities might worke that conceite in <hi>Gildas,</hi> who was the authour of this error.</p>

               <p>This was a dangerous time when theeues and murtheres must be hyred for rewarde and not constrayned by iustice, to desist from
