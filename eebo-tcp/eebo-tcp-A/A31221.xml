         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
MOST HIGH
AND HONOVRABLE
Court of PARLIAMENT, now
Assembled.
The humble Petition of WILLIAM CASTELL,
Parson of Courtenhall in Northamptonshire, for the
propogating of the Gospell in America.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all humble manner, sheweth unto your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
wisdomes, the great and generall neglect of
this Kingdome, in not propagating the glorious
Gospell in <hi>America,</hi> a maine part of the World:
Indeed the undertaking of the work is (in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall)
acknowledged pious and charitable; but the small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
that hath hitherto been made of it, either by us or others,
having (as yet) never been generally undertaken in pitty to mens
soules, but in hope to possesse the Land of those Infidels, or of
gaine by Commerce, may well make this and all other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kingdomes confesse, they have been exceeding remisse, in
performing this so religious, so great, so necessary a worke.</p>
            <p>May it therefore please your wisdomes, to give your <hi>Petitioner</hi>
leave to propose briefly, (as the nature of a Petition requireth)
the more then ordinary piety and charity of the worke; the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
necessity, and benefit of undertaking, together with the
easinesse of effecting.</p>
            <p>A greater expression of piety (your <hi>Petitioner</hi> conceiveth)
there cannot be, then to make God knowne where he was never
spoken nor thought of, to advance the Scepter of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57768:4"/>
And now againe to reduce those, who (at first) were
created after the Image of God from the manifest worship of
Devils, to acknowledge and adore the blessed Trinity in Unity.
To do this, is to be happy instruments of effecting those often
repeated promises of God, in making all Nations blessed by the
comming of Christ, and by sending his Word to all Lands: It is
to inlarge greatly the pale of the Church. And to make those
(who were the most detestable Synagogues of Sathan) delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Temples of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>It was a high point of piety in the Queen of the South, to
come from the utmost parts of the world to heare the wisdome
of <hi>Salomon.</hi> And so it was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> to leave his native
countrey for the better, and more free service of his God.</p>
            <p>And certainly it will be esteemed no lesse in those, who (either
in their persons or purses) shall religiously endeavour to make
millions of those silly seduced <hi>Americans,</hi> to heare, understand,
and practise, the mysterie of godlinesse.</p>
            <p>And as is the piety, such is the charity of the work, exceeding
great, to no lesse then the immortall soules of innumerable men,
who still sit in darknesse, and in the shadow of death, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assaulted and devoured by the Dragon, whose greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is to bring others with himselfe into the same irrecoverable
gulfe of perdition. What those blinde and spirituall distressed
<hi>Americans</hi> are, we were, and so had continued, had not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
men afforded greater charity unto us, <hi>Divisis orbe Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannis,</hi>
by long journeying; and not without great hazzard of
their lives, then (as yet) hath been shewed by us unto them.</p>
            <p>We are not indeed indued with such eminent extraordinary
gifts, as were the Primitive Christians; but yet (if it be duly
considered) how fully and how purely God hath imparted his
Gospell unto this Island; how miraculously he hath lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
us from Spannish Invasions, and Popish Conspiracies;
how (at this time) we abound in shipping, and all manner of
provision for Sea: It will be found, that we (of all Nations) are
most for the work, and most ingaged to do it in due thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to God.</p>
            <p>Nor is the arms of the Lord shortned, or his wonted bounty
so restrained; but that undertaking the Voyage principally for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57768:4"/>
Gods glory, and in compassion to mens soules, we may expect
a more then an ordinary blessing from him, whose usuall custome
is to honour those that honour him, and most abundantly even
in this life, to recompence such religious undertakings.</p>
            <p>The Spaniard boasteth much of what he hath already done in
this kinde; but their own Authors report their unchristian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour;
especially their monstrous cruelties to be such, as they
caused the Infidels to detest the name of Christ. Your wisdomes
may judge of the Lion by his claw. In one of their Islands cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Hispaniola</hi> of 2000000 of men, as <hi>Benzo</hi> (in his Italian Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story)
affirmeth, they had not left 150 soules. And <hi>Lipsius</hi> just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complaineth, that wheresoever they came, they cut downe
men as they did corn without any compassion. And as for those
that survived, they bought their lives at deare rates: for they put
them to beare their carriages from place to place; and if they
failed by the way, they either miserably dismembred, or killed
them out-right. They lodged them like bruit beasts under the
planks of their ships, till their flesh rotted from their backs:
And if any failed in the full performance of his daily task, he was
sure to be whipped till his body distilled with goar blood, and
then poured they in either molten pitch or scalding oyle to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
him.</p>
            <p>A very strange and unlikely way to work Infidels unto the
faith, neither yet could they (if they would) impart unto others
the Gospell in the truth and purity thereof, who have it not
themselves, but very corruptly, accompanied with many idle,
absurd, idolatrous Inventions of their owne, which are but as
so many superstructures wickedly oppressing, if not utterly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the very foundations of Christianity.</p>
            <p>And although some of the reformed religion, <hi>English, Scotch,
French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> have already taken up their habitations in
those parts, yet hath their going thither (as yet) beene to small
purpose, for the converting of those nations, either for that they
have placed themselves but in the skirts of <hi>America,</hi> where
there are but few natives (as those of New <hi>England,</hi> or else for
want of able and conscionable Ministers (as in <hi>Virginia</hi>) they
themselves are become exceeding rude, more likely to turn He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
then to turn others to the Christian faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57768:5"/>Besides, there is little or no hope our plantations there, should
be of any long continuance, since here in England for some years
last past, they have been rather diversly hindered then any wayes
furthered, how and by whom, your wisdomes either have, or
will shortly find out: but this is evident, that the proud super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Spaniard (who hateth their religion, and feareth their
neighborhood, will spare them no longer then (to his over-swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
greatnesse) shall seeme good: And in the judgement of most
judicious Travellers that way, they may (if they will) easily
enough suppresse and destroy all other our Plantations, as they
did of late that of Saint <hi>Christophers,</hi> when they were no way
provoked by us, as they will now pretend they are by a latter
taking of <hi>Trinidado,</hi> and the losse of more then 150 of their men
there. At least they will be sure to be desperately assaulted, as
was the Isle of <hi>Providence,</hi> but the year last past.</p>
            <p>Whence your Petitioner offereth unto your Honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
a third Argument (drawn from meer necessity) that
as you tender the happy proceeding of those (as yet) but weakly
setled Plantations: the liberties, livelyhood, and lives, of many
thousands our deare brethren and countrey men: and which is
yet more the prosperous progresse of the Gospell, you would be
pleased to consult of such an able and speedy supply, as may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them against the now expected cruelty of the Spaniard.</p>
            <p>To which needfull supply, the better and sooner to induce
your wisdomes, your Petitioner desireth your yet a little further
patience untill he hath shewed some temporall benefits that are
thereby like to accrew unto this kingdome, together with the
easinesse of effecting.</p>
            <p>When a kingdome beginneth to be overburthened with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of people (as <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> now do) to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place where to send forth Colonies is no small benefit:
And such are the North-East and North-West parts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
between the degrees of 25 and 45 of the North latitude,
which at this time do even offer themselves unto us, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by us, against the known cruelty of the over near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Spaniard.</p>
            <p>A very large tract of ground containing spacious, healthfull,
pleasant, and fruitfull countries, not only apt, but already provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of all things necessary for mans sustentation, Corne, Grasse,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57768:5"/>
and wholesome Cattell in good competency: but fish, fowle,
fruits, and herbs in abuddant variety.</p>
            <p>If we should look no further then the South of <hi>Virginia,</hi> (which
is our owne) wee shall finde there all manner of provision for
life: besides Merchantable Commodities, Silke, Vines, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Tobacco, Deere-skinnes, Goat-skinnes, rich Furre, and
Beavers good store, Timber, Brasse, Iron, Pitch, Tarre, Rosin,
and almost all things necessary for shipping, which if they shall
be employed that way; they who are sent away may (with
Gods blessing) within short time in due recompence of their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth, returne this kingdome store of silver and gold, pearls,
and precious stones; for undoubtedly (if there be not a generall
mistake in all Authors, who have written of these places) such
treasure is to be had; if not there, yet in places not farre remote,
where (as yet the Spaniard hath nothing to do.) And in case the
Spaniard will be troublesome to our Plantations, or shall (as it
is generally conceived) be found an enemy to this kingdome,
there is no way more likely to secure England, then by having
a strong Navie there; hereby we may come to share, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to defeat him of that vaste Indian Treasure, wherewith he
setteth on fire so great a part of the Christian world, corrupteth
many Councellors of state, supporteth the Papacy and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexeth all reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>Nor need any scrupulous <hi>quere</hi> be made, whether we may not
assault an enemy in any place, or not esteeme them such as shall
assault us in those places, where we have as much to do as they.
The Spaniard claimeth indeed an Interest, little l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
in almost all <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>West Indies,</hi> but it is but by
vertue of the Popes grant, which is nothing worth, as was long
since determined by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her Councell; so as
for the Spaniard to debarre us in the liberty of our Plantations, or
freedome of commerce in those spacious Countries, were over
proudly to take upon him; and for us to permit it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
to yeeld of our own right.</p>
            <p>Especially, when we may, as now we may, so easily help our
selves: For your Petitioner conceiveth there is no great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the preparation here, or tediousnesse in the passage thither,
or hazard when wee come there. The preparation of men and
shipping, in respect of the daily happy expected accord between
us and the <hi>Scots,</hi> is (upon the matter) already made. And as for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57768:6"/>
money it is in the power of this Honourable House to give suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
without any grievance, or dislike of the Common-wealth,
who (undoubtedly) in the generall will think nothing grievous,
which shall be concluded by your wisdomes, expedient to such a
pious and charitable worke.</p>
            <p>And as for the passage, how can it be thought either tedious or
dangerous, it being ordinarily but six weeks saile, in a sea much
more secure from Pirats, and much more free from shipwrack,
and enemies coasts, than our ten or twelve moneths voyage into
the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> And as for our good successe there, we need not
feare it. The natives being now every where more than ever, out
of an inveterate hatred to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ready and glad to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine us. Our best friends the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> being with eigth and
twenty ships gone before to assist and further us. And which is
much more, our going with a generall consent in Gods cause, for
the promoting of the Gospell, and inlarging of his Church, may
assure us of a more than ordinary protection and direction. That
hitherto we have been lesse successefull in our voyages that way,
we way justly impute it to this, that as yet they have not been
undertaken with such a generall consent, and with such a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Gods glory as was requisite.</p>
            <p>And so your Petitioner having delivered his apprehension here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
more briefely, than so weighty a matter might well require,
he submits all the premises to your more full deliberation and
conclusion, which he humbly prayeth, may be with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
speed; the only best way under God to make it the better
successefull.</p>
            <p>WEE whose names are here under-written, having been
upon occasion acquainted with a motion intended to be
made by Master <hi>William Castell,</hi> Parson of <hi>Courtenhall</hi> in the
County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> to the High and Honourable Court of
Parliament now assembled, concerning the propagation of the
glorious Gospell of Christ in <hi>America.</hi> As we do well approve
of the motion; so we do humbly desire his reasons may be duly
considered: And so good a work furthered their wiser judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may resolve upon, to which we humbly submit the same.

and farther spreading of the Gospell of Christ

and ignorance.</head>
            <p>WHereas many thousands of the Natives and
good Subjects of this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi>
though the oppression of the Prelates, and
other ill affected Ministers and Officers of State, have of
late yeares, to their griefe and miserable hardship, been
inforced to transplant themselves and their families into
severall Ilands, and other remote and desolate parts of
the West Indies: and having there through exceeding
great labour and industry (with the blessing of God) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for themselves and their families, some compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb facs="tcp:57768:8"/>
and convenient meanes of maintenance and subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
so that they are now in a reasonable well setled and
peaceable condition. But fearing least the outragious
malice of Papists and other ill-affected persons, should
reach unto them in their poor &amp; low, (but as yet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition) and having beene informed, that there
hath beene lately procured from his Majesty severall
grants under the Great Seale for erecting some new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
and Commanders amongst the said Planters in
their afore-mentioned Plantations: Whereupon the
said Planters, Adventurers, and Owners of land in the
said forreign Plantations, have preferred their Petition

of them and their present estates there obtained,
through so much extreame labour and difficulty, they
might have some such Governours and government as
should be approved of and confirmed by the authority
of both Houses of Parliament. Which Petition of
theirs the Lords and Commons having taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and finding it of great importance both to
the safety and preservation of the aforesaid Natives and
Subjects of this Kingdome, as well from all forraigne
invasions and oppressions, as from their owne intestine
distractions and disturbances, as also much tending to
the honour and advantage of his Majesties Dominions,

justly to be condemned for the suppressing of the Gospell in the

            <p>But though this <hi>New World</hi> (for so it may be justly styled, as

A plot yet to bee prevented, by our King and State, if timely

by more, sometimes by lesse distance of leagues, nearer to <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>

parts of the world, as yet remaining to be discovered, how large
the Sea is that divides <hi>America</hi> from <hi>Asia,</hi> is as little knowne,
some are of opinion that it is but a narrow Sea, but it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

            <p>The forme of this spacious Country is irregular in respect of

the South-west seas of <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> (which differ not much
in latitude) the longitude both by sea and land doth not exceed
above thirty degrees. And afterwards in some places more, in
others lesse; this North <hi>America</hi> in a great disproportion falleth
to the Equinoctiall, where from the most E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much. The Northerne corner reacheth to the 53 degree; the
Nore-west, so farre as it is yet discovered, but to 48, the maine
body of it falling between those corners (which by some are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compared to hornes) riseth no farther then the 24 degree.
The forme of the South part of <hi>America</hi> beyond the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
is no lesse irregular, the generall description whereof I here
forbeare, as intending in this booke to write onely of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
part.</p>
            <p>Now for the method which I have proposed to my selfe in
the particular description hereof, it is thus. I shall begin with
the most Northerne part thereof, which is <hi>New-found-Land;</hi>
from whence keeping the Sea-coast, (the course I intend to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
constantly through-out this Discovery:) I shall forthwith
fall upon our chiefe English plantations, and so taking view of
<hi>Florida</hi> lying upon the Sea-coast for many hundred leagues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Nova-Histania,</hi> so farre as the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Sea will permit, I shall (God assisting) retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

surveigh the Islands great and small, comming in betweene the
two parts of the Continent, which (as I said before) in some
places being farre more, in others farre lesse, are divided the one
from the other.</p>
            <p>Having done with the Islands, I am againe to bend West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and according to the Sea-coast, to proceed with all the
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ger and
much richer then are the Islands, or the Northerne side of the

               </gap>nds, and the next adjacent Regions of the Nor-east Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
(with which I am to begin) afford but very little that may
invite us thither; yet I hope those who begin to reade this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium,</hi>
will either reade it over, or at least passing over these
Countries of much lesser worth, wil fall carefully to peruse what
here by mee faithfully is related out of many approved Authors,
concerning the pleasant habitations, exceeding fertility of the
earth, abundant provisions in all kinds, and incredible treasure
of many other Kingdomes and Provinces, lying Southward and
South-west down to the Equinoctiall: Yea, and if it should be
granted (as it cannot be granted without condemning of folly
and falshood, more than 50 authors who have written more or
lesse of this part of the <hi>New-World,</hi> &amp; many hundred witnesses,
who in severall Islands and parts of this wide Continent have
seene and injoyed more then I have expressed thereof) yet with
true Christians (who in some good measure understand what it
is to live or dye for ever) the preservation of many thousands of
soules out of those millions of men who now fit in darknesse and
perish eternally for want of the light of the Gospell, ought to be
of so high esteem, and so prerious in their eyes, as that though the
most, or all of the fore-named invitations should be wanting, yet
they should be content, I say not, to part with all, but with some
considerable portion of their estates, whereby a strong Navy
might withall conveniency be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the propagating of the Gospell. Now to proceed in a particular

many other Islands great and small thereunto belonging, on the

Islands; there are two of a pretty extent of good use and note,
to wit, <hi>Bacalaos</hi> upon the 49 degree, and <hi>Aves</hi> somewhat

Islands, <hi>viz. Grand Banek, Vert Banck, Banquereaux</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>

some part of Isle <hi>Britton</hi> falling to the 46 degree, whereas the

of <hi>George Popham,</hi> in the yeare 1609. entered the

setled themselves, where they continued for the space of one

able to provide for themselves, by reason of the death of both the

and sustained. But their unexpected returne, was so displeasing
to many other Adventurers here, as that for a good while after,
they cast off all care of any further Plantation there.</p>

After this, with far greater preparation was Captaine <hi>Hobson</hi>
sent forth out of <hi>England,</hi> with two of those Natives, who were
intended for Interpreters, (as having gotten some little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our <hi>English</hi> tongue) in the time of more than two yeares
abode here. But the voyage was frustrated, by reason that the
Natives then were very much incensed with our <hi>English</hi> men,
because one <hi>Hunt</hi> an <hi>English</hi>-man, had not long before most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously
allured twenty of them into his Shippe, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Commerce, and so perfidiously carried them away, and
sold them for slaves unto the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third and fourth voyage was performed in the yeare 1614,
and 1615, by Captain <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> but those neither with any
good successe, for in the former, he neither discovered any gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
or silver Mines, nor yet found any such usefull Whales as he
expected. And in the other voyage, he was taken by the <hi>French</hi>
Pirates, and by them for a while detained.</p>
               <p>A fifth voyage accompanied with a Colony of 19. families,
set forth from <hi>Plimmouth</hi> in the beginning of September, in the
yeare 1620. and on the nineteenth of November following, they
entered a nooke of the Sea ten miles from Cape <hi>Cod,</hi> and there
they stayed untill the sixteenth of December. But not liking the
place, they removed to another more fertill and more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
over against <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, where having built them a
Towne, called <hi>Plimmoth,</hi> they have continued for more than
twenty yeares. And since within these twelve yeares last past,
many hundreths of families have resorted either to new <hi>Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
or they have made other plantations, as those of <hi>Bristall</hi>
neare Cape <hi>Anna,</hi> and <hi>Connock</hi> neare <hi>Hinders</hi> Bay, where they
have continued a good while, every yeare better and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
with necessary provision for life, and not without
some indifferent intercourse and correspondency with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
upon whom they have thus far wrought, toward the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to God, as that they usually acknowledge the God of
the <hi>English,</hi> to be good, but their god (which they call <hi>Tanto)</hi>
to be nought. And yet for feare of the Devill by whom they are
expresly prohibited, they dare not frequent our Plantatione, nor
confer with our men about Christian Religion, so often as they
would. Neither indeed is it likely our men should be able to doe

               <p>Store of grasse in many places there is not, not because the soile

this course being carefully performed: They have besides store of

receive a wonderfull increase, every stalke bearing usually two

graines, which are as big, and as sweet, as our Rounsevals; but
our Country-men (besides the <hi>Indian</hi> graine) doe now sow in

But besides these, our Plantations doe at this present so abound
with Neat and Swine, as that they feed more plentifully on them
than they need; and as I have been credibly informed by divers
worthy inhabitants, that they can, upon occasion spare sufficent,

found out (as I said) by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and since amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by our country-man Master <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who affirmeth that
there are great store of Deere, Conneys, and big Squirrils, which
afford very sweet and wholesome nourishment, and no lesse
abundance of Fowle, as Peacocks, Partridges, Stock-doves,
Cranes, Hernes, Swans, Geese; as also of Fish, as Sturgeon, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Rayes, Mullets, Plaice, Soles, Trouts, Eeles, and many
more, beside infinite store of all kind of Shell-fish, and all of these
very usefull for mans sustentation: There are likewise in this
Southerne part, many Merchantable commodities, besides ample
provision of almost all things necessary for shipping, which with
a competent supply of men and Ammunition from <hi>England,</hi>
might within a short time, by Gods blessed assistance, command
the Northerne parts of <hi>America,</hi> where would be found silver
and gold sufficient, though they never went over the Line, to
abate the over-swelling greatnesse of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by whom the
Papacy is only supported, and all Protestant Churches at this
present so extreamely perplexed. There was in the yeare 1546,
a small Colony sent into this part of <hi>Virginia,</hi> at the charge of
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> but finding themselves not able long to resist
the Natives, they returned into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Second Expedition was undertaken in the yeare 1585, by
Sir <hi>Richard Grinvill,</hi> who continued not long there, but left a
Colony of an hundred and seven under the command of Sir <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael
Lane,</hi> who being greatly distressed by the Natives, were
next yeare brought back again by Sir <hi>Francis Drake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last voyage we reade of, was undertaken at the charge of
the said Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> by Master <hi>With,</hi> 1587, who finding
the former Colony gone, and himselfe not able to make good the
Plantation, returned.</p>

               <p>THE next adjacent Countrey unto <hi>Virginia,</hi> to the West and
Southwest is <hi>Florida,</hi> containing a very large tract of gronnd,
not yet fully discovered, it hath the Island <hi>Cuba</hi> to the South, and
runneth South-west to the River <hi>de Palmas,</hi> about forty miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from <hi>Panuco,</hi> a Province of <hi>Nova Hispania.</hi> The tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the aire differeth not much from that of <hi>Castile</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>
it is for the most part very fertill, but it seemeth not to have in it
any rich mines, either of gold or silver, or not to have been regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Natives, who not long since would not take the pains
to take up any of the great store of gold and silver, which was
usually cast upon that coast, by reason of many shipwracks which
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> suffered in bringing such treasure thorow the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Straits of <hi>Bahema</hi> from <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> and the South of
<hi>America;</hi> the soile is as fertil, if not more fertill than any part of
<hi>Virginia,</hi> and aboundeth with greater store and varie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of flesh,
fish, fowle and fruit, than that doth. Great store of gold and
silver is found there, which they who have written of <hi>Florida,</hi>
impute rather to frequent Shipwracke, than to any Mines
growing there, because they have farre the greater store neare
the Sea-coast, though yet there be a constant report of many
golden Mines in the <hi>Apalaci</hi> Mountaines, which divides
<hi>Florida,</hi> from the South part of <hi>Virginia,</hi> but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that many of the Sea-shores afford store of <hi>Amber
Grise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are of a tawny colour, of great stature, and
well compacted bodies, very expert Archers, exceeding active,
fierce and manly in their manner of assault.</p>
               <p>Their Religion is the same, or not much differing from that
of their Neighbours, a meere worship of Devils, wherein they
are greatly deluded by their Priests, who are great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</p>
               <p>They hate the <hi>Spaniard</hi> extreamly, more willingly they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57768:22"/>
and joyn their forces with the <hi>French,</hi> and other <hi>Christian</hi>
Nations against them. They consist of many petty Governments,
which usually infeft and weaken one another, in that respect easie
to be subdued, though they were better provided for war than
they are.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as also the <hi>French,</hi> have made many voyages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Florida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first <hi>Spanish</hi> Expedition was undertaken in the year 1512.
from the Isle of <hi>Portorico,</hi> by <hi>Portius,</hi> from whom it received
the name, for that the face of the Country hath a resemblance of
a continuall spring, but this Expedition proved to be of none
effect.</p>
               <p>A second voyage was undertaken in the yeare 1520, by <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi>
from <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> who performed nothing memorable
there, save only this infamous act of inviting many of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
into his ships, where once ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ord, he hoysed sayle, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them into miserable bondage.</p>
               <p>A third voyage was made to as little purpose, by <hi>Narvesius,
Anno</hi> 1526, who stayed so long in the search of the South-west
part of <hi>Florida,</hi> which is the most barren part, as they were faine
to eat one another.</p>
               <p>The most remarkable was undertaken by <hi>Ferdinando à Soto,</hi>
from the yeare 1536, unto 1541, in which time he with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of nine hundred foot, and five hundred horse, were the
greater part consumed, having not found out (what they chiefly
sought after) any golden or silver mines; the remainder of his
souldidiers, which were not a fourth part of those he brought
from <hi>Cuba,</hi> were after his death under the conduct of <hi>Ludovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Moscosus,</hi> brought into <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> not without great
difficulty, being often fiercely set upon, and prosecuted by the
Natives. After which very chargeable and unprosperous voyage
of <hi>Hernandus</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for many yeares did intermit any
further search of <hi>Florida,</hi> which indeed was never throughly
by them, as having searched no further than that part of the
Countrey, which lyeth opposite to the Gulfe of <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi>
and not within and beyond the Straits of <hi>Bohema,</hi> lying towards
<hi>Virginia,</hi> which is by many degrees the more fertill soyle, and
most abounding with treasure, and rich merchantable commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57768:22"/>After this the <hi>French</hi> with two of the Kings ships, every way
wel provided, by the procurement of <hi>Colinus</hi> (that most worthy
Admirall of <hi>France,)</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Ribaldus,</hi> set forth to
<hi>Florida,</hi> in the yeare 1542, where they arrived within two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
at the River of <hi>Dolphines,</hi> lying about the 30 degree, and
from thence following the Sea-coast towards the North, they
came to a very safe Port, which they named Port <hi>Riall,</hi> neare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they built <hi>Charles</hi> Fort, about the degree of 32, neare
adjoyning to the Sea-coast of <hi>Virginia,</hi> But by reason of great
civill war that as then happened very fierce in <hi>France,</hi> a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
supply being not sent from thence, a mutiny arose among
his souldiers, so as <hi>Ribaldus,</hi> though ha was well entertained, and
supplyed by the Natives, was inforced to returne into <hi>France,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some discovery made of the North-east part of <hi>Florida,</hi> not
without the losse of some men, though of more money; And in
his returne (for want of victuals) they killed one of their owne
men, and had hardly ever againe recovered <hi>France,</hi> but that they
were unexpectedly furnished with some victuals by an <hi>English</hi>
ship.</p>
               <p>After this the civill war ceasing in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Colinus</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
returning againe into grace with the King, <hi>Laudonerius</hi>
the twentieth of May 1544, set forth with three ships well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for <hi>Florida,</hi> where he arrived the twentieth of June, and
was friendly received by the Natives, but could not find any gold
or silver Mines, though he spent much travell and time in search
after them, so long as his provision was all spent; And the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
growing both unable, and unwilling to supply him any
longer, he was resolved to have returned into <hi>France,</hi> if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Ribaldus</hi> had not againe arrived there with thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of <hi>France;</hi> whose expected comming as it was very joyfull
to the <hi>French,</hi> so the Natives seemed to be highly pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
as foure of their petty Kings, the Kings of <hi>Homoloa Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatri,
Almacam, Malica</hi> and <hi>Castri,</hi> came forth to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>Ribaldus</hi> arrivall, and promised to conduct the <hi>French</hi> unto
the Mountaines of <hi>Apalactri,</hi> where store of red Mettall was to
be had, which they supposed to be gold: But this great hope of
the <hi>French</hi> soone vanished, by reason of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> comming
suddenly upon them with great ships every way well prepared,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57768:23"/>
upon whose approach the <hi>French</hi> stole away to sea, but were
forthwith pursued by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom though they as then
escaped, yet were they by a violent tempest, after shipwrack and
losse of some of their men, againe cast upon the coast of <hi>Florida,</hi>
about six and twenty miles higher to the North-east towards
<hi>Virginia,</hi> where they were forth with set upon by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
beaten out of their Forts, and almost all cruelly slaine, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

outragious opposers, joyned with him to the slaughter, and
utter extirpating of them out of <hi>Florida;</hi> and yet for all this

by the Natives, would not venture with so small a force, to stay
long in <hi>Florida,</hi> as knowing very well that the bloudy revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Spaniard</hi> might in a short time from <hi>Cuba, Hispaniola,</hi> or
other there neare adjoyning Plantations, invade him with far
greater forces, and therefore within a while returned, where he
found his worthy service to be so displeasing to the King and his
Popish Lords, as he was faine a good while to hide himselfe,
and to fly for his life, and after this we doe not heare that the
<hi>French</hi> did ever venture into <hi>Florida</hi> any more.</p>
               <p>Neither yet hath the <hi>Spaniard</hi> obtained any strong footing
there, for as yet they have no Towne of any note toward the sea
of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and but two which lye towards the Northerne sea,
the one (which is chiefest) called Saint <hi>Augustines,</hi> the other
Saint <hi>Matthewes,</hi> of great difficulty to be taken by a small Navy,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57768:23"/>
but of great import, in regard of their great wealth to them that
shall take them. And now will I only describe the Sea coasts of
<hi>Florida</hi> from the Confines of <hi>Virginia</hi> unto <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> far
better known then the Inland countries to the North of <hi>Florida.</hi>
The nearest River of <hi>Florida</hi> to <hi>Virginia</hi> of any note falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ocean, is the River <hi>Iordaine,</hi> which lyeth 32 degrees
from the <hi>Equinoctiall;</hi> from whence, about 20 leagues downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the South, towards the West lyeth the <hi>Promonntory</hi> of
S. <hi>Hellen,</hi> neare <hi>Port Royall,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> chose for the
best and surest place to begin their Plantations; between which,
<hi>Oristanum, Ostanum,</hi> and <hi>Cayagna,</hi> whereof the first is distant
from S. <hi>Hellen</hi> six leagues, the second from the first four leagues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
third from the second, eight leagues: but how far <hi>Cayagua</hi>
is from the River <hi>Iordaine,</hi> is not yet determined. From S. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
to <hi>Dos Baxos</hi> haven is five leagues, from thence to the Bay <hi>De
Asapo</hi> three leagues, thence to <hi>Cafonusum</hi> three, to <hi>Capula</hi> five,
to <hi>Saron</hi> nine, to S. <hi>Alcany</hi> fourteen, to S. <hi>Peter</hi> twenty leagues.
All Bayes and Rivers Westward falling down to the South from
<hi>Peter Bay,</hi> which lyeth about the 31 Degree to the South, to S.
<hi>Matthews</hi> Town, is five leagues, and from thence ten more to S.
<hi>Austines,</hi> directly Southward, the land so falling in upon the Sea,
from the degree of 30 and a half to 25, where the comming up of
thestrait of <hi>Bahama</hi> beginneth, having to the west side those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Rocks called <hi>Marteries,</hi> to the East those called <hi>Roques.</hi>
betweene S. <hi>Austines</hi> Towne and the Bay <hi>de Mosquito,</hi> is fifteen
leagues. From thence to the point <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>evarall,</hi> is 16 leagues;
from thence to the River <hi>Ayz</hi> is full 20 leagues and from thence
to <hi>Martyres</hi> neer as many more; so as from <hi>Cape Francis</hi> (neer
S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Towne where the land beginneth to turne direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Southward) to <hi>Martires</hi> (comming up from the Gulph of
<hi>Mexico</hi> to the Northeast parts of <hi>Florida)</hi> is neere six degrees
downeward to the Line. Not far from <hi>Martires</hi> Westward, lie
<hi>Tortugas</hi> dangerous Ilands, where the Continent of <hi>Florida</hi>
turneth againe almost directly North for near 5 degrees: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which and <hi>Tacobago</hi> which lyeth neer to the top of that
great Reach, lye the Bayes of <hi>Carlos, Tampa, Muspa,</hi> S. <hi>Ioseph;
Muspa</hi> is distant from <hi>Carlos</hi> thirteen leagues, to <hi>Tampa</hi> from
<hi>Carlos</hi> as many more, from thence to S. <hi>Ioseph</hi> are fifteen leagues,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57768:24"/>
and from S. <hi>Ioseph</hi> to <hi>Tacobago</hi> eighteene: betweene which at
S. <hi>Ioseph</hi> beginneth a great inlet of the Sea for more then twenty
leagues to the North latitude, and more then forty foure to the
Westerne longitude; in the middle of which lyeth <hi>Ante,</hi> a safe
haven, and of great import for those who intend a more full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of <hi>Florida,</hi> which as yet is bu slenderly discovered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West; for betweene it and the most Northwest parts
of <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> which are distant the one from the other four
hundred leagues, we reade but of one safe Bay, called the Bay of
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> neer <hi>Cape de Crus,</hi> and some few Rivers for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and supply of Navigators.</p>
               <p>The first River from <hi>Ante</hi> one hundred leagues is <hi>Nieves,</hi> from
whence the River <hi>Flores</hi> is twenty, from the Haven of the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> (which is of all the surest) To the River <hi>Flores</hi> is seventy
leagues, from which to the River <hi>Piscadores</hi> is as many more:
where the Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> beginneth to turne from the West
directly South, from the degrees of 29 to 25.</p>
               <p>I might here proceed with the description of <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi>
(a countrey of highest esteem with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> for riches and
fruitfulnesse;) but having passed as far as the Northwest Seas of
<hi>America</hi> will permit, I take it to be our best course to returne
back againe to view the Ilands, and the more Southeast parts of
the Continent, lying far nearer, and every way of as good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
for the propagating of the Gospell, and the setling of
some weake Plantations which we have there already, for the
continuall sending forth more Colonies, and for the obtaining
store of treasure, and many rich merchantable commodities.</p>

               <p>Now to begin the particular description, of the Ile, of
the Townes, Rivers, and Ports according to the severall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
as they lie from East to West, betweene North and
South. The most Easterne Province called <hi>Hygvey</hi> is a rough,
and mountainous place, yet well furnished, with variety of
fruitfull trees. To the South, lie two small Islands <hi>Catilina</hi> and
<hi>Zybo</hi> well provided with good nature and store of cattell, as
also the Island <hi>Saona</hi> of a larger extent, which though it be not
now inhabited, yet it is very commodious for Ships to furnish
themselves with severall sorts of provision, it abounding with
great store of fruits and wholsome cattell.</p>
               <p>The next province is <hi>Iagvagua</hi> upon the South Coast,
wherein standeth <hi>San Domingo,</hi> the onely chiefe City of the
Island built by <hi>Bartholomeus Collumbus</hi> Anno 1494. on the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

Obando</hi> to the Westside. It is neatly built and stately with
stones, and environed with a strong wall. It is the seat of an
Archbishop, and the place where the governour of the Island, and
all the Kings officers do reside, and but that it is not conveniently
supplied with water, it might wel passe for one of the best cities in
all <hi>America.</hi> It flourished exceedingly in the preceeding age, but

it selfe,) all greatly frequented especially <hi>Nizao,</hi> and <hi>Ocoa</hi> by
the Dutch, for the abundance of Suger and hides, untill of latter
yeers, trading there hath beene utterly prohibited, by the King
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> Upon this coast are three little Islands (little better
then Rocks) <hi>Beta, Alta, Vela, Frayles,</hi> wherein though there be
nothing worth observation, yet are they carefully to be observed
for the preventions of Shipwracke, The next Province to the
West, and more to the North is <hi>Baoca</hi> very mountaines, and so
hard of accesse as it cost the <hi>Spaniard</hi> very dear before he could
gaine it. The most Southwest Province is <hi>Hanigvagia</hi> very

the Land turning to the East many leagues, admitteth of a great
inlet of Sea, upon which bordereth <hi>Zagua,</hi> a Province no lesse
fruitfull, and pleasant then the former, in which standeth the
Towne called <hi>Iaguana,</hi> well provided with store of excellent
Salt. And neer unto the North, is the Island <hi>Guanabo.</hi> The
most Northwest is Cape Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> where beginneth the
first Northside Province of the Island <hi>Marien,</hi> where <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus
Columbus</hi> built <hi>Navidad,</hi> hereunto belong two Islands
<hi>Mosquites</hi> and Port <hi>Palma</hi> the one to the East the other to the
West. The next Province is <hi>Lawega Reall,</hi> extending it selfe 70
leagues in length twenty in breadth admirable rich in medowes
and Pastures. Between this Northerne Province and <hi>Yaquimo</hi> to
the South lie to other, <hi>Cibao</hi> sometime abounding with golden
mines, and <hi>Maguana</hi> with in comparable meadowes, as being
almost incompassed with two wide Rivers <hi>Niba,</hi> and <hi>Yaquen.</hi>
There are belonging to this spacious Province two Townes of

               <p>
                  <hi>Portorico</hi> lying to the North, short of the 19 Degree of the
North latitude, is to the East of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> neare sixteene
leagues. To the West of <hi>Virgo, Gorda,</hi> and <hi>Anagado,</hi> the most

Promontory of <hi>Vnezuella,</hi> in the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> to the
Northeast it is distant one hundred thirty leagues. The Climate
is very pleasant, only sometimes in the moneths of December and
January, it is infefted with too much raine; in June, July and
August, with somewhat immoderate heat, and terrible tempests,
which they call <hi>Huracanes.</hi> The land for the most part riseth and
falleth with convenient small fruitfull hils and vallies, though
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57768:27"/>
the fruitfulnesse thereof is much hindred with the over-great
store of <hi>Guiabo</hi> trees. The Townes and Ports of this Iland are
but few: about the middle of the North side lyeth <hi>Porto-Rico,</hi>
the only Towne of note, built after the Spanish fashion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into fair streets: it hath in it a safe Haven for ships, a
stately Cathedrall, and a Monastery: and though it hath no wals
it is well fortified by land and sea: yet not so, but that it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by our countrey man the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who found
there a rich booty, and at least seventy great peeces of Ordnance,
which he brought away <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. It hath since in the yeare
1625 beene assaulted by <hi>Henricides</hi> the Dutch Generall, who
though he demeaned himself very valiantly in the attempt, could
not obtaine it. The other Ports on the North side of the Iland, as
<hi>Visa, Canaba,</hi> and <hi>Cabeca,</hi> to the East of <hi>Portorico,</hi> are not safe,
as being exposed to the Northern tempests and shelves, and sands
which lye before them. In the Northwest corner lyeth <hi>Agada,</hi> a
very oportune Haven to water in, between which and <hi>Portorico</hi>
the Rivers <hi>Cami</hi> and <hi>Cabuco</hi> fall into the sea. Directly to the
West side of the Iland, somewhat about the middle, lyeth the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Guiabo,</hi> by which they passe to Saint <hi>Germin</hi> four leagues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Westerne sea, the Towne is but small, and hath
been often taken by the French. Between the harbour belonging
to it, which is the mouth of <hi>Guiabo</hi> and <hi>Aguada,</hi> directly to the
west side of the Iland lyeth the Rock <hi>Zacheo,</hi> inconvenient and
dangerous. There are other small villages in the Island but none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of great worth or note.</p>
               <p>On the Southside most to the West lieth Cape <hi>Roxo,</hi> neer
which our English have found some salt pits very usefull for
those who travaile those parts. From Cape <hi>Roxo</hi> lie the havens
of <hi>Guaima, Xaria; Guadianilla,</hi> and <hi>Guaiama</hi> distant five or
six leagues the one from the other. On the Southeast-side lie the
small Islands <hi>Bieque,</hi> on the East coast, then are onely these two
Ports Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Yabucoa.</hi> The prime commodities of this
Island are great store of Sugars, Ginger Cassia, and Neats hides.
It did abound with silver and gold, but those mines are either
exhausted, or nelected for want of worke men.</p>

pleased God, that the Canoa was carried downe the stream and
that certaine <hi>Guianians</hi> met it the same evening; (and having
never seene any Christian, or man before of that colour) they
carried him into the Country to be wondred at; and so from
Towne to Towne untill he came to the great City <hi>Manoah,</hi> the
place of <hi>Inga,</hi> the Emperours abode: Who upon the first sight
of him, knew him to be a Christian, as having seene many in
<hi>Peru,</hi> where he formerly lived, before his brother <hi>Atabalipa</hi>

called <hi>Guiana:</hi> though yet the inhabitants were called <hi>Orono<expan>

as farre as the mountaines of <hi>Wacarima,</hi> which they might
from thence behold afarre off in the Continent, beyond which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57768:33"/>
he told them, the large valley of <hi>Amariocapana</hi> did lye, whose
inhabitants were called <hi>Guianians.</hi> And that into the Provinces
which lye beyond these more to the South, there came some
yeares since multitudes of people called <hi>Oriones</hi> and <hi>Epuremei,</hi>
who possessed themselves thereof, having driven the Natives
out of their ancient inheritances; (the <hi>Cassiapagots, Eparagots,</hi>
and <hi>Arawagots</hi> onely excepted) who were then great enemies
to the Spaniard and possesse <hi>Magureguaran,</hi> a City strongly and
stately built, and withall amply furnished with gold.</p>
               <p>From hence in two dayes they rowed up neere to the River
<hi>Caroli,</hi> where the heady violence of that, and the other Rivers,
(as is usuall at that time of the yeere) permitted them not then
by water to make any higher search into <hi>Guiana.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
staying three or foure dayes, their small company was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
by direction of the Commander, to view the severall
quarters about and above the said River; which upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
they reported in generall to be very fruitfull, in well
growne Medowes and Pastures; exceeding commodious for
hunting, hawking, fishing, fowling; as having many plaines,
cleere Rivers, abundance of Pheasants, Partriges, Quailes, Railes,
Cranes, Herons, and most other Fowles; Deere of all sorts,
Camas or Antas, as big, and affording as good nourishment, and
as pleasant, as our English Beefe, Porkets, Hares, Lyons, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Leopards, and divers other sorts of Beasts, either for chase
or food. But that which most contented them, was (as being
the thing they chiefly aimed at) the great store of gold and
precious stones, the greater and lesser hils promised them, the
very stones glistering like gold; a more then probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the judgement of the best <hi>Mineralists,</hi> that the earth
lying a fathome or two deepe, under strong spars or quarries
of such stone usually called <hi>Marcasite</hi> hideth much Treasure.
Upon due consideration of the relations made of those that Sir
<hi>Walter</hi> had sent to review the Inland (agreeing so well with
what he himselfe had then seene, neere the banke of <hi>Caroli,</hi>
which he with some few musqueteers undertooke to survey) he
confidently affirmeth <hi>Guiana,</hi> in no respect to be inferiour to any
part of the world.</p>
               <p>His owne lively expressions (being a Gentleman of as great
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57768:33"/>
learning this way, as any one our age hath afforded) is worthy to
be read and seriously considered. I never saw (saith he) a more
beautifull country, nor more lively prospects, hils so raised here
and there over the valleys, the River winding into divers bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the plaines adjoyning without bush or stubble, all faire
greene grasse, the ground of hard sand to march on either for
horse or foote, the Deere crossing in every path, the birds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the evening singing on every tree with a hundred severall
tunes, Cranes and Herons of white, crimson, carnation, pearching
on the River side, the Ayre fresh with a gentle easterly wind;
and every stone we stooped to take up, promised either gold or
silver by his complexion.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship (saith he) writing to the Lord Admirall (that
then was) shall see of many sorts, and I hope some of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be bettered under the Sunne; and yet we had no meanes
but with our daggers and fingers to teare them out here and
there, the rockes being most hard of a minerall sparre, as hard
or harder then a flint: Besides, the veines lye a fathome or two
deepe in the rockes, and we wanted necessary Instruments to
have digged the treasure out. Which last clause well considered
together with what he in his booke of <hi>Guiana</hi> alleageth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(namely the violence of the waters hourely increasing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonablenesse
of the yeere, the smalnesse of his company, the
inforced leaving off his ships more then 400 miles for a whole
moneth, and his unwillingnesse to let the natives now perceive
that the intent of his comming was the same vvith the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
chiefly for gold) may in my judgement sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
those, vvho have and doe still question the truth of Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
high expressions of <hi>Guiana's</hi> riches, and the most fruitfull

them unexpectedly. Yet such was the courage and resolution
of our men, that they went up to Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and tooke it,
and in it some store of rich Tobacco; but the Spanish forces
purposely abandoned the Towne, for the better defence of the
mines, so that ours could not take them, which by reason of
Woods lying on every side neare unto them, with 200 Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
they easily defended. A more then probable argument,
that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was then possessed of those golden mines (then
sought by the English;) else, would they not have left their
Towne and betooke themselves to the defence of them? And
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in his foresaid letter maketh good proofe
of it, in naming the men in whose possession they then were;
and he further confidently affirmeth, that he was sufficiently able

grants to severall persons; as also by the Spanish Register books,
wherein appeare the abundance of Treasure the mines as then
discovered afforded, by the great summes thence arising yeerly
from the Kings fifth part. And certainly had the Spanish King
not feared, learned and experienced <hi>Raleighs</hi> future and greater
discovery and prosecution of <hi>Guiana,</hi> he would never so eagerly
have pursued him unto death as he did; which yet he had not

somewhat above the sixth degree, the Land adjoyning is as the
former possessed by the <hi>Arwaci,</hi> but is farre inferiour in regard
of fertility, and the forenamed merchantable Commodities. The
next two Rivers, or rather two in one is <hi>Sarname</hi> upon the sixth

are of all others least to be trusted; neither indeed are the
Commodities thereabout of that worth (being upon the matter
onely Brasil-wood) as might invite men to venture farre into
the Country. Twelve miles more to the South is <hi>Marawyny,</hi>
a River of a wide and deepe mouth, affording above twenty
leagues convenient passage for vessels of burthen, though yet
the comming up from sea into it is very difficult: The inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and infidelity of the borderers is as great as the other, and
the Commodities the Land affordeth of as little worth, and
therefore seldome frequented either by us or the Netherlands.
From hence more and more to the South, five other Rivers of
greater note have their fall into the East Ocean. The first is
<hi>Cajana,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Caribs,</hi> whose fall is computated to
be twenty leagues from <hi>Marawiny,</hi> the head of it to be more
then fifty from the South-west. The second and third <hi>Cauwo</hi>
and <hi>Wio,</hi> much upon the middle betweene the fourth and fifth
degree (inhabited by the <hi>Yayi</hi> and <hi>Shebaij</hi>) have their rising to
the South-west further into the continent. The most Southern
of the five great Rivers is <hi>Wiapoco</hi> (inhabited also by the <hi>Yayi</hi>)
lying betweene the fourth and fifth degree of latitude, into
whose channell many little Rivers fall. The regions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
belonging to the five foresaid Rivers, are very fruitfull,
temperate and pleasant; I say in the generall (for they are not
in all places alike.) The sea coasts (to omit further particulars)
are more hot, but yet withall moarish, and therefore lesse fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or pleasant. The Inland being mountainous is colder, but
yet more profitable, the ground that lyeth between them (both
being in some places of greater, in others of lesse extent) doth
farre exceed them both in temperature, pleasure and profit:

notice of the Sea-coasts, for besides the famous Ports, Rivers,
Islands, Promontories both on the North and South side of this
necke of ground, nothing is much worth the noting; for three
parts of it lying betweene the River <hi>Darien</hi> and the South-sea,
are taken up with exceeding high mountaines and those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
and unfit for habitation (being overrunne with wild
beasts) besides the plains and Valleys adjoyning to either, though
they be more fruitfull yet very unhealthfull, insomuch as
though formerly they were well inhabited by Spaniards, yet
now they are for the most part deserted.</p>
               <p>On the North from the gulfe of <hi>Uraba</hi> (where I left my des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of that Sea-coast) unto the River <hi>Chagre,</hi> the most
Westerne belonging to <hi>Panima</hi> government (not above forty

safe and convenient Ports, beside other places worthy conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Within the narrow <hi>Uraban</hi> sea, five leagues to the South-west
of it standeth <hi>Darien,</hi> a Towne after it was first raised in the

ten yeers; for the Inhabitants in regard of the unhealthfulnesse
thereof, betooke themselves to <hi>Panima,</hi> the chiefe Towne of
all the government upon the mouth of the gulfe.</p>

of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> five leagues distant from thence) is the
greatest, safest and every way most convenient for the mutuall
trading of the North and South Sea, by the River <hi>Chagre,</hi> many
rich and necessary commodities of <hi>Europe</hi> being from hence
continually transported to <hi>Panima</hi> whence the gold and silver

of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chily</hi> are returned hither twice every yeere.</p>
               <p>It was taken by Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> before the Towne and
Fortifications thereunto belonging were one quarter finished:
And since in the yeere 1601 when it was fully finished, it was
surprised with two ships and a pinnace by Captaine <hi>Parker</hi> (who
found there in respect of the place) but a very small booty not
above 10000 dollers; for that within a few dayes before 120000
were from thence conveyed to <hi>Carthagena.</hi>

               <p>The passage from this port Towne to <hi>Panima</hi> upon the
South sea is not above eighteene leagues (and in summer time
not hindred by Creekes of sea) not eight, so that as there is no
great difficulty with a considerable Navy to take <hi>Porto Belo,</hi> and
to secure the Navy there: so would it prove no long march nor

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57768:45"/>
Captaine <hi>Oxenham</hi> (induced by the fame of the vast treasure,
which fortunate <hi>Drake</hi> obtained in those parts) provided a ship
of a 120 Tun; in which having with him neere a hundred men,
(the winds favouring him, he came sooner then he could well
expect on the North Sea-coast of <hi>Panima</hi>) where getting as
neere as he could conveniently, for the shortest cut over to the
North sea; he landed his men, drew up his ship into a cranny,
where he left her and his great Ordnance, covered all over with
bowes. Then he and his men taking sufficient victuall, with
two field pieces, and other necessary armes, after twelve leagues
march, they came to a River which falleth into the South sea,
where he built a barge 45 foot long; in which he conveyed his
men into an Island called the Isle of Pearles (close by the side
whereof, they who come our of the South sea to <hi>Panima,</hi> must
needs passe.) Here they closely concealed themselves for ten
dayes; at the end whereof they seized upon two Pinnaces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from <hi>Peru,</hi> wherein was little lesse then 200000 .li. of
gold and silver, besides great store of rich Pearles they took from
the Islanders; both which they might certainly have conveyed
to their ship (and so into <hi>England</hi>) had not both Captain &amp; soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in their comming back in three particulars dealt very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly.
First, in too sudden discharging the two Pinnaces they
had taken by whom the Governour of <hi>Panima</hi> being much
sooner informed of the exploit then, otherwise he could have
been, made the more quick pursuit after them, with twice as
many forces as they had, Secondly, in casting the feathers of
hens they had pillaged over board, whereby they gave perfect
notice to the pursuers.</p>
               <p>Of the particular River they returned by, of which before
they were very much to seek. But most of all did they forget
themselves in an unseasonable contention concerning the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the prize; the Souldiers refusing to beare it upon their
shoulders over the land, unlesse the might know how much
should come to every mans particular share; which demand of
theirs being as undiscreetly denied, the convention lasted so
long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the forces from <hi>Panima</hi> came upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> recovered the
treasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cut them all off, or took them prisoners, whom

               <p>The next Province to the North of <hi>Soconusco,</hi> and the South
of <hi>Yucatan,</hi> having <hi>Chiapa</hi> Province, to the West is <hi>Verapaz,</hi> so
called, for that the Natives came freely in upon the preaching
of the Gospell, but having so little profited therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under such
covetous corrupt Tutors, as they know scarce any thing aright
of Christrianity, and would be very glad they could be freed
from such tyrannicall Lords. The middle part of it is somewhat
temperate, the residue is extreame hot and extreamly perplexed
with Mosquitos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> usually swarming in other parts of the Indies
which are hot and over moist as these are. Neither doth the soyle
(by reason of eight moneths raine, which most an end happeneth
continually) yeeld any store of Indian wheat, but little or none
of ours; and yet it bringeth forth abundance of medicinall
herbs, beautifull flowers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and trees most usefull and profitable
both for nourishment and building<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but withall it harbours ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wild beasts; as Lyons, Tygers, Beares, but very few for the
use of man. Nor yet (so farre as I heare) have gold or silver mines
been here discovered by the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>The most Westerne Province of all <hi>Guatimala,</hi> bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the East of <hi>Nova Hispania</hi> is <hi>Chiapa,</hi> full forty leagues long,
and almost as broad every place from South to North, in regard
of over great heat and moysture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of great store of wild beasts and
dangerous serpents much like <hi>Verapaz;</hi> as also in respect of the
innumerable profitable Trees there, the fruit whereof affordeth
toothsome and wholsome nourishment, the bodies speciall tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the gumme (which in great quantities come from them)
precious Balsome and sweet odours, the bark, gumme and fruit
very rich materials to dye colours of the best esteeme with us.
But herein it farre exceedeth all the Provinces of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> in
that being competently provided with graine, it doth breed and
maintaine great store of excellent Horses, Kine, Sheep and
Swine, besides incredible variety of the best Fish and Fowle,
onely for Mines it must give place to <hi>Honduras</hi> Province.</p>
               <p>Thus I have passed through the government of <hi>Guatimala;</hi>
I am now come to make entry upon those Provinces that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to the royalty of <hi>Nova Hispania:</hi> For the right sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing
whereof, I must of necessity againe fall to discribe the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57768:50"/>
Sea-coast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so by surrounding in <hi>Yucatan,</hi> a long and wide Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula,
save onely in the necke of it where the gulss of <hi>Honduras</hi>
and <hi>Mexico</hi> come neerest together (of no lesse then 25. leagues
compasse) the sayling on either side of it is dangerous, by
reason of many scattering Islands, rocks shelves, and sands.
From the comming up againe of <hi>Honduras</hi> gulfe on the South-east
of <hi>Yucatan</hi> to the North-east, these are very carefully to be
avoyded, as most pernitious, <hi>Elbob, Lamanary, Zaratan, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toia,
Quitazuwenho,</hi> which last signifieth as much as, now take
heed; It lyeth in the eighteenth degree of latiude, a full degree
more to the North then <hi>Guanima</hi> Isle, just opposite to <hi>cape
Honduras,</hi> but much of the same longitude with them; so as
though the gulfe on either side towards <hi>Yucatan,</hi> or <hi>Honduras</hi>
be not safe to saile in; yet by the channell thereof more then
twenty leagues broad in most places is safe and navigable. From
<hi>Quitazuwenho</hi> to Cape <hi>Conche,</hi> the most northeast of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninsula,
and neerest to the Island <hi>Cuba</hi> are neer seventy leagues,
between which comes the Island <hi>Coznmel</hi> and many petty I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands
called <hi>Mucheres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The North and North-west Sea-coast of <hi>Yucatan</hi> are no lesse
dangerous then the North-east; as being also full of sands shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
and rocky Islands, known by the name of <hi>Alcranes</hi> and
<hi>Negrillos:</hi> which though they be far remote from land, yet they
make the passage dangerous to come into the best ports of <hi>Comill</hi>
on the river <hi>Ligartes</hi> on that side, being themselus not very good.</p>
               <p>From hence to the west, the continent falling down again more
and more to the South for three degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> from above 21. to
28. all this coast (as the other) by reason of the Isle of <hi>Sands Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considla</hi> and <hi>Triangulo</hi> and some others no lesse sandy, but much
more rocky, is hazardous and make <hi>Cical</hi> and <hi>Telichaque</hi> (the
best Havens hereabouts) to be lesse frequented. Neither yet is
the Sea channell here adjoyning so deepe and free from sands,
as is safe for ships of any great burden to faile in. The land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this long and wide Peninsula, is for the most part neither
temperate nor healthfull, save onely in the mountainous places,
nor so much inhabited but onely to the North end of it, where
standeth <hi>Merida</hi> the chief Town about twelve leagues from sea,
the Governour &amp; Bishops abode, accompanied with 100 Spanish
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57768:50"/>
Families. Another is <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> 31. leagues to the East of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi>
where a great Monastry of Franciscans standeth, and where
the Natives of the region adjoyning are said farre to exceed all
others, being at least 50000.</p>
               <p>A third Towne fifty leagues to the West of <hi>Merida</hi> is <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peche,</hi>
where Captaine <hi>Parker</hi> our Country-man, Anno 1596.
with some hazard but greater honour seized (in sight of all the
Inhabitants) upon a ship laden with gold &amp; silver and other rich
commodities, and brought her away, though they made all the
resistance possibly they could.</p>
               <p>A fourth Towne is <hi>Salamanea,</hi> in the neck of this Peninsula,
not much differing in respect of longitude, though neerer a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in latitude from port <hi>Real;</hi> it belongeth to the Province
of <hi>Tabasco,</hi> of which I will say no more, but that it is very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
inhabited though yet it be of large extent, no lesse then
forty leagues, bordering upon the North-sea called the gulfe of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> as many in breth toward the South adjoyning to the
province <hi>Verapaz</hi> and <hi>Chiapa.</hi> The reasons whereof given by
Authors are, that this Country is as intemperate and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
as any other thereabouts, and affordeth but slender susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and but few Merchantable Commodities. The onely
Spanish Towne in this Province is called <hi>Senora Victoria,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the great Victory here obtained by <hi>Cortesius,</hi>
the over prosperious, because the over cruell subduer of this and
all the Country hereabout.</p>
               <p>The next Province to the South is <hi>Chiapa,</hi> much upon the
same bredth and length; whereof also little is to be said, but
that it is a more pleasant and healthfull, more abounding with
the rare, though usuall fruit of <hi>Nova Hispania;</hi> and which is
Neat, Sheep and Swine the horses are of such an excellent breed
as they are sent for as farre as <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Hispania,</hi> no lesse then 200. leagues distant. Here are likewise
many Eagles and other Fowles of prey, that now live upon such
wholsome and toothsome Fowle as may be better imployed for
mans sustentation, and by their meanes more easily taken. <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
maketh mention of one monstrous Bird, having one foot
like a Goose, and the other like a Faulcon, that liveth by prey
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57768:51"/>
taken both in the water and Ayer. There are in <hi>Chiapa</hi> many
Natives distinguished by the names of <hi>Zeques, Zeltales, Quelc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Secaulands,</hi> and among either of these there are many
Villages well inhabited. The onely Spanish Towne of note is
<hi>Cuidad Reall,</hi> seventy leagues to the North-east of <hi>Guatimala,</hi>
and as many from <hi>Senora</hi> in <hi>Tabasco.</hi>
               </p>

treasure by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Anno 1578. and by Captains
<hi>Candish</hi> 1586. This Bishoprick with the Provinces annexed are in
the generall (though mountainous) very fertill and healthfull, but
the Valley of <hi>Guaxaca</hi> (that <hi>Crotesius</hi> the Conquerer of this
Country and the regions thereabout chose for his inheritance)
doth exceed imagination in regard of fertility both of grasse and
Cattell, Corne and pleasant fruits, Fish and Fowle. Besides that
it containeth in it many gold and silver mines, much Chocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neel
&amp; Silk, strong incitements to make it so fully inhabited as it
is, both with Spaniards and Natives; the Natives being repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to exceed 150000. And though <hi>Mistica</hi> and the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
Provinces, be not every way so beneficially accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet are they so well provided with necessaries, streames a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with golden oare, small peeces of gold washed from
the mountaines, and other Merchantable Commodities, that
they also are well stored with Inhabitants; of whom this is very
remarkable, that they use the Jewish Ceremonies in particular,
Circumsicion, which they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affirme to have received from their
Ancestors.</p>
               <p>The chiefe Spanish Towne there is <hi>Auteguera</hi> standing in the
heart of the aforesaid incompararable Valley <hi>Zapoteca<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (and

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57768:51"/>
Haven towne upon the South sea standeth directly to the South
somewhat more then thirty leagues. The Bishoprick of <hi>Tlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi>
is next to <hi>Guaxaca</hi> more to the North-west, though exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
also through the whole continent from sea to sea, no lesse
then 100. leagues in length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in bredth to the South-sea but 18.
where we read of no Haven of note but to the North-sea, here
called the gulfe of <hi>Mexico,</hi> being full 80 leagues; there fall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Rivers convenient for ships to harbour, lade and unlade; as
namely, the Rivers <hi>De Banderas</hi> and <hi>Zempoal, Almeria,</hi> Saint
<hi>Peters,</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>de los Cazon.</hi> The first <hi>Banderas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within five leagues of the famous River <hi>Alucrado</hi> in <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naca:</hi>
The last not above three leagues from the River <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuco</hi>
in the Province of <hi>Panuco;</hi> which two differ full soure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in latitude; but the onely ports of note &amp; now of use with
the Spaniard are <hi>Vera Cruz</hi> and Saint <hi>Iuan-Uullua,</hi> both very
convenient and strongly defended, but the latter as being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more healthfull, and comming up to the Towne with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
water to bear ships of greatest burden, is at this prefect of
greatest imployment; and therefore every day more and more
fortified by the Spaniard. Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> in the yeere
1568. came into this Haven, where he found 22. Spanish ships
richly laden, which though he might have certainly seized upon,
yet he condiscendered to meane conditions, whereof the chiefe
was the victualling of his ships; yet neither that nor any of
the other were performed, but they with a new Navy from
<hi>Spaine</hi> falling upon him unexpectedly after agreement made,
put him so to it, as he had much adoe unvictualled, with two
ships onely to escape, and for want of provision was inforced to
set 100 of his men on land who all perished, either by the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
of the Savages who killed and eat them, or through the
cruelty of the Spaniard, who to revenge themselves under the
prentence of Religion put them to death.</p>

but that here also are some rich mines, though as yet few
have been discovered. But of this I am well assured, that the
Native Inhabitants are here more then usually to be found in
any place, whose conversion to the true knowledge of Christ,
ought in the first place to be considered by us.</p>
               <p>The Spanish Townes of note here (take them as we passe
from East to West) are <hi>Sigura,</hi> and the two Haven Townes (of
which I spake before) all three strongly and statety built, as also
well provided with pleasant and profitable fields round about
them. In the Bishoprick it selfe standeth <hi>Rubla los Angelos,</hi>
the Valley of <hi>Altisco,</hi> inhabited with 1500. Spanish Families
now the chiefe City where the Bishop resideth. 22. leagues

               <p>And now we are to come unto the heart of <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi>
even to the great City <hi>Mexico,</hi> the center of the Arch-bishoprick
(from whence it is denominated) and upon which government
(under the command of the Victory) all the rest depend. As it
lyeth to the West of <hi>Tlascula,</hi> so it hath to the North the wide
Province of <hi>Panuco,</hi> to the West and North-west <hi>Mecoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
of as large extent; the length of this Archgovernment is
taken from the Inland confines of <hi>Panuco</hi> to the South-sea,

there are many petty Provinces, now knowne rather by their

               <p>The lake of <hi>Mexico</hi> in the surrounding bosome whereof the
City standeth to the North, being more then eight leagues in
length, and in most places five in bredth, is on every side well
planted and well inhabited: <hi>Culuala</hi> as is reported consisting of
20000. Families<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Yztacapalpa</hi> of 10000. some others 4 or 5000.
A strong argument to beleeve the regions round about to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fertill. Eight leagues to the South of <hi>Mexico</hi> beyond
the lake is <hi>Zalateco,</hi> where is a plantifull silver mine. As are
also <hi>Tasco</hi> 22, and <hi>Zumpango</hi> 40. leagues to the South. Beyond
which yet more to the South, eighty leagues, from the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
somewhat above seventeen degrees of North latitude lyeth
<hi>Acapulco,</hi> the most famous port belonging to the South-sea.</p>
               <p>Of all <hi>America</hi> concerning the City <hi>Mexico</hi> it self, it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to know that it is the greatest and richest of all this new
World, standing as was formerly noted, upon the North side of
the lake, about the twentieth degree of latitude, and according
to <hi>Herrea</hi> 130. in longitude from the Miridian of <hi>Toledo,</hi> no
lesse then 1740. leagues distant the one from the other, it
consisteth (according to the relation of <hi>Cortesius)</hi> who first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
it) of three streets, whereof the least to the West is a
mile and halfe; a second to the North is three; the greatest to
the South is full two leagues in length, it is credibly reported to
be now inhabited with 4000. Spaniards, and 3000. Natives, a
small proportion in respect of what was formerly related. But
then it is now farre better built and beautified, with a stately
Cathedrall, many Churches, Monasteries and Schooles for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:57768:53"/>The temperature of this City differeth little from the regions
adjacent, in the moyst moneths annoyed with too much rain, in
the dry (which are November, December, January, February
and March) much more infested with dust, that being raised by
sudden whirlwinds, getteth up into their nostrils and produceth
many diseases, especially Fevers.</p>
               <p>There are yet two other things here very observable: First,
that this great City, either through the negligence or avararice
of the Viceroy and his Officers; in not dispending what was
yeerly allowed for repairing the mounds of the lake, was in the
yeer 1629. miserably overflown, to the drowning of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Inhabitants, and to the losse of the greatest and best part
of their houshold-stuffe and other goods, which were either dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away or corrupted by the waters.</p>
               <p>A second thing here to be noted, is that this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> last yeere (as it
was constantly reported in <hi>London</hi>) the Viceroy of <hi>Mexico</hi> and
with him all <hi>Nova Hispania</hi> were revolted, and in open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> which if it shall (as yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beleeved) prove true, it will be of high concernment to this
Nation or any other, into whose hearts it shall please God to put
an effectuall desire of dispossesing the Spaniard of his usurped
stewardship. so unfaithfully imployed (in respect of the fincere
promoting of the Gospell in the purity thereof) and so tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically
exercised, in regard of incredible oppressions, rapines and
murthers there (as their owne Authors confesse) inhumanely
committed by them.</p>
               <p>Now for the two other greater Provinces under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Mexico</hi> government: <hi>Panaco</hi> to the North, the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choacan</hi>

               <p>That part of <hi>Panuco</hi> which is said to be both in length and
bredth fifty leagues; toward the Arch-bishoprick of <hi>Mexico</hi> is
very habitable and fertill, and in times past of great note, for
silver mines (that are now thought to be neere exhausted.) But
the other part which bendeth to the North-east for fifty leagues
to <hi>Florida,</hi> so farre as it is yet discovered, is found overgrowne
with woods, and barren. The Spanish Townes here not greatly

are Saint <hi>Iago,</hi> 25. leagues to the West, and <hi>Lewis de Tampice,</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Colima</hi> is constantly reported to be very healthfull, apt
for graine and Cattell, but abounding with the choisest fish and
fruit, and not without some gold mines, though it hath more
brasse (which is there so common) that since the Spaniards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thither, they make all those instruments of brasse that we
usually make of iron. And though this South-west part be the
best of all, yet is there none (unlesse high to the North not yet
so fully discovered) but is as rich, and every way as convenient
to be inhabited.</p>
               <p>Besides <hi>Valadolid</hi> (which the Natives call <hi>Guagangareo,</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

And it is further to be observed that this inland Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
is for temperature and fruitfulnesse in most respects se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to none. <hi>Xalisco</hi> is to the West of <hi>Guadaliara,</hi> upon that
Sea-cost called <hi>Mare Pacificum,</hi> that is, the still sea. The onely
thing of observation here is an herbe, which the Native call
Curcas, highly extolled by <hi>Monardes</hi> the great Herbalist, to be
of singular use against most diseases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cametla</hi> likewise lyeth upon the same sea-coast, but a degree

                  <hi>Calfornia,</hi> though it be esteemed to be of very large extent,
yet hath it not been as yet discovered. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in

it (and was from such Savages as there inhabiting more kindly

forth of these rich mines may be guessed at by the 600. Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,

not lesse then fifteen, so as they must needs be of a very large
extent (the longitude being considered with the latitude.) But
the relations of these most Westerne North parts of <hi>America</hi>

be set downe for certaine.</p>
               <p>A Fryar <hi>Marke de Niza,</hi> (in a relation to the Viceroy) telleth

who thereupon was presently sent away to make a further
discovery with 150. horse and 200. foot, finding nothing worth
his great travaile and cost, certified so much to the Viceroy,
with an ample expression of his, and his souldiers detestation of
the Fryars fained relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quivira</hi> (which <hi>Gomara</hi> and <hi>Herrea</hi> likewise place in the

the Reader) to write little or nothing, is to write best. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salez

by one <hi>Augustinus Ruyz</hi> (one of his owne more hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
then holy fraternity) how by his powerfull Preaching to
Savages (not much inferious to his Founder Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> who
is said to Preach to wilde Beasts) converted instantly two great
Provinces of <hi>Nova Mexico, Concht,</hi> and <hi>Tiguria.</hi> But withall
he confesseth that for the killing of a zealous (it might more
truely he said of a foolish over-venturous Fryar amongst men,
who in regard of the knowledge of Christ are but beasts) one
<hi>Anthonius de Espiro,</hi> (I cannot thinke him to be inspired with
any better spirit then that of <hi>The Antichrist of Rome)</hi> made
flaughter of more then forty thousand poore, silly, ignorant

Fathers were better then other cruell, mercilesse, <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He telleth us of many thousands converted to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
faith by the Preaching of Fryars (no better inspired then
was the foresaid <hi>Anthonius.)</hi> A strange thing that a few ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Fryars should doe more in a few dayes, then all their
<hi>Spanish</hi> Clergy did in one hundred and seventy yeeres in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
farre neerer.</p>
               <p>He telleth us also, as doth his brother <hi>de Benavides</hi> (in a
