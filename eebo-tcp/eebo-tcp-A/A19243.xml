         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They ſay this was a woman, and that ſhe went verie yong out of England to Athens with a certaine great clerke who was in loue with her: and that there by hearing of good profeſſors, ſhe profited ſo much, that when ſhe came to Rome ſhe had few like her in Diuinitie. Whereupon, by her reading, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, teaching, and praying, ſhe got her ſelfe ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that vpon <hi>Leo</hi> his death ſhe was choſen Pope into his roome (as manie men ſay) by common conſent. But ſee the lucke of it; a while after ſhe was got with child by one of her acquaintance, and deliuered thereof in the time of her Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. For going vpon a time from the Vatican to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans in proceſſion, betweene the Coloſſes and <hi>S.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9076:14"/> in the ſame place, with her litle one by her. Now in hatred of her filthie dealing, and for continuing of the memorie of ſo leud a part, the Popes to this day when they go in proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in reſpect of their diſlike of that place of her trauell, which was in the midſt of her way, forſaking it, do turne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by-lanes and by-ſtreets, till they haue left that on their backes; and then returning into the ſame ſtreete againe, they go forward with their proceſſion. And for auoiding of like miſchiefe in time to come, it was decreed: That none ſhould be conſecrated Pope, before the yongeſt Cardinall Deacon had tried by touching (whileſt the partie to be conſecrated ſate on a cloſe ſtoole) that he was a man.

               <p>Good words I pray you ſir. <hi>Florimondus</hi> may be honeſt enough for any thing you ſay againſt him. For he<note n="*" place="margin">Loco citato.</note> writes, that he hath two editions of this <hi>Wernerus,</hi> the one bearing date what
<note n="*" place="margin">Viz. 1480.</note> yeare it was printed, the other without date, but very ancient. And theſe two (as he ſaith) do differ in reporting the ſtorie of Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> and in nothing elſe. Now it may be that though in yours it be as you ſay, yet in his it is otherwiſe.</p>

This Pope (as they ſay) was a woman, &amp; being caried in her youth in mans apparell to Athens, by one who was in loue with her, ſhe profited ſo much in diuerſe kinds of learning, that ſhe had no fellow: in ſo much that coming to Rome, and reading there Grammer, Logicke and Rhetoricke, ſhe had of the greateſt Rabbins there many auditors and ſcholers. And being much eſteemed of in that Citie, both for her life and learning, with one voice ſhe was choſen Pope. Now in the time of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, ſhe was got with child by ſome of her familiars: and not knowing ſhe was ſo neere her reckoning, as ſhe went from <hi>Saint Peters</hi> to <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> Lateran, betweene the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe and <hi>Saint Clements</hi> Church, ſhe was deliuered of a child; but died thereon, and was there (as they ſay) buried. And becauſe the Lord the Pope doth alwayes ſhunne that way, it is thought by ſome, that he doth it in diſlike of the accident. And ſhe is not numbred among the Popes: partly becauſe of her ſexe, partly becauſe of the filthineſſe of her fact.
