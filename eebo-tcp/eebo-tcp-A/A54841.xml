            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now to consider my present Text in the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner that I am able, I must bespeak your best Attention, not so much to the <hi>dogmaticall,</hi> as to the <hi>Applicatory</hi> part of my Meditations. It being chiefly in my design, to shew what <hi>Profit</hi> we are to <hi>reap</hi> from all such melancholy Solemnities, as by many deep <hi>Mourners</hi> are <hi>sown</hi> in Tears. What kind of Influences and Virtues, from the great <hi>brittleness</hi> of our Lives, are to be shed upon the <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of them. What kind of <hi>Consectaries</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi> should flow from the <hi>one,</hi> upon the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not therefore wear out my little Time, in any such accurate and logicall <hi>Analysing</hi> of the words, as would but serve to divert you from the <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>drift,</hi> for which the holy man <hi>Iob</hi> did make them a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98875:8"/>
part of <hi>his</hi> Preaching, and for which I have chosen them to be the subject of <hi>mine own;</hi> but shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately consider them as an entire Doctrinall Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, exhibiting to us both the <hi>frailty,</hi> and <hi>frame</hi> of man, and the <hi>reason</hi> of the one implicitly rising out of the other. <hi>Man is born of a woman;</hi> there's his <hi>Frame. He hath but a short time to live,</hi> there's his <hi>Frailty.</hi> He hath but a short time to live, <hi>because</hi> he is born of a Woman; there is the <hi>reason</hi> of his Frailty from the <hi>condition</hi> of his Frame. Nor is He attended onely with <hi>vanity,</hi> but <hi>vexation</hi> of <hi>spirit.</hi> As <hi>Iacob</hi> said unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> His Dayes are <hi>evil,</hi> as well as <hi>Few.</hi> However <hi>empty</hi> of better Things, yet from the <hi>Bottom</hi> to the <hi>Top,</hi> (I mean from his Birth unto his Buriall) he is <hi>Repletus miseriis, fill'd full of Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet by way of <hi>Application,</hi> we may reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text in a threefold <hi>Antithesis.</hi> For</p>
            <p>To Man as <hi>born of a woman,</hi> we may oppose the same Man, as being <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and <hi>born of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the very <hi>short life</hi> he hath by <hi>Nature,</hi> we may oppose the <hi>life eternall</hi> he hath by <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to his <hi>fullness of misery</hi> whilst he is here in the body, we may oppose his <hi>Fullness of Bliss and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first let Man be consider'd in his <hi>Hypogaeo,</hi> that is, his state of <hi>Declination,</hi> as he is <hi>born of a woman,</hi> and having a <hi>short time</hi> to live; and that for this reason, <hi>because</hi> he is born of a woman. For tis a Maxime in Philosophy which never fails, That Generable and Corruptible are Terms convertible.

                  <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 21.</note> and <hi>naked shall we go out of it.</hi> Or it concerns us rather to say with David, that <hi>we are strangers upon Earth,</hi>

Or if we were able to understand it, yet our <hi>hearts</hi> are too <hi>narrow,</hi> to give it entrance.

            <p>The <hi>end</hi> of Christ's coming into the world, was <hi>to make us live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.</hi> (Tit. 2. 13.) the first implying our whole duty towards our <hi>selves,</hi> the second towards our <hi>neighbour,</hi> the third towards our <hi>God.</hi> That extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of whom I speak, doth seem to <hi>me,</hi> as well as <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> to have reached those ends.

            </p>
            <p>To pass on therefore towards his <hi>death,</hi> as the fittest transition unto his <hi>buriall;</hi> I am enabled to say of him, (by such as were eye and ear witnesses,) that he abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly injoyed [that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] that happy <hi>calmness of death,</hi> which the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> was wont to pray for. I say he injoy'd it in <hi>both acceptions</hi> of the word. For first however he was sick of a <hi>burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> (which carried him up like <hi>Elias</hi> in a <hi>fiery Chariot</hi>) yet he had this <hi>rare</hi> happiness which is the priviledge of a few, that he even <hi>injoyed</hi> his whole <hi>disease</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least taint of <hi>deliration.</hi> That knot of union betwixt his body and his soul, was not violently <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> but very leasurely <hi>untyed;</hi> they having parted like <hi>two friends,</hi> not by a rude <hi>falling-out,</hi> but a <hi>loving farewell.</hi> Thus was his <hi>Euthanasia</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> acception of the word. But he had it much more, as to the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> For</p>
            <p>Two things there are, which are wont to make death terrible. The first is <hi>suddenness,</hi> and the second is <hi>sin.</hi> He was so arm'd against the <hi>first,</hi> that he did not onely take care for the <hi>setting his outward house in</hi>

trash his flight towards a <hi>better;</hi> but he also sent for the <hi>Divine,</hi> to imp the <hi>wings</hi> of his devotion; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told his <hi>Physician,</hi> that <hi>God had sent him his summons;</hi> so well was he arm'd against the <hi>first</hi> of those <hi>Phobera,</hi> and that by the help of our English <hi>Litanie,</hi> which prompt's us to pray <hi>against sudden Death;</hi> and which he commanded one of his servants to <hi>assist</hi> him with upon his death bed, bestowing upon it (when he had done) a great deal of holy <hi>admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, so well was he prepared against the <hi>second,</hi> that for the <hi>tenderness</hi> of his conscience, and his deep <hi>resentment</hi> of all his sins, <hi>those of the times</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in which he deplored his unhappiness that he had had <hi>a great share,</hi> (till God was pleased in much mercy to shew him that <hi>errour of his judgement,</hi> by which the <hi>errour of his practice</hi> was bred and cherish'd,) Next for his <hi>hatred of himself</hi> in the remembrance of them, (though we may say, that in <hi>comparison</hi> with many others alive and dead, he had kept himself <hi>unspotted from the world,</hi>) then for his steadfast <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi>

            <p>But some may say, that <hi>sick</hi> persons are ever sorry<note place="margin">Object.</note> for their <hi>sins;</hi> but it is many times a <hi>sorrow</hi> squeez'd out by <hi>sickness.</hi> And as soon as they <hi>recover,</hi> they do <hi>relapse</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98875:20"/>To which I answer, that though it is often so in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet in this <hi>exemplary</hi> Christian it could <hi>not</hi> be so. For</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> it was a mark of his <hi>sincerity,</hi> that he look'd upon his failings, as through a <hi>Macroscope;</hi> which made them seem <hi>nearer,</hi> and very much <hi>greater</hi> then they were. He warn'd all those who stood about his sick bed, to beware of those sins which the world call's <hi>little;</hi> and of the <hi>no-little</hi> sins which the world calls <hi>none;</hi> yea from the least <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 22.</note> 
               <hi>appearances</hi> and <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities</hi> of sin. It was his own expression, that <hi>all the sins of his former life did even kick in his very face;</hi> yet<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it was another good token of his <hi>sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that he was not meerly a <hi>death-bed penitent,</hi> whose repentance too too often is but [a <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was another mark of his <hi>sincerity,</hi> that he <hi>insisted</hi> on the nature of <hi>true repentance,</hi> which still importeth an <hi>amendment</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi> of life. Nor had he a willingness to <hi>recover</hi> his former health, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to the end he might <hi>demonstrate</hi> his <hi>renovation,</hi> by that <hi>carefullness,</hi> that <hi>fear,</hi> that <hi>indignation,</hi> that <hi>vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desire,</hi> that <hi>zeal,</hi> yea that <hi>revenge,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, it was a comfortable token of his <hi>since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> that he was <hi>obstinate in his Prayers,</hi> against the <hi>precept</hi> of his <hi>Physician,</hi> and resolv'd to pour out his soul, though to the prejudice of his body. As if he were piously ambitious of being too strong for his own infirmities; when a reverend Divine (who was standing by) would fain have done that office for him, at least as a Deputy to his <hi>lungs</hi> onely, that he might not spend his <hi>few spirits</hi> as yet left in him; he made him this resolute and hasty, but pious answer, that <hi>whilst a tongue was in his head whereby to speak, and whilst he had breath in his body to move and animate his tongue,</hi> and <hi>whilst he had lungs in his brest to supply his breath, he would shew forth the goodness and the glory of God, who had been pleas'd to do so great things for him.</hi> And in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Answer to all his Prayers, which he continued to the <hi>amazement</hi> of all that heard him, (after some <hi>conflicts</hi> which he had had with the <hi>ghostly enemy,</hi> that so he might be happier in a <hi>victorious,</hi> then he could possibly have been in an <hi>untempted</hi> innocence,) God was pleased (<hi>very signally</hi>) to reveal himself to him, <hi>to speak peace unto his conscience,</hi> to fill him inwardly <hi>with joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> to give him some <hi>glimmerings</hi> and <hi>fore-tasts</hi> of <hi>the glory to be revealed.</hi> That I may use his own words, (which, as he came out of a <hi>trance,</hi> he was observed to speak,) <hi>he had a ravishing glimps of the Beatifick vision;</hi> meaning thereby (as I interpret) that God had refreshed his drooping soul with his unspeakable comforts; saying unto his soul,

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, it was another great sign that <hi>his heart was right towards God,</hi> and therefore not treacherous to <hi>himself,</hi> that he extended his care to the souls of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> with as true a charity, as to his <hi>own;</hi> exhorting <hi>one</hi> in particular against the <hi>love of this world;</hi> charging <hi>another</hi> to be watchfull against <hi>intemperance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch;</hi> exciting a <hi>third</hi> unto <hi>frequent and servent prayer.</hi> I do but <hi>mention</hi> the severall subjects, on which he <hi>treated</hi> like a <hi>Divine.</hi> To all his servants in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and to three of them in special (for his words like <note n="*" place="margin">
