         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue forged no new Author, I haue falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

the points in issue: which be these;

            <p>If they do not teach and practise so, I will

            <p>There is a <hi>Babell</hi> spoken of &amp; literally vnderstood
in the old Testament: there is a spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically
meant in the Olde, and literally in the New
Testament. Both are spoken of in this place: the one
historically and literally; the other allegorically,
and in a mysterie: and this interpretation is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; for it is ordinary with the Prophets in the
old Testament, when they speake of matters literally
true at that time, in &amp; vnder them to point at further
matters, of a more spirituall and higher nature. For
howsoeuer to destroy the literall and historicall sense
of the olde Testament (with some old, and many late
writers that be Papists) is worthily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the
Church as iniurious to Gods word: Yet the literall
sense once layd, we may then warrantably extend the
text to the allegoricall sense, as far as we see the holy
Ghost in the New Testament, to goe before vs, or to
giue vs leaue. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> makes an allegory of <hi>Noahs</hi>
Arke, and makes that business a <hi>type of Baptisme</hi>

            <p>Touching the olde and <hi>literall Babylon,</hi> all these
points haue bene long agoe verified vpon her, since
the <hi>Prophet</hi> vttred them: The Church of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament

               <hi>would haue cured her:</hi> But she<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                  <p>First therfore let vs obserue this generall doctrine,

not <hi>desireth</hi> onely but euen <hi>seeketh</hi> their good: this
did the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> to their enemies &amp; persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
For these Babylonians had done the greatest
hurt to the Church and kingdome of Israel, that euer

these wrongs is heauie to be borne: but all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and especially, for a Christian after all these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
to be mockt for his religion, and to see his God
dishonored, oh how bitter is it to the spirit of a man.
Yet, after all this what do Gods people? not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it and put it vp; but further, doe both wish and
seeke their good; <hi>We would haue healed Babell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus to doe is a marke of Gods childe, and a signe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18782:12"/>
of a true Church. For to doe euill for euill, and good
for good, is no more then nature; <hi>euen the publicans,</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>doe so much</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 46.</note>: to recompence euill
for good, is worse then nature; it is malice, &amp; peruerse
corruption: and therefore (saith <hi>Salomon); Hee that
doeth so, euill shall neuer depart from his house</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Prou. 17. 13.</note>.
But to doe good against euill; that is aboue nature, it
is grace, and a good euidence of Gods spirit: <hi>thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>you are the children of your heauenly

                  <p>Hereupon for the vse of this doctrine, we may see
a comfortable euidence, that our Church is the true
Church of God; seeing that wee pray daily for the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which curseth vs: and it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruable,

Gods prouidence it falleth out that our publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is the same or the next day, when they haue
publikely cursed vs: and this is the facte of our whole

be good, that <hi>priuate men, blessing their cursers,
are the children of God;</hi> then sure this is not ill: <hi>the
Church that blesseth her cursers, is the Church of God.</hi>
Let them therfore still go on in cursing, if they needs
wil: but let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take heed, least as <hi>they loue cursing, so it
come vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as they cloth themselues with cursing

                     <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 109. 17. 18.</note>: we, contrariwise, let vs

of them he loues, namely, their conuersion, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

and prayest for, and seekest for many things for thy
children, and thy friends, thy wife and family. Thou
clothest them, &amp; feedest them, &amp; prouidest for them
(else thou art <hi>worse then an infidell</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> and preferrest
them, and much more: but all this is for the body.
But, canst thou say, from a good conscience, <hi>I would
haue healed their spirituall diseases: I haue heartily wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and faithfully endeuoured their saluation.</hi> This
is to be a true friend, a true father, a worthy husband,
and a good wife: happie they that haue such friends
neere them.</p>
                  <p>2. Obserue further, they seeke the saluation euen of
their persecutors: so doth alwayes the holy man. <hi>Paul</hi>
was put in prison, the <hi>gayler</hi> tormented his body, and
<hi>Paul</hi> healed and saued his soule<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 16. 24. to the 35.</note>. Many a sinner, is
made a happie man, by his prisoner: and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
oft times by their patience, their prayers and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instructions, conuerted their executioners &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.
As in the former point, a holy man is like
to <hi>God:</hi> so herein, to <hi>Christ;</hi> who when <hi>Iudas</hi> and the
<hi>Iewes</hi> were conspiring his destruction, the same houre
was ordaining the holy sacrament, and establishing
the meanes of their saluation<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 23.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Israel</hi> liues in <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp; would gladly haue
her as holy as themselues; <hi>we would haue healed her.</hi>
It sheweth the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the nature of holy things:
they are <hi>fire</hi> (not in the flint, hardly bet out; but) <hi>in the
bosome, that will not be concealed.</hi>

of them: He is indeede greedy to gaine them;
but not to keepe them secret and to himselfe, as in
worldly things wee are: nay he desires and ioyes to
impart them to others; and it is the ioy of his heart
to see others as good or better then himselfe.<note place="margin">Numb. 11. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Woulde
God</hi> (saith <hi>Moyses) all Gods people were Prophets:</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> wished from his heart, not <hi>Felix</hi> the president
and <hi>Agrippa</hi> the king alone, but that <hi>all that heard
him,</hi> were like him; not a prisoner and <hi>in bonds,</hi> but in
<hi>grace and goodness</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 26. 29.</note>. Hardly shall a man heare such
voices in the world; I wish others were as rich as I, as
high as I, as learned as I, as much in credit and fauor
as I. No: these things make men base and seruile, self-louers
and priuately minded: but grace and holiness
is of a royall and excellent nature, and inlargeth the
heart wherein it is, with such loue to other men, as
nothing more contents him that inioyeth it, then to
make others as good as himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, where it is said, they <hi>would haue healed the
Babylonians</hi> with whom they liued; see what a good
neighbour, a holy man is: he comes, he dwelles, he
soiournes in no place, but hee seekes the good of it.
<hi>Lot</hi> would gladly do good in <hi>Sodom:</hi> if hee can doe
none, at least <hi>his righteous soule shal be vexed, for their
sinnes</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 8.</note>. <hi>Israel</hi> soiournes in <hi>Babel,</hi> and had rather
be away; yet while they be there, they will <hi>cure her</hi>
if they can: and if she cannot, yet <hi>Babel</hi> shall thereby
knowe that <hi>Israel</hi> was amongst them. Thus the
whole shyre and parish shall fare the better by one
good man dwelling among them. Hee comes no
where but presently he considers what that people
wants, what is their disease, what he may doe to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18782:14"/>
heale them, or any way to helpe them: he comes no
where but he leaues behind him signes of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
monuments of his holinesse, and a sweet sauor
of his vertues. Thus euery place is better for him
where he comes: and when he is gone, his memory is
blessed,<note place="margin">Extinctus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabitur idem.</note> his vertues praised, his name honored, &amp; his
person loued. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise, the wicked leaues behind
him the stinke of his vngodliness, and monuments of
his pride, his cruelty, his wantonness: <hi>Come</hi> (say they)
<hi>let vs leaue som toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our pleasures in euery place</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Wisd. cap. 2. 9.</note>.
Thus euery place is worse for him, while he staies, &amp;
his memorie rots when he is gone. Let vs learne of
Gods Church here, so to behaue ourselues in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where we liue, or where we come, that the good
may be helped, &amp; the euill healed by vs, that we may
be able to say; Them I found good, I encouraged:
whom I found sinfull, <hi>I would haue healed.</hi> Thus shall
we be honoured while wee are there, praysed when
we are gone, and euer loued and blessed both of God
and good men: and <hi>the mouth of wickednesse shall bee
stopped.</hi> And thus we haue the particular good they

would, as we may see in SHIDRACH, MISAK: and
ABEDNEGO<note n="b" place="margin">Dan. cap. 3.</note>, Noble yong Gentlemen of <hi>Israel:</hi>
and the <hi>people</hi> would haue cured her, as is plaine both
here, and in the 137. Psalme.</p>
                  <p>Where we may learne, that howsoeuer properly,
and peculiarly, and more principally it is the office of
the Minister: Yet it belongs also to euery Christian,
to performe the duties of holy and spirituall edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to them with whom he liues, for their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
good. Not onely the Prophets here would haue
cured <hi>Babylon,</hi> but euen those three young gallants,
being noble Courtiers, gaue a worthy example, to
all of their age and ranke, of admirable courage and
constancie in Gods cause, chusing rather to die, then
deny their God and worship an Idoll, checking the
Kings impietie, and condemning his idolatry to his
face, rather like Prophets then Courtiers. Such were
their speeches, and such their sufferings, their words
so wise, their sufferings so valorous, and all for their
God, that this alone had bene sufficient to haue <hi>cured
Babell,</hi> had she not beene incurable. Oh happy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

that cherisheth such Courtiers: the diuell should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue his Church, where God hath but his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
if it were thus in Christian kingdomes. The <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
also had their hand in this good businesse, they
ceased not in all the time of their captiuitie, to vse all
the means they could to bring <hi>Babel</hi> from her genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme,
and Idolatry; and therfore here are bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she is at the point of her destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>We</hi> for

                  </p>

errors, discouering their impieties, and laying before
them the excellencie of true religion.</p>
                  <p>2. By their continuall <hi>example,</hi> practicing their
own religion euen before their very faces, not fearing
their scornes, and rebukes, no not the contrary lawes
made purposely against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as we may see in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

would cast away their musicke and depriue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

(had they not bin incurable) and it is to be hoped
that the sight hereof did good vpon some of them.</p>
                  <p>3. They endeuoured to heale them by their <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
praying continually and desiring God to heale
them: for as the Parent is said to <hi>blesse</hi> his childe, by

                        </gap>um. &amp; 48. 15 &amp;c. to 21.</note>; so one may be said
to <hi>heale</hi> another, by praying that GOD may heale
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18782:15"/>
him. And that they did this dutie, is no question:
for it was so commanded them by the Lord; <hi>Seeke
the prosperity of</hi> Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>&amp; pray to the Lord for it</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Iere. 29. 7.</note>.
By these meanes, they endeuoured the curing of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
tho they were no prophets: and by these means,
may one priuate man further the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of another.
Thus euery good man is as it were a litle pastor to his
neighbour: &amp; happy were it for the Church of God,
if all priuate persons would performe these duties,
one to another.</p>
                  <p>The third and last circumstance is, <hi>whom</hi> they
would haue healed: the Text answereth; <hi>Babel:</hi> where
we obserue two points.</p>
                  <p>First, that the Israelites aymed not at the conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the great ones, and men of State only, but euen
at all the people of <hi>Babell.</hi> Whereby, it is apparant
they sought not themselues: for then they would haue
fisht for the great ones only or especially (as doe the
Iesuites, &amp; craftier sort of Friers at this day<note n="b" place="margin">See Watson in his Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets often.</note>); but
they sought the saluation of soules, which they knew
to be all alike before God. For they had learned afore
they came at <hi>Babel,</hi> that <hi>euery soule is Gods, the soule
of the sonne, as well as of the father</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Exek. 18. 4.</note>, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of the subiect &amp; seruant as well as of the king
and commaunder, and the meanest mans as well as
the mightiest: and therefore they endeuoured the
conuersion of all.</p>
                  <p>The godly and conscionable Minister, must heere
learne to haue care of the least &amp; poorest soule in his
parish, considering it is as deare and precious as the
best. For, as good hands <hi>made</hi> it, as the best<note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 22. 2.</note>: as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood was shed to <hi>saue</hi> it, as for the greatest
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18782:16"/>
mans on earth<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3. 28. 14</note>. Therefore, let them not bee like
those proud spirits, &amp; carnal minded men, that thinke
ordinary parishes not worthy of them, and therefore
will preach no where but at the Court, or in great &amp;
solemne assemblies: nor like those, who in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
will be acquainted with none, conuerse with
none, conferre with none, visit none, but the rich and
mighty; but as for the poore, they may liue and die as
they can, for them. Such men might remember the
blessed apostle, who <hi>kept back nothing, but taught</hi> (not
in Courts and Palaces, and great houses only, but)
<hi>through euery house</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 20. 20. vers. 31. vers. 26.</note>, and that he <hi>ceased not to warn
euery one,</hi> and stood vpon it boldly, that he was <hi>cleere
from the blood of all men</hi> (see: not some, but <hi>all</hi>): and
in another place expounding himself saith, his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
course is to <hi>witnesse Gods will both to small and
great</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 26. 22.</note>. He that lookes for <hi>Pauls</hi> reward, at Gods
hand, must thus behaue himselfe to Gods people,
remembring his account is not for trifles, but for
soules, and to that God who hath told vs afore hand,
<hi>Euery soule is mine</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The good father of the family must learne here, not
himselfe, &amp; his wife onely, but to see that his children,
&amp; seruants &amp; those not some of the chief, but all, euen
the meanest may knowe and serue God. Such a man
was <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was not carefull for <hi>Isaac</hi> alone, his
deere sonne, the sonne of the beloued: but oh (sayth
he to God) <hi>that euen</hi> Ishmael <hi>might liue in thy sight</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Gen 17. 18.</note>:
&amp; therefore God becomes <hi>Abrahams</hi> surety, he giues
his word for him; <hi>I know</hi> Abraham <hi>that he will</hi> (not
looke to some of his principall officers, but) <hi>command</hi>
(not this son or that daughter, but) <hi>his sons &amp; his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18782:16"/>
to keep the way of the Lord</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 18. 19</note>: &amp; yet in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
house were 318. <hi>persons borne &amp; brought vp, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 14. 14</note>.
More shame for the great men of this age, both in
City and country (who though they bee great, and
daily plot to be greater, yet keepe they not so great
houses and families as <hi>Abraham</hi> did): in whose fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
many of their inferiour officers, and seruants, doe
scarce euer come to Church: And much more shame
to some parents, who being blessed of God with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
children do partially respect some of them, and
seeke their good of soule and body, &amp; neglect others,
who it may bee are more worthy: what would they
do if they were profane and vndutifull <hi>Ishmaels,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they are so vnmindfull, and respectlesse euen of such
as be holy, and dutifull <hi>Isaacs?</hi> but let such children
comfort themselues in this, that God their better fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and best friend is no respecter of persons. These
are the ordinary faults of fathers &amp; mothers in these
daies: but assuredly, those that be <hi>heires of Abrahams
faith</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3. 7.</note>, will distribute their loue to euery one, &amp; care
for the soule of their meanest serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; take order in
their families, that al their officers, euery day (at lest in
their course) may go to church, &amp; their very kitchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boies,
&amp; hors-boyes, may learne <hi>to know the God of
their saluation</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">1. Chr. 28. 9.</note>; that so he may be able to say with a
good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, I found my family a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fused <hi>Babel</hi> of
disorder &amp; profanenes, but I haue heartily endeuored
to make it a little Church: &amp; tho my family be great,
yet there is not one whom I would not <hi>haue healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus they would haue <hi>healed</hi> all: but where began
they? whom did they desire to win first &amp; principally?
certainly the greatest: as namely the K. &amp; Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellers of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18782:17"/>
State. This course tooke <hi>Daniel,</hi> in whom (more then
in any one) this prophecy was fulfilled: who after he
had done the busines for which the king sent for him,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fell he to the busines of God, wherof is spoken in
this Text, namely to see if hee could <hi>heale the king: ô
King</hi> (saith he) thou art a king; but there is a higher;
<hi>know, know, that the heauens beare rule. Wherefore ô
King, let my counsell be acceptable vnto thee, breake off
thy sinnes by repentance, &amp;c. Lo, let there be a healing of
thine error</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 4. 24.</note>. Well knew <hi>Daniel,</hi> that if once the
King would abandon his Idolatrie, and imbrace the
truth, easily would the people be induced to follow
him: So, whereeuer is true reformation either of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in doctrine, or corruption in manners, it must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at the highest; els it will be to little purpose. To
little effect, were it in the naturall body, to heale the
hand &amp; foot, when the head is deadly sick; but heale
the head first, and then more easily the body will bee
cured: So in the spirituall body, how should <hi>Babel</hi> be
healed, when the King will not? how should they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christian, when the king persists a heathen?
euen so in our State, how shal popery be extinguisht?
how shall vaine swearing, wantonness, profaning of
the Sabboth, bribery, and other the sins of this age be
reformed in the body of the people, if they be suffred
to harbor in the Court, and to creepe into the Kings
priuy Chamber? Priuate persons will hardly bee
brought to detest those sinnes, that are the common
practices &amp; recreations of great persons. Therefore
we haue cause to blesse God for giuing vs such a King,
as hath care of religion, and who in his owne person,
is an enemie to poperie, a detester of wantonnesse,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18782:17"/>
and iniustice, and many vile sinnes too commonly
found in persons of his place. And let vs not cease
to pray, that God would confirme him in all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that he may still go on with <hi>Dauid</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the sinnes of the greatest, and them that are
neerest him: for when a King saith, <hi>No wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

Shew if you can one nation, of your religion, but

till one MOYSES, and after him one SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVEL,

you are to bee deemed and condemned for

And what though you can pleade continuance of
some hundreths of yeares, yet what is that to our
time? for when you can scarce shewe three poore
housholdes in all the earth of your Religion, (as
namelie, in the daies of ABRAHAM and long
both before and after) then can we prooue that all
the Kingdomes and Nations of the whole earth were
of ours.</p>
                  <p>Neuer brag that <hi>Abraham</hi> was of your religion,
and therefore you are antient: for his Father and his
Grand-father were ours, and therfore we are elder. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
during all the time you haue had your Kings
and Priests, shewe one nation by you conuerted,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18782:19"/>
or one that came and ioyned with you, of all that
time: and tho God suffered you for a time, yet see
how at the last he hath brought you downe; and as
you forsooke vs and the ancient religion, which we
will keepe and maintaine; so he hath now giuen vs
power ouer you, to conquer your kingdome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
your religion, as it hath deserued: therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
labour to bring vs to your noueltie and new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled

to seduce vs into your secret and schismaticall, and

Church: neuer speake of healing vs: heale your
selues seely fooles, for you haue neede; as for vs, we
are well, we are farre better then <hi>Israel</hi> can make vs.</p>
                  <p>Thus did <hi>Babell</hi> cast away the good counsell that
the Israelites gaue them, and pleased themselues in
the like carnall arguments, &amp; fleshly conceits, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists

themselues in farre better case then the Israelites: &amp;
yet when God comes to giue the verdite, they are
sick; and which is worse, are <hi>past healing.</hi> Here we may
learne</p>
                  <p>1 First the pittifull estate of wicked men, They are
wounded; nay, they will be wounded, but will not
be <hi>healed;</hi> they will wound themselues; but neither
can <hi>heale</hi> themselues, not will let others heale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: are
not they worthy to <hi>perish?</hi> they are in the fire, &amp; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18782:19"/>
they not worthy to <hi>burne?</hi> being in prison, the doore
set open to them, and they will not stir to come out;
are they not worthy to bee <hi>slaues</hi> for euer? they are
deadly sick: the Physition comes to them that is able
to heale them, and they will not heare them: are they
not worthy to <hi>die?</hi> O deafe adders, that stop their
eares against the voice of the best and wisest char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers!
and yet these men are the mockers, and scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of them that be godly, and the discouragers of
many a man in the waies of God Some seeing their
worldly prosperity, stand amazed, and enuy their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
but alas, why should any man do so? for if their
estate be rightly considered, they deserue rather to be
pittied, then either enuied, or any way regarded.</p>
                  <p>Further, heere we may see how it fares with Gods
children in this world; oft times they must lose their
labour, when they haue sincerely, and zealously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
the conuersion of sinners. <hi>Israel</hi> would
haue heale <hi>Babel:</hi> but when all is done, <hi>she will not be
healed.</hi> So saith <hi>Salomon, Rebuke a scorner and he will
hate thee</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Prou. 9. 8</note>. No maruell, if this be so with priuate
men, when the Ministers and Prophets of the Lord,
find oftentimes so little profit of their great labours,
that they cry out; <hi>I haue laboured in vaine, and spent
my strength in vaine</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Esay. 49. 4</note>. And Ministers may not
thinke much hereat: for the Prophet makes that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
not in his owne person onely, and his fellow
Prophets, but euen in the person of Christ himselfe,
whose labour was much of it lost in this respect. For
it is apparant in the Gospell how little hee preuailed
with many of his owne nation, yea with the learned
Rabbines the Scribes and Pharisies<note n="a" place="margin">Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the excellent sermons made all the time before,
went not <hi>Iudas</hi> away fuller of Sathan then hee came<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 27</note>? And to conclude, did not God himselfe preach
from heauen, a notable sermon to <hi>Cain?</hi> and was hee
not worse for it? &amp; being hellishly inraged, instantly
after the Sermon ran out and slewe his brother<note n="c" place="margin">Gan. 4. 7.</note>?
Thus howsoeuer <hi>Gods word neuer returns in vaine,
but prospers in the work whereabout the Lord dooth
send it</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Esay. 55. 11</note>: Yet, it is here apparant, that it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<hi>the sauour of life to life,</hi> but often <hi>of death to
death,</hi> in whose mouth soeuer it is spoken.</p>
                  <p>Wee must heare learne, not to bee discouraged in
our courses of seeking mens conuersions; Priuate
men to practice the dueties of admonition, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. vnto their neighbours that bee out of the
way: Nor Ministers, to preach the word, with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
For howsoeuer thy labor may be lost to som;
yet know, thy labour is neuer lost before God: for be
it <hi>the sauour of life, or of death,</hi> it is a <hi>sweet sauour to
God,</hi> (sayth the Apostle<note n="e" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 14 15. 16.</note>: and tho in regarde of
men that wil not be cured, <hi>thou hast laboured in vain,
and spent thy strength in vaine;</hi> yet, saith the Prophet,
<hi>My iudgement is with the Lord, and my work with my
God</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Esa. 49. 4.</note>. And let not the good man of God be too

                  <p>For the first, <hi>how</hi> is <hi>Babel</hi> to be <hi>forsaken</hi> when there
is no more hope of curing her? the answere is, not
in <hi>loue</hi> and affectionate desire to do her good: but still
the wicked man is to be pittied, still to be loued, still
to be mourned for, still must the godly man wish wel
to him, tho he care not for it, but scoffe at all. Thus
when the Prophet had called vppon the people,<note n="g" place="margin">Ier. 13. 16. 17</note>
                     <hi>Heare and giue eare, be not proud, but yeelde &amp; turne
and repent, and giue glory to God before he send darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp;c.</hi> He then addeth: <hi>But if you will not heare
and obay, my soule shall weepe in secret for your pride,
and mine eyes shall drop downe teares, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the
good man sends vp many a sigh, and sheads many a
teare for the wicked, that neuer giue one groane for
themselues.</p>
                  <p>Nor must we forsake them in prayer; but though
they seeme to vs neuer so incurable, wee must still
praie vvithout ceasing to GOD for them: for <hi>that
that is impossible to vs, is possible inough with
the Lord (h) God forbid (sayth</hi> Samuel) <hi>that I should
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18782:21"/>
cease to pray for you</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">1. Sam. 12.</note>: and so must we say of all,
euen the greatest sinners; saue onely them that sinne
against the holy Ghost (which no priuate man, but
onely the whole Church can discerne and iudge of)
<hi>God forbid that I should cease to pray for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither must we forsake them by a finall separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
neuer to come at them, nor to assist them any
more: but still we must be willing to go againe, and
do our endeuour, if euer there be hope that they will
be healed. <hi>Forgiue</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>not seuen onely, but
70. times 7. times.</hi> When a sicke man is froward and
impatient, then the good Physition must be the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
&amp; tho he haue come oft, &amp; to no purpose, yet if
at last he will be healed, he must not <hi>forsake him;</hi> so
must Gods children reioice, if after neuer so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses,
the wicked will be content at the last to <hi>heare
and to be healed.</hi> Thus wee must still loue and pittie
them, still pray for them, and still be ready to do them
good: and in these three respects we must <hi>not forsake
them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But wee must <hi>forsake Babel.</hi> First in regard of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation:</hi>
we must separate our selues from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
mans company and societie, as far as lawfully &amp;
conueniently we may, after we see him obstinate and
incurable: it is Gods commandement, <hi>Flee from the
midst of</hi> Babel: <hi>depart out of the land of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Ierem. 50. 8.</note>: and do not this slackly and slowly (like <hi>Lots</hi>
wife<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 19. 26</note> 
                     <hi>but be as the hee Gootes before the flock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the meanes: for after that
by her often and obstinate refusall, (ioyned with
spightfull contempt both of the meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and the men
that brings them) she hath shewed her selfe to be a <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18782:21"/>
swine, then pearles are no longer to bee cast before
her, holy things must no more bee giuen to such Dogges;</hi>
but they are to bee left to their vomit and mire, till
God shew either his mercie, or iustice vpon them,
either in their conuersion or confusion.</p>
                  <p>Thus must she be forsaken: and the reason why
(which is the second point) is double.</p>
                  <p>First, in regarde of our selues: wee must forsake
the wicked when they are incurable, lest in steede of
dooing good to them, wee take hurt our selues, by
beeing polluted by her contagion, or made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of her sinnes; and consequently, of her punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
God giueth this reason himselfe: <hi>Flee out
of the middest of</hi> Babel, <hi>and deliuer euerie man his
soule, be not destroyed in her iniquitie</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Ierem. 51. 6</note>. Therfore
after that a christian man perceiues there is more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to get hurt <hi>from them,</hi> then hope to do good <hi>to
them,</hi> he is bound no longer to stay; nay, he is bound
to leaue them &amp; looke to the safety of his owne soule
and body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the meanes vsed to heale
them: which because they be the holy ordinances of
God, &amp; pretious <hi>pearles;</hi> therefore are they not to be
exposed to the contempt of wicked men, not to bee
troden vnder the foule feete of their peruerse and
scornefull spirits: Both these reasons doth Christ co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
together. <hi>Giue not that</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is holy to
dogs, neither cast your pearles before swine; least they
treade them vnder their feete, and turning againe all
to rent you</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 7. 6</note>. Christ would neither haue his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
abused, nor his children hurt by the wicked
men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:18782:22"/>Thus we see the <hi>maner how,</hi> and the <hi>reasons why:</hi>
Now let vs see the time when <hi>Babel</hi> must be forsaken;
<hi>when she is incurable,</hi> but not til then: first, long time
is to be spent, all meanes to be vsed, all waies to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all patience to be practiced, &amp; all wisedome to be
exercised, all occasions to bee taken, that probably
may preuaile to doe them good. But if after all this,
they be incurable, and out of hope; <hi>then</hi> must we <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> but not till then, not till there bee no hope
at all: he that forsakes <hi>Babel</hi> till then, is wanting in his
duetie, and hath much to answere for before God. For
if the Physician may not forsake <hi>this vile body</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
as there is any hope of life; then how may any man
forsake the soule that is pretious, <hi>&amp; that cost so preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bloud</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 19</note>? Surely, the spirituall Physician must
neuer forsake a Church, a people, or a man, as long
as there is any hope of curing and conuerting him.</p>
                  <p>Heere is condemned the practise of two sorts of
men amongst vs. First, such as be now tearmed <hi>of the
separation,</hi> formerly &amp; vsually called <hi>Brownists;</hi> who
forsake our Church, and cut off themselues from our

of their owne deuising; these men haue made
a grieuous rent, and giuen a deepe wound into the
peace of our Church: they vse this place and others
like against vs, &amp; say; <hi>Wee would haue healed you, but
you will not bee healed, therefore we forsake you:</hi> but
they abuse the place; therefore, I will turne the point

their errors, and this their bitter and schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
separation. To this end I would aske these men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18782:22"/>
but 4. questions: whereunto if they can giue me satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
I will be one of them.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, whereas you say that <hi>Wee are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
incurably, and will not be healed, I aske; Wherein</hi>
are wee deadly or incurably wounded? what funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
wound is in our doctrine? what deadly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is in our discipline, such as eats out the heart,
and life, &amp; being of a Church? what booke of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
scripture receiue we not? what holde we for
Canonicall, that is not? what sacrament that Christ
ordained do we want? and what haue we more then
Christ ordained? what article of faith deny wee? or
what holde we for an article of faith that is not? what
fundamentall heresie doth our doctrine maintaine?
what haue we in our Church, that ouerthrowes the
beeing of a Church? what is necessarily required to
make a Church, that we do want? Do not say, These
be many questions: for if you will haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all in one
generall, I will end it as I began; Wherein are wee
deadly &amp; incurably wounded? if I should walk a while
on your owne grounds, &amp; grant you that which you
can neuer proue; yet wil it not follow that we are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably,
or deadly,</hi> wounded. A man may want a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or haue some blemishes in his face, and yet be a
strong and perfect man, sound, and heart-whole, and
able to ouerthrow his enemies: so, tho there were in
our Church, those wounds you speake of, yet do they
not come neere the heart, they be not deadly, they
may blemish the beautie, but indanger not the life of
our Church. The Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi>
had other kind of blemishes then ours hath; (blessed
be God.) <hi>Corinth</hi> doubted or erred in the great article
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18782:23"/>
of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> 1. Cor. 15. The Galathians erred
fouly in the high and maine point of <hi>Iustification;</hi> and
yet <hi>Corinth</hi> a <hi>Church of God sanctified in Christ Iesus.</hi>
1. Corinth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. And Galatia, though almost <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to another Gospell,</hi> Galathians. 1. 6. yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>a Church</hi> for all that. Galat. 1. 2. And if you
will adde to these fundamentall errours in doctrine,
corruptions in manners, and disorders in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
you can with no shewe of truth lay such to the
charge of our Church, as is apparant were rise in the
Church of Corinth: and then shall Corinth bee a
Church, and not England? Let the Lord bee Iudge
betwixt you and vs. Therefore, if wee should grant
vnto you that our Church were blemished or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
yet not beeing <hi>deadly wounded,</hi> your separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from vs is schismaticall and vniust: and more
hardly deale you with <hi>our Church,</hi> then did Gods
Church euen with <hi>Babell;</hi> who <hi>forsooke her not till
she was deadly wounded,</hi> and past life. To conclude, if
<hi>Israel</hi> might not forsake <hi>Babel</hi> till then; then what are
you that dare forsake a Church of God, wherein yee
haue found God, if euer ye found him yet; and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the diuell himselfe cannot shew one <hi>deadly wound:</hi>
Blessed be the Lord that hath so healed vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing they say that we are <hi>wounded,</hi> but
as for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues they be <hi>healed,</hi> &amp; therefore they must
separate, and so keep the sound from the sicke; I aske
them this question: Are they healed? then where
were they healed? where were they called? where
were they regenerat &amp; begotten to Christ? was it not
in the wombe of this <hi>our Church,</hi> &amp; by meanes of the
immortall seede of Gods word, that is daily sowen in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18782:23"/>
our Church, and by the ministry of those men that
were called by our Church, and yet cleaue to our
Church, &amp; mourn for their separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; by the deaw
of that blessing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, which is dayly poured vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
our assemblies, from Gods merciful right hand?
Then how can they deny that to bee a true Church,
a holy Church, a Church of God, wherein ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men are called, and brought to God? And how
vnthankfull and vndutifull are they to their <hi>spirituall
mother,</hi> to forsake her, and cast the dust of contempt
in her face, that bore them in her womb, and brought
them forth the sons of God? To auoid this, what can
they say, but one of these two things: either that there
is indeed a true ministery of the word amongst vs; but
it is not powerfull to any but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: that we haue
the word truly preached, and so as it may conuert a
man; but it is not <hi>the sauour of life</hi> to anie, but such
as come into their couenant: (but from this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and hellish pride, good Lord deliuer them; or els
let them bee assured, such a height of pride, is sure to
haue a feareful fall.) Or if not this, then must they say
that they were not called, in our Church, but since
they left vs: But they haue bard themselues already
from that plea. For, it beeing obiected to them that
they haue left our Church, not out of conscience, but
out of carnall discontents, and vpon fleshly reasons,
and worldly grounds; they all stoutly answer and stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stand to it, that they do it not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any such grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
not for any reasons of flesh &amp; bloud; but meerly and
only out of conscience, and for their saluation; and
that gladly they would haue staied, but with a good
conscience they could not. If this be true, then they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18782:24"/>
had conscience before they left vs: then where came
they to that conscience and care of their saluation,
but in our Church? Now, a good conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee seuered from regeneration and an effectuall
calling: therefore, they cannot deny, but they were
regenerate, and called in our Church; vnless they wil
say, they had no conscience when they forsooke vs:
which if they doe, then I will yeeld that my question
is answered.</p>
                  <p>If they grant they were called afore they went, and
that stil they who fall from vs to them, are called; then
how can that be but a true Church, wherin by their
own confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, men are ordinarily begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God? &amp;
how can that be but a lawful &amp; holy ministery, which
brings men to saluation? therefore, (vpon their own
grounds) they haue no iust cause to leaue vs. For that
Church and Ministry that brings a man to <hi>grace,</hi> and
to <hi>faith,</hi> is able to bring him to <hi>glory</hi> &amp; <hi>saluation:</hi> and
that which is able effectually to <hi>begin,</hi> is able effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to <hi>finish</hi> the good work of God in any man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they be <hi>healed,</hi> and we still deadly <hi>wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
then I ask them: How haue they sought, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
endeuoured our healing? and till they haue
done al that possibly can be done for our healing, <hi>how
dare they forsake vs?</hi> For if the Israelites might not
forsake <hi>Babel</hi> til then; shall they forsake vs, afore they
haue put all meanes to the farthest? if they be healed
already, why doe they not more seriously labour the
healing of others? They cannot but knowe, there be
many in our Church curable inough, if they coulde
shew them to need their healing: why then doe not
they stay amongst vs, to heale and helpe vs? He is no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18782:24"/>
good <hi>Physician,</hi> that flies and forsakes his <hi>Patient:</hi>
they therefore if they be healers, and would heale vs
as they pretend, why do they not stay with vs, &amp; shew
vs our wounds, and apply the meanes to heale vs? But
contrariwise, they forsake vs, and runne into corners
and raile on vs, and call vs <hi>Babylon, Antichristian,</hi> and
the <hi>synagogue of the wicked,</hi> &amp; that we are no church,
and Christ is not amongst vs. Are these the plaisters
with which you wil heale vs? is this the way to heale,
to make wounds wider and deeper then indeede they
be? Hee is a pittifull Physician, that makes his Patient
worse then he findes him: but he is not tolerable, that
makes him worse then indeed he is, or wil make him
belieue he is heart sicke and deadly, when his finger
aketh. They alledge persecution, and that therefore
they cannot stay with vs but are constrained to leaue
vs: but assuredly (were it true that they say, that wee
were deadly <hi>wounded,</hi> and they able to <hi>heale</hi> vs) then,
seeing they cannot say that all amongst vs are incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they would care for no danger that could befall
their <hi>bodies,</hi> so that they might heale our <hi>soules</hi> and
gaine them to God. Therfore I conclude, that if we
would grant them their owne grounds, that they are
as good as they pretend to be, and wee as ill as they
would make vs; yet notwithstanding, their separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is vnchristian: because its certaine none of them
can haue assured testimony to his conscience, that he
hath done al he can possibly for our healing: til which
time no man may forsake another; especially no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
forsake another: and least of all a priuate man
forsake a Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and lastly, if they will needes leaue our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18782:25"/>
Church, <hi>whither will they goe?</hi> To leaue one thing,
for another <hi>no better,</hi> is seely; but for <hi>a worse,</hi> is folly
and madnes. But they will say, they leaue vs to take
the better: then shew me a better religion, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Church then the Protestant Churches of Europe
are, and the religion amongst them. You will not go
to the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> for they (you say) are worse then
we: much lesse to the <hi>Papists,</hi> for they apparantly are
worst of all: whither then? wil you go to the Church
of the <hi>Lowe-countries?</hi> but they are of our confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wil you go to the Churches of <hi>France?</hi> but they
are of our confession. will you goe to the Church
of <hi>Geneua,</hi> or the free Cities of the Empire? but
they are of our religion. will you goe to the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to the
States, &amp; Princes of <hi>Germany?</hi> but they are all of our
confession, and so professe themselues to bee<note n="q" place="margin">See the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</note>.
Looke ouer all Christendom, and you shall not finde
a Church that condemneth ours, nor any that is not
of our religion, nor any one but that professeth it self
to be of the same confession with vs, and not to differ
from vs in any substantiall or fundamentall point.
Whither then will you go? or what remaines for you
to goe vnto, but vnto your corners &amp; conuenticles,
where you are <hi>your owne</hi> caruers, <hi>your owne</hi> Iudges,
<hi>your owne</hi> approuers, but haue not one <hi>Church</hi> in
Christendome, to approue you.</p>
                  <p>So that then it remains, it must either be graunted
you, that you are better then all others, and that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Gospell preached thus long, since
the reuealing of Anti-christ) there is not one true
Church in the world but your selues: or els you must
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18782:25"/>
grant that ther is no better Church for you to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
if you forsake vs. Therefore play the wise mens
part; forsake not our church til you can shew a better.
And tel vs not of <hi>France, Scotland, Geneua, Zurick, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,
&amp;c.</hi> for they be all ours, and not yours: they wil &amp;
do all approue vs as a glorious <hi>Church,</hi> and condemn
you, as factious, and <hi>sohismatical.</hi> And seeing you can
finde none better (all things considered) &amp; haue none
to fly to but your selues (who are the <hi>parties</hi> now in
question, &amp; therfore no fit <hi>Iudges</hi> of the matter) looke
well about you; and if vnaduized zeale haue caused
this bitter separation, then by your <hi>returne</hi> make vp
that breach againe, which by your <hi>reuolt</hi> you made
in our Church: Returne againe into the bosome of
the <hi>Church,</hi> aske pardon of that your <hi>Mother,</hi> who
brought you forth children of light: Come, &amp; ioyne
with vs against the <hi>Papist,</hi> the common enemy; who,
by our diuision hath gotten ground vpon vs all.</p>
                  <p>Remember <hi>Peters</hi> answere, when Christ asked
the Apostles, after so many fell from him, what (saith
hee) <hi>Will you also goe awaie?</hi> Alas Master, sayth <hi>Peter,
Whither shall wee goe? thou hast the words of eternall
life</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn, 6. 61</note>. So will you say, if true humility and sauing
grace possess you, when your deere mother in whose
wombe you were conceiued, and with whose brests
you haue bin fed, shall ask you (after so many reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to popery) what, <hi>Will you also goe away?</hi> Alas!
<hi>whither should we goe</hi> from thee? thou hast the <hi>words,</hi>
and thou hast the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> of eternall life. Yea,
malice it selfe cannot denie but wee haue them; and
he who gaue them vs, grant we may long enioy them
<hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18782:26"/>And as for you, my brethren (Brethren I call you,
because I am sure we had both one <hi>mother</hi>) look well
about you, and consider of the bitter effectes like to
follow, vpon this your separation: remember that
they will all lie heauy vpon you. And do not say, you
are driuen out: for if it be the Church, &amp; if the words
of eternal life be here, nothing in the world ought to
driue you from it. Nay, your separation was wilfull:
therefore, let your return be voluntarie: and til then,
esteem as basely and censure as sharpely of vs as you
list; but knowe, that <hi>for this diuision of</hi> Ruben, <hi>are
great thoughts of heart</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Iudg. 5. 15.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The second sort of men, whose practice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
by this doctrine, be such, as refuse publicke
places in the Church, and common-wealth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
themselues into priuate and discontented cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and will not bee employed for the publicke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they pretend the dayes are euil, and many sores
in our body incurable, vnlesse there be other order
taken for their healing. To these men I would say but
two words.</p>
                  <p>1. Are the dayes <hi>euill?</hi> the more need haue they to
be <hi>amended</hi> by each ones helping hand. And if wee
have any wounds in Church or state, more cause hath
each one that loues the peace &amp; health of Ierusalem,
to indeuour the present <hi>healing</hi> therof, least they fester
and growe worse.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, are the times euil? Nay, are they not
made euill by thee? at least, are they not the worse for
thee and thy sinnes? Who can shew his face and say;
I haue committed no sins, that may be in part a cause
to bring downe the spirituall and corporall plagues
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18782:26"/>
that are amongst vs? Then what are they that are so
busie to complaine of the <hi>times,</hi> and so slacke to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of their <hi>sins?</hi> But it is a trick of hypocrisie, to be
so eagle eied in prying into the illnesse of the <hi>times,</hi> &amp;
so blind and dull in considering his owne <hi>sinnes,</hi> the
cause of all that ill. Thou, contrariwise, out of a holy
and humbled heart confess, that seeing thy <hi>sins</hi> haue
made the <hi>times</hi> worse then els they would haue been,
therefore thou hast cause to endeuour for thy part to
make them better. Then set thy shoulder to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and put thy neck to the yoke, remembring that
euen <hi>Babel it selfe is not to be forsaken, till it be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incurable,</hi> &amp; past al hope: But being incurable (as
here the text saith) shee is; therfore, saith the church,
<hi>Let vs forsake her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Babell</hi> beeing forsaken of the Church,
what remains to be expected? nothing but ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance
and destruction.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>For her iudgement is come vp vnto heauen, &amp;c.</head>
                  <note place="margin">The 4. point.</note>
                  <p>IN these words is laid down the last point; namely,
what becomes of <hi>Babel,</hi> when being incurable she
is forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Church: she <hi>is made ready for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and destruction.</hi> Here we may learne (amongst
many others) two most worthy doctrines.</p>
                  <p>First, what the wicked get by persecuting, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
and seeking to root out Gods children: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
euen nothing but the hastening of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18782:27"/>
The <hi>Babylonians</hi> cared not for the <hi>Israelites</hi>
company: but as soone as they were gone destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
came vpon <hi>Babel.</hi> Whilst they stay, the wicked are
spared: but when they are gone, vengeance breakes
out. Whilst <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>Sodom</hi> it perished not: Nay,
(sayth the Angell to him) Haste thee away, for <hi>I can
do nothing til thou be safe from amongst</hi> them<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 19. 22.</note>. See,
God the good King is more carefull to saue one of his
owne seruants, then to destroy a thousand enemies:
but see their madnesse, they mocked and flowted this
<hi>Lot,</hi> scorned him as a stranger, and many wayes <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his righteous soule,</hi> were weary of him, and his
company, and tryed euery waie, to make him weary
of the Towne; for they held it worse, as long as hee
was in it: at last they haue their wills, and he forsakes
them; but with him their protection is gone, &amp; now
<hi>fire, and brimstone,</hi> falls from heauen on them. So,
at this day doe the wicked and worldly men: whom
hate they, whom accuse they, whom abuse they, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lie they in waite for, whome persecute they, whome
would they destroie, whom banish they, whome are
they weary of, but of the godly men? When they dy,
they bid them be gone, and wish that all were gone
after them; not knowing (poore fooles) that if these
men stood not in the gap, the fire of Gods wrath had
long since broken out vpon them; and when they are
gone, then they are wel apayed, and are glad: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
what haue they gained? euen as much as <hi>Sodom</hi>
did when they had cast out <hi>Lot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may heere learne, what a fearful and
daungerous thing it is not to bee healed by spirituall
Physicke (that is) not to profit by the word of God,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18782:27"/>
nor to be conuerted from sin, when God giues means<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
For, what is this but an euident testimonie of Gods
heauie wrath, and a certaine forerunner of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<hi>Will not</hi> Babylon <hi>be healed?</hi> then what followes
but <hi>destruction?</hi> So in the new Testament, <hi>If our Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
be hid,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul, it is hid to them that perish</hi>
                     <note n="w" place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 3</note>.
For as if at noon day any man say the sun shines not,
it is because he is blinde and cannot see: So, if in the
sun-shine of the Gospell, some see it not, but in the
midst of that light liue in darknesse, its certaine they
are blinded by Sathan, &amp; if they continue so are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vp for iust damnation. A fearful example we haue
hereof in the sonnes of <hi>Eli,</hi> of whom the Text saith,
their Father hearing of all the euil they did, called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and reproued them, and gaue them good &amp; ghostly
counsell, able (a man would haue thought) to haue
turned their hearts; especially comming from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from him that was the Iudge and Prophet
of the Church: But all in vaine; for, notwithstanding,
<hi>they obayed not the voice of their father:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 25.</note> and mark the
reason; <hi>because the Lord would s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ay them.</hi> Wherby its
apparant, there is not (ordinarily) a surer signe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
then not to obey the voice &amp; word of God,
nor to profit by those meanes that God giues a man
for his conuersion.</p>
                  <p>A matter of speciall vse to our Church, which
hath so long enioyed the Gospell: but to you of this
Citie especially, who haue long and liberally beene
fed from heauen, with abundance &amp; variety of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
food. Therfore, euery one looke to thy selfe how
thou profitest by these good means. For be assured, if
any congregation or particular man haue vse of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18782:28"/>
meanes and profiteth not, but runneth on hardned in
his sinnes; it is because hee is a vessel of Gods wrath,
and prepared for damnation: but contrariwise, hee
that heareth and yeeldeth, and obeieth, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it is an vndoubted pledge to him of his saluation,
layed vp in heauen assuredly for him. Therefore, let
euery one take heed: for otherwise his lot will be
like <hi>Babylons;</hi> of whom we here finde, that because all
meanes vsed to conuert her were in vaine, therfore
she is now iustly destroyed, and remaines a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of misery, and a spectacle of Gods iustice, to all
posterities<note n="x" place="margin">Read, for this end, the 50. and 51. Chapt. of Ieremie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the Prophets.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus concerning the literall</hi> Babylon <hi>wee haue
heard,</hi> 1. How <hi>Israel</hi> would haue cured her. 2.
How she will not be healed. 3. How therefore she

for the body of the town; yet diuers publicke places
where Antichrist exerciseth his authority and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
iurisdiction, are yet to this day on those hils; as
namely, &amp; especially, the <hi>Lateran Church and Palace:</hi>
which Church one of their Popes hath by Bull and

world; to wit <hi>Gregory the eleuenth,</hi> almost 250. yeares
agoe: and after him <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> and of late, <hi>Pius

same: and in which Church or Palace there haue bin
held by seuerall Popes, some 33. prouinciall or natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and 5. general Councels, all or most of them for
the raising vp &amp; establishing of Antichrists Throne:
and in which the most horrible and hainous canons
were concluded against God and his Church that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
were before: as (to name but two.)</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That monster of transubstantiation, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of bread and wine in the sacrament ceaseth,
and is turned into the substance of Christs bodie
&amp; bloud.</item>
               <item>2. That a King, an hereticke, not reforming himselfe
and his land, (meaning to popery), is to be deposed
by the Pope, his subiects to be discharged from his
obedience, and his land to bee giuen to Papists; to
whom the Papes gift shall be good and effectuall.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This Church and Palace, besides many of inferior
note, stands to this day on the hil <hi>Coelius:</hi> and though
now the Pope for his pleasure hath remoued himselfe

for many hundred yeares, (as <hi>Blondus</hi> himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18782:29"/>
it was the principall seate of the Popes: which
appeareth also by the verses written vp and down the
Church; especially those that are graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
chaire, which is hard by the high altar where the
Pope sitteth at masse.
<q>
                  <l>Haec est Papalis sedes &amp; pontificalis:</l>
                  <l>Praesidet &amp; Christi de iure vicarius isti:</l>
                  <l>Et quia iure datur, sedes Romana vocatur:</l>
                  <l>Nec debet verè nisi solus Papa sedere:</l>
                  <l>Et quia sublimis, alij subduntur in imis.</l>
               </q>
Thus its apparant, his chief throne is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of the 7.
hils. And it is very obseruable, that howsoeuer they
make their succession fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Peter;</hi> and that therfore in
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Church should have bin chief: yet that God
may shew to the world that their Citie is the <hi>Whore
that sitteth on 7. hils;</hi> therfore, by Gods iust iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
they are so blinded, that they haue made a Church &amp;
Palace, that is on one of the hils, superior to that they
cal S. <hi>Peters,</hi> which is not on any of the hils; and haue
giuen it not only priority, and precedence, but euen
priueledge &amp; preheminence aboue S. <hi>Peters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another vnanswerable reason out of the Text is;
<hi>That Citie</hi> (sayth the Text) is <hi>Babylon, which reigneth
ouer the kingdoms of the earth</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Reu. 17. 18.</note>: but <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; no other
City, at that day &amp; long after, reigned ouer the world.
Therfore <hi>Rome</hi> is that <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then the holy Text cleers it, the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
it, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe grants it, and the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
also (vpon condition we will yeelde that <hi>Peter</hi>
was at <hi>Rome</hi>) doe willingly yeelde it<note n="*" place="margin">Rhemist in 1. Pet. cap. 5.</note>; therefore
wee will not stand vppon further proofe. And as for
their distinction that <hi>Rome</hi> heathen is <hi>Babylon,</hi> but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18782:30"/>
not <hi>Rome</hi> Christian: I answere briefly, that if heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>Rome</hi> bee <hi>Babylon</hi> in regard of her sinnefulnesse
and persecution of the Saints; then this <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
also, seeing in her sinnefull abhominations and
cruell persecutions, shee is nothing inferiour to olde
heathenish <hi>Rome:</hi> as may be easily proued and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at large, if this time and place required it; and as
hath been alreadie shewed in diuers learned writers,
and (in good part) confessed by many of their owne.
Now then to goe forward touching this mysticall <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell;</hi>
I propound these foure points to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<list>
                  <item>1. That we would haue <hi>healed</hi> her.</item>
                  <item>2. That she will <hi>not</hi> be cured.</item>
                  <item>3. That therefore we ought to <hi>forsake</hi> her.</item>
                  <item>4. That God will take iust <hi>vengeance</hi> on her.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The 1. and 2. is past, the 3. is in hand, &amp; the fourth
is sure to come: its true <hi>we would haue healed her;</hi> its
most true <hi>She is past cure;</hi> I hope it shal be as true that
<hi>we shall quite forsake her;</hi> and the last hastens fast on,
<hi>Her destruction is at hand and sleeps not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first: That <hi>we would haue cured the Papists,</hi>
we dare call the world to witnesse, and appeale euen
to God himselfe; and this not onely desired, but ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
it by all good meanes, both in the dayes of
that renowned Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of happie memorie, and
in the present gouernment of our Souereigne that
now is.</p>
            <p>The meanes we haue vsed for their healing be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse.
1. By <hi>instructing,</hi> and informing them in the
truth, and discouering their errours both by holy
Scriptures, and by the ancient Fathers of the best and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18782:30"/>
purest times. <hi>Iewel, Fulk, Whitakers, Rainolds, Perkins,</hi>
and manie other, who now sleep in Christ, haue left
behinde them such testimonies of this truth as shall
liue whilst the world lasteth, and neuer can be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as appeares in that they haue not dared to answer
most of their books to this day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our continuall <hi>prayers</hi> for them, both
publick, and priuate; in performance of which duty,
both our Church in generall, and all amongst vs (that
vse to pray for themselues) haue the testimony of a
good conscience, that they haue not failed to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
their healing by this means. This our diligence
in this duty, so shamed them for their negligence in
the same for vs, that iiij. yeares ago they published at
<hi>Rome</hi> a forme of Litanie, and publicke praier, for the
peruerting of the Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to Popery. But by the way let it be obserued, that as
when <hi>Cain</hi> left his frowning at his brother, and began
to make shew of friendship with him, &amp; entised him
by fair words into the fields, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he harbored the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiest
malice in his heart and there slewe him<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note>: So
when these men had conceiued, and hatcht at <hi>Rome</hi>
the pouder treason; then to make vs secure, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
they loued vs, they framed prayers for vs, as tho
the worst thing they wisht vs were our <hi>conuersion;</hi>
when as indeede they plotted the <hi>subuersion</hi> of vs all.
<hi>Hee that sitteth in heauen, and laughed</hi> both <hi>them</hi> and
hell <hi>to scorn,</hi> for that their deuise, knoweth wee haue
not dealt so with them. Well, if their <hi>Prayers</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
come so attended, let vs haue their <hi>curses,</hi> and
let their <hi>prayers</hi> turne into their <hi>owne bosomes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee haue endeuoured to heale them by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18782:31"/>
our <hi>example,</hi> professing and practicing our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
daily in their sight: and many of our Fathers
professed it openly, euen in the times when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
&amp; gaue their liues in the fire for it. And heerin
the example of noble Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is worthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
memorie, whose constant zeale to the truth was
such, as that al her daies they could not by their brags
and treasons, &amp; curses, cause her once to fear the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; nor
by all their sleights, could euer win the least estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with her, nor gain an inch of ground in her hart:
nay, her last Proclamation, not two moneths afore
her death wounded them as deepely, or rather more
then euer any one before<note n="*" place="margin">See the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in Feb. before h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> death.</note>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and lastly; we endeuoured their healing,
by deuising and enacting good and wholsome <hi>lawes</hi>
against their errours, superstitions, impieties, &amp; sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
courses: sometime in <hi>iustice</hi> executing them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in great <hi>mercie</hi> suspending them; thus try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all meanes that might possibly perswade or work
vpon them: and in this course (our State by wise fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
and discreete managing the lawes; our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
by instruction and confutation, and all by their
prayers and example) did we continue to endeuour
<hi>hir healing,</hi> all the happie dayes of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But especially dare wee call the Lord to witnesse,
that we haue endeuoured <hi>hir healing</hi> since the happy
comming of his Maiestie to this Crowne; wherein
all the forenamed meanes haue beene vsed, and one
more: their errours haue beene most learnedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
and confuted, their bookes and libells aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
&amp; if I may giue my iudgement of these daies,
the skirts of the Romish Whore were neuer better
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18782:31"/>
discouered, her grossest absurdities and fowlest impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
neuer so cleerly displayed, as haue beene by the
Diuines of this present age. I spare their names, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
they bee aliue: and long may they liue, to the
happinesse of this Church.</p>
            <p>And beyond all meanes then vsed, and now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
his Maiestie hath vsed one more; namely,
admirable lenitie, and extraordinarie patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, notwithstanding all their ill deseruings:
which as it was alwayes great; so, since the hellish
powder treason it is incredible: for he whose patience
is not prouoked, and whose iust anger is not wakened
by such an attempt, sure there is somthing more then
ordinarily humane, in that man. Neither do I think
is there a King in Christendome, that after such a
treason would haue left one of that factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but onely his Maiestie. Oh mirror of mercy!
how famously in future ages shal this princely boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be renowned! and how fit is hee to bee the Lords
anointed, and to be the Lieutenant of that God <hi>whose
mercy is ouer all his workes;</hi> seeing his mercie is so
largely extended euen ouer his worst deseruing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
Thus heauen hath seene it, euen the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
will witnesse with vs, that as all his Church eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
where ouer the world, so wee in <hi>England</hi> for our
parts, would gladly haue healed <hi>Babylon,</hi> and haue
done our full indeuour to that ende: But now alas
see the effect of our labours, all is lost; for <hi>shee is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
and therfore past cure: <hi>She wil not, &amp; therfore
cannot be healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some will say this is harsh &amp; bitter: but I say it is
true, and therfore is not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed: let hir blame
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18782:32"/>
them that haue made her incurable, and not them
that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>scouer it: and for me that affirme it, I craue not
to be belieued, but rather to be reprooued, if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of the fact doe not fully prooue what I haue
sayd.</p>
            <p>To this end, I will first lay downe a ground or two.</p>
            <p>First, that in former times there haue beene great
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints of foul deformities in the Romish Church,
made by men of great learning, and such as eyther
are, or at least whom they say are, their owne: and
these deformities not only in priuate persons, but in
the publick body; not in the members onely, but in
the head of their Church. I will not stand to prooue
this, it being not the end of my purpose at this time:
they that look into the monuments of elder ages doe
knowe this to be true; and whosoeuer will but looke
into the Reuelations of Saint <hi>Bridget, Bernards</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<hi>Vicentius Ferrariensis,</hi> and others of that age, wil
soone acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>Another ground: these deformities were so fowle
and so apparant, that the Councels of <hi>Constance,</hi> and
<hi>Basil,</hi> and (of later times) that of <hi>Trent,</hi> were called
to this principall end, <hi>for the reformation of the
Church both in the head and in the members.</hi> For that
of <hi>Constance,</hi> the Councell it selfe confesseth it in the
publick acts thereof more then once: and for that of
Trent, howsoeuer they pretended it against <hi>Luther</hi> &amp;
his doctrine; yet it is confessed by a learned Bishop
of their side<note n="*" place="margin">Espencaeus in Titum. cap. 1.</note>, that it was wrought out and brought
to passe at last, and after much resistance, <hi>for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Romish Church,</hi> &amp; euen of the Popes
owne Court; wherein there raigned at that time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18782:32"/>
abhominable things, as one of the better sort of
Popes himself freely confessed<note n="*" place="margin">Adrian the 6</note>. Vpon these grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
I proceed to lay downe 3. propositions, touching <hi>the
incurablenesse of Romish</hi> Babel.</p>
            <p>1. That these Councels assembled to <hi>reforme and
amend,</hi> did contrariwise establish diuers impious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
neuer before decreed in the world.</p>
            <p>2. That those fowle deformities in the Romish
Church, both in the head and members, and both for
doctrine and manners, that were in that Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those Councells, and for the redresse whereof,
those Councels were called, did neuertheles, and yet
do, continue vnreformed.</p>
            <p>3 That since then, <hi>in steed of redresse and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the euills then found, there haue contrariwise
growen vp in their Church <hi>more horrible</hi> and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
practices, and <hi>more erronious</hi> and impious
doctrines then euer before; and at this day stand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprooued,
and maintayned by their Church. And
these three propositions being proued, I hope there
is none but will confesse that the Romish Church, for
ought that man can see is <hi>past cure,</hi> or at least, <hi>not yet
healed.</hi>

and after seuerely punished <hi>Saul</hi> in his posteritie, for
the breach of it<note n="b" place="margin">2. Sam. 21. 1. 2.</note>: yet the Romish Councell in this

he may be taken and proceeded against and
burned as an hereticke, without any preiudice to

            </p>
            <p>If this be good diuinity, that Oaths &amp; Couenants
to hereticks are of no force, &amp; binde not the makers;

            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:18782:34"/>Thus this Romish Councell that should haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
hath contrariewise decreed two conclusions
of monstrous impietie: and such, as (for ought I could
euer see) were neuer till then decreed nor receiued;
no, not in the Romish Church it selfe.</p>
            <p>But is this <hi>reformed</hi> since? No, saith a great Spanish
Bishop, more then a hundred yeares after this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell);
it is so farre from being altered, that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
by the authority of this decree, it is now a rule
in our Church that faith made to an hereticke, by a
priuate man, is <hi>not to be kept;</hi> no, nor if it be made
by a Magistrate, as (saith he) is proued by the practice
of the <hi>Councel of Constance.</hi> Mark how they are <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi>
afore it was true in <hi>publique</hi> persons; nor it is true
in <hi>priuate</hi> men also: afore it might be broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any fault; but nowe it may not be kept. See how
<hi>Babylon is cured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> is of later times: hath
not it done much good and reformed much ill? Nay
on the other side, it hath decreed and made two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
to the high disgrace of holy Scriptures, and
much derogating from the soueraign authoritie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
which till then were neuer decreed, not in the
darkest times of poperie, when her ignorance and
superstition was without all controll: As namely,
first<note n="*" place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. sess. 4.</note>,
<q>That the Apocriphall Bookes of <hi>Tobiah, Iudith,</hi>

of holy Scripture, whose authoritie was euer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This wrong was neuer offered to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

Councell, so presumptuous afore this of <hi>Trent,</hi>
that euer durst add more books to the sacred Canon,
then we receiued from Christ and the Church of the
olde Testament. Some bold Papists say, that the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi>
Councel, before <hi>Trent,</hi> did make them Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall:
which if it had, it had bin little materiall, seeing
it was but a smal time before Trent, scarce 100. yeares:
but the truth is, it did not; and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
and <hi>Coccius</hi> are more carefull of their credit, and will
not affirme it<note n="*" place="margin">Bellar. tom. 1 lib. de verbo Dei.</note>. So that its cleer, there neuer was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

all the Fathers for 400. yeares did reiecte them, and
many after; yea, the greater part of all learned Papists
themselues till the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> And thus wee
see how Romish <hi>Babylon</hi> is stil <hi>the elder the worse:</hi>
But this is not all: a Romish Councell will neuer meete
for one euill. Therefore secondly they decree<note n="*" place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. sess. 4.</note>,
<q>That in all Disputations, Sermons Lectures, and
to all other purposes, that Latine translation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the vulgar, shal be held the authentical text,
and that no man presume vnder any pretext to
refuse it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Heere is a strange decree, that the <hi>streame</hi> shall be
of more vertue then the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> a <hi>translation</hi> of
more authoritie then the <hi>Originall.</hi> The former ages
neuer heard of this indignitie: but whensoeuer doubt
was made, or difference found, recourse was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18782:35"/>
had to the Originalls for the determining of the
matter. Many learned Papists are ashamed of this, if
they durst vtter it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Coccius</hi> do bewray
it by their slight handling of the matter; for they
would gladly prooue if they could, that <hi>Hierome</hi> was
the author of that translation: but as for the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of it (whosoeuer was the translator) aboue the
Originalls, they are wiser then to venture their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
vpon so false a matter, and therefore doe wholly
leaue it vpon the credit of that conuenticle that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it.
Neither do I wrong, to call it a <hi>Conuenticle:</hi>
for tho I should grant the whole to be a Councel; yet
the number that past this bil, was so small, that I may
safely call it a Conuenticle. For as an ill motion may
pass in Parliament betimes in a morning before all
the house be set, so was this bill carried at <hi>Trent.</hi> For
whereas the Councel in his fulness consisted of about
300. that had voice of decision, they took the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
at the beginning of the Councell, and carried
these two bils when ther were scarce 60. in the house
(wherof how many went against them is vncertain)
for the Pope durst not (for one of his Crownes) haue
put these 2. bils, especially the latter, to the full house:
for how would they haue entertained it, then when as
they had liberty of speech against it, who since their
tongues were tyed &amp; the bil passed, yet haue dared (&amp;
some of them who were of the Councel themselues)
euen to resist the decree,<note place="margin">Arius Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Sixtus Senensis, Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster, &amp;c.</note> and haue taken so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
a course themselues in expounding the Scripture,
that howsoeuer they were tolerated for their learning
whilest they liued; yet being dead, their books are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purged, that is altered, or els reproued: So that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18782:35"/>
its apparant to all that will vnderstand, that this decree
was so far from being established in any former ages,
that it is euen misliked of many of the better sort of
themselues now that it is made.</p>
            <p>And thus I hope we haue cleered it, that these two
Councells, called in the corrupt and declining times
of the Popish Church, in shewe to haue reformed
it, haue beene so farre from that, that contrariwise
they haue concluded diuerse enormous impieties
that were not before: Then is not the <hi>Romish</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
<hi>well cured?</hi>

            <head>The second Proposition;</head>
            <head type="sub">Poperie is still as ill as euer it was.</head>
            <p>I hasten to the second Proposition: which is, that
the deformities that were before, both in Doctrine
and practice, both in head and members, and many
whereof were complayned on by some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
doe yet remaine without redresse or reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For the demonstration of this Proposition, I
might inlarge my selfe into many particulars; but I
will insist but vpon fewe: and those I shal produce
shall not be trifles, nor triuiall, but of great moment,
euen touching the maine and morall duties which a
Christian man oweth to his God; and which to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is to denie God, to falsifie his word and nullifie his
lawe. And to this ende, it were no hard matter, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18782:36"/>
passe through the most of the 10. Commandements
of the Morall and eternall lawe: but I will stand vpon
some few of the principall.</p>
            <p>In all which, my course shall be fairest for them,
and safest for my selfe: for I will not relie vpon the
credite of any reporter nor other writer, how great
soeuer his authoritie bee; but produce the recordes
themselues, and the authenticall originalls of their
owne bookes, as they stand at this day allowed by
Authoritie.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, whether the Romish <hi>Babylon bee
yet cured</hi> or no, let the Christian world iudge by these
particulars:</p>
         </div>
         <div n="1" type="part">
            <head>The first Wounde.</head>
            <p>THe pride of the <hi>Romish Anti-christ,</hi> in times past,
was such, that hee exalted himselfe, at least suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe to be set in the throne of God; yea, and
to be called of men <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>their Lord God</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>The first wound;</hi> The Pope is a God, and their Lord God.</note>: and
this not only in priuate Authors, but euen in his own
<hi>Canon lawe:</hi> these be the words in the glosse vpon the
extrauagants;
<q>To beleeue that <hi>our Lord God the Pope,</hi> the maker
of this Decretal, may not decree it as he hath; may
be iudged hereticall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The words are plaine enough. But if any man say
this is but the glosse, and not the Text: I answere;
first that the glosse is of greater authoritie amongst
them then any, or then many Doctors. But further,
what if wee finde as much or worse, out of the verie
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18782:36"/>
Text of the Popes lawe it selfe? Look in the Decree,
the 96. distinction, there the Pope himself frames this
argument, writing to the Emperor against them that
would call his Holinesse to account;
<q>Its certaine that the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> called
the Pope God.</q>
               <q>But its as cleere that God may not bee iudged of
men. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Pope may not be iudged of any
man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Pope that canonizeth so many men and
women Saints, hath here taken paines to canonize
himself a God, both in the Text and gloss of his own
lawe: his <hi>glossers</hi> call him their Lord God, and hee is
content to take it to himselfe. <hi>Constantine</hi> (he saith in
the text) cals him God, and he is content both to take
it, and make good vse of it. Whether this bee not
<hi>Herods</hi> sinne<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 12.</note> at least, let him looke to it; but let vs
goe forward. Heere <hi>Babylon</hi> is sicke of a deadly euill:
but is she healed? I wish she were: but I cannot shew
it.<note n="2" place="margin">The first wound not healed.</note> If any say shee is, then let him shewe mee that
Pope, or name mee that Writer, Doctor, Inquisitor,
Bishop, or any other, who by commandment or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or but with the approbation of the Pope,
hath confuted, or but as much as reproued this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy;
or shewe any that hath reproued it, whom
they haue not blamed or condemned. But that <hi>shee
is not cured</hi> in this point, I can make it apparant. For
look in the <hi>Canon lawe</hi> reuiewed, and as they pretend
reformed and reprinted of late by the authoritie and
with the approbation of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
vnder his bul; where though manie things be
altered, or taken out that made against the <hi>Popes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18782:37"/>
primacie:</hi> yet this that makes so much against <hi>Gods
holy Maiestie</hi> is not in one point helped, nor in one
word altered, but stil this is good &amp; Catholick Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Popes lawe, that
<q>The Pope is God, and therefore may not bee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But will you haue yet better euidence, that <hi>Shee is
not cured?</hi> Hearken a little: A great Italian Doctor,
no lesse then a Bishop, writes thus to the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(for to the Pope eyther the Authour or his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
doth dedicate it) no longer then three or foure
yeares agoe;
<q>From the Pope as from the Head there doe flowe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole body of the Church, that is, into the
whole Christian world, spirits or spirituall life,
yeelding the feeling and fruite of heauenly graces,
and effectuall motion to eternall happinesse: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is worthily called (as God is) most holy &amp;
most blessed, and is worshipped &amp; adored as a God
of all christian men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Loe here as bad or worse then the former: <hi>the Pope
is such a Head of the Church, as infuseth spirituall life,
and heauenly graces into the body of the Church</hi> (Doth
Christ himselfe any more?) and <hi>hee is worthily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
as a God.</hi> And this doth Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8.
suffer to be spoken and written of himselfe, and not 4.
yeares agoe to be printed vnder his nose at <hi>Rome;</hi> and
thence to be sent ouer the world: and now iudge, Is
not Romish <hi>Babylon</hi> well healed? nay, rather alasse,
doth not her wound fester and rankle more &amp; more?
Well then seeing this is the Romish doctrine and
practice, both olde and newe, both long agoe and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18782:37"/>
now present, let vs make a little vse of it.</p>
            <p>First, we see here good reason, why a Papist should
holde the Pope aboue a Councell, and euen the holy
scripture it selfe: for the Pope is God; and we knowe
that God is aboue the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why also the Pope holds himself aboue
Kings: for he is God, and God is King of kings: in a
word, no maruell why he should take appeals from
all the world, weare a triple Crowne, bee carried on
mens shoulders, giue his foote to be kissed, dispose
of kingdomes and kings at his pleasure; for hee that
is God may doe more then all these. And surely, wee
Protestants must needs grant, that as truely as he is a
God, so lawfully may he do all these. All these vses are
as good, as that is the Pope himselfe makes, when he
sayth: <hi>God may not be iudged by men; but I am God,
and therfore may not be iudged by man:</hi> these be his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:
but now he shall giue mee leaue to make
but one for him and his fellowes.</p>
            <p>The God that admitteth <hi>another Lord God,</hi> and to
be worshiped as God; is not the Lord IEHOVAH,
the true God: <hi>for the true God is God alone</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note>: but the
Papists God admits of another Lord God, and to be
worshipped as God; therfore he is not the true God.
If they deny the <hi>Maior,</hi> they denie Scripture: If the
<hi>Minor,</hi> they denie their Doctrine, and their owne
bookes: if they grant both, they are worthie of the
Conclusion.</p>
            <p>I would end this point: but I cannot omit to make
one vse more of this their doctrine. It hath bin made
a question amongst them, whether the Pope might
not emptie all Purgatorie, if hee see cause; and no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18782:38"/>
maruell: for he being God, surely (if there be a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie)
God can empty it. Now to conclude, all
these do but equallize the Pope with God: but what
if <hi>hee haue made himselfe greater then God</hi>

            <p>Yea, the Pope is so farre from healing it; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
he suffred a Spanish Dominican Frier to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it: and that not in word, but writing; not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly,

            <p>Thus tho it containe neuer so great an impietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

of the Popes power and prerogatiue (let as manie

healed of her deadliest woundes. And wonder not
tho I call them deadly; for consider of these conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences:
The Pope deliuered a soule out of hell;
Therfore he did that which God neuer did. Againe,
therfore there may be redemption out of hel. Again,
therefore the Popes prayers did that which Christs

            <p>The impiety is so execrable &amp; seems so incredible,
that I will put downe the words out of the booke it
selfe, as it was dedicated to the Pope.
<q>A man may appeale to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> not only from
a Tyrant, and from the diuell, but euen from God
himself; Namely, when he feels himself grieued or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
of Gods iustice: which was signified in the 5.
of <hi>Ester,</hi> where it is sayde that <hi>when king</hi> Assuerus
<hi>was angry at the Iewes, Queene</hi> Ester <hi>came in to
please &amp; pacify him: to whom the king answered;
whatsoeuer thou askest me, tho it be the half of my
kingdom, I wil giue it thee.</hi> Now, this Empress pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
the Empress of heauen, <hi>with whome God
hath diuided his kingdom:</hi> For whereas God hath
iustice &amp; mercy; He hath reserued Iustice to himself
to be exercised in this world, and hath granted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to his Mother: therfore if any man finde himselfe
agrieued in the court of <hi>Gods Iustice,</hi> let him appeal
to the Court of the <hi>mercy of his mother.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:18782:40"/>What is this we heare? do there lie appeales from
God? and from God to a creature? Is Gods iustice
such, as a man may iustly be agrieued at it? &amp; further,
is Gods kingdom diuisible? and hath God indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
his kingdome? and diuided it with a creature,
yea with a woman? and hath God granted his mercy
from himself to a creature? we may say with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Oh heauens be astonied at this:</hi> and let all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hearts tremble to heare such blasphemies: and yet
these be good doctrines in popery, fit for their pulpits,
and their people; and after they be preached worthie
to bee published to the world. Surely if they graunt
these be false doctrines; then blame &amp; shame belongs
to the Papists that preach them, write them, publish
them and allow them for Catholicke doctrine: but if
they stand to them as true, then mark what conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will follow vpon them: first it is here taught, <hi>that
a man may appeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</hi> Hereupon this argument
is easily framed, but I beleeue not so easily answered;</p>
            <p>Popery teacheth there lies no appeale from the Pope:
and heere teacheth that there lyes appeale from
God.</p>
            <p>But in reason, he from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no appeal can lie, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then he from whom one may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> by popish doctrin the Pope is greater then God.</p>
            <p>This conclusion is ineuitable, if their doctrine be
true. Again, here it is taught that <hi>we may appeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God to the Virgin</hi> Mary: if that be true, let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
this argument;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He, vnto whom appeale doth lie from another<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then hee from whome it is made;</hi> this is their
owne doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:18782:40"/>But from the Lord God appeale doth lie to the Virgin
<hi>Marie. Ergo,</hi> shee by popish doctrine is greater
then God.</p>
            <p>If this conclusion be heresie and blasphemie; then
<hi>Bernardine de busto</hi> his bookes are to be burnt, &amp; yet
they are both allowed &amp; commended by the Romish
Church: but let vs goe forward.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here it is taught, that <hi>God hath diuided
his kingdome with a creature, euen with a woman:</hi> This
being true, here we learne many points.</p>
            <p>First, the reason why they call her in their Seruice
booke allowed by supreame and soueraigne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<hi>Reginam Coelorum,</hi> the <hi>Queene of heauen;</hi> for
shee that hath got possession of the halfe of Gods
kingdome, may well and worthily be held <hi>the Queen
of heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, heere is a very good reason, why the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> keepes the Bible from the vulgar
people, and will not haue it divulged in their Mother
tongues: for if they had it in their own tongues, they
would startle at this doctrine; and when they heard it
deliuered in Pulpit, that God had diuided his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
would soone haue saide, that is false doctrine:
for the Psalme saith, <hi>The kingdome is the Lords</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 22. 29</note>: and
<hi>Dauid</hi> in his thankesgiuing, at the preparation for the
Temple building, confesseth to God; <hi>Thine O Lord
is greatnesse, power and glorie, aeternitie and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:
Thine O Lord is the kingdome and thou excellest
ouer all</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1. Chr. 29. 11.</note>: and if the Frier had obiected that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
indeede is Gods, yet not so, but hee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
it to another; then they would haue answered,
that cannot be: for he himself sayth, <hi>I am the Lord, &amp;c.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18782:41"/>
My glory, I will not giue to another</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Esa. 42. 8</note>: and if hee still
obiected that to be true in the olde Testament, when
there was none capable and worthy of this honour,
because then the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> was not; they would
readily answere, that in the new Testament after the
Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> was, and after shee was the mother of
Christ; Christ her son speaks to <hi>God his Father,</hi> (but
not to <hi>her his mother) Thine is the kingdome, power, &amp;
glory</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 6. 13.</note>. The kingdom is Gods: and how long? (not
till she be assumed &amp; crowned in heauen, as they say,
but) <hi>for euer and euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas they further teach, that he hath kept
Iustice to himselfe, but <hi>committed mercie to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
they would crie out vpon that doctrine &amp; him
that taught it; and tell him that they finde it sixe and
twentie times in one psalme, that <hi>Gods mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for euer</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 136. in euery verse.</note> 
               <hi>and that his mercy is ouer all his works</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 145. 9</note>: If ouer all; then ouer her also, or else she is not of
his making: and if his mercy be vpon her, without
which shee could neuer haue beene saued: then how
dare any say, that <hi>Mercy is hers, and not Gods? And if
mercy bee Gods,</hi> and that mercy of his <hi>endureth his,</hi>
(not for the time of the olde Testament onely, but)
<hi>for euer;</hi> Then it is foule and false doctrine to say,
that now since Christ, God hath resigned vp mercie
from himselfe to a creature: Thus would the people
come vpon him that taught this doctrine, and vpon
the Romish Church that alloweth it: and therefore
doth not that Church wisely, to keep the people from
reading the holy Scriptures?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, seeing it is doctrine currant in the Romish
Church, that God hath giuen vp mercie from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18782:41"/>
to the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> heere is a good defence of
their Ladies Psalter: wherein they turne the Psalmes
from <hi>Dominus</hi> to <hi>Domina,</hi> from GGD to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
and when <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, Lord haue mercy on
me; they say, O Lady haue mercie on me: &amp; in thee
O Lady is my trust. They say this was compiled by
<hi>Bonaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture:</hi> but tho he liued in il times, yet his other
writings giue cause to hope hee made it not: for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
saith, that <hi>we must take heed wee so inlarge not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Mother, that we diminish the glory of the
sonne.</hi> Sure hee that saide so, would not be so lauish
and carelesse of Gods glorie, as to turne the Psalmes
from him to a creature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, heere we see the reason why the popish
Synagogue do maime the Lords prayer, leauing out
the conclusion, <hi>For thine is the kingdome and power
and glorie for euer and euer</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">See the Rhemish Testa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment in Mat. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and allowed primers: in all which they cut short the Lords praier, leauing out the words of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for thine is the kingdom &amp;c.</note>. For if the kingdom be
diuided, then it is not <hi>all his for euer:</hi> no maruel ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though they will haue their <hi>Pater noster</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
for their common people; for if it were in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
there is none so simple but would see their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
dealing.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, (leauing this robbery and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in cutting off part of the Lords prayer, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place and purpose) it is heere euident that no
papist in the World can with a good conscience say
the whole Lords prayer. For if God haue now <hi>diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Kingdome,</hi> then how can he say with <hi>Dauid</hi> in
the olde testament<note n="i" place="margin">1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thine O

alter the Lords prayer and say, <hi>Thine is halfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18782:42"/>
detest his own teachers that <hi>write,</hi> and his Lord God
the Pope that <hi>alloweth</hi> such doctrine. Alas, poore
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oules, what should a simple honest hearted papist do
in this case! See therefore in what pittifull state they
liue, who haue subiected themselues to such tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
            <p>Lastlie, let it bee obserued that heere they teach,
that there bee in spirituall matters touching the soule
2. diuine Courts: the one of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and that is <hi>Gods;</hi>
the other a <hi>Chancery,</hi> a Court of <hi>Mercy,</hi> &amp; that is, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
these bee their verie wordes: and further, that
<hi>if any man feele himselfe agrieued in Gods Court of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
let him appeale to the Court of mercie of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
Oh strange diuinity! Can Gods iudgements be
vniust, or his proceedings erroneous and vnequall?
If they bee not, then why do they talke of appealing
to a higher Court? For, why doe Writs of error
lie from one Court to another, but that it is presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that they may erre? and why is there a <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi>
but that the rigour, and extremitie of the Lawe
maie bee mitigated? But if the Scripture saie true
in the text, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and iust in thy
iudgements;</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 119 137</note> Then this is blasphemie of a high
nature, that there needes a Chancerie to rectifie his
proceedings and mitigate his iudgements. But as
for this doctrine, that <hi>the Chauncerie or Court of
mercie is not Gods, but his Mothers, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods iudgements are to be mitigated by another,
and therefore that she and her Court are in this respect
aboue God and his Court:</hi> These blasphemies are so
execrable and odious to Christian eares, that I hope
ther is not a papist in this kingdome, that professeth to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18782:42"/>
know and serue God, but his heart hates them and
all that hold them.</p>
            <p>Against all this, what can bee obiected but this:
that he, being a priuate man, spake &amp; wrot out of his
priuate iudgement; but this is not the generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of their teachers, not their Church. I answere,
If none in the world taught this, but this one Frier;
yet how many soeuer knowing it, do approue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
or defend it, or if they do not reproue &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it, it is iustly to bee called their doctrine: and
by the lawe both of God &amp; man, it is their sin as well
as his. For, by the lawe of Accessaries: he that anie
waie approues, or knowing it and hauing a calling to
it, reproues not a sinne, makes himselfe guilty of the
sinne: but the Romish Church, that is, the Pope
knoweth this hainous blasphemie; and sayth, that
he hath authority to condemne all such: therefore,
hauing not done so, but contrariwise, approuing it,
is guiltie of it.</p>
            <p>Shewe me then that Pope, Bishop, or Inquisitour,
that hath condemned this blasphemie, or this book
for it. I produce a Pope that allowed it, namely, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
the sixt,</hi> who suffered it to passe vnder his
name, to the view and reading of the world: let them
bring one Pope since, that hath condemned it: or
shewe one writer (not reproued by them) that euer
reproued it, or (not condemned by them) that euer
condemned this blasphemie; if they doe not this,
then it is apparant that in this wound, <hi>Babylon is not
yet healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for better euidence, that she lies rotting in this
her filthinesse, and incurable in this wound<note n="6" place="margin">The third wound not healed.</note>: <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuine</hi>

and full of learning and godlinesse.</hi> And this his
censure, no man that knoweth the present state of

worke of <hi>Posseuines</hi> was attempted, continued, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and printed and reprinted with as publick &amp;
generall allowance as any thing can be.</p>
            <p>And yet for better euidence, that <hi>she is not healed,</hi>
nor reformed at all: let it be obserued, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this book
is of so much estimation amongst them, that it hath
diuers times beene reprinted since <hi>Bernardine</hi> the
Author set it out: as namely in my knowledge
once at <hi>Brixia</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> almost twenty yeares agoe,
in three volumes, corrected and amended, as they
pretende.</p>
            <p>But that this impious doctrine is not amended, I
will make it euident: for of late, euen this present
yeare, this booke and all his other works were again
printed at <hi>Colein</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> in three volumes: which
when I perceiued out of the last Catalogue, I could
not rest till I had obtained this new impression from
<hi>Coleine,</hi> hoping that now at last they had (for shame
righted this cause of God, and razed out that hainous
blasphemie: but hauing perused it, I see to my griefe,
that <hi>they will not be healed;</hi> for there the very same
words and doctrine stand vnreprooued, vncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
vnaltered: nay, not so much as hauing a Marginal
note to explaine them: but they are let to passe as
good, holy, and Catholicke Romish doctrine. And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18782:43"/>
that this is true I here pawne my credit to this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
assemblie, and will be ready to iustifie it to anie
(desirous to be informed in the particulars) by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the books themselues, both new and old. Which
being so, I hope no man wil denie, but that it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>she is not healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet for the better satisfaction of all men, that
as she is not yet, so shee purposeth neuer more to bee
healed, nor to reform any thing, and that this is not
the priuate opinion of that or any other one doctor; I
desire al that loue the truth to take knowledge, that of
late within these seuen yeeres, an Italian doctor a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi>
and an approoued writer, writing a story of the
miracles of our Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> teacheth euen the
same doctrine, and makes no bones to bluster out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the very same words: which for better assurance
I will put down.
<q>The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> both wil and can, is both willing &amp;
able to deliuer such, as be compassed about with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
on all sides, and to heape vpon them all good bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings:
for, Almighty God, (as farre as it is lawfull)
hath made his Mother fellow and partaker of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power, and Maiesty, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>See heere the new and refined diuinity of the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites:
what is this, but the same with that afore? for if
she be made <hi>partaker and fellow with God in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
power and Maiesty,</hi> it is no maruell, that <hi>God hath
committed his mercy to her:</hi> and if from these words
we looke into the body of the booke, we shall find hee
ascribes such works and miracles to her, as can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to none but to him or her that is a fellow with
God, or rather God himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18782:44"/>
And as for this clause, <hi>as far as it is lawfull,</hi> is a
strange word to be spoken of God; for what can be
vnlawful to God, that is good, whose will is the holiest

            <p>To conclude, let wise men obserue heer this point;
how vnwilling the Romish Church is to amend or
alter any thing, especially if it concern Gods honour
and not their owne free-hold: else, why should they
maintaine that blasphemy in the Rubrick and title
of the Chapter, which in the body of the Chapter
they condemn? But well doe they know, that many a
man reades the contents of books &amp; chapters, which
neuer read more. Therfore because the words of this
title giue honour to his decretalls, tho they be neuer
so dishonourable to Gods holy Scriptures, they are
suffred to stand, whereas they haue put out many
things disgracefull to themselues: <hi>Thus vnwilling is
Babylon to be healed in any thing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Oh admirable doctrine! First, heere is <hi>a prayer to
the Crosse</hi> it selfe (but of that heerafter): the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Crosse
is made a mediator to Christ</hi> for vs. And surely we shal
lesse wonder heereafter that they make Saints Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours
to Christ; seeing heere they shame not to send
the wodden crosse to him, to make intercession for
them: but as for that, where they giue a power to the
<hi>Crosse to procure Christ to be good vnto vs,</hi> how it can
bee spoken without Atheistical blasphemie, let them
answere that made it.</p>
            <p>Further, obserue how the <hi>Crosse</hi> is said to haue <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
to beare Christ:</hi> surely no maruell tho Saints
can mori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when a peece of wood can merit at Gods
hands. Lastly, let all reasonable men iudge what the
Romish Church holds of <hi>Christs death;</hi> seeing they
praie to a wodden Crosse, to bestow the fruite and
benefit of it vpon them.</p>
            <p>But sure (will some say) this is healed: I wil not
deny but that in some of their new and later Breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
this is left out: but thereunto I answere;</p>
            <p>First, that it is not cured, bue couered: for to
the healing of a spirituall wounde, there needes <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
and publique <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18782:54"/>
by the fault: but heere is no confession of any
fault nor euill, in these words to the Crosse; only they
be cunningly kept out in the newer bookes: so that
they are ashamed of them, and yet haue not the grace
to confesse it, and therefore will leaue it out and yet
shew no cause why. Now if it be naughtt; why do they
not say so, and therfore put it out? if it be good, why do
they put it out? So then it may be couered but is not
cured.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answer that though they haue left out
that, yet they haue kept in as bad or worse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as well as one: But I answere further, it is a cleere case

but to the very Crosse it selfe: else lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<q>That is to be worshipped with diuine worship, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee put and place the hope of our saluation: but
wee place the hope of our saluation in the Crosse
that Christ dyed on, for thus sings the Church
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18782:54"/>
(<hi>and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he alleageth this place &amp; these words</hi>)
All haile ô Crosse, our onely hope: in this time
of Lent, do thou increase righteousnesse in holie
men, and graunt pardon to sinners: therefore
the Crosse is to bee worshipped with diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These be his owne very words, and are spoken of
the Crosse, and not of Christ; as any man may see
that will but looke on the booke it selfe: for, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in generall, beeing concerning <hi>the adoration of
Christ,</hi> hee diuides the generall into sixe particular
questions: which are these;
<list>
                  <item>1. Whether <hi>Christs humanity</hi> be to bee worshipped
with the same worship as his diuinity.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether <hi>Christs humane flesh</hi> be to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with <hi>latria.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Whether the adoration or worship of <hi>latria</hi> bee to
be giuen to the <hi>Image of Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Whether to the <hi>crosse of Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Whether to the <hi>Mother of Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. Howe the <hi>Relickes of Saints</hi> are to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So that we see, heere is <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Crosse,</hi> and
his <hi>Image,</hi> and his <hi>Mother</hi> are made 4. seuerall matters
&amp; of seueral &amp; distinct consideration: then falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the particulars; for the 2. first questions, he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them negatiuely, but concludes them affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely;
touching which two we haue no controuersie
with them at this time: then comming to the 3. &amp; 4.
which be these in question; touching the <hi>Image of
Christ,</hi> whether it be to be worshipped with <hi>latria</hi> or
no: he answereth, that it seemes no; &amp; giues such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18782:55"/>
as he nor the world is able to answere, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>affirmatiuely that it is,</hi> as I haue set downe:
namely, that
<q>Seeing <hi>Christ himselfe</hi> is to be worshipped with the
worship of <hi>latria:</hi> therefore his <hi>Image</hi> is also to be
worshipped, with <hi>latria.</hi>
               </q>
So comming to the fourth question, which is of the
<hi>Crosse,</hi> demaunding whether it be to bee worshipped
with <hi>latria</hi> or no; He answereth, that it seemes no:
but concludes <hi>affirmatiuely that it is;</hi> and then giues
his reason as I haue aforeset it down; &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom thence
drawes his conclusion in these words;
<q>The crosse of Christ, namely that whereon Christ was
crucified, is to be worshipped with latria, for two
causes; both for the representation or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
it hath to Christ, as also for that it touched
the bodie of Christ: But the signe of that Crosse,
or a crucifixe, of what matter soeuer, is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
with <hi>latria,</hi> onely in the former respect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These be his very words. And heere by the way,
obserue how ridiculous and absurd poperie is, in this
point: for it giues greater worship to the <hi>dead Image</hi>
and <hi>wodden crosse,</hi> then to the blessed <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> the
mother of Christ; of whom he concludes in the next
article, that shee is by no meanes to be worshipped
with <hi>latria,</hi> but onely with an inferiour worship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>hyperdulia;</hi> and marke what wodden arguments
are giuen for it: One, <hi>Shee is a reasonable creature, &amp;
therefore must not be worshipped with</hi> latria: Lo, shee
must not, because she is a <hi>reasonable</hi> creature, and yet
the crosse shal which is <hi>vnreasonable</hi> &amp; dead. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>A crucifixe is like to Christ: therefore it shall bee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18782:55"/>
worshipped with</hi> latria: But is not she liker to Christ
then anie crosse can be?</p>
            <p>A third; <hi>the crosse did beare</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and did
touch his bodie: therfore it must bee worshipped with</hi>
latria. But did not she beare him, and touch him and
his blessed Bodie in a farre more excellent manner
then the Crosse either did or could? See what pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
arguments be here brought to fortifie this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Idolatry. Who could think that so great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
doctors should thus childishlie dally with holie
thing, and be so blinded in their vndestandings? But
this it is to bee drunke with the wine of the <hi>spirituall
Babylons</hi> abhominations.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the matter: by these wordes of
his, <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath cleared that doubt and aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that obiection made afore; <hi>that these wordes are
not spoken to the crosse or image, but to Christ:</hi> No saith
<hi>Aquinas;</hi> they are spoken to the cross.</p>
            <p>What can bee saide to all this? but one thing
more, that in the time of <hi>Aquinas</hi> it may be this was
holden, but since then it is reformed, &amp; now it is not
so. But I answere; this <hi>wound is not healed:</hi> for as it is
thus as I haue reported in the olde copies of <hi>Aquinas</hi>
both <hi>Manuscript,</hi> and printed; so is it also without the
least alteration in the new and later editions, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and purged as they pretend: and printed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these fewe yeares. And (which is more euill)
whereas, some thirty yeares agoe, all <hi>Aquinas</hi> was
reuiewed at <hi>Rome</hi> by commandement of <hi>Pope
Pius Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thought good, and so printed: yet had not <hi>the

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18782:56"/>
Christs glory as to amend this horrible impietie, but
to the perpetuall blemish of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and euerlasting
shame of their Romish synagogue, lets it stand for
good currant Catholicke doctrine, euen at this daie,
that
<q>A Crosse is to be worshipped with the same worship
as Christ himselfe.</q>
            </p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18782:57"/>
the crosse it selfe; therefore by popist religion <hi>the
wodden Crosse is a God.</hi>
               <q>2. That the Crosse is made a God, not by the doctrine
and iudgement of their priuate Doctors, but of
their Church and religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I collect thus: Their Missalls and Breuiaries

in their Liturgie is not priuate, or such as may be
questioned, or doubted of, but publicke and general,
and may not bee called in question. But in their late
and reformed Breuiary allowed and confirmed by
the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councell, they pray to the Cross and
call vppon the Crosse,</hi> as wee heard before, and
their owne doctors doe expound it that it is <hi>not to

which booke with strange impiety first they paint in
the first leafe Christ bearing a Crosse and Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
following him with one as bigge as his; where
Christ hath nothing but precedence: but after thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that too much, they paint one Crosse, and vpon
it one of Christs armes, and another of S. <hi>Francisces,</hi>
one a-crosse ouer the other: then begins the booke;
<hi>In the name of Iesus Christ and of S.</hi> Francis: where,
Iesus Christ is called <hi>our Lord</hi> and S. <hi>Francis our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Father:</hi> and the Authour saith not, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piles
the booke to the honour of God, or Christ, but
of the foresayd holy father S. <hi>Francis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he salutes Saint <hi>Francis</hi> with a prayer(m) fit
for none but God himselfe: First, blasphemously cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him <hi>typicall Iesus;</hi> then desiring him <hi>to cure the
sinnes and driue away the spirituall maladyes of their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18782:58"/>
soules, and to giue vnto them place in the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he comes to the point of <hi>Conformitie;</hi> and to
shew this the better, hee paints a tree; at the toppe
whereof is Christ, and at the roote Saint <hi>Francis:</hi> the
tree hath twenty branches on the right, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
on the left side, and euery branch hath foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fruits; in all eighty: these are equally diuided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ and S. <hi>Francis.</hi> 40, to the one, and 40. to
the other: &amp; each couple or pair of these is one point
of conformitie betwixt Christ <hi>and S. Francis,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in all vpon 40. particulars; wherein they begin
at the birth &amp; conception, nay at the very prophecies
&amp; promises made of Christ, &amp; so proceed to his life,
his death, resurrection, and alcension: and in all and
euerie of these, and euery thing else whatsoeuer may
be saide of Christ, the very same doe they not shame
to affirme of that man <hi>Francis.</hi> For example, thus:
<hi>Christ was foretold by the Prophets: So was S. Francis.
Christ was sent from God: so was S. Francis.</hi> Thus
go they ouer all his life, in such a manner as there is
nothing giuen to Christ, but bare precedence. And
which surpasseth all admiration, those two thinges
wherein Christ did most apparantly, as God, declare
his power, and his loue as Mediatour; namely, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and his passion, euen in these two is this <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
matcht with Christ our Sauiour: nay rather in his
passion he is <hi>matcht,</hi> but in his miracles <hi>aduanced</hi> farr
before Christ.</p>
            <p>And first for his passion, whereas by their doctrine
Christ had 5. wounds in his body (tho indeed he had
more) they make S. <hi>Francis</hi> nothing his inferiour in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18782:59"/>
that point: for they say that hee had wounds in his
hands and feete, proportionable to Christs; and had
certaine things like nailes in his feete and hands, so
diuided from the flesh, that they would open from it,
so as his wounds did continually bleede; insomuch,
as hee was faine to put tents into them to keepe them
from bleeding: which he continually did, sauing on
<hi>good Friday,</hi> when alwaies this popish <hi>Iesus</hi> did pull
out his tents, and let his wounds bleede, as the true
<hi>Christs</hi> that day did for our saluation; and this not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in hands and feete, but that he had a wound in his
side like to that in our Sauiour Christ: &amp; all this (saith
the book) was not fained nor imaginarie, but truly &amp;
really imprinted in his body by the power of God,
that so he might make his friend <hi>Francis</hi> like to his son
Christ in al things. And all this was not the superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of idle &amp; superstitious Monks brains; but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
act of their <hi>Church:</hi> and manie <hi>Popes</hi> one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
haue allowed it, &amp; by their buls &amp; cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ouched the truth of this story, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the wounds of S. <hi>Francis;</hi> &amp; in monument and
memory thereof, they haue their holy day of the fiue
wounds to this day established by all authoritie.</p>
            <p>Thus Christ, touching his passion, is made equall
with a mortal man: &amp; an ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Erier (by the Popes
diuinity) is made equall with Christ in the manner of
his suffring; not in that fashion as euery Christian
may be, but so as none at al, no (saith this book) not
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, nor the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> her selfe
could be.</p>
            <p>But if we come to his Miracles, then surely Christ
must come after him; for whereas Christ wrought a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18782:59"/>
miracle, he (say they) wrought 10, &amp; those that Christ
did are nothing to his. Christ neuer shewed that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility

            <p>I haue named some, but not all; look for the rest in

is not the least mention of faith in Christ, nor once
so much as the name of it, nor any relation to Christ,
nor his holy merits. No, these are well if they may
be vnderstood: and yet these men (if they be not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists)
doe knowe that all these their large promises
are but winde; and their Indulgences but fome and
froth, if there be not liuely faith and true repentance:
and if these bee in a man, then let vs see that Pope,

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18782:68"/>

that all that come to the Church at the sound of
it, may be free from all temptations of the Diuel.
<hi>O Lord infuse into it the heauenly dewe of the

it is apparant to be a more solemn baptism then that

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning which, whereas they pray that the sound
of that bel, so washed &amp; sanctified as afore, <hi>may driue
away the diuel and all his fiery darts,</hi> I would ask <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
or anie of his Chaplains, whether this bee
spoken in iest or in earnest, in formality as words of
course, or in faith as a holy prayer. If they knowe the
prayer to bee impossible, not to haue any warrant,
but meerlie to be a State Ceremonie, and done to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18782:68"/>
the poore people &amp;c. then it appeares they be
Cozeners &amp; Atheists, that make religion a pretence
to all their purposes: But if it be in earnest, and they
know it to bee a prayer of faith, and haue warrant
from Gods word for it, then it is possible inough to
driue away the diuell &amp; all his temptations out of a
kingdom: for so many Belles might be hallowed and
washed, as might hang, one within the reach of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sound; and so if the words of this prayer be true,
a Diuell might not stay in the realme: and that Realm
were very worthy to haue the Diuels companie, that
would not willingly bee at the cost to haue so manie
bels though they were of siluer, &amp; to haue them bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
though it were in costly water.</p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pleaseth to sport him
selfe a little with vs and sayth; <hi>The Heretickes obiect
to vs that we baptize belles: but its maruell</hi> (sayth
hee) <hi>that they doe not also say, wee catechize and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them, that so they may sound out the Articles
of Fayth:</hi> But it is very likelie, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> had
not seene or not well perused the <hi>Pontificale:</hi>
for if hee had, hee might haue found that <hi>they pray
to GOD to giue the HOLIE GHOST to
the Bell, to blesse it, to sanctifie it, to purifie
it, to poure heauenlie blessings vppon it, and the
dewe of Gods grace.</hi> Certainelie if this bee a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
an apt and fit prayer for the bell, they may also
catechise it: for it is doubtlesse as capable of instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from man, as of anie spirituall and heauenly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from God.</p>
            <p>Thus it is proued, I hope, that the Romish Church
(in some sort for the name, but especially for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18782:69"/>
doth <hi>baptize Bells.</hi>
            </p>

there is often and famous mention in our Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

<q>Not Clergie men onely, but euen the very Churches

<q>A <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> not onely is so holy a person

<q>If (saith he) the Virgin-vestals in <hi>Rome</hi> heathenish

that they be not, tho they neither confesse
nor do communicate; and giues his reasons. 1. For
that whores in the Romish Church, be neuer pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

refuseth their companie, notwithstanding that
yeerely excommunication: and concludeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:18782:77"/>Oh excellent doctrine, and fit for the Romish

followeth. Nay, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise say I, the wound is made
worse; &amp; by the craft of that that followeth, obserue

            <p>Thus its apparant by the great Confessor <hi>Viualdus,</hi>
that the Romish Church excommunicats not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

fornication, which is a mortall sinne? I answer
<hi>(saith he)</hi> that the Church sometime tolerateth
a lesse euill present that she may auoide a greater
euil to come, that is probable to fall out: <hi>and
this hee proues out of the Canon law;</hi> and so
concludes that the Church doth tolerate stewes
and whores, to auoide greater sinnes: not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the sinne of fornication; but by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence,
or dissimulation tolerates it, that so shee
may restraine and keepe yoong men from adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18782:78"/>
incests, and other crimes of that kind: then
he goeth further to proue his conclusion; which he
doth out of the practise of heathen lawgiuers, &amp;
by the ciuile law, &amp; would proue it out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and then to make vp the measure of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
he addeth that the law doth so far foorth
tolerate fornications in stewes that it takes order

her, her pay: the words are too bad to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            </p>
            <p>And to conclude, the better to encourage women
to be whores, and the better to please their carnall &amp;

               <q>That Whores, taking money of men, for their sin, be
they maried or vnmaried, tho it be neuer somuch
aboue their due, are not bound to restore any of

iustice, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly the stewes are much beholden to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Tollet</hi> for this doctrine: but, what Iustice &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and the Church, and the truth and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
do owe him for it, hee feeles afore this time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he repented.<note n="t" place="margin">Obijt Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Romae. 1596</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is the present doctrin of the Romish Church
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18782:78"/>
that she alloweth stewes by publick toleration, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
greater euills, and censureth not the whores
for it; nay, ties them by a lawe to refuse no man, and
tyes men by a law to pay the hire; and for this ende
allowes them Courts, Iudges, and Officers, and takes
part of the benefit arising. Now, that their practice is
according to this doctrine, I appeale to all that haue
trauelled in those parts where poperie reigneth; as
<hi>Spaine, Italy, &amp;c.</hi> And further to giue one euidence
out of my owne reading for the practice, <hi>Iacobus de
Graffijs</hi> telles vs plainely in these words,<note n="u" place="margin">Iacobus de Graff decis. aur. cas. cons. tom. 1. lib. 1. c. 28. art. 20.</note>
               <q>It is lawfull for Lords and owners of houses to let
out their houses to whores, euen whom they know
so to be, so it be with this mind, not purposelie
that they may sin, but with this that the women
may get their liuing, &amp; be able to pay them good
rents. Now tho they know they wil get their own
liuing, and paie them their rent out of whordom,
yet if they haue a dislike of the sin, they may do it
lawfully: and such, saith hee, is the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus both for Romish doctrine &amp; practice, it is
apparant that stewes are allowed to this day, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
whores not censured.</p>
            <p>Against al this but one thing can be obiected; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

had rather the particulars were considered of by a
mans owne discretion, then deciphered by mee. But
let vs see if this be healed or no: For the Iesuites may

            <p>But the truth is, that contrariwise this impious and

No, the booke hath indeed bin often printed, &amp;
with many alterations.<note n="k" place="margin">Vide Posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinum ibid.</note>. But this stands in his last
impression vntouched, as a doctrine for the Pope to
glorie in: which I speake not at randon, but vpon too
good ground. For this doctrine, and the writer of it
haue been often reprooued by our Diuines: but in
stead of reformation, <hi>Costerus</hi> hath beene defended,
and the doctrine iustified by other of his learned
brethren. I will name but one example. <hi>Chamier</hi> a
learned French Minister obiected it to the Iesuites at
Turnoue; and it is at large defended by <hi>Ignatius Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandus,</hi>
the principall of the Colledge there, for
Catholick and good doctrine.<note n="l" place="margin">Vide Episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Iesuiticas, part. 2. in epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stola 1. Iesuitae Ignatii ad Chamierum. pag. 33. &amp;c.</note> The Epistles on
both sides are in print to be seen. And if these be not
of authority sufficient, let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> come to helpe
them. Thus he teacheth:

let them marrie: for it is better to marrie
then to burn) cannot be rightly said of them that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18782:82"/>
haue vowed: for both are naught, both to burn &amp;
to marry: <hi>yea it is worse of the two to marry,</hi>
whatsoeuer the Protestant babble to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little after in the same Chapter:
<q>She that marrieth after a single vow, contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
indeed a true Matrimonie, yet in some sort
shee sinnes more then shee that playes the
whore.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this pope-holy doctrine is now brought to
ripenes and perfection, by the diligence, deuotion,
and modesty of the Iesuites. But they haue a reason
for all this, so good and so strong, as they thinke, that
thereby <hi>all is well healed:</hi> for, say they, fornication
or whoring we do not simply allow to be better then
mariage, but in respect that a man hath afore made
a vow not to marry,<note n="n" place="margin">Bellar. ibid Costerus ibid Ignatius ibid.</note> therefore to marry after the
vow, is to breake promise with God. A notable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if it bee well considered: for here by it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that poperie teacheth her people to vow against
mariage, but not against fornication; against wiues,
but not against whores. Alas, alas, what doctrine is
this, doth marriage breake their vow, and not forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?

               </gap>l Christians from such vowes.
But that this true I say, let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> iudge.

shee that marrieth makes her selfe vnable to
keep her vow, which shee doth not that commits

            </p>
            <p>Thus it is plaine: Poperie voweth against mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18782:82"/>
not against whoredome, adulterie nor fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And thus three great <hi>Iesuites</hi> haue made good
what <hi>Pighius</hi> taught, and that more plainely and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
then he did. And to make vp a messe of <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,

            <p>THe last point wherewith I will charge the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish

called a wound, as a <hi>leprosie,</hi> or a generall <hi>consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>

wounded, or haue a leprosie over all the body,
or a generall consumption, for both are deadly, and
both incureable: so is it in this case; wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception

Sodomie, their Simonie and other corruptions in
attaining places in the Church; and then at last
comming to Rome it selfe, so layes open the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of the whoore of Babylon, as it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whether her sinfulnesse be more hateful then his
boldnesse is admirable. Let him that would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to answere all their false slanders, which they lay
to the charge and disgrace of Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
and to retort vpon themselues their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
of the liues of our Professors; and he that
would see the Church and state of <hi>Rome</hi> in her
her owne naturall colours; let him, I say, reade but
that one Author: who beside that hee is Manuscript
in many Libraries, was also published at Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
or somewhere neere thereabouts, this present

            <p>And after he hath discouered her corruptions, and

her vehemently to repentance and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which because he seeth no hope of, but that
still shee falleth from euill to worse; therefore hee
denounceth Gods iudgements against her, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
her, that vengeance, ruine and destruction shall
fall vpon her. Some part of his owne words I haue
heere put downe in Latine, but not in English, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the sinnes hee laieth against her are such, as
some of them are better vnnamed then reprooued.
What can they say to it? Is he some fained and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

was he some late writer hired by <hi>Luther,</hi> or suborned

therefore his testimonie in this case is beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>Now whether these wounds and corruptions in
the Romish Church and state were healed, in the

            <p>Wherein, for our parts, make promise in our name
that we will giue all diligence, that first of all this our
<hi>Court of Rome may be reformed; from which it is
likely al this mischiefe hath proceeded:</hi> that so, health
&amp; reformation may begin there, to the good example of

earnestly we see the whole world to expect &amp; desire it.</p>
            <p>These were the wordes of this good man, too
good to be a Pope, at least too good to be long a
Pope: for after that hee had so much forgot himselfe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18782:90"/>
and his papall dignity, and the honor of his Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
seate (which cannot erre nor doe amisse, as hee
like a foole confessed) to graunt, that not the Church
alone, but the holy Court of Rome did need refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
forthwith there was order taken that hee
should not trouble the world nor disgrace his place
any longer; for shortly after he died: and for his sake,
they prouided that their seate should neuer bee so far
abused &amp; abased againe by any plaine hearted Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
man,<note place="margin">Since <hi>Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> haue bin. 15. Popes, but all Italians.</note> making sure from that day to this, that
the Popedom should not be trusted out of the hands
of an Italian, lest hee should euer haue a thought of
reformation. For what followed after all this? Was
there any reformation in the Romish Church? were
any of the euills and diseases, confessed by <hi>Adrian,</hi>
redressed? I had rather <hi>Espencaeus</hi> their owne Bishop
should tel, then I: which because he doth very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I will contract it into a <hi>compendium</hi> and hope
that some will take paines to put all that wise and
learned discourse of his, into our vulgar tongue: the
rather for that it containeth much matter of greate
moment, and yet not vulgarly knowne to this daie.
Meane time the effect of it is this:</p>
            <p>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Legatur Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencaeus in Comment. ad Titum cap. 1. à pag. 65. ad. 91.</note> That after all Christendome had complained
of the enormous and intolerable grieuances, sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the Pope and his Court of Rome, al which
and more the good pope <hi>Adrian</hi> had <hi>confessed</hi>
(but was taken away, lest hee had <hi>redressed</hi>) and
after at their motion, hee had intended a Councell
should be called for reformation: all this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his death. His successor <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18782:90"/>
not so idle to hearken to such toyes, nor giue way to
such innouations, hee would haue no Councell,
hee saw no cause of reformation. But from his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
<hi>Paul</hi> the 3. plaine necessity did wring out an
vnwilling consent: and so after many difficulties,
the Councell of Trent was called, wherein first of all
this point of reformation was so vrged, that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
was chosen of nine principall Diuines, some
of them Cardinalls, to consider what reformation
was requisite in the Church. Who after mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
plainely told the pope, that all these euills
proceeded from the abuses raigning in the Court
of Rome: and concluding something for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pluralities (one onely abuse) the pope did
so interpret it, and alter it, when it came to him, as it
did no good but hurt. He then dying, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
being intermitted, was set on foot againe by
his successor <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3. who also confessed there
were innumerable abuses in administring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
but when it came to reforme them, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
thereof hee suspended the Councell; though
many Bishops that desired reformation, did protest
against it, affirming confidently that they had not as
yet dispatched one of the businesses, for which they
had assembled: but the pope preuailed, and so for
tenne yeeres it was discontinued. And at last being
again assembled by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, he made shew he
would referre the whole matter of reformation to
the Fathers of the Councell: but when it came to
trial, it was with a prouiso, that, First, <hi>they should not
meddle with the Court of Rome:</hi> Secondly, that in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18782:91"/>
their reformation, laid vpon other persons and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they should alwaies enact it thus; <hi>Sauing alwaies
holy and vntouched the Authority of the Apostolicall</hi>
Sea: for which their courtesie to him and his seate,
hee afterward gaue them thanks in an Ora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion in the
Consistory at Rome, assuring them (out it was in the
worde of a Pope) that he would bee more rigide and
seuere in purging his owne Court, and house and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
then they would haue beene. With these good
words, the pope dissolued the Councell. But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
day to this (saith this Bishop) through these so many
yeeres, <hi>nothing is done, nothing is changed, nothing is
amended in the Church:</hi> and no maruell (saith
hee) for nothing haue they amended in Rome vnder
their owne nose, where they might reforme any
thing if they had conscience and will to doe it. So
that now, seeing all is finally referred and reserued
to the Pope, <hi>there is</hi> (saith hee) <hi>no more hope
of anie reformation left,</hi> nor any thing else remaines,
but to see one miserie after another fall vpon the
Apostolicall seate, and the whole Church of <hi>Rome:
to which let all good Christians say Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These and many more words, to this purpose,
hath this wise and learned Bishop. Out of all which
I conclude: Therefore 30. or 40. yeeres agoe in the
daies of <hi>Espencaeus,</hi> the Church of Rome, beeing
found and confessed to be most fearefully corrupt, is
not healed no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should reioice in my heart once to behold: so till

that
<q>The Romish Church is that Babylon that
will not bee healed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And wil she not? what then remaines? but as our
text leades vs,
<q>Let vs forsake her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how? not in loue or affection; let vs neuer
cease to wish to her as to our owne soules: nor let vs
cease to pray for her, publikely and priuately; yea let
vs blesse her when she curseth vs.</p>
            <p>But let vs (as we haue well begun) proceed to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
our selues from her society, and empty our
Church and kingdome of her and hers. And if they
say we be schismatiks for separating from her: we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
nay; she is the schismatike that hath separated
herselfe from Christ.</p>
            <p>Now therefore you honourable Magistrates and
Iudges of this nation, set your shoulders to the work
of your God, rouse vp your spirits to execute the
good lawes your selues and your forefathers haue
enacted: our lawes are enow and good enough,
they want nothing but execution, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to you: vnto which dutie wee of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18782:92"/>
doe exhort you in the Lord: execute our lawes
against them, yet rather against poperie then the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists:
remember the blessed promise in the Psalme;
though it was spoken of literal Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Psal. 137. 8. 9.</note> it hath a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
&amp; true relation to spirituall Babylon: <hi>O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Babylon, worthy to be destroied, happy shall he be
that rewardeth thee as thou hast serued vs, yea blessed
shal he be that taketh thy yong children and dasheth
them against the stones.</hi> Oh pull this blessing on your

blasphemies, idolatries, equiuocations,
treasons, &amp;c. these be her Impes, her naturall brood;
but, now they are of more age &amp; grown to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the more daunger is there of them, and more
cause to kil them; which if you doe with diligence &amp;
discretion, you see you draw a blessing from heauen
vpon your selues. If you doe not, you do for a time
maintain <hi>pricks in your eyes, and thornes in your sides,</hi>
and your negligence will prouoke the great &amp; iust
Lord, to take the matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> into his owne hands: which
as hee hath already, not onely threatned, but begun,
so he will, (though he deferre it till his owne time)
bring it to full execution: For
<q>Her iudgement is come vp into heauen, and
lifted vp to the clouds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And then when she hath drunke vp the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Merchants and al her louers (whereof we haue too
many that lurke amongst vs, and euen some that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

will needes bee of vs) be ashamed for
<hi>their louing</hi> of her, whom they see <hi>God hated;</hi> &amp; for
their labouring so basely to <hi>couer</hi> her filthy skirts,
which God would haue to her shame <hi>discouered</hi> to
the view of the world: and then shall they shrinke to
beare a part of her <hi>punishment,</hi> which so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to wallow with her in her pollution. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the holy Ghost make the conclusion, and
giue vs our last lesson: <hi>Go out of her my people,
and be not partakers of her sinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 4.</note> 
               <hi>least you receiue

vs. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
            <p>There is also another mysticall Babylon, and that
is the kingdome of sinne, the throne whereof is in
this world; for hell is the place of execution, rather
then of sinning: of this also is this text verified: for
we do naturally (without grace) so loue this world,
that though we finde it miserable and confused; yet
by our sensuality, and dayly deuising and practising
new pleasures, we endeauor <hi>to heale it,</hi> and to make
it a paradise, and they that are bewitched with it,
would here set vp their rests. But when all is done
that can be, <hi>it cannot be healed,</hi> but it is still a very Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
of confusion and disorder, a miserable worlde, a
vale of teares, and a sea of trouble and turmoile to
whosoeuer hath the sweetest portion of it. Therfore
though wee bee in it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7 31.</note> yet let vs <hi>vse it as though wee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it not,</hi> let vs not set our hearts vpon, but <hi>let vs
for sake it, and go euery one to his owne country,</hi> that is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18782:93"/>
to our blessed inheritance the kingdome of heauen,
that is a Christians mans countrie: for as for this
world, her sinnes are so vile, that <hi>her iudgement is
gone vp vnto heauen,</hi> &amp; God will assuredly destroy it.
But there is a better world, euen an <hi>inheritance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
vndefiled, &amp; that fadeth not, which is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in heauen for vs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 14.</note> hereof wee are borne heires by
grace in Christ. Therefore forsaking the wicked Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
of this world in our hearts and affections (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is past cure) let vs aspire after that, and long to
haue our parts in it.</p>
            <p>Now there are also besides these two greate Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
certaine other little <hi>petty Babylons,</hi> namely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable
sinnes amongst vs, which are <hi>Babels,</hi> or at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>least
<hi>daughters of Babylon,</hi> and sprigs of that cursed
roote. As,</p>
            <p>1. That great Sacriledge and Church-robbing
committed by <hi>Impropriations,</hi> (in which case at this
day almost halfe of this kingdome is) whereby it
comes to passe (aboue any other one meanes) that
an ignorant and vnteaching Ministery is set ouer a
great part of our people; which is the sourse and
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of all other euils in our Church: this is a deep
wound, yet once was it cureable enough, namely,
when the Abbies were first dissolued; and since was
it <hi>cureable</hi> enough: but now (alas) how incurable it is,
and by the crafty plots of the diuell how incurea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is made, more and more, hee obserues but
little that sees not. Oh happy hee that can say in
his conscience, I would haue cured this daughter of
Babell: and happy also hee (though not so much)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18782:93"/>
that hath had no hand in making this wound incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
such plots and deuises arise out of hell, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
will confound them, though the earth for a time
beare the burden of them. Meane time, vnlesse the
Kings Maiesty vouchsafe to take the matter into his
hands, and to heale the wounds that he neuer made;
(otherwise it is incureable; or as <hi>the Kings euil,</hi> to be
healed by none but by a King) till then wee may say
with griefe of heart; It is an impe of Babylon <hi>that
will not be healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The vngodly Playes and Enterludes so rise in

a daughter of error and confusion, a hellish deuice
