         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold</hi> (ſaith the Lord Chriſt to <hi>Peter) Satan hath deſired you, that he may ſift you as wheat</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note>. Men uſe to ſift wheat more carefully and thoroughly, then other graine. The reaſon is, becauſe it being the pureſt and richeſt of all graine, a little beggery or ſoyle left in it, is ſo much the greater eye-ſore, whilſt it is yet in the heap, or hand; and beſides any mixture of droſſe being ground with wheat, is (for the ſame reaſon) the more offenſive in taſte, when bread comes to be made of it. So that our Saviours meaning in the recited paſſage is; that the Devill hath a very great deſire to obtaine leave from God of ſifting the Saints thoroughly, <hi>i.</hi> by libertie of temptation to try them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, what may be gotten out of them by way of weakneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; not indeed to make them the more pure, (though this be Gods deſigne in the permiſſion) but to render them the more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and polluted, and to abate and pull downe their high intereſts both with God and man.</p>
               <p>The Author of the late Treatiſe, knowne by the marke of a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> or Cancer in the forehead of it, being (as it ſeems) of Satans counſell, and partaker of his intentions againſt the Saints, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159609:3"/>
ſwept his floore, and gathered together his ſiftings, all that droſſe and beggery of weakneſſes and infirmities, which Satan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of foure yeares (by his own confeſſion) was able to ſift out of them, and he to come to the knowledge of; and hath ground, kneaded, and bak't it, and made <hi>ſhew-bread</hi> of it, for ſuch of the Presbyterian Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and their retinue, to eat, as are of his own dyet and conſtitution. But (doubtleſſe) the man ſuffers loſſe in his deſigne, upon the ſame terms, and by the ſame occaſion, upon which his Grand Tutor many times ſuffers the like alſo in his; who, though his ſubtiltie and induſtry to promote his kingdome, be very great and formidable, yet is ever and anon befool'd by his malice, which is predominant, and magnifies it ſelfe above them both. This ſtill importunes him for preſent action againſt the Saints, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers him not to preconſider, whether the winning of the Reſts, be not like to loſe him the race. So (doubtleſſe) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, even to an intoxication, with the ſweetneſſe of his end, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation of his poore innocent helpleſs Brethren, ſirnamed (by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and many others, who of late have acted themſelves into a far deeper merit of the name, and that in the worſt ſenſe &amp; conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word) <hi>Independents;</hi> had not his Prudentials free, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether the courſe which he hath ſteer'd to drown them in the <hi>black Sea</hi> of infamy and reproofe, be not more like to carry them into the <hi>faire Havens</hi> of honour. For he that chargeth his enemy, whoſe reputation in every kinde he ſets himſelf to tread and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot, like clay and mire in the ſtreets, onely with ſuch and ſuch crimes; he doth not ſo much charge him with theſe, as acquit and diſcharge him from all others.</p>
               <p>There is no reaſonable man, but will abate and deduct, and that<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> to a good proportion, from ſuch reckonings and accounts, which are drawne up and given in to him by the hand of envie: much leſſe will he judge ſuch accounts ſhort, or defective in particulars. So that whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> conceits, that he hath now in his <hi>Gangraena</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the world, how bad and vile theſe Sectaries and <hi>Independents</hi> are; the Truth is, that he hath done this but faintly, and with the extreame hazard of his own reputation; but he hath juſtified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted them with an high hand from all other crimes and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any worſe reſentment or import, then thoſe wherewith he aſperſeth them; and conſequently, hath repreſented them unto the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159609:3"/>
world as better and far more deſerving, then far the greateſt part of his own <hi>Presbyterian</hi> generation. For firſt, as to matter of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, look of what crimes or miſcarriages ſoever, he hath with any truth, impeached thoſe men, of his indignation; I here (in his own phraſe elſwhere <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Antap.</hi> p.</note>) <hi>caſt the glove to him,</hi> that if he will accept of the challenge, I will produce both as many for number, as foule (yea far more foule) for nature, perpetrated and done by a far leſſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Claſſique Proſelytes, then they are, amongſt whom he pretends to find ſo many things of ſuch portentuous demerit. Yea and that I will give another manner of account of the realitie and truth of what I bring upon the Stage in this kinde, then he hath done, or ever will be able to doe, of a very conſiderable part of thoſe things, which his gangred pen hath uttered againſt his Sectaries.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, for matter of opinion; <hi>I caſt my glove</hi> unto him the<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> ſecond time, that I will doe the like. 1. That I will diſcover and find out as many errors and hereſies, and thoſe of every whit as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an import, as thoſe which he pretends (or at leaſt is able to prove) to be at this day extant among thoſe who by the authoritie (or paſſion rather and precipitancy) of his pen are voted Sectaries, in a far leſſer number of his Claſſique party; onely upon condition, that he ſhall undertake to perſwade thoſe, amongſt whom I ſhall undertake to make this diſcovery, to anſwer, and give an account unto me what their judgements are, in all ſuch points and queſtions, which I ſhall propoſe to them. Yea whereas he makes ſuch a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall outcry, that there ſhould be 180 errors and hereſies amongſt us, as if he were afraid that he ſhould loſe his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Religion in the crowd; I verily believe (and not without ground) that if he would vouchſafe but freely and candidly to declare his minde and judgement, in all ſuch points, as I would tender unto him, and not profeſſe that Scepticiſme himſelfe, which he ſo much abhorres in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I could make a diſcovery of as many (errors and hereſies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether I meane) in himſelfe alone. Nor doe I judge, that the moſt Orthodox <hi>Presbyterian</hi> under Heaven (no nor <hi>Independent</hi> neither) erres much beneath the like rate or number of errors and miſtakes in matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſe the man were reliev'd with this ſuppoſition (<hi>Cujus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>tamen contrarium verum eſt,</hi> as will be atteſted by many Authentique witneſſes) that all the tales he tells to make that crowne of honour

to languiſh and fade, which God hath ſet upon the heads of thoſe which to him (it ſeems) are Heathens and Publicans, I meane Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries and Independents, were true; yet certainly they that ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them were more innocent then he that gathered them up, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially with ſo polluted an intention, as to call the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee the nakedneſſe of the Saints, and to rejoyce with Satan in his victories and triumphs over them. If the man had thought good to have ſerved his God in verſe as he hath done in proſe, hee might have begun his work with this Hexameter,</p>

The form of thoſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath levied againſt his brethren, is much more inexcuſable then the matter of them. Nor doe we read that either <hi>Cham</hi> or <hi>Doeg,</hi> though ſonnes of much unworthineſſe, ever traded with Satan for theſe black commodities, or compaſſed the earth to and fro by their Eves-droppers, Agents, or Factors, to gather up and furniſh themſelves with the ſinnes or infirmities of the Saints; no nor that they ever took up a report into their lips a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any man, upon either the looſe or malicious ſuggeſtion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but onely related and informed what themſelves ſaw with their own eyes, and that caſually and without awaiting the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Whether therefore the man we know, hath not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe ſonnes of ſhame by doubling the ſpirit of their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe upon himſelfe, I leave to the conſideration of ſuch men, who have not ſacrificed the principles of their ingenuity upon the ſervice of the Claſſique cauſe.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159609:4"/>
the hearts of wicked and prophane men? yea, he hath ſpread a table for Satan with the ſhame and ſorrowes of the Saints, and made more joy in hell with the noyſe of his <hi>Gangrene</hi> going forth into the world, then that climate hath known for theſe many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yea, he hath made <hi>Belzebub</hi> himſelfe drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and reputation of his enemies, and hath lifted him up halfe way towards that heaven from which our Saviour long ſince ſaw him falling like lightning <hi rend="sup">e</hi>.

For Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> or any man to judge of Independency by the miſcarriages, whether in practice or opinion, of ſome few that (it's likely) are the retrimentitious part of that way, is as if a man ſhould make an eſtimate of <hi>Cheapſide</hi> by the chanell that runs in the midſt of it, or give ſentence of the holy and elect Angels by what is found in ſin and wickedneſſe in the Devils. If Independency hath its tens, Presbytery hath its thouſands of the ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> in her retinue. And if the man will deale fairly in comparing them together, hee muſt not ſet the head of the one againſt the taile of the other, but meaſure head with head, and taile with taile. All may bee true which the man chargeth upon Independency, and yet independency lift up her head in worth and dignity as high above Presbytery,</p>

That Wolves are oft found in <hi>Sheeps cloathing,</hi> is ſo farre from being matter of diſparagement unto it, that it rather commends it for the beſt and moſt innocent cloathing of all other: Nor ought the ſheep (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid long ſince) either to lay aſide his cloathing, or think the worſe of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Wolfe ſometimes puts it on to deceive by it.

Should not the world have cauſe to feare leſt the Sun would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and the Moon abaſhed at the very ſight of ſuch a monſter of impiety as this; and mourn in ſackcloth over the deplorable and ſad condition of men, that ſuch things ſhould be found with them? yea, and to interpret the birth of it, as a ſigne that her diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion approacheth, and <hi>is even at the doores?</hi> I have neither leaſure nor opportunity to ſearch to the bottome, or ſift to the bran, all that the man ſtorieth, <hi>per ſe</hi> and <hi>per alios,</hi> in his <hi>Gangrene;</hi> nor doe I hold Intelligence with any man to inform my ſelf of his haltings, but I am able of mine owne knowledge to avouch the untruth of ſome things aſſerted by him: the untruth of more hath been avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto me by others; and I make little queſtion but that when all his accuſed ones ſhall have had time and opportunity to ſtand forth &amp; plead their innocency, there will be very little truth found remaining in any thing reported by him, except (haply) in ſuch things which are tranſgreſſions againſt no Law.</p>
               <p>In the mean while he hath taken a pretty politick courſe to ſave<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> the ſtake of his own repute, and to prevent as much as may be, the through examination of the greateſt part of what his <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> repreſents by way of diſparagement to the Independent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by printing ſo many letters ſo full fraught with theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, without the names of their Authors. For by this means he may put down in ink and paper, and make up letter-wiſe what he pleaſeth, and yet no man be able to ſay unto him that black is his eye for ſo doing. If hee will affirm that ſuch or ſuch letters were ſent unto him, or came to his hands, and withall refuſe to produce the authors, or pretend reaſons why hee ſhould not name them; well may we ſuſpect jugling: but yet the Jugler hath a Citie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to fly unto to ſave himſelfe out of the hand of a detector. And to me it ſeems not a little ſtrange, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſhould keep the

names of his informers, who have contributed ſo liberally towards the ſame deſigne with himſelfe, under hatches, or within the vaile; when as he proſtitutes his own name with ſo much confidence (that I ſay not impudence) in the frontiſpice of his booke. If hee judgeth it honorable in himſelfe, to bee taken notice of for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chiefe in the Claſſique warres againſt Sectaries and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; he had no reaſon to hide the names of his Captains, and thoſe that ſerved in inferior place of command under him in the ſame ſervice: except he either thinks that they have been too timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and low-ſpirited in the action, and in this reſpect is tender of their reputation, hoping they may quit themſelves more like men hereafter, and then he means to bring forth their names with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; or elſe judgeth that his own intereſt in the glory of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement, will riſe the better, and bee the greater and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, if no man ſhall be looked upon, or known by name, that gave aſſiſtance to him in the work. Or elſe thirdly, feareth leſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the letters being evicted of forgery and untruth, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect diſhonor upon the indighters, and ſo diſcourage and weaken their hand as to any further ſervice in ſo laudable a cauſe. But the truth is, that I cannot attribute ſo much either to the firſt of theſe reaſons, or to the ſecond, nor yet to the third (though this hath moſt in it) as to be able to beleeve, that he ſuppreſſed his names for any other end, then to ſuppreſſe the examination of the truth of the letters. I know, that if I would borrow but a little Presbyterian faith, I could with this, without any demurre or conſideration at all, beleeve that all that is contained in the letters from the firſt to the laſt of them, is pure and ſimple truth; and that M. <hi>Edwards</hi> did very vertuouſly and commendably in ſending away the names of the writers into a land of darkneſſe.

But the latter part of the ſentence he ſpeaks of, the <hi>naming whereof would have been ſo evident a confutation of me,</hi> is this; <hi>that he may apply efficaciouſly <gap reason="foreign">

For the Devill did not leave out the latter part of the ſentence which he cited, but onely the laſt words, or latter part of the latter

part of this ſentence. For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> in affirming that the Devill left out theſe words, <hi>To keep thee in all thy wayes,</hi> deales farre worſe then <hi>the Devill did by Chriſt;</hi> for the Devill did not lie unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though he tempted him; but whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Edw.</hi> chargeth upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe, <hi>In all thy wayes;</hi> which being the very laſt words of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> that hath copied out the Devils delinquency to an haire; <hi>dealt juſt</hi> by himſelfe, <hi>as the Devill did by Chriſt,</hi> not I. But whereas other Authors frequently make uſe of the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> in putting down a part for the whole; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> makes much uſe in his writings of a new figure, which we may call an <hi>Anti-Synecdoche,</hi> by putting the whole, yea and ſometimes more then the whole for a part. But however, I muſt give him the teſtimony of a man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall between the Devill and the Saints; for though he ſpeakes falſly of theſe, yet he will not flatter the other with the truth.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. I would faine know, in caſe the former part of his ſentence cited by me, be falſe, whether the addition of the latter would have made it true. <hi>If the power of the Magiſtrate by which he puniſheth ſin, doth not ſubſerve to the Kingdome of Chriſt the Mediator</hi> (which are the words I cite) would the naming of the following words, <hi>that he may apply efficaciouſly</hi>

And ſecondly, if it would, yet ſuch a ſenſe is little better then no ſenſe; the ſentence thus taken, being of the ſame forme and character of ſpeaking with this: The bread by which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> lives, doth not ſubſerve to the maintenance of his life, by making his drinke effectuall to quench his thirſt. Or this: The learning by which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>

confuteth the Sectaries, is not ſubſervient to their preferment by giving them houſes or lands, or great rewards, &amp;c. If there be ſap, ſavour, or ſenſe in either of theſe, then may hee have ſome cauſe to complain of wrong done unto him, in that the body of that ſentence he ſpeaks of, was not produced by me whole and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, lower parts and upper parts together. But if the period taken together, was of the very ſelfe-ſame ſhape and forme with thoſe, then was it Centaure-like; and then I did him more right then came to his ſhare, in ſhewing onely the upper parts of it, wherein it was rationall, and like to a man, and concealing the nether parts of it, the diſcovery whereof makes it appeare like a monſter, ſtrange and uncouth to behold. The truth is, that the paſſage he ſpeaks of, and over which he mourns, finding it without the taile in my cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he calls it a <hi>Sentence,</hi> yet a ſentence it is none, having neither form, feature, nor any property of a ſentence in it. And in this my ſentence and cenſure of it, I refer my ſelfe to all thoſe that have but <hi>their ſenſes exerciſed in diſcerning</hi> between ſenſible and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſayings.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the man (in his Preface) is tumultuouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune<note place="margin">Sect. 14.</note> for an anſwer to his <hi>Antapologie,</hi> and calls all the ſpeeches that have been given out by the <hi>Independents</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning an anſwer to it, <hi>but meer flouriſhes and ſwelling words of vanity;</hi> as if to talke of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him, were a <hi>ſwelling word of vanity,</hi> a word of too much confidence to proceed from the mouth of a mortall man. Yea, in the very firſt page of his preface he vapours at an inſufferable rate, powring out contempt upon the poore <hi>Independents</hi> (whom hee calls <hi>Dogges,</hi> making himſelfe or his <hi>Antapologie</hi> the <hi>Moone</hi>) as if they were not onely not able to anſwer it, but as if they <hi>knew not</hi> ſo much as <hi>which way to goe about to anſwer it:</hi> as if they who mean to anſwer him, had need to be furniſhed with other manner of parts, learning, knowledge, wiſdome, then were any wayes requiſite to anſwer all the Seraphicall diſputants in the world beſides. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe (it ſeems) with ſome others, had given out ſome ſpeeches of his coming to <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſome while before he came. And becauſe through occaſionall diverſions his journey was for ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time deferred, ſome in this Church that were obnoxious, were <hi>puffed up</hi> (it ſeems) as if the bitterneſſe of death had been paſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> never meant to come amongſt them. <hi>Some</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:159609:9"/>

                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 18.</note>. But he cuts the comb of this their confidence in the next words, by acquainting them with his reſolution in that behalfe. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will come unto you ſhortly, if the Lord will, and will know not the words of them which are puffed up, but their power</hi>

Becauſe an anſwer to his <hi>Antapologie</hi> hath been ſo much ſpoken of, and through many interruptions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing like the waves of the Sea one in the neck of another, hath not yet been brought forth, therfore the man is ſo far ſwoln &amp; <hi>puffed up</hi> with conceit, as if the world were not wide enough to containe him. But the anſwer which he calls for with ſo much fierceneſſe of importunity, will ere long (<hi>if the Lord will</hi>) be with him: and the world ſhall know, not <hi>what the words are,</hi> (for theſe are big enough, &amp; known unto the world already) but what <hi>the power is</hi> (or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather) of the <hi>Antapologie.</hi> There were ſome ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> and yet ſonnes of Confidence too, among the Jewes, in the dayes of the great provocation of that nation, when the day of that ſoare judgement of the 70. yeares captivity <hi>drew neere, and was even at the doores,</hi> who (it ſeems) derided the predictions of the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the judgement, and were ſo confident as to deſire and call for that <hi>day of the Lord,</hi> (under which expreſſion the Prophets of the Lord were wont to forewarn them of it) as for a treaſure. But what ſaith the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> to theſe? <hi>Woe be to you that deſire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you?

I verily beleeve that the Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Edwards Antapologie,</hi> will not be for his honour: in which reſpect he hath no great ground to be ſo reſtleſſe or importunate in calling for it; or to inſult over thoſe, who have told him once and again, that (if the Lord will) an anſwer ſhall be given him. Whereas hee talks of his worthy peece being <hi>publiſhed 18. months ſince,</hi> he ſuppoſeth (it ſeems) that men have little or nothing to doe, but to attend the motions of his pen, and to expedite and diſpatch him out of hand.

And knowne alſo it is, though ſomewhat more privately, that I had given ſome further account in the ſame kind, of my time ſpent, (within the ſaid compaſſe of 18. moneths) had not the way, by which light and truth ſhould goe forth into the world, been hedg'd up by Clergie-Claſſique Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as with thornes, againſt me.

                  <hi>and heroique reſolution, to triumph and rejoyce</hi> in what he ſhall ſuffer in way of hatred or reproach from the Sectaries, for his faithfull and noble ſervice done both to Heaven and Earth in oppoſing them; animating and flattering himſelfe in his courſe, with this, that in caſe he ſhall ſuffer in this kind, he ſhall ride parallel in the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Chariot of honour with thoſe great worthies of the world, <hi>Calvin, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Auſtine;</hi> yea with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe; nay, with the great Lord of all the Apoſtles &amp; Patriarchs, the Lord Chriſt himſelfe, bleſſed for ever. See the 4, 5, and 6 pages of his Preface. But poore man! little doth he conſider, how diametrally oppoſite he is in his cauſe and courſe, both to Chriſt and <hi>Paul;</hi> and how unlike thoſe other men. Was either <hi>Paul</hi> or Chriſt, of his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation? did they ſpend their time, or ingage their friends, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up vagrant, looſe, ſcandalous and lying reports againſt the Saints, and ſervants of God, under the names of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> to bleſſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:159609:10"/>
the vanitie and wickedneſſe of the world with the venting of them? Did <hi>Paul</hi> or Chriſt, ſet their faces like an Adamant, to inflame and ſet on fire the Powers of this world, with hatred, bitterneſſe and bloudineſſe of ſpirit, againſt the ſons and daughters of God, though full of weakneſſe, and unworthy in the higheſt? Or did they impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and clamour upon the ſecular arme, even to the wearying of it, to <hi>avenge them on their adverſaries;</hi> and little leſſe then threaten thoſe in place and Authoritie, if they would not comport with them in their carnall ends and deſires, and lift up their iron rod to breake their enemies in pieces like a potters veſſell? <hi>This,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſpeaking of their murtherous attempts againſt him) <hi>this did not Abraham</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 8. 40.</note>. Nor did the Lord Chriſt, or his bleſſed Apoſtle any of the things mentioned: but whether Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> hath done any thing elſe (almoſt) either in his Lion, or in his Beare, I mean either in his <hi>Antapologie,</hi> or in his <hi>Gangrene,</hi> eſpecially in this latter, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the judgements and conſciences of all, that either have, or ſhall pleaſe diligently to peruſe them, and withall have but their wits and ſenſes free from Claſſique bands. When the Lord Chriſt was ſollicited by ſome of his diſciples, and that by thoſe whom he loved beſt, to call <hi>for fire from Heaven to conſume thoſe that would not receive him,</hi> he <hi>turn'd</hi> himſelf, <hi>and rebuked them,</hi> telling them that <hi>they knew not what ſpirit they were of.</hi> Whereas Mr. <hi>Edwards calls</hi> and cries, might and maine, for fire from Hell to deſtroy, not thoſe who refuſe to receive the Lord Chriſt, but ſuch as do receive him with all their hearts, and with all their ſouls, onely becauſe their faces are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſet to receive the Traditions of his Diſcipline and Doctrine; and yet conceits that he knows well enough <hi>of what ſpirit he is,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>no queſtion for conſcience ſake,</hi> but that it is Heavenly. And for <hi>Paul,</hi> we know he <hi>burnt (viz.</hi> griefe and ſorrow) when any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, though never ſo weake, was but <hi>offended:</hi> his Doctrine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was, that <hi>ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men: for Kings and all that are in Authoritie, that wee</hi> [Chriſtians &amp; believers, of what judgement ſoever, for he excludes none] <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſtie</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12.</note>. But Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is ſo far from <hi>burning</hi> when <hi>weake</hi> Chriſtians are <hi>offended,</hi> that he is <hi>offended,</hi> when they <hi>burne</hi> not. His Doctrine, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and deſire is, that <hi>ſupplications and prayers, interceſſions and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thanks, be made for, and to, Kings and all in Authoritie,</hi> that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:159609:11"/>
Chriſtians and believers may either not live at all, or at leaſt be ſo far from <hi>leading quiet and peaceable lives in godlineſſe and honeſtie,</hi> as to have their faces ground, and their bones broken, and their hearts fill'd with heavineſſe, unleſſe they will receive the Clergie-Claſſique Faith, as well as the Faith of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe. O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man! who ſhall deliver him from this dangerous ſnare of death; I meane of conceiting himſelf like unto <hi>Paul</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt, in the courſe he ſteer's againſt Sects and Errors! And as for <hi>Calvin, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> though theſe had much more fleſh and bloud in them, then the two former had; yet for him to ſtrengthen his hand in the way he goes, by their example, is as if a murtherer ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelfe in his way, from the practiſe of a Surgeon when he lets bloud, or the proceedings of a Judge, when he ſlayes a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor with a ſentence of death. For when, or in what age of the world did any of theſe ſpread the world round about them with ſnares of intelligence, in every place, to catch the failings, and halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and infirmities of the Saints; and when they had taken a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of them, to ſpread a table with them to entertaine and feaſt the prophane world? Eſpecially when did any of theſe, ever publiſh ſuch a rhapſodie, of looſe, light, lying reports and tales, all or the greateſt part of them calculated for the ſhame of the Saints, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sons of <hi>Belial?</hi> Or when did any of them deale ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely or imperiouſly with thoſe, whom God had ſet in Authoritie over them, to cruſh the generation of the righteous, the lambs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, under the names of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> only becauſe in ſome things they held not conformitie in judgement with them? I doe not all this while ſay, that either Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> writing, or printing, or preaching, againſt errors, hereſies, or Sectaries, is that, which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply makes him unlike either unto Chriſt, or <hi>Paul,</hi> or thoſe others named; for doubtleſſe they did, interpretatively at leaſt, all this; and who hath not ingagements upon him, to go thus far both with him and them, if he be able, and hath opportunitie? But firſt, the blaſpheming many Truths of God, under the names of <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>hereſies</hi> (a ſtone at which his pen frequently daſheth) maketh him extremely unlike unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> yea and unto thoſe others alſo, except onely in their failings. Secondly, his turning himſelfe, eſpecially with that fierceneſſe of countenance, and furiouſneſſe of importunitie, upon the Civill Magiſtrate, to provoke men of this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159609:11"/>
Intereſt, to powre out themſelves in wrath and indignation upon all thoſe, whom he thinks good to make Delinquents by his pen. Thirdly, His ſending forth of Emiſſaries (wherein, thorough a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the word <hi>Independents,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he chargeth the <hi>Independents</hi> to reſemble the Jeſuites) to diſcover, and report unto him, the ſlips and weakneſſes of the ſervants of God. Fourthly, His inveterateneſſe, and Dragon-likeneſſe of ſpirit, by which he manageth all his endeavours againſt Errors and Sectaries. Fifthly, His importune confidence, and overgrowne preſumption of his own parts, learning, knowledge. Sixthly, His drinking in with ſo much greedineſſe, all, and all manner of reports, that are brought in to him, whether with ground or without, that will but make dirt to throw in the faces of thoſe, whoſe underſtandings are either longer or ſhorter then his, be they otherwiſe as deare to him <hi>whoſe Name is jealous,</hi> as the <hi>apple of his eye.</hi> Seventhly and laſtly, His virulent and viperous deſigne, to preach the nakedneſſe of the Saints, yea the nakedneſſe of vile and unworthy men (I meane their falſe, baſe, and putid ſuggeſtions againſt them) as their nakedneſſe, upon the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, and to call upon all the world to heare; theſe things make him ſo extremely unlike Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe others whom he pretends to imitate, that that drop of reſemblance wherein he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes with them, is quite drown'd and ſwallowed up in this Great Ocean of diſſimilitude. And let Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> know, and let his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Compeers know, that whatſoever he ſhall ſuffer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his Sectaries or others, in this bloudy negotiation, he ſhall ſuffer not as a Chriſtian, nor with Chriſt, but as a malefactor and an evill doer.</p>
               <p>But I marvaile with what profound Oracle of policie the man<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> conſulted with, about the title of his book, calling it, <hi>A Catalogue and diſcovery of many Errors of the Sectaries.</hi> Was it not that tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and bloudy principle: <hi>Pereant amici, dummodo &amp; inimici una pereant.</hi> i. Let friends goe to wreck too, ſo that enemies may but wreck with them. For certainly, by this title he makes <hi>Presbyterians Sectaries,</hi> as well as any others. Wherein I ſhould not have faulted him, but onely to ſhew how that <hi>the zeale</hi> of High Presbytery, <hi>hath eaten him up,</hi> and not left him ſo much of himſelf, as wherewith to know his friends from his enemies. For if men be therefore Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becauſe they hold ſuch opinions, as he rallieth in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:159609:12"/>

had for love or money. For otherwiſe, (doubtleſſe) the man would not have plaid at ſo ſmall game, would not have ſtrain'd himſelf to catch at this flie. As much love as a ſingle half-peny, would have ſerv'd to have cover'd this Tranſgreſſion. What? not ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie meet to be allowed to <hi>Independents,</hi> as to give what Names they think beſt to their bookes, without a Synodicall debate, and permiſſion? I confeſſe, <hi>Gangraena,</hi> is <hi>no Great or glorious Name,</hi> but it is a <hi>title ſwelling</hi> with poyſon, and the gall of aſpes. But for me, I ſhall take no offence at it: the proverb is but fulfilled, <hi>Similes habent labra lactucas;</hi> like lips, like lettuces. Both title and booke (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) are ſavoury meat to thoſe for whom they were prepared, and ſuch as their ſoules love, as marrow and fatneſſe. But what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he hath to call <hi>Innocencie and Truth Triumphing together,</hi> either a <hi>great and glorious Name,</hi> or <hi>ſwelling Title,</hi> wee deſire to gather from the <hi>Tree of paradiſe</hi> the next moneth of her fructification. In the mean ſeaſon, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edwards</hi> muſt ſuffer as an unjuſt aſperſer in this charge alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. He chargeth Mr. <hi>John Goodwin, in a Sermon to have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>that againſt the Parliament, and the power of it, as opens a gap to all ſlighting of their Authoritie and power:</hi> and further addeth, <hi>that he believes there was never any ſuch ſpeech from any before himſelfe.</hi> But firſt, if any ſuch <hi>gap</hi> (as he ſpeaks of) be <hi>opened,</hi> I know no wild beaſts that have broken in at it, but ſome ſuch <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who (as I heare) demanded, <hi>What hath the Parliament to doe with Inferior Courts?</hi> And who charge ſome of the worthy members thereof, to be <hi>hereticall and factious;</hi> yea <hi>ninnies and grolls, and men that have no more wit, then will reach from their noſe to their mouth, and are onely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi> I confeſſe in reſpect of ſuch <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſpirits as theſe, there had need be no <hi>gap opened to the ſlighting of Parliamentarie Authoritie and power:</hi> and that the Parliament it ſelfe had need keepe power out of ſuch hands, which without it know how to be Imperious enough. But ſecondly, it is ſo far from being true, that I in the <hi>Sermon</hi> he ſpeaks of, have <hi>uttered</hi> any thing <hi>againſt the Parliament or power of it;</hi> much more, any thing which <hi>opens any gap to all ſlighting of their Authoritie and power;</hi> that he himſelfe in this charge againſt me, daſheth his foote againſt the ſtone he ſpeaks of. For firſt, that which he inſinuates as <hi>uttered</hi> by me of ſuch a conſequence, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but manifeſt and cleare truth; yea and hath paſſed the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:159609:16"/>
triall of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> fire it ſelfe, and is come forth in full weight, without ſuffering the leaſt damage or detriment by it. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, moſt certain it is, that no Truth whatſoever hath any prejudiciall or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaging influence upon any juſt and lawfull Authoritie; for God is not divided in, or againſt himſelfe. Therefore he that ſhall affirme, that any Authoritie or power whatſoever, is any waies endangered, prejudic'd, or diſparaged by any Truth, doth by an unavoidable conſequence, denie that Authoritie or power to be lawfull, or from God. Nor could Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> lightly have <hi>uttered</hi> any thing, that would have ſtrooke more dangerouſly at the very roote of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentarie Authoritie and power, then to ſay, that he that ſpeakes the truth, ſpeaks <hi>againſt them,</hi> and <hi>opens a gap to all ſlighting of them.</hi> But thirdly (and laſtly) let Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and his abettors in this charge know, that it is not they who ſpeake the Truth, whether to Parliament or Princes, that <hi>open a gap to the ſlighting of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or power;</hi> no: but they are the men of this demerit and impietie, who for their own ends flatter them, and <hi>have their perſons in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for advantage;</hi> who ſtraine their wits and conſciences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to lift them up nearer to the Heavens then God will beare, that ſo they may be maſters of an opportunitie and power, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them in their carnalls. And the Truth is, that had not God by more then an ordinary hand of grace, both towards themſelves, and towards the Nation, made thoſe honorable and worthy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, <hi>wiſer then their Teachers;</hi> Satan had a moſt dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt them, to have made them more unwiſe then their enemies.</p>
               <p>Page 73. He chargeth the <hi>Independents, That many of them play at</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Cards and Tables, are very looſe on the Sabbath dayes, goe to Bowls and other ſports on dayes of publick Thankeſgiving, as Mr. Iohn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, and ſeverall of his Church, &amp;c.</hi> Whether his intent be to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie and make good the firſt and ſecond branches of this charge, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Independents playing at Cards and Tables,</hi> and their <hi>looſneſs on the Sabbath dayes,</hi> by the inſtance of <hi>Mr. Iohn Goodwin and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of his Church,</hi> I will not determine. Certain I am, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common rules of conſtruction, his words import it, and I beleeve that not one Reader of ten but ſo underſtands him. If this be his ſenſe, abhorred of all men be his lying: for Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> neither <hi>playes at Cards nor at Tables;</hi> neither hath he done
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:159609:16"/>
either ſince his firſt comming to the Citie, nor of many yeares before; nor doth he know any of his Church addicted to either of theſe recreations. But however, I marvell the man ſhould think to <hi>burthen</hi> the <hi>Independents</hi> with theſe exerciſes of <hi>Cards and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> when as it is ſo generally known, of what <hi>light</hi> account, and generall uſe they are in the beſt reformed <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches. And if there bee any of the <hi>Independent</hi> way ſo much addicted to them, as <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> charge ſeems to import, I beleeve they are chiefly, if not onely, thoſe whom Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> calls <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> complaining of them for falling to this way; and who lately drank of the ſame waters of Epiſcopacie with the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> party, and now accompany them in their ſchiſming or rending off from that way. And (alas!) who knowes not how hard a thing it is for men that have a long time drunk old Wine with their old Friends, preſently to drink new?</p>
               <p>For his charge of <hi>looſneſſe on the Sabbath dayes,</hi> the net of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,</hi> like that of the Goſpel (as it ſeems by the many bitter complaints made by Miſtreſſe <hi>Gangraena</hi> in that behalfe) <hi>gathering fiſhes of every kind, good and bad</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 13. 47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48.</note>, and that in ſuch abundance, as the tenor of the ſaid complaints imports, I am not able to ſpeak for the whole circumference. But for <hi>M. I. Goodwin and ſeverall of his Church,</hi> who are the onely perſons in whom inſtance is given to make good the truth of the charge, we deſire that when his great labours of <hi>powring out the Viall upon the Sun be over,</hi> he will pleaſe to refreſh himſelfe with telling out the ſtory at large, with the particularities of it, <hi>viz.</hi> on what Sabbath, or Sabbaths it was, whether before Saint <hi>Ieffrey</hi> or after, that either himſelfe or his Informers ſaw that looſneſſe in <hi>Mr. Iohn Goodwin and ſeverall of his Church,</hi> and what looſneſſe it was, and who of his Church they were, that tranſgreſt this tranſgreſſion with him. For my part, I ſhall not goe about to juſtifie my ſelfe, or all of my Church from more looſneſſe then well becomes us, on ſuch dayes; but I know no looſneſſe comparable to that, when Miniſters of the Goſpel, (whether ſuch, or ſo called by themſelves) ſhall take liberty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of preaching to vent vagrant, looſe, light, lying tales and reports, on purpoſe to defame the good wayes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; or elſe to make lowd challenges to all the world,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:159609:17"/>
to make good what they deliver, and yet ſhrink and decline the incounter with a few plain conſcientious men. Doubleſſe neither <hi>Mr. Iohn Goodwin, nor any of his Church,</hi> ever treſpaſſed the treſpaſs of any ſuch looſneſſe as this on any Sabbath day; nor of any other equall in demerit to it.</p>
               <p>But though hee ſhould cavill himſelfe off from the charge of charging, either Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> or any of his Church, either with <hi>playing at Cards and Tables,</hi> or with <hi>looſneſſe on Sabbath dayes,</hi> yet he muſt own the charging of them with <hi>going to Bowles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſports, on dayes of publick Thankeſgiving.</hi> Therefore, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeaks of <hi>dayes</hi> in the plurall number, as of many; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, that in the next return of his monethly courſe upon him, he will throughly purge himſelfe from all malignancy in this particular of his charge, by naming thoſe <hi>dayes of publick Thankeſgiving</hi> wherein this hainous offence (but againſt no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment or law, either of God or Man) was committed. Wee cannot allow it, no not by his own law for a ſufficient come-off, to ſay that on ſuch <hi>a day of publick Thankeſgiving,</hi> the men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached treſpaſſed the ſaid impeachment, except he can give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the pretended miſcarriage in more dayes then one, of that denomination. For himſelfe in his <hi>Antapologie, p.</hi> 54. quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with his <hi>You five</hi> (as ever and anone hee calls the <hi>Apologiſts</hi>) onely for ſaying, that <hi>ſome of their brethren in their printed books do candidly teſtifie of them;</hi> telling them (by way of reproof, and charge of untruth in their Aſſertion) that <hi>it is but one of them,</hi> not <hi>ſome</hi> that doe ſo teſtifie. Therefore by his own rule, an aſsertion of the plurall number cannot be juſtified by a ſingle inſtance or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of what is plurally aſserted. And yet who knowes not the very law of Nature allowes a man a greater indulgence of phraſe and expreſſion in his own purgation, then it doth in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or impeaching others?</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee deſire of our grand-accuſer, the next time hee comes amongſt us with his monethly viſitation, to let the world know, what <hi>other ſports</hi> they are that <hi>Mr. Iohn Goodwin, and ſome of his Church</hi> uſe to <hi>go unto on dayes of publick thankeſgiving,</hi> beſides <hi>Bowles:</hi> they are not conſcious to themſelves of tranſgreſſing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Bowles</hi> or in any <hi>other ſports</hi> on ſuch dayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) we deſire of him for the further vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:159609:17"/>
of himſelfe in this charge, when it ſhall next bee with him after the manner aforeſaid, that hee will pleaſe to ſpeak it out, that the world may hear, on <hi>what day of publick Thanksgiving,</hi> about what time or houre of the day, whether fore-noon, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; whether in the morning, or in the evening it was that Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin, with ſeverall of his Church went,</hi> or on ſuch dayes are wont <hi>to goe to Bowles and other ſports.</hi> For if it were on the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſuch a day, that the deed was done, it is no clean ſtrain to ſay it was done in the day it ſelfe, eſpecially except ſome notice were given in the margin, that he chargeth by the day naturall, not artificiall. And beſides, if it proves but an <hi>evening</hi> tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the conſtant practice of the graveſt <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themſelves, going to ſee the Fire works uſually made in ſeverall places of the Citie, on every fifth of <hi>November,</hi> being the moſt ancient, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable <hi>day of publick thankeſgiving</hi> unto the Nation, will be an abundant atonement for it.</p>
               <p>But (Reader) that thou maiſt underſtand <hi>ab ovo ad mala,</hi> from the top to the toe, the nature and tenor of that grand delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in point of looſneſſe, which is here charged upon Mr. <hi>John Goodwin and ſeverall of his Church,</hi> the ſtory truly and briefly is this: Vpon the day ordered by Authority for publick Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving unto God for his gracious and good hand upon the new Modell in the victory at <hi>Nazeby</hi> the laſt Summer, having preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat long, and to wearines in <hi>Michaels Cornhill</hi> in the fore-noon, and being hereby ſomewhat indiſpoſed to further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that day, I kept my houſe privatly in the afternoon, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix of the clock. At which time two of the brethren comming in, and finding me in no better poſture, deſired me to walk out a little into the fields with them, ſuggeſting that a walk in the freſh aire might doe me ſome good. So a walk we took, the ſeaſon being pleaſant and faire; and having walked about a quarter of a mile, or very little more, and being now upon retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, one of thoſe that were with me told the other and my ſelfe, that if we thought good to eaſe our ſelves a little before wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, there was a garden-houſe of a friend of his (a man fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly known alſo to my ſelf and the other, though of a differing judgement from us in point of diſcipline) neere at hand, and that if we pleaſed we might ſtep in thither, and repoſe our ſelves
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:159609:18"/>
for a while. Comming into the garden, we betook our ſelves to an Arbour, and there fate about halfe an houre. During which time (and I know not how long before) there was a company playing at Bowles in a little Alley in the Garden; whom (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) we ſhall not wrong in caſe we judge them Presbyterians, though (I confeſſe) wee did not examine them upon the point. But before this company had given over their exerciſe, there came into the Garden to us ſome more of our acquaintance, ſome of them of our, others of them of M. <hi>Edwards</hi> judgement in point of Church-government. When the company that all this while had been bowling, quit their ground, one in our company, (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not who, or of what judgement) asked mee if I would not ſtirre my ſelf a little by caſting a Bowle before I went home. The motion being made, and the reſt inclining to it, wee went, whether 6 or 8, of us, I doe not remember; but that the one part was <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and the other <hi>Independent,</hi> I perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and betook our ſelves for about halfe an houre to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; the Sun by this time being either down, or very neere it; and ſo returned home. This is the ſtory of that drop of water which M. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath got upon the tip of his finger to cool his tongue, being (as it ſeems) grievouſly tormented in the flames of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and indignation, that the world ſhould no more wonder after the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> for holineſſe and religion, then to think that the <hi>Independents</hi> had equall part and fellowſhip with them therein.</p>
               <p>But let us animadvert a few things upon the ſtory before wee leave it. Firſt, it is very obſerveable that the man, who (it ſeems) holds correſpondency with the world, and with all parts in the Kingdome, to receive intelligence of all the miſcarriages and undue deportments of all ſuch as are independently given, is notwithſtanding neceſſitated for the carrying up his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of their defamation, to article againſt them ſuppoſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages and miſdemeanors, in ſtead of thoſe that are truly and really ſuch. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> I preſume knowes, that <hi>where there is no Law, there is,</hi> there can be, no ſin, <hi>no tranſgreſſion</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note>: For that <hi>ſin</hi> (all ſin) <hi>is a tranſgreſſion of</hi> ſome <hi>Law</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 John 3. 4.</note>. Now then till Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſhall produce ſome law either of God or Man, againſt which Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin and thoſe of his Church</hi> hee ſpeakes of, treſpaſſed in bowling as aforeſaid, (which I know hee will not bee able to doe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:159609:18"/>
till the day after doomſday) it muſt be acknowledged that all their offence and miſcarriage therein, amounts to no more, then onely to an unhappy occaſion of cauſing Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to give teſtimony unto them, whilſt his heart was up to diſhonor them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is conſiderable, that as there were ſome of Mr. <hi>John Goodwins Church:</hi> ſo there were ſome (and, as I remember, more) of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his Church alſo, (I mean of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) who were involved in that innocent tranſgreſſion of playing at Bowles; yea, the owner of the Garden and Alley, a godly and honeſt man, and competently warm in the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<note place="margin">The Proverb ſaith, Is is an evill bird that defileth his own neſt.</note> way, was partaker with them in the ſuppoſed overſight. But (as was ſaid before) his Maxime is, <hi>Pereant amici dummodo &amp; ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciuna pereant.</hi> Let us beſpatter our enemies, what ever becomes of our friends.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for my ſelfe, I neither ſo much as handled a Bowle for many months, (I think I might truly ſay, for ſome years) before; nor have I done it ſince: nor would I then have drunk this cup of cold water, could I have thought the <hi>weakneſſe of any brother</hi> ſo great, as to be offended at it. But now perceiving the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> weakneſſe to be ſo exceſſively and importunely great as it is, I doe hereby, in the word of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, ſecure Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and all his tender retinue, that I wil drink no more any ſuch waters, I mean caſt a Bowle on a day or night of publick thankſgiving, <hi>whilſt the world ſtands, leſt I ſhould offend them.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if I had a mind to demand <hi>a tooth for a tooth,</hi> I could call ſome <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſtarres by their names, and thoſe of the firſt magnitude, who upon a day of publick thankſgiving, fell every whit as far from heaven, as Mr. <hi>I. Goodwin and thoſe of his Church</hi> did. Yea, if you ſift the Doctorate it ſelfe of the Aſſembly, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you wil find a man dropping through your ſieve, who with three more (of his <hi>com</hi>-or <hi>ſub-Presbyters</hi> rather, four Miniſters in all) conſecrated the greater part (if not the whole) of an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon <hi>upon a publick thankeſgiving day,</hi> to a ſervice that had no more Religion in it, then the Fiſhermans daily occupation and imployment: nor did their exerciſe (it ſeems) receive any great teſtimony from heaven, they ate but very little of the labour of their hands; two Roaches (as ſaith the Hiſtory) being all that Providence and they could agree upon for the reward of their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:159609:19"/>
afternoone ſervice. But <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (I perceive) have a <hi>priviledge aſſerted</hi> to ſteale horſes, without ſin: but poore <hi>Independents</hi> muſt not have ſo much as a Toleration to look on. And if Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> will not take faire warning when it is given him, and give over telling tales of <hi>Independents,</hi> I know who is reſolv'd to ſift the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heap yet neerer to the bran: and to make the world judge, whether <hi>Presbyterian</hi> miſtakes <hi>in the night,</hi> be not far worſe then <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent bowlings</hi> on <hi>dayes</hi> (or evenings rather) <hi>of publick Thanks gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</hi> Yea I know who hath a ſtory of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Angel, which doth but waite for the opening of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> mouth in reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſlanders againſt his <hi>Independent</hi> Brethren the ſecond time, to clap into it, and ſtop it for ever. Yea I my ſelf have a Manuſcript by me, which came to my hands above a yeare ſince, concerning Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> himſelf; which diſcourſeth his jugling and indirect walking between the two Townes of <hi>Godalmin</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mow</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The writing will be atteſted by good hands: and if there be no remedy, will be content to ſubmit it ſelfe to the Preſſe. In the meane time, how wofull and ſad is the method, wherein the caſe depending between <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi> muſt now (it ſeemes) thorough Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his horrid and portentuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, be argued and debated thorough! the arguments on both ſides being onely or chiefly, firebrands of Reproaches and Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, throwne in faces of the one ſide by the other. So that that way of the two, which is able to render the ſons of her competitreſſe moſt odious and hatefull unto the world, muſt ſit as Queene, and weare the Crowne. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> by the method, wherein he hath begun to plead the cauſe of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and threatens to proceed, hath devoted the Names and reputations of all of his owne partie, at leaſt of ſuch of them as are any wayes obnoxious, to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall abhorring both of the preſent, and future ages. Therefore it concernes all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in generall, and the Doctorage of this way more particularly, that are any wayes conſcious, to heale the <hi>Gangrene</hi> of his pen, &amp; to reſtraine the further ſpreading of it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Names and Reputations are but ſo many dead corpſes.</p>
               <p>5. Whilſt Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſo conſcientiouſly refraineth from caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>bowle upon</hi> the evening of <hi>a Thankeſgiving day,</hi> and takes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to recreate himſelf with revilings and bitter ſpeakings againſt the wayes and ſervants of God in the heart and ſtrength of ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:159609:19"/>
dayes, (as his manner is too too frequently to doe) doth he not <hi>ſtraine out gnats, and ſwallow camels?</hi> and run parallel in practiſe with thoſe Prieſts &amp; people, who refuſed <hi>to goe into the common hall, left they ſhould be defiled</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 18. 28.</note>; but fear'd no defilement from proſecuting <hi>that Juſt One,</hi> even unto death? Yea doth he not by ſuch diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe, imitate the temper and ſpirit of the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> among the Heathen, who (as <hi>Iphigenia</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith of her) <hi>was wont to drive from her altar, as uncleane, whoever did but touch a woman in childbed, or a perſon ſlaine; and yet delighted to have men ſlaine in ſacrifice unto her?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. (And laſtly) May it not be ſome Queſtion, whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularitie of that day of <hi>publique Thanksgiving,</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> finds <hi>Mr. John Goodwin and ſome of his Church</hi> ſo tardie, might not occaſion him to ſift the <hi>Independents</hi> more narrowly on that day, then on many others? It was ſaid of King <hi>Philip,</hi> that <hi>though he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the treaſon, yet he hated the Traytor.</hi> So wee have many ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us who love victories, and yet doe little leſſe then hate the victors, I meane thoſe by whom it pleaſeth God to give many of theſe unto them. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> adminiſters a ſtrong ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, that he himſelf is a man of this dark complexion, in the laſt page (ſave one) of his Dedicatory Epiſtle, where, having firſt ſtrip'd himſelf nak'd of all principles of reaſon and ingenuitie, he thus ſhameleſly beſpeakes the two Honourable Houſes of Parliament. <hi>And who knows but that all theſe victories are ſent to take away all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, to anſwer this objection, and to encourage you to this work?</hi> The <hi>work</hi> he ſpeaks of, and whereunto he ſuppoſes that no man can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but that the Parliament are <hi>incouraged</hi> from God by thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny victories which he hath given them, is (as appeares by the tenor and ſtraine of the whole Epiſtle) the cruſhing and utter undoing of all thoſe, whoſe conſciences cannot ſubmit to the Lawes of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> in all things appertaining to God. So then, it being generally knowne, that many conſiderable perſons, whom God hath hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by making them eminently inſtrumentall in the victories he ſpeaks of, cannot presbyterialize in things of God; that which he ſaith to the Parliament in the words mentioned, being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is this; <hi>Who knows but that the many victories, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, were intended by him as a means of incouragement unto you,</hi> to quaſh and cruſh the greateſt part of thoſe men, who were ſignally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:159609:20"/>
and ſerviceable both to God and them in the obtaining of them, together with all thoſe that adhere in judgement to them in the land. Now the ſpirit of the man being ſo extremely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable with the honour, comfort, or peace of many of thoſe who were prime Actors in the ſervice at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> leſt the valour and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of theſe men being commended by God unto the Nation with ſuch remarkable ſucceſſe, ſhould plead with too nigh an hand the goodneſſe of the way wherein they ſerve and worſhip God, in the minds and thoughts of the generalitie of men, he (probably) conceiv'd that the beſt way to prevent this miſery from coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, was to inquire out how men profeſſing the ſame way with them, behav'd themſelves on that day, whereon <hi>publique Thankes</hi> were to be given unto God for that victory: that ſo in caſe any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly or unworthy thing could be found out and charged upon any of them, as on this day, the divulging of it, might help to break the ſtrength and intereſt of that other plea in the minds of men.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Sect. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>plague of peſtilence, upon the making my houſe a meeting for the Sectaries.</hi> That two of my children were taken away, by that hand of God he ſpeaks of, others ſo reporting it beſides Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> (for touching the manner or means of their <hi>taking away,</hi> I know nothing but by report, my ſelfe having been far abſent ſeverall weeks, when God took them away) I ſhall not denie. And if he had ſtaid his pen and clos'd the period here, he had wrought little leſſe then a miracle; for he had uttered one whole ſentence of Truth. But now he may take up the Poets lamentation;
<q>Sed mea me in culpam nimirùm fata trahebant:</q>
the ſpirit that attends him, (it ſeems) envied him the crown of that glory. For in ſaying, that <hi>this was done upon making my houſe a meeting for the Sectaries,</hi> he makes the ſentence like unto its fellows, I meane void of Truth. For firſt, <hi>my houſe</hi> is a ſolid ſubſtance; whereas Mr. <hi>Edwards meeting</hi> is a fluid accident. I never heard of an <hi>houſe,</hi> that was made <hi>a meeting</hi> till now. And if mine be transformed into ſuch a thing, doubtleſſe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath done it by ſome magique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation; I have done no ſuch thing to it my ſelf. But it is the mans unhappineſſe to be ever and anon tardie, in non-ſenſe, as well as in non-truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:159609:20"/>2. If his meaning be, that I have made a <hi>meeting place</hi> of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Sectaries,</hi> or whoſoever, he doth not herein neither nick the Truth. For if by <hi>my houſe,</hi> he means, my dwelling houſe, conſiſting of that building and roomes, wherein I keepe and converſe daily with my familie, (which is the ordinary acception of the word) this is no wayes altered by me ſince my coming to it. Or</p>
               <p>3. If his meaning be, that I have ordered and diſpoſed ſome part of the buildings which I have hired, with an intent to have <hi>Sectaries meet</hi> there; neither yet doth the man or his meaning agree with the Truth. I confeſſe one roome in theſe buildings, is ordered with an intent that ſuch perſons who thinke it worth their time to attend my miniſtery, whether <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or others, may be ſome wayes accommodated to partake thereof. But that I ever <hi>made</hi> it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make it, a <hi>meeting</hi>-place for <hi>Sectaries,</hi> well may it be one of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edwards</hi> aſſertions, but Truth it is none. Nor doe I know any ſort of perſons that ever met in it yet, that any whit more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the denomination of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> then the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But</p>
               <p>4. (And laſtly) If the mans meaning be, (which is ſimply the beſt conſtruction can be made of his words) that I have permitted and given way, that ſome part of the buildings which I have taken, ſhould be us'd by ſuch perſons, as in his miſ-carrying dialect are called <hi>Sectaries,</hi> to meet in; neither will this relieve him againſt the habituated foulneſſe of his pen, or make the ſentence cleane. For it was not upon that permiſſion or grant of mine, that <hi>my two children were taken away,</hi> nor yet upon the furniſhing of the roome for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of meeting, (for the <hi>Sectaries</hi> he ſpeaks of, both <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> &amp; others, had met therein ſeverall times before the leaſt haire of the heads of either of the children fell to the ground) but it was upon my deſerting and diſuſe of it for a longer time, then God (it ſeems) was well pleaſed with; at leaſt if I ſhould look upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them away, as a ſtroake of anger or diſpleaſure from God. But as touching the Providence it ſelfe about my children, whether I ſhould look upon it as having more of mercie, or more of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, I am not ſatisfied to this day. Though the children (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) were deare unto me, &amp; their lives very deſireable, upon hopes that God (howſoever) would have provided for them, if he had thought it meet they ſhould live; yet conſidering that the beſt part
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:159609:21"/>
of that livelihood and means of ſubſiſtence which I had, was by a ſtrong hand taken from me, I could not ſo much look upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them away by God, as a <hi>taking them away</hi> from me, as from that miſery, whereunto the undeſerved hatred and injuſtice of my <hi>Presbyterian</hi> neighbours, in wreſting and detaining my means from me, had expoſed them. Men took away my means; and God made up the breach (in part) by diminiſhing my charge. Neither were they taken away alone: there was a greater number of children <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away</hi> out of a <hi>Prebyterian</hi> familie neere to them, by the ſame hand of God; where yet there was <hi>no meeting-place made for Sectaries.</hi> And beſides, I could ſoone be out of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> debt for this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerning two of my children being taken away; by telling him of three Grave men (and two of them Great) who were principall Actors in my troubles and ejection, taken away by death ſince the good ſervice they did to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> partie in that tranſaction. God hath cut off both head and taile of thoſe my adverſaries: But I leave M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> to make obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s upon it: for my part, I make none.</p>
               <p>I have now perfected reckonings and accounts between Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 25.</note> and my ſelfe, and have ſet ſtraight the foule errors and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of his bookes in theſe. I have yet another ſmall parcell of accounts to cleare with him in the behalfe of others: and by that time I ſhall have iſſued theſe, though I ſhall be very briefe in this tranſaction, yet I feare I ſhall make him uncapable of any <hi>Quietus eſt</hi> for ever. For doubtleſſe the man hath ſold himſelfe to write all, and all manner of untruths that he can but ſcrapple together, from what mouths or tongues or pens he cares not, ſo they be but <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> in their conſtitution, and carry any antipathie in them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the honour or peace of <hi>Independencie.</hi> I preſume that M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
                  <hi>Gangraena</hi> hath not as yet paid me the tith or tenth part of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries: it is like in time ſhee will be more honeſt in this, and I ſhall receive knowledge of the whole ſubſtance of her iniquitie.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin this latter account, where Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> wel-nigh<note place="margin">Sect. 26.</note> makes an end; with a ſtory related by him in the very laſt leafe, (ſave one) of his booke, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 181. concerning <hi>one Coſens of Rocbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Kent.</hi> By the way, if the common Proverb, which ſaith, <hi>That the beſt is at the bottome,</hi> takes place in his Booke; forgery of forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all is forgery, all over it. For in this Relation, (by which you may judge both of thoſe many that goe before it, and thoſe few
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:159609:21"/>
that follow after it) there are wel-nigh, <hi>quot verba, tot mendacia:</hi> and yet even this alſo hath this banner of confidence diſplayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of it; <hi>I was enformed for certaine:</hi> upon which preface we ſhall animadvert preſently.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His Relation here reports, that <hi>one Coſens of Rocheſter in Kent, that Jeſus Chriſt was a Baſtard. Hoc primum:</hi> let this be the firſt lie in this Catalogue: the man never ſaid it.</p>
               <p>2. This report avoucheth, that the ſaid <hi>Coſens</hi> ſaid, that <hi>if Jeſus Chriſt were upon the Earth againe, he would be aſhamed of many things he then did.</hi> This is another of the ſame, and the ſecond in order. For neither did the man ſpeake any ſuch words as theſe; the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, upon whoſe ſingle teſtimony, (originally) both theſe and the former words were charged upon him, upon reexamination, and that upon oath, before the Committee of the Countie, wav'd both the one and the other; as appeares by the ſaid Examination under the hand of the Clerk of the ſaid Committee, which I ſaw &amp; read; and is forth-coming for any man to peruſe for his ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>3. This Information of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> affirmes, that the ſaid <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens,</hi> for <hi>the</hi> ſaid <hi>Blaſphemies, was put into priſon in Rocheſter.</hi> Keep tale: this is a third ſtumble. The occaſion of the mans impriſonment, was a matter of a quite differing nature; as by inquiry may be found out by any man; though for ſome reaſons the partie thinketh not ſo fit to have it printed.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>ſaid certain Information</hi> informeth; that the ſaid <hi>Coſens being committed, at the Seſſions there came an Order from ſome in place to the Recorder to releaſe him.</hi> Skore up: this is the fourth word of folly in this Narration. For there came no <hi>Order from any in place,</hi> nor unto any in place, <hi>Recorder</hi> or other, for <hi>the releaſe</hi> of the man; but upon the ſight of the fore-mentioned Examination taken upon oath before the Committee, by the Juſtices, the man was diſcharged. This untruth may well ſtand for two (or at leaſt be printed in a Capitall letter) becauſe men of honour and place are aſperſed by it, as if they interpoſed with their intereſt or power to obſtruct the courſe of Law and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>5. The Information now under impeachment, further averreth, that <hi>upon the receipt of the ſaid Order, the Recorder a Serjeant at Law, and a grave man, uſed theſe words; Coſens, know you muſt ſhortly come before another Court to anſwer for theſe words, where you ſhall have no Order to releaſe you.</hi> Tallie on: this is a fift (if not a fift and ſixt) phib in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:159609:22"/>
Relation. For here is a big lye with a leſſer in the belly of it. For, firſt, the <hi>Recorder</hi> he ſpeaks of, never, upon no occaſion, ſpake any ſuch words as theſe to the man: nor ſecondly, did he ever receive any ſuch Order, as is here ſpoken of; and ſo could not ſpeake, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe words, or any other, <hi>upon the receipt</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>6. This loud-lying Information, further atteſts, that <hi>this man</hi> (Coſens) <hi>being at libertie, entertaines in his houſe the Sectaries that come from London, or other places into thoſe parts, as Den, Lamb, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp;c. Keep tale; this is a ſixt flaw (at leaſt) in the certain Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the man profeſſeth that he knows no ſuch man, as <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> nor that (to his knowledge) he ever ſaw the face of the man.</p>
               <p>7. (And laſtly) The ſaid <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Information, for unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie ſake, that it may end as it began, affirmes (in the cloze of it) that <hi>this Coſens is ſo bold, that he dares threaten to queſtion and trouble godly Orthodox Presbyteriall Miniſters, and goes to ſome of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to ſee if he can get any matter againſt them: for example, he hath gone to one Mr. Clares, a godly Miniſter, and threatened upon hearing him to complaine of him, and put in Articles againſt him.</hi> Remember the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: for this is the ſeventh and eighth time (at leaſt) that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation prevaricateth with the Truth. For firſt, the man is ſo far from <hi>daring to threaten to queſtion or trouble any godly Miniſter</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that he profeſſeth it to be his judgement, that neither god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor ungodly, whether Miniſters or others, ought to be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or troubled for their judgements in matters appertaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Therefore ſecondly, though he confeſſeth that he went to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Clare</hi> upon the preaching of a Sermon, and told him that he had not delivered the Truth; yet that he any wayes <hi>threatned Mr. Clare,</hi> he abſolutely denieth. I find nothing more to be excepted againſt in this <hi>Information of the</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of February,</hi> as matter of untruth: the reaſon (I conceive) is, becauſe there is no more of it. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Information, I had from the mouth of the ſaid <hi>Coſens</hi> himſelfe, and have the particulars under his hand.</p>
               <p>Now though there be never a ſentence (ſcarce a clauſe or piece of a ſentence) true in all this Relation, yet it hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edwards</hi> ſeale upon it, and this foundation; <hi>I WAS INFORMED FOR CERTAIN:</hi> But firſt, by this ſpecialtie of honour, <hi>I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for certain,</hi> beſtowed upon this Relation, doth he not plainly grant and imply, that he was <hi>informed</hi> of many other things in his <hi>Gangrene,</hi> for <hi>uncertain?</hi> If he had been <hi>informed</hi> of the greateſt part
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:159609:22"/>
of them for <hi>certain</hi> untruths, his Information had been orthodox, and no guile found in the lips of it.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, If Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſignall and choice reports, of which <hi>he was informed for certain,</hi> be of ſo dark and diſmall a complexion, that there is ſcarce ſo much as one beame, or the leaſt glimmering of the light of Truth in the whole body of ſome of them, what ſhall we think of thoſe that have no ſuch image or ſuperſcription of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon them? If his Chariots and Horſemen faile, ſurely his Infantery will yeeld the field.</p>
               <p>3. (And laſtly) I would gladly underſtand, by what character of difference the man diſcernes between his <hi>Informations for certain,</hi> and thoſe that are but of vulgar repute with him, and for which he alloweth three graines of non-beliefe: I ſuppoſe ſuch as come from his <hi>godly Orthodox Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> he holds <hi>for certain:</hi> thoſe which come from hands whoſe heads have not been anointed with the hands of Conſecration, more ambiguous and doubtfull; and yet <hi>certain</hi> enough to be reported and ſpread, if their faces be but ſet againſt <hi>Independency.</hi> But who is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edwards godly Orthodox Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Miniſter?</hi> Is he not ſuch an one, who works ſtoutly at the forge, and <hi>feeds</hi> both himſelf &amp; the world with all manner of ſcandals and falſhoods againſt the <hi>Independents, without feare?</hi> We have reaſon to judge ſo by the rule of proportion. For <hi>p.</hi> 57. he pronounceth a man, <hi>a Perſon Religious, and well-affected to the Parliament,</hi> only upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Letter written by him, full fraught with falſe and foule ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and inſinuations againſt his Sectaries; who is look'd upon by men as godly, and as judicious as Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> yea and who have better opportunitie to know the ſpirit and wayes of the man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to both thoſe particulars, then he; by ſuch (I ſay) this man is look'd upon, as a man no wayes deſerving either of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, except it be by the figure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; as will appeare (in part) by a Letter, whereof we ſhall give a copie before we end.</p>
               <p>You have ſeene the man like himſelfe in a <hi>Kentiſh</hi> ſtorie: let us croſſe the water, and ſee whether wee can finde him in any better ſhape on this ſide. <hi>Pag.</hi> 78. &amp; 79. He tells you a long formall ſtory of one <hi>Nichols, living about Moore-fields, that comes into Stepney-Pariſh to draw away people: That to Mr.</hi> Greenhils <hi>face did juſtifie and maintain many wicked opinions, &amp;c. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon occaſion whereof there was a meeting concluded, and Mr.</hi> Greenhill <hi>and Mr.</hi> Burroughs, <hi>with many others, were at it.</hi> Hee tells you further when this meeting
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:159609:23"/>
was, <hi>viz. a little before Mr.</hi> Burroughs <hi>fell upon the preaching of the power of the Magiſtrate in matters of Religion.</hi> And further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorns the relation with many good words that Mr. <hi>Greenhill</hi> ſhould ſpeak at this meeting; with others that Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſhould ſpeak, as particularly, that <hi>in regard of theſe things, matters being ſo, there was a neceſſity both of the government of the Church, and of the power of the Magiſtrate, &amp;c.</hi> As likewiſe with others that ſhould be ſpoken by divers others there preſent. This ſtory is long, and the particular forgeries in it numerous beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In which reſpect I ſhall deſire the Reader at his leaſure to make the computation, which he may do with exactnes enough, if he ſhall pleaſe to compare Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> Relation with theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing lines which I received from Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> himſelf in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, anent the buſineſſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That ſtory Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath, <hi>page</hi> 79. of one <hi>Nichols,</hi> and of a meeting concluded of, occaſioned by ſome viſe opinions vented by that <hi>Nichols,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Greenhill</hi> and my ſelfe (he ſayes) was, together with divers paſſages that hee relates came from mee at that meeting, is all falſe. I know no ſuch man as this <hi>Nichols,</hi> I never heard there was ſuch a man in the world, till I read it in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his book. I to this day know of no meeting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, or any of his opinions, either intended, deſired, or reſolved upon, much leſſe that there was any ſuch meeting. The next Lords day after Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his book came forth, M. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> asked me whether I knew of any ſuch meeting with that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols:</hi> for his part he wondred to ſee ſuch a thing in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>his book, for he knew of no ſuch meeting.</q> Thus far M. <hi>Burroughs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe we have had occaſion here to mention Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 27.</note> and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> takes occaſion <hi>p.</hi> 33. not onely to deale by him as he doth by his other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> whoſe opinions he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes (<hi>ad placitum</hi>) for errors; but ſeldome either names their perſons, or encounters their opinions by argument; whereas hee hath expreſſed himſelfe in both againſt him; I deſire to inſert a few lines for the vindication of him that is unjuſtly charged, by detecting the weakneſſe and groundleſneſſe of the charge. The opinion wherewith Mr. <hi>Burroughes</hi> ſtands there charged amongſt the Sectaries, as with an error, is this: <hi>Whatſoever errors or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in Religion, the Church ſhould bear withall in men, continuing them ſtill in communion with them, as brethren, theſe the Magiſtrates</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:159609:23"/>
                  <hi>ſhould beare with in men, continuing them in the Kingdome or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in the enjoyment of the liberty of Subjects.</hi> But firſt it is to be conſidered, that Mr. <hi>Burroughes, p.</hi> 34. of his book, had laid down this poſition, <hi>That notwithſtanding any plea of conſcience, yet if the error be deſtructive to the State, a man may be dealt withall by the State for it.</hi> And ſecondly, this, (<hi>p.</hi> 35.) <hi>That no pretence of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can excuſe a man in any matter of apparent injuſtice.</hi> Theſe two concluſions pre-aſſerted, he comes, (<hi>p.</hi> 67.) to give this Rule for forbearance in matters of Religion: <hi>That whatſoever miſcarriages in matters of Religion the Church ſhould beare with, theſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould beare with:</hi> becauſe though it ſhould be never ſo much granted, that the Magiſtrate is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae,</hi> yet his charge in matters of Religion reacheth not further then the charge of the Church doth. Now Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to confute this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in a man <hi>whoſe conſcience is not ſatisfied in the point of ſubjects taking up Armes againſt Armies raiſed by a Prince, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth bearing Armes, and all maintenance to ſuch a warre, &amp;c.</hi> Such a man as this (ſaith he) the State may ſequeſter, and <hi>the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I think hath ſequeſtred many upon ſuch occaſions, taking their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, &amp;c.</hi> Surely this confutation is ſo farre from being <hi>fit to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any Scholar,</hi> that it hath hardly ſtrength or colour enough <hi>to take women or weake people with</hi>

As I was haſtily peruſing a book writ in Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> name, among ſever all letters therein contained, I found one written by a perſon with whom I have more then ordinary acquaintance. In which letter the glory of God, the pure inſtitutions of the Lord Jeſus, with the Saints practiſes, are maliciouſly abuſed, as alſo your ſelfe not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. In conſideration of the which, I was not a little preſt in my own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, neither indeed could I refrain, but needs muſt declare unto you the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that wrote it (as he himſelf acknowledgeth,) not knowing but it might ſeem ſtrange unto you, and remain as a burden upon your ſpirit, that the author of ſo many falſhoods, and, as they appeare to me, palpable untruths, ſhould be (by ſuch a one as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>) termed a man religious, and cordially affected to the Parliament. But not to withhold you any longer, his name is <hi>Joſiah Ricraft,</hi> the ſame man in whoſe name the Reply to your Anſwer was printed, the which whether he did indite, or no, I will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, only I may thinke, but it matters not much whether he or another did indite it, only this I am confident of, hee is a man ſo far from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and cordially affected to the Parliament, (as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> would make the world beleeve, that I ſhall, and am able by evident teſtimonies, yea and by that knowledge I in particular have of him, perſpicuouſly make it appeare (and had done before this, had I not been extraordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented) that he is an enemy to the Parliament, State, and Kingdome, by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:159609:24"/>
concealing, countenancing, &amp; bearing correſpondency with ſuch as endevour nothing more then the overthrow of religion &amp; the ſubjects liberty. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhal ſpeak no more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning him, then what I my ſelf diſtinctly know of him: After he had taken the ſolemne league &amp; covenant, he did invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereof, conceal a Colonell the which came out of the Kings Army, and from him did receive the Kings Picture. This Colonell not daring to goe abroad in the day time. All this he did declare in my hearing; nay, during the time this Colonell was in town, he did carry, as now hee doth, a great correſpondency with one Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> Miniſter, being one in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, whoſe life this Colonel would have taken from him, if I be not miſinformed, the which as I am credibly informed, had Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> known of the Colonels being in town, he would have endeavoured the hanging of him, &amp; that not without cauſe, for former diſcourteſies received from him, too tedious to relate. I ſhal deferre the naming of him until I am called to teſtifie what I here declare, the which I hope wil be ſuddenly. And though he was wiſht &amp; deſired to diſcover him, preſſing the Covenant upon him, yet would he not: I ſhall at the preſent, as not deſiring to be tedious, preſent you with one paſſage more; it is concerning one who being to goe to <hi>Oxford</hi> with an intent to take up Arms for the King, he wel knowing he was a malignant, and would not take the covenant, yet him did he furniſh with mony to carry him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and hath ſince taken up Armes. This I ſhall through the help of God make appeare to be really true, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his name and where he lived, the which I now forbeare in regard of ſome friends whom I am not willing in the leaſt to grieve; were not the glory of God and the Kingdoms good intereſſed in it, I ſhould not at preſent have mentioned any thing of this nature, but not knowing any way more tending to the vindicatiou of both, I take this method.</p>
                  <p>Truly, ſhould I declare unto you how contrary his carriage and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to the Goſpels rule, I am confident it would ſadden the ſpirits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious men, and cauſe admiration in thoſe who profeſſe themſelves to be followers of our Lord Jeſus. I do aſſure you, the Lord hath ſo carried on my ſoul with divine contemplation, and ſweet communion &amp; fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, that all the unreaſonable dealings I have received from him, have not made any impreſſion upon my ſpirit: only this the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God knoweth hath been no ſmall ſaddening to my ſpirit, to ſee his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe of ſpirit to thoſe who are of his own judgement.

                  <hi>perſon, and ſo cordially affected to the Parliament</hi> (as you have heard) how notoriouſly falſe are a great part of them! As firſt, that Mr. <hi>Kiffen,</hi> and ſome others, upon their diſputes with Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> M. <hi>Seaman,</hi> M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> M. <hi>Porter, and others, gave out to their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that they had the better, and that</hi> M. <hi>Calamy durſt not diſpute with them.</hi> Both which are diſavowed by the perſons charged, and with certainty of knowledge that the reporter can never prove either the one or the other of them.</p>
               <p>2. The ſaid letter affirmeth, <hi>that</hi> M. <hi>Kiffen was left out from that diſputation which was held and to be held with</hi> M. <hi>Calamy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> whereas it is ſo far from the truth, that he was <hi>left out from this diſputation,</hi> that earneſtly ſoliciting an exemption from that ingagement, his motion herein was abſolutely refuſed by the reſt that were to diſpute.</p>
               <p>3. He affirmeth, that the ſaid M. <hi>Kiffen was put to do the drudgery, to fetch up members ſcattered to and fro in the countrey &amp;c.</hi> This alſo is as falſe as falſhood it ſelfe can make a report to be: The ſaid M. <hi>Kiffen</hi> never ſtir'd a foot out of the Citie, further then his own houſe all the while.</p>
               <p>4. This religious perſon in the ſame letter ſaith, that not onely M <hi>Kiffen,</hi> but <hi>others alſo of them did the like good ſervice</hi> (as <hi>Hobſon the Taylor) in their places.</hi> This again is ſo far from truth, or likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of truth, that this <hi>Hobſon</hi> he ſpeaks of, with Mr. <hi>Kiffen,</hi> were (amongſt others) made choyce of by their friends to attend the diſputation, and to manage their intereſt in the controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their oppoſers, and therefore could not doe that, beſides which there was nothing poſſible to be done by them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that can now ſave the pen of <hi>Religious I.

               <p>5. The ſaid letter advanceth yet further in her way of folly, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:159609:25"/>
affirmeth, that <hi>one of their members, whoſe name is</hi> Palmer, <hi>being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, came into their Conventicle houſe, and there before many people ſaid, That Phyſitians left her as they found her.</hi> This is a very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall untruth; the woman never making uſe of any Phyſitian all the time of her ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>6. This letter (which ſeems to be <hi>Gangrena's</hi> chiefe favourite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all her fellowes) being loath that any other ſhould carry away the whetſtone from her, pleads for this prize with ſuch an argument, which makes all the quaint inventions, and bold ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and daring relations in the book beſides, to give place and yeeld the crown. This is a ſtory of a woman that was to be rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; a ſtory which makes the tale of <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Don Quixote</hi> with his windmils, to look like Goſpels in compariſon of it. It is pitie the relator ſhould either eat or drink, till either he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the truth, or elſe confeſſed the untruth of it.</p>
               <p>This letter boaſts what miſchiefe it could doe yet further, as when it ſaith, <hi>Many ſuch Heatheniſh &amp; Atheiſticall paſſages WITH BASENES, I could relate of this man &amp; ſome of his members, &amp;c.</hi> It is very likely that what ever you can do in this kind, you muſt doe it <hi>WITH BASENES,</hi> or elſe let it alone. But indeed you have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world a very full account of your great ability to <hi>relate</hi> what <hi>heatheniſh and Atheiſticall paſſages</hi> you pleaſe of any man.

               <p>But this ſaying of his needs not be melancholy for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; it hath <hi>Brethren</hi> enough <hi>in the iniquitie</hi> of it.
