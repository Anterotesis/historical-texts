         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though I will not ſay it made them more ſcrupulous how they approved: yet certainly it made me leſſe ſcruple at their <hi>Non</hi>-approval, becauſe, I needed not (as ſome others) either Epiſtles of commendation unto you, or letters of commendation from them; you were our Epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men. <hi>2 Cor. 3.2, 3.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe (as occaſion hath been offered) I alwayes deſired it. <hi>1.</hi> That I might live peaceably amongſt, and keep a correſpondency with the neighbouring Miniſters, and not ſeparate for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo long as we agreed in the ſubſtance of the truth. <hi>2.</hi> That (while providence made way) I might not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (though I feared not my being troubleſome) to any of you. <hi>3.</hi> The maintenance allotted to the place at which I uſually preached, and near unto which I was born, did ariſe (as ſome of you know) from within the Precincts and Borderies thereof;
<pb facs="tcp:118559:3"/>
and the people were generally willing, and freely petitioned, that it might be diſpoſed off to me rather than to ſtrangers, that exerciſed at places farre remote, and yet with all earnestneſſe ſollicited for it, This laſt general call (in obedience to which, I with many others crowded up to <hi>London</hi>) cannot poſſibly but have been heard of by every one of you, And my deſire is, that you ſhould truly know, what was upon my heart before, and in reference to my going thither; what entertainment I found there, and how it cometh to paſſe, that you are now preſented with, and invited to peruſe, an explanation of theſe (Scarce intelligible) paſſages.</p>
            <p>I was not freer in my ſpirit to ſeek for approbation now, than i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the dayes of old; nor did I expect theſe in commiſſion now, to be any freer in granting (to ſuch as me) than men entruſted by men with the like power, had formerly been. Though I profeſſe, <hi>1.</hi> That I honour ſome of the preſent Commiſſioners exceeding highly for their works ſake; and am glad (as well for their ſakes as the quiet of my own mind) that providence ſo ordered things, that they were not preſent at this Tranſaction, nor did ſit to vote concerning me. Tender hearted Christians might perhaps have been troubled at themſelves afterwards, least they had offended ſome of the little and deſpiſed ones. <hi>2.</hi> I could not be perſwaded of ſo much as an intended oppoſition from, or by the brethren of the Claſſis in the County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> becauſe I knew <hi>1.</hi> That the Grandees of that party had refuſed for theſe four years laſt paſt, to obſerve either the publick days of faſting or thanksgiving appointed by the State; And I did not think men of that zeal and ſpirit, would ſtrain their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and make uſe of that power (no not if they had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thereby to promote their own catholick cauſe) which they had ſo lately refuſed (meerly out of conſcience) either to pray or give thanks for according to <hi>2 Tim. 2.1.2.</hi> Their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences might tell them, that though they alwayes have the happ to get and keep, that which is by them called the honour of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: yet men as diſputable as I in their account, deſerved countenance from the powers that be, as well as they. <hi>3.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther I, nor any friend of mine (that I heard of) ever
<pb facs="tcp:118559:3"/>
harmed any of them either in their perſons or eſtate; And though they were guilty,<note place="margin">A vindication of the anſwer to the Queries lieth by me in ſcattered ſheets: the publiſhing called for, and at hand.</note> (as many reported) not only of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as is pretended against me) but of acting ſome Illegal and Antinomian Paſſages; yet were they paſſed by in ſilence; no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage taken, nor information poſted up againſt them. <hi>4.</hi> My converſation (to ſay no more of that) theſe very men have not excepted againſt, and the points wherein I ſeemed to differ from them, whether in doctrine, worſhip, or diſcipline, have been ſo fully diſcuſſed in writing, and pillars of that party ſo farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged upon that account, that I deemed it inconſiſtent with the ingenuity of the men, either to fetch Arguments from <hi>Carters</hi> Topicks, or with <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> in a paſſion ſure, to Querie about the extent of the <hi>38.</hi> Article of our late Charter.<note place="margin">Reply to <hi>Crand. pag.</hi> 43.</note> 
               <hi>5.</hi> I was not conſcious to my ſelf of any point of doctrine maintained or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by me, that differed really from the Chriſtian Religion contained in the Scriptures, and held forth as the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this Nation. And therefore as the Law is good, ſo if uſed lawfully, I ſaw not wherein poſſibly I could be judged a Tranſgreſſor of it; But contrary to my expectation, letters were written to a Brother, or Brethren in <hi>London.</hi> Theſe paſſages ſent up in that form, and in thoſe very words at they are preſented to you in the following page: And the minds of the Commiſſioners, ſo far as ſome of theſe mens Intereſts could prevail (for I ſpeak not of them all) exaſperated and prejudiced againſt me. But to ſay no more of that. The method and manner of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings with me was briefly this, and thus.</p>
            <p>At after ten dayes tedious attendance, I had the favour to be called in, and was then honoured with the preſence of a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee: my certificate never queſtioned, nor any Querie propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to me to try my knowledge and utterance: or diſcover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the grace of God was in me of a truth. But the paſſages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing were diſtinctly read twice over; I was required to anſwer yea or nay, as to the matter of fact, had liberty to ſpeak what I thought meet in order thereunto, commanded to withdraw, recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at after a ſhort pauſe, and heard the ſentence of a <hi>Non poſse approbare: ſcilicet,</hi> That the Brethren had conſulted together, and could not grant the one of thoſe printed papers (which yet
<pb facs="tcp:118559:4"/>
were ſo common, that four hundred at leaſt had gotten of them) called an Approbation. One of the Commiſſioners who appeared (as to me) more reſpective and ingenuous than any of the reſt, was pleaſed at after this to offer. <hi>1.</hi> A reference into the countrey for examination of things before witneſſes (as to the matter of fact) if I conceived my ſelf wronged, and did deſire it. <hi>2.</hi> A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (as I apprehended) to anſwer thoſe paſſages in writing, and preſent it to the Commiſſioners, unto the latter I ſaid nothing. In order to the firſt I anſwered: that for ought I knew, the men in our countrey that were beſt known to them, and to whom I ſhould be referred were my profeſſed adverſaries; to which the Gentleman replied, that I might leave the choice of perſons for the diſcharging of that duty wholly unto them. Whereupon I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a copy of the paſſages, and time to conſider, both which were granted. And upon conſideration, I did not think it meet to accept of the firſt offer. Becauſe <hi>1.</hi> The letters of Reference (ſince gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to neighbouring Miniſters) were commonly directed to thoſe I took to be the Informers themſelves, aſſiſted with ſome of their own brethren, and collected from that, compared with the entertainment I had already found; That this ſort of men, had ſuch an influence upon, and were of that repute with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, that it was not poſſible for them to account me any other than an evil Doer. They anſwered and ſaid unto him, if he had not been an evil doer, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. <hi>Ioh. 18.30.2.</hi> I am willing to ſubmit to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man for the Lords ſake: yet it ſuited not with that Christian wiſdom and frame of Spirit the Lord hath given me, to deſire and petition for orders of this nature, or voluntarily to put ſuch a cauſe as this upon trial before the Judges qualified in ſuch manner as I conceive them to be. <hi>3.</hi> If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in me, I deſire to live peaceably with all men, and therefore ſeeing they have ſmitten me on the one cheek, and taken away my cloak, which they knew to be the <hi>Summum</hi> jus, or utmoſt that could be done (by vertue of any Law or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance yet in force) it was upon my heart to follow Chriſts coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, even offer them the other, and not forbid them to take away my coat alſo. If the quiet enjoying of the unrighteous Mammon
<pb facs="tcp:118559:4"/>
will make them my friends, I love them ſo well as not to ſuffer them to incurre any further guilt by continuing my enemies. And not the latter; for <hi>1.</hi> I freely and publickly delivered my judgement upon ſome of the paſsages (inſtead of returning my yea or nay) which was ſo ſtumbled at by the Commiſſioners, that I thought my Writing would give no ſatisfaction at al, but more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. <hi>2.</hi> Though when called, I was willing to ſubmit my parts &amp; gifts, and my life and converſation, or any thing I can call mine, to the credit of Commiſſioners impowred by the State: yet the doctrine I preach, being ſuch as I cannot call mine own, I dare not ſubmit it to the vote of any man on earth: unleſſe they could make it out that they have their Commiſſion immediately from Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>3.</hi> I knew my ſelf unable to anſwer <hi>De facto,</hi> to all or any of theſe paſſages, which I conceived would be chiefly, if not ſolely expected. For firſt, I took no notes in writing of any Sermon preached by me for this eight years last paſt, and if I had, yet theſe being (as the Informers well call them) meerly paſſages, not poſitions or concluſions, it is not likely that I ſhould have booked any of them, <hi>2.</hi> It is (ſo far as I can learn from others, or collect by circumſtances) three years and a halfe at the leaſt, ſince the Sermon was preached; in which it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that theſe paſſages were delivered, and I have not ſo well ſtudied the Art of memory, as to recollect paſſages of ſo old a date. Nor can <hi>I</hi> hear that any of thoſe hundreds that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that publick meeting (except only theſe Informers) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>I</hi> delivered any ſuch; or can punctually call to mind any form of words then uſed; ſave the text it ſelf, <hi>Rom. 10, 6, 7.3.</hi> Though the paſſages, as here preſented without any thing conſequent or antecedent ſound ſomewhat harſh; And thoſe that know me beſt, can ſcarce think that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be ſo ſpermalogical, or egregiouſly act the part of a babler as <hi>(ipſis terminis)</hi> to deliver any ſuch: Yet do <hi>I</hi> ſo clearly diſcern ſeveral precious truths latent in, obſcured by, and ſtruck at through this miſt of words; that though <hi>I</hi> cannot own the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſimply conſidered: yet can <hi>I</hi> not diſown the things hinted at by them, without making ſhipwrack of faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118559:5"/>And hereupon <hi>I</hi> did reſolve to write an explanation of theſe paſsages: that ſo <hi>I</hi> might (according to the meaſure of light and grace received) <hi>1.</hi> Vindicate clear and free thoſe truths of Chriſt, which <hi>I</hi> looked upon as contemned, darkened, and here impriſoned through the unrighteouſneſs of men. <hi>2.</hi> That ſuch ſcruples and Queres might be removed, as may hereby have been caſt into your minds, and diſquieted the peace of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>3.</hi> That <hi>I</hi> might diſcharge mine own conſcience, and leave with you a reaſon of the hope that is in me; for the conviction, if not ſatisfaction, of all ſuch as ſhall ask for, or expect it.</p>
            <p>And now (my brethren) <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> need not in the cloſe of all to put in one caveat more againſt my ſelf, and tell you what ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſay, and you your ſelves already know, <hi>Scil.</hi> that <hi>I</hi> am a man not only ſubject to the like, but more paſſions and infirmities, than other men.

               <hi>for as a law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mr, Burgeſſe</hi>) it was <hi>Adams, Abrahams</hi> &amp;c. then though Chriſtians may heare, read, ſpeake of, and hearken to the letter which ſaith labour, and it may be but uſeful in divers reſpects as is hereafter ſhewne: yet are not Chriſtians bound to an <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> of this poſition, which is Negative, is evident: for firſt the Apoſtle oppoſes the Letter or law, as diſpenſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> unto the word of Faith or doctrine of the Goſpel which we preach, and dehorts from an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiall hearkening unto that, and exhorts to a hearing and Cordiall beleeving of this, as holding forth Chriſt the

Thirdly, The binding of Chriſtians to obey this Law, renders Chriſt unprofitable to them: for circumciſion did it not ſimply (for if ſo, doubtleſs <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould not have been circumciſed by any conſent of <hi>Paul</hi>) but becauſe it was looked upon as making them debtors to doe the whole law, Gal. 5.2, 3, 4, <hi>and neceſſarily putting them under the curſe for not doing of it.</hi> Gal. 3.10.12.

And <hi>Paul</hi> proves that as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe, Becauſe it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law, to doe them,</hi> Gal, 3.10. He propoſeth theſe texts as containing the Sum &amp; eſſentials of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. And can no more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed ſo to doe (for ought I See) then that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. cited <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8,<note place="margin">Nos igitur mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos dicit legi &amp; legem nobis, quod eadem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: nam mortuo altero conjugum nexus conjugij, utrinſ<expan>

For though it be not againſt the ſervice done in the newneſſe of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.23. any more than the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt in the fleſh; yet as this, ſo that is not exactly, <hi>Idem,</hi> the ſame there required, at leaſt, not done <hi>per eundem,</hi> by the ſame, though being ſpirituall and proceeding from the ſpirit of Chriſt, it be really the <hi>tantidem</hi> the <hi>tantamounts,</hi> nay the <hi>Supramounts</hi> and farr more acceptable to the Father, who is both the Soveraigne over, and was the giver of the Law.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of this poſition which is affirmative is as plaine. For firſt, Chriſt hath promiſed to ſend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.8, And the Scriptures plentifully declare both that and what he ſhall worke when hee is come <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, nay what he hath already wrought <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And ſure then Chriſtians ſhould looke for the ſpirit to work, and to work thoſe very works in &amp; upon them in meaſure which are promiſed and have been wrought in others. Secondly, Chriſtians are encouraged to pray for the holy Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13 and ſure not to be idle, but to worke either by, in, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118559:9"/>
upon them: and ſhall they not looke for an anſwer to their prayers? Thirdly, Chriſtians are exhorted <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> And fourthly. Seeing we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the ſpirit by the workes of the Law, but by the hearing of faith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. wee are to looke for the ſpirit to worke, not by the miniſtrie of the Law, which ſaith labour; but by the word of faith or doctrine of the Goſpell.

            <p>If any thinke that Chriſtians are hereby ſet at liberty from all liberal commands &amp; ſhal never work, but when &amp; as, and what the Spirit moves them, let him conſider, firſt. That there is a difference betwixt the commands of the Law, or letter (ſtrictly ſo called) which requires obedience (though Spiritual) to be done in the power of the Old man which is carnall. And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands of Chriſt, or given by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the Name of Chriſt, which calls for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience Spiritual, but to be done in the power of the New man, which daily fights againſt and mortifies the old.

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:118559:15"/>1, Repentance is either legal, which conſiſts chiefly in a ſenſe of, and ſorrow for the tranſgreſſions of the law, and a reſtleſſe fear of the judgements threatned and deſerved, and this (I grant) is often followed, nay commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſaying in the heart, do this or that, or what ſhall I do, this commandment or that commandment, to free my ſelf thereby from fear and bondage; Thus the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour cries, Sirs, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved.</hi> Or Evangelical, which includes a Renunciation of a mans own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the works: The <hi>Iſmaels</hi> begotten of his own fleſh, by the law, and a turning unto Chriſt, who is the Lord our Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption, and this is that hereafter ſpoken of.</p>

For, 1. This is a ſinful evading of the juſt ſentence of the Law already given by God, inſtead of ſubmitting to judgement, and acknowledging the ſin and guilt.

            <p>THis Paſſage may be reſolved into three Queries. 1. Whether there be two ſorts of people, the one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the other uncalled. 2. Whether the Goſpel only is to preached to the uncalled. 3. Whether good works are to be preached to the called.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118559:16"/>
that maintain an univerſal calling of all, of all ſorts, active at leaſt, if not paſſive. Note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by a people called, are not meant a people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon meerly by a Lecture read out of the book of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or the Dictates of a natural light. For 1. <hi>Paul</hi> (before his converſion, or that light from heaven ſhined about him, <hi>Asts</hi> 9.) had this light within him, and yet remained ignorant in unbelief: and at the height that this could lead him unto, perſecuted Chriſt and the Church. Neither can it be ſaid, that it was becauſe of his not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that light. For 1. He laboured alwayes as much as poſſible for man to do, to follow that light, and profited more than his equals. 2. Touching the law he was blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and perſecuted the Church out of pure zeale of acting according to this light. 3. He bears the Jews record, that they acted for God zealouſly according to this legal light, and yet wanted knowledge; or that Evangelical true light, <hi>which ſhines from God in the face of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6.4. The Jewes killed the Diſciples, and yet judged from this light, <hi>that they did God good ſervice, not knowing</hi> (indeed) <hi>either the Father or the Son:</hi> Joh. 16.2, 3.2. Though <hi>all the Gentiles ſhew the work of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts:</hi> Rom. 2.15. yet not any work of the Goſpel. Nay, where is it ſaid that this light ever convinced Gentile of ſin, for not believing in Chriſt? <hi>Is not this to be done by the Spirit of Chriſt?</hi> Ioh. 16.8. Or where was ever Heathen ſavingly converted, but by the fooliſhneſs of preaching? The world by wiſdom (that is this light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the utmoſt) knew not God, <hi>And therefore it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſave them that believe:</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21.3. <hi>Adam</hi> had this light, and it taught him firſt, <hi>That he was naked:</hi> 2. To <hi>Sew fig-leaves.</hi> 3. And when thoſe vaniſhed at the voice of God, to ſeek to hide himſelf, <hi>under a thick covering:</hi> But could neither teach him to confeſſe his ſin and commit himſelf unto God, nor tell him any thing of the ſeed of the woman, <hi>That ſhould break the head of the Serpent.</hi> 4. The Apoſtle diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118559:16"/>
of a natural man, and of a ſpiritual man; <hi>And though he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things, yet the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> 2 Cor. 2.14, 15. Nay, what needed Chriſt to ſend the Spirit of truth to lead the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into all truth. If the light thy already had could have diſcovered it to them, and effectually guided them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a people called, are not meant a people called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meerly by a Lecture read from the book of the creature, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, &amp;c. For 1. <hi>Though the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy works,</hi> &amp;c. Yet the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> concludes them all imperfect; <hi>As to the converting, making wiſe, and true en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening of the ſoul,</hi> and aſcribes all thoſe effects unto the word of the Lord: <hi>verſ,</hi> 7, 8.2. <hi>Though the Philoſophers and wiſe men might by contemplation come to know the eternal power and God-head,</hi> Rom. 1.20. Or, <hi>A Deum abſolutum,</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks) yet could they know nothing of a God manifeſted in the fleſh, and juſtified in the ſpirit; which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the myſtery of godlineſſe:</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16.3. God did not make uſe of any of the ſtars of the old cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but created a new one (called his Star: <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.2.)

            <p>In anſwer to the ſecond Quere. I ſay firſt the Goſpel is to be preached to the uncalled. For 1.

Secondly, that chriſtians beholding as in a Glaſſe, the Glory of the Lord, may be changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, Thirdly, the Goſpel is ſaid to work effectually in them alſo that believe: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. and chriſtians, the more they grow in grace and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the more they grow in a ſence of their own weakneſſe and unworthineſſe, which occaſions that faithful ſaying, ſtill to be ſeaſonable, and worthy all acceptation. <hi>That Ieſus Christ came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. Thirdly, The men that are moſt zealous for preſſing the Law of works, will allow the Goſpel (if a conditional covenant may be called Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) to be preached to themſelves, and ſuch like godly men whom they look upon as truly called. Nay, in old time,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118559:18"/>
Chriſt might have been feaſted at the Phariſees houſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would never reprove them for taking the higheſt roomes to themſelves: <hi>Luke</hi> 14.8. nor appear a friend to Publicans and ſinners. <hi>Luk</hi> 17.39.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if (onely) be referred unto the Goſpel, or the Doctrine to be preached, and the ſenſe of the Quere be, whether only the Goſpel is to be preached to the uncalled? Then firſt, Chriſt, in commiſſion for preaching which he gave to the Apoſtles, mentions only the Goſpel, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts not a word touching the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he that in hearing that believes and is baptized (no mention of other works) ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not, (what other works ſoever he doth) ſhall be damned: <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth that he was made an able Miniſter of the New Teſtament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, and that God hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given unto us the miniſtery of reconciliation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.9. not of death and condemnation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Law that was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> onely as hath been ſhewen, and not ſo much as for the uſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> while ſuch, but ſuppoſitively and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily in caſe they became <hi>Proſelites,</hi> and were by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion incorporated into the body of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> And for the Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam,</hi>

However the work thereof is indele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and undeniably written in the heart: the conſcience bearing witneſſe, and the thoughts in the mean while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing and accuſing one another. Fourthly, I diſtinguiſh <hi>Inter praedicare legem, &amp; praedicare de lege,</hi> betwixt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, and preaching of the Law: <hi>Praedicare de lege,</hi> or to preach of the Law, is to declare firſt what the Law in its own nature requires; and what it behoveth them to do or die, that think to become righteous, or to get life by conformity thereunto: as <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.

of life and death, according as the Scriptures deſcribe them: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. which is truly <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare legem,</hi> or to preach the Law indeed as yet alive (an abrogated, repealed, fulfilled, ſatisfied Law, being no otherwiſe a Law, then a dead man, a man) as it was never commanded by Chriſt, ſo was it never (that we read of) practiſed by the Apoſtles, and by conſequence, not now to be revived by the Miniſters of the Goſpel. And yet fifthly, This excludes not all preaching, that is minatory for thoſe that manifeſt themſelves to be poſitively uncalled (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:) and all ſorts (occaſionally) ſhould be taught, that he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.36.

               </note> when taken ſtrictly and properly, then is the Goſpel, or the triumph of Chriſt over the Law, Sin, Death, and the Devil, &amp;c. The proper object of preaching, and Miniſters more fitly ſaid to teach, then to preach good works to the called.</p>
            <p>But if this Quere or part of the paſſage (though indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite) be intended to run in equipage with the former, and that to preach good works to the called; ſhall amount to as much as to preach good works only to the called. Then conſider that good works may be taken firſt largely, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all good works whatſoever, though the immediate products of the Goſpel. As repentance and faith: or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrictly, as including only ſuch works, as are mediate effect, ſuppoſing the precedency of faith, in which ſenſe good works are commonly ſaid to flow from, or follow after faith. If we take good works in the former ſenſe. Its true, that good works, <hi>Scilicet</hi> faith and repentance, though not expreſſely all good works, are to be preached to, and required from thoſe that are yet paſſively uncalled. For, 1. Chriſt himſelf having preached the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or propoſed the object which inſtrumentally begets, immediately injoynes the duties, or calls for the Acts to be exerciſed thereabout. Repent and believe the Goſpel. <hi>Scilicet,</hi> which I have preached: <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. Secondly, In the name of Ieſus, held out as the Saviour of ſinners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and remiſſion of ſins, or as the <hi>Syriaok</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the remiſſion of ſins, is to be preached unto all nations: <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. Thirdly, <hi>Peter</hi> bids the <hi>Iewes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted: <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. And <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Jaylor to believe on the Lord Ieſu: <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. Take good works in the better ſenſe and though it be true, that <hi>Senſu diviſo,</hi> the uncalled ſhould do theſe ſubſequent works, as love the Brethren: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. Call upon the name of the Lord: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. &amp;c. as being now immediately called to obey the truth, and believe the Goſpel, by which they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118559:20"/>
may be enabled and privileged thereunto: yet not <hi>Senſu compoſito,</hi> or while uncalled: For 1. People under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſhould <hi>hoc agere:</hi> not only do the things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but in that order as they are commanded to do them: when ſervants are bidden come, they ſhould not then ſay, they'l go, and when they are bidden go, they ſhould not then come, or do this, (though both due in their ſeaſon) but when the Maſter ſaith come, they are to come: when he ſaith go, they are to go, and when he ſaith, do this, then are they to do it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8, 9.

Fourthly, Believers only are in a condition for acting in an Evangelical way, and upon Evangelical grounds (and that an Active obedience is not now to be preſſed from, or to the Law, hath and ſhall be fuller cleared) For as Mr, <hi>Shepheard</hi> no friend to <hi>Antinomians</hi> (in that very tract where he ſo learnedly oppoſeth them) ſaith; This caution is ever to be remembred, that ſuch acting be not to make

               <head>The firſt Querie.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Whether it be not good for a man to do all that he can, <hi>viz:</hi> in a way of obedience to Gods Commandments?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Man may be conſidered either in the ſtate of nature, or in the ſtate of grace, Secondly, it may be ſaid to be good for a man to do, &amp;c. either ſimply in relation to the work it ſelf, or in reference to the effects and conſequents of the work; that is, the procuring thereby either a Temporal, or a Spiritual good. Thirdly by commandments, may be meant, either the precepts of the Law as a covenant, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in nature or Scripture: or the commandments given, and as given by Chriſt who is Lord of all, even of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118559:21"/>
day. Fourthly, by way of obedience may be meant either a mans own way in which alone he can obey: or Gods way. <hi>Scilicet,</hi> Accordingly as he commands.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is good for a man in the ſtate of nature to do all that he can in way of obedience to Gods commandments, under whichſoever notion conſidered in relation to the work it ſelf. For firſt, <hi>Virtus per ſe ipſa amabilis:</hi> vertue it ſelf by it ſelf is amiable, and vice hateful. Secondly, a work that is good, though only for the ſubſtance of it, is better then that which is evil, both for the ſubſtance and circumſtances. Thirdly, it is good and commendable for any man to walk according to that light vouchſafed unto him, and not to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is good for a man in the ſtate of nature to do all that he can, in reference to the procuring of a Temporal good. For firſt, Becauſe <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, the evil was not brought in his dayes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21, 29. Secondly, the Phariſees that gave almes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, have their reward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2. though in the preſent tenſe all here, and with an (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) a thing diſtinct from God, like <hi>Eſau</hi>'s bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing gotten by ſelfiſh tears, and not God for their reward. Thirdly, the wrath of God is exemplarily revealed in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſuch as held the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, and have followed luſt contrary to the light of Law and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And though a man doing what he can, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Yet if fourthly, any ſay that to him eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be mittigated, as to the degrees of it, I ſhall not contend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not good for a man, in the ſtate of nature, to do all that he can in his own way of obedience, to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, however conſidered, in reference to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of a ſpiritual good; that is, all or any of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which are the peculiar purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt for his elect. For firſt, This is a ſeeking them as it were by the works of the Law, that is, a working to get a right to, or poſſeſſion of the bleſſings purchaſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118559:21"/>
by Chriſt, as if that were to be obtained by the carnal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of an outward command; whereas they are freely given by Chriſt, through a lively faith begotten by the Spirit in the Evangelical publiſhing of them unto ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32.4, 5. Secondly, All that a man (while ſuch) can do (though pretended and intended in a way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) really and in truth, is <hi>Rebellious Diſobedience. For the minding of the fleſh, is enmity againſt God.</hi> Rom. 8.7. and ſo by conſequence the more he can do, the more he can rebell, and procures to himſelf the greater condemnation: <hi>The minding of the fleſh is death.</hi> Rom. 8.6. And ſo the more, the more deadly: <hi>Homo non ſolum nihil poteſt ſuis viribus ad juſtitiam coram Deo, ſed etiam adjutus lege docen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; operibus per iegem extortis deterior efficitur.</hi> Thirdly, Neither Law, nor the commands under the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires any ſuch obedience as this man can perform. For the Law requires that which is ſpiritual to be done in the life and power of the fleſh; ſuch as man could have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his firſt creation. The commands under the Goſpel, call for an obedience Evangelical to be done in the life and power of the Spiris of Chriſt, ſuch as the elect onely do and can perform after their ſecond creation. If all that a man can do, were all or part of that a man ſhould do; if his way of obeying anſwered to Gods of commmanding; or if the work, when done, were good by rule of any law, there were ſome probability of it being good, for a man to do all that he can in reference to the getting of ſome good by that Law: But all things here being otherwiſe, what can mans doing be good for? But as it is ſin, ſo to procure the wages of ſin, which is death. There is none in, they are all gone out of the way, and thence are they altogether become unprofitable. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. Thirdly, there is no promiſe in Scripture (of any ſpiritual good) made to a natural mans doings though he do all that he can, and how ſhall any man call them good, in reference to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that which God hath never promiſed upon any ſuch condition? Is not piety alone ſaid to be profitable,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118559:22"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and that as, and becauſe it hath the promiſes. Fourthly, <hi>Paul</hi> did what he could in a way of obedience to Gods commandments, and yet he confeſſeth at laſt he gained nothing thereby, in reference to any ſpiritual good, but was a looſer, and found all his doings to be dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. The natural mans looking for God to give him Chriſt, or the bleſſings purchaſed by him becauſe he doth this or that, or works more than other men, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groundleſſe, having no promiſe whereupon to bottom it, but abominable; even as if a ſervant ſhould expect a pearl from his Maſter, becauſe he throwes Dirt in his face, and that more conſtantly than other men; doth that which is abomination in his ſight, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. And yet will needs perſwade both him and others that he is doing acceptable ſervice, a prime piece doubtleſſe of that Religion, which derives it ſelf, <hi>à religando,</hi> from binding of God to man, and not man to God. Fifthly, Chriſt reclaimes men in the ſtate of nature, from doing all that they can in their own way of obedience to Gods commandments, to do that which is not onely beyond their abilities to do,, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their underſtandings, (while ſuch) to think that they ſhould do it,<note place="margin">Cenſet ne idem eſſe hominem hartari ad poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam, &amp; ad utendum ſuis naturalibus?

What ſhall we do (ſay the <hi>Iewes</hi>) that we might work the works of God? This (ſaith Chriſt) is the work of God, &amp;c. Actively and Paſſively. The work now commanded to be done by you, and yet the work which onely is, muſt and can be done by God, <hi>John</hi> 6.28, 29. <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do,</hi> ſay thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37? <hi>Repent,</hi> (anſwereth <hi>Peter</hi>) or abandon the preſent thoughts and actings of your minds, whereby you are alienated from God, and yield your ſelves up as dead loſt men, to be baptiſed or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under water with Chriſt in Baptiſme, thence to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by his mighty power alone to newneſſe of life. It
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118559:22"/>
is therefore good for a man (inſtead of doing what he can in his own formal Hypocritical way of obedience to the outward commands) Firſt to learn experimentally from the luſting and rebelling of his own heart againſt Gods commandments, that he can do nothing but ſin. That when the commandment comes, <hi>Sin reviveth; that ſin taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the commandment, and worketh in him all manner of concupiſcence, Rom.</hi> 7.8, 9. Secondly, to acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſinner and guilty of death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. Thirdly, To digeſt judgement, or admit (without pleading for himſelf) the letter or law to condemn and kill him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10, 11. Fourthly, Not to ſtick to ſave himſelfe actively, by doing and conforming to the letter. But paſſively to ſuffer God to work in him, upon him, and concerning him, the whole power of his will by the power of his word: for if dead, he may perhaps hear that which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did nor could while he was alive, even (not the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor Epiſtle only ſent by meſſengers) but the voice of the Son of God, and in hearing, <hi>Believe and live.</hi> Joh. 5.25.</p>
               <p>And here we conclude, that it is hurtful for a man in the ſtate of nature to be active, or do all that he can, or any thing he is able to imagine he either can or ſhould do in reference to the procuring the ſpiritual goods or bleſſings purchaſed by Chriſt, and firſtly conferred upon his Elect, as Regeneration, converſion, faith and Repentance: and (that we may the more particularly prove and clear this) conſider that here, and in order to the collation of theſe; it is true, that the ſumme of all the commandments is that of the Sabbath, or a ceaſing of man from his own works, or working according to a form or letter. <hi>Nos praedicantes fidem omnino dehortamur ab operibus homines, ut praedicemus Sabbatum, non operando, ſed patiendo boni ſumus cum patimur divinas actiones quieti ipſis.</hi> Your ſtrength is to ſit ſtill. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.7. For if man muſt act or be active in reference to his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118559:23"/>
Regeneration and converſion, which is the firſt ſpecial bleſſing that is conferred by Chriſt. I ask firſt, whether as an efficient principal, or inſtrumental? Not as principal, for if ſo, he might be ſaid to Regenerate or beget himſelf, the old man to be the father of the new man; nay the new man the workmanſhip of the old, made in himſelf by works Antecedent, and not created in Chriſt unto works ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: <hi>That which is born of the fleſh be ſpirit,</hi> contrary to <hi>John</hi> 3.6. Not as inſtrumental under God; for firſt, <hi>We are not begotten by corruptible, but incorruptible ſeed by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>Of water and the Spirit, not water and the fleſh.</hi> John 3.5, Secondly, If a man were actively inſtrumental in his Regeneration, he might of neceſſitie be actuallie alive before regenerated; for how ſhould man act before he have life? But man is not actuallie alive, before Regenerated, <hi>But dead in ſin and treſpaſſes.</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. And therefore not activelie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in his regeneration; nay, he is ſo far from being an inſtrument, that he is not ſo much as the matter out of which life is educed, but only into which it is induced by the Spirit of life, <hi>in materiâ privativâ non poſitivâ operatur Deus.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Quid inſanius fingi poteſt,</hi> as <hi>Luther.</hi> Doth not the fleſh fight againſt the Spirit, <hi>at actu,</hi> and how then ſhould it act for and with the Spirit, before, or in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Fourthly, he ſhould not; for the Law doth not command any man to be born from above, or of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt; And Chriſt doth not require any man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate himſelf from below or in the power of his fleſh. All in this Kingdome of heaven is to be done in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own Spirit, the commands preſuppoſing the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it in the Goſpel. And hence is that (as the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Spirit) to be preached antecedentlie unto thoſe, even to every creature. And then doth this new husband, Chriſt call for the bringing forth of thoſe children to God, which he hath already begotten by that immortal ſeed of the Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If man be or ſhould be active herein, he muſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118559:23"/>
needs antecedently know and will his converſion, and the means of it, for otherwiſe he acts ſenſuallie as a beaſt, not as a man: but he neither knowes, nor wills either of theſe antecedentlie, or till he be regenerated, but oppoſes and accounts them fooliſhneſſe. That he knows them not is plain, firſt from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> caſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.4. who could neither apprehend the thing, nor tell any means or way to it (though Chriſt had already told him) <hi>But entering the ſecond time into his mothers womb:</hi> The new man in this reſembling <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> Heb. 7.3, being to a natural man (for oughr he can find in Scriptures) without Father, without Mother, and without Deſcent, neither having beginning of daies, nor end of life; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is made not after the manner of the ſonnes of men, but like unto the Sonne of God. Secondly, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it commeth, and whether it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> John 3.8. Thirdly, <hi>We must be known of God, before we can know God.</hi> 1 Cor. 8, 2, 3, Gal. 4.9. <hi>Quia cogniti ſunt, ideo cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcunt: I know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</hi> John 10.14. <hi>Man must be born again or from above, before he can ſo much as ſee the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> John 3.5. Nor can he ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently will either of theſe. Firſt, becauſe he cannot know them, and it is a general maxime, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido.</hi> If there be none that underſtandeth; there is ſure for being any that ſeeketh after God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11. He knowes doing the old way, and naturally can will as the old end, ſo the old way, to do, to be ſaved: but not ſuffering, which is the new. He can as little think of dying in, and to his own fleſh, with which he ſo ſweetly now converſeth, as the Diſciples, of Chriſts ſuffering thoſe things, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his Glory. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. Oh what living man can think: that either we muſt, or that the Captain of our ſalvation was made perfect through ſufferings? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. Secondly, the Text is plain. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13, <hi>Which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118559:24"/>
the will of man, but of God.</hi> If any ſay, that a man may ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently will regeneration, or converſion, by antecedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works of grace, though not of nature. I anſwer, firſt, <hi>It is ſaid that God worketh in us, to will.</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>And to will is preſent with us, who are born of God,</hi> Rom, 7.18. but never that he worketh it in them that are unborn: So that ſecondly, To will converſion is not a work of grace ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but ſubſequent thereunto, and argues the Infant born and alive, though yet it cannot tell ſo much; but only cries, thirſts and hungers, for in this very willing, there is a turning towards God, and then undoubtedly a believing on the Lord Ieſus. And he that believeth, is born of God. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.1. Thirdly, Chriſt puts not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of entring into the Kingdom upon mans doings, but upon Gods; he ſayes not, except a man beget, bear, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf; but except a man be begotten, born again, or (as ſome read it) from above, and be converted, <hi>He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat 18.3. <hi>

I ſee little that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleaſed, or that others can ſay againſt it, and not in the latter, For firſt, God hath appointed means to be uſed by the living, through which he hath promiſed to beget faith in all the elect (though for the preſent dead) <hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the Goſpel,</hi> Mar. 16.15, but of means appointed of God for the dead to uſe, thereby to get faith, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the raiſing of themſelves from and by God, we read not, If any ſay that prayer is a means, then firſt, If by prayer be meant the interceſſion of Chriſt, it is granted, for it is his interceſſion alone that procureth the actual collation of all thoſe bleſſings purchaſed by himſelf in the fleſh, promiſed in the new Covenant by the Father, and conveyed to us by the Spirit. But if by prayer be meant any petitioning of ours, then is prayer not a means to, but a conſequent of faith; for firſt, <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not believed.</hi> Rom. 10.14? The interrogation is equivalent to a ſtrong negation, <hi>viz.</hi> they cannot. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Chriſt taught his Diſciples to pray in faith, not before, nor for faith.</hi> Mat. 21.22. unleſſe by faith be meant the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof, and then we pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith.</hi> Luke 17.5. <hi>I believe, Lord help my unbeliefe.</hi> Mar. 9.24. Thirdly, he called them to leave all and follow him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they asked him any ſuch a thing. <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> John 15.16. and after he had called them, he preſcribeth them a form of prayer, or teacheth them to pray after this manner, ſaying. <hi>Our Father which art in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 6.9. Luke 11.1, 2. And is it now agreeable to that form or letter, to teach men to preferre the petitions before they can ſay the <hi>Preface?</hi> or to enjoyn them to pray <hi>thy Kingdome come,</hi> before they can cry <hi>Abba,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:118559:25"/>
or, <hi>Our Father?</hi> Theſe men (I fear) would teach their Scholars all the Alphabet of Chriſtianity before Chriſts Croſſe, all the petitions before the <hi>Preface,</hi> and it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then (that as ſome coppies do) they will leave out the concluſion alſo, and the obſervation of all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before that which ſtands in the front, <hi>Scilicet, I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Secondly, God hath made no promiſe to an impenitent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing man (while ſuch) that upon condition of uſing ſuch and ſuch means, or performing ſuch and ſuch duties, he will beſtow upon him either of thoſe, where it is ſaid either implicitly, or expreſſely; if thou wilt do thus and thus, I will give thee faith, or I will give thee repentance? And how any doing or dutying of man, ſhould be called means of getting any thing from God, unleſſe in a moral conſideration, and way of cauſation, as conditions to ſome promiſe; I have not yet learned from thoſe Maſters, that ſtile one another the Orthodox Divines. Thirdly, though many enquired of the Apoſtles, <hi>What they ſhould do to be ſaved:</hi> yet did never any ask what they ſhould do to get Faith, Repentance, Converſion, Regeneration, or to get Chriſt, into Chriſt; nor did the Apoſtles leave any Directions or Rules to be obſerved by ſuch Queriſts in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times: but brought the word nigh unto them into their mouthes, and into their hearts, even the word of faith which we preach: and tells them, that faith comes by hearing, and that hearing is not an Antecedent act of their own, but that that alſo cometh by the word of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8.17. The legal reſolving of theſe Queries, and the teaching of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> Diſciples how to beget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſecond time by entring into their own fleſhly wombes, is left to the Grand Caſuiſts of theſe our dayes, who can direct their followers, how to beget that which is ſpirit, of that which is fleſh, and how to get the fruits of the Spirit by doing the works of the Law; can either aſcend to heaven, or go beyond the Sea to fetch ſuch commandments (as were neither given by <hi>Moſes</hi> nor

               <p>The Commandement of the Sabbath may be taken either literally or myſtically: when taken literally, if we attend only to the outward form and draught thereof, forbidding (for divers reaſons) all ſervile works on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning it to be kept holy.

For firſt, All the commandements (except the fifth) though implicitly they may be called affirmative, and ſaid to require thoſe duties; the contrary whereof they forbid. Yet explicitly and according to the letter of them they are Negative, enjoyning a ceſſation from our own works, or forbidding man to ſin, which is in effect, a bidding man be quiet, for he can do nothing but ſin.

Upon which ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet reckons the ſeveral kinds, by which he might make it evident, that the true obſervation of the Sabbath doth conſiſt in a denial of ſelf and entire converſion. Hence do we clearly ſee wherefore God doth ſo highly commend in Scriptures the obſervation of the Sabbath: for he looked higher than the external ceremony, that is, the reſt and quiet in which the <hi>Iewes</hi> did think their holineſſe to be? But rather would have the <hi>Iewes</hi> bid adieu to the affections and luſts of the fleſh, and yield up themſelves in obedience to him; Becauſe no man can live the life of the heavenly Kingdome; unleſſe he be dead to the world, and to himſelf. Now when that ceremony is abrogated, nevertheleſſe the truth doth remain, becauſe Chriſt is dead, and is riſen again, that we may have a perpetual Sabbath, that is, may keep holy-day, or ceaſe from our own works, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God may act powerfully in us. Thirdly, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gods reſting from his works propoſed for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, both in the commandement it ſelf, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the injunction to the <hi>Iewes</hi> for a total ceſſation from all ſervile works, teach and confirm the ſame thing: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth work therein, ſhall be put to death: ye ſhall kindle no fire throughout your habitations.

Sabbath doth not imply a ceaſing from, but a ſpiritual act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good works; yet it implies a ceaſing to account the good works acted to be ours or our own, according to that. <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God that is within me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevrtheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Gal. 2.20.

Sixthly, Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> as he doth moſt learnedly argue for an external Sabbath to be obſerved at certain times, and on ſpecial dayes: ſo doth he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an internal Sabbath from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 2. which ought continually or every day to be obſerved, it reſting from all ſin, and reſting in God by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 77.80. And yet I do not hold that Chriſtians in this life can perfectly keep the Sabbath. For firſt the fleſh is againſt the Spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>They find a law in their members, warring againſt the law of their minds, they cannot do the things that they would, when to will is preſent with them, how to do that which is good, they find not.</hi> Rom. 7. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards the mark, trying if by any means he might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the reſurrection from the Dead, and yet confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he had not yet already attained, neither was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect. He followed after, and was perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Chriſt Ieſus, but could not perfectly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 14. And hereupon as a wretched man crieth for deliverance from the body of this death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Deſireth to depart and to be with Chriſt, which he reputed gain, and farre better.</hi> Phil. 1.21, 23. And that <hi>Paul</hi> not attain to a perfect conqueſt over the fleſh till death, or his departure hence, and ſo no to a parfect ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſing from ſinne and in Chriſt, ſeemeth evident: Firſt, from the time in which he maketh this acknowledgement of his, not having attained, which was (doubtleſſe) not long before his death. This Epiſtle being writ by <hi>Eupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraditus</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:118559:28"/>
from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was then impriſoned (and as ſome <hi>vinculis ſecundis</hi>) Chapter 1. verſe 13. he had writ (if we credit either the Hiſtories of others, or what is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from his own writings) ten of his Epiſtles, fulfilled the greateſt part of the courſe of his miniſtery, being a Profeſſor and a Preacher at leaſt thirty years, and preſſed ſtill toward the mark, trying if by any means he might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And if after all this, he acknowledged that he had not attained; ſhall we profeſſe our ſelves actually to have attained that which he could not? Secondly, After he had been caught into Paradiſe, or the third heaven, and heard unſpeakable words not poſſible for man to utter; There was given to him a Thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, and that upon this ground, becauſe after that he was imperfect, and in danger to be exalted above meaſure through the abundance or Revelations, 2 Cor. 12.7. And for this thing he beſought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. But it was denied as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent either with his ſafety, or the advancement of Gods Grace, Power, and Glory, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and fourteen years after this, he confeſſeth himſelf the ſame man, to ſtand in need of the ſame pricks and buffettings, and that therefore moſt gladly will he rather glory in his infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is no ſuch thing mentioned either in any of his own or the Epiſtles of others that bear a latter date, and it is his own rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. not to think of men above that which is written. Thirdly, the life that we live in the fleſh, is not a life of ſence or of the fleſh, as if we did not die daily through the ſtrength of ſin, or had not matter of confeſſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8, 6. Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. and ſelf-condemnation. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. But the life that we live in the fleſh, is by the faith of the Son of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. we walk by faith and not by ſight. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. The God of hope filleth our hearts with peace and joy, not in ſeeing, but in believing. <hi>Rom</hi> 15.13. And hence I do aſſert with <hi>Calvin.</hi>

The works of the Spirit when wrought, being alwayes agreeable thereunto (though I dare not ſay) that the Spirit in working is at any time guided therby.

weakneſs and death of ſelfiſh fleſh. Thirdly, The rule or form may be obſerved by Chriſtians in acting, and yet Chriſtians not alwayes obſerve a form or rule, when and while they act. Artificers that have any acquired habit, may work agreeable to the rules of art, and yet not always by their artificial rules. The rule is alway <hi>Regula operis,</hi> a rule of the work, and it is wrong if not agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but not alwayes <hi>Regula operantis,</hi> the rule of the worker (<hi>Scilicet</hi> in working) for it is not contrary to the rule, though he ſometime work without looking at it: So the work be wrought accordingly; and when wrought,<note place="margin">It is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the rule to give power to conform unto it (nor to command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity) but to be that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which we are to be conformed. <hi>Shep.

Fourthly, As the Spirit is the Pylate; So this form is the compaſſe, not by which he ſteereth, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we are ſteered. As the Spirit is the guide: So this form is the rule not by which he guideth, yet according to which we are guided. As Chriſt in Spirit is the King or Ruler, ſo is this form the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he (though an abſolute Prince) is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to declare, we ſhall be ruled by. Fifthly, As the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ruleth and governeth according to theſe ſciptural laws enacted in heaven, and proclaimed by the Apoſtles on earth: So theſe Scriptural lawes require us to be ruled and governed by the Spirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">As the Spirit leads us to the word, ſo the word leads us to the Spirit, &amp;c. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 89.</note> and make it death either to reſiſt the commands of this governour (who alwayes commands agreeable to theſe lawes) or yeeld obedience to any other, whether fleſh, world, or devil, who would rule according to their, or our wicked luſts. Sixthly, the Negative commands do <hi>obligare ſemper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> always and unto all times: ſo that it is a tranſgreſſion of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ever to obey either fleſh, world, or devil (ſuppoſe that the Spirit did ſuſpend his Actings for a time) The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative <hi>Semper,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> alwayes but not unto all times (except that of walking after the Spirit, becauſe that virtually containeth all the reſt.

The determining in <hi>individuo,</hi> when and which of theſe works is to be done by each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtian, is left to the holy Spirit, whom Chriſt hath ſent to govern and guide his Church by the law of light, life and love unto the end of the world. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe firſt Chriſt could not diſcharge thoſe relations of Head, Husband, Biſhop, King, Lord, and Captain: all which (keeping within the bounds of the General Law) Determine for thoſe under them. <hi>Qua tales,</hi> when, and which particular duties each ſhall do, <hi>I ſay to this man go, and he goeth, to another come, &amp; he cometh, &amp; to my ſervant do this, and he doth it.</hi> Secondly, There would be no ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but only againſt the letter; whereas the great ſin is called the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: and offering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite to the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. Thirdly, Chriſtians now ſhould be in the ſame bondage as the <hi>Iewes</hi> were under the Law. <hi>Scilicet,</hi> bound <hi>Sub poena peccati &amp; mortis,</hi> to act at the meer commandment of the letter, <hi>Rom,</hi> 7.9. <hi>But the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus, haeth made them free from that law of ſinne and death.</hi> Rom. 8.2.14. So that it is not the letter it ſelf; when of it ſelf commanding, or as ſimply ſpoken by our neighbour, but to Ieſus Chriſt himſelf ſpeaking in the letter, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things contained in the letter, that Chriſtians nextly and immediately owe their obedience. And hence it is clear, (for ought I yet ſee) that though ſin <hi>De facto,</hi> when committed, be firſtly and formally the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the letter or law without: yet in <hi>fieri,</hi> or in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it is firſtly and more directly againſt the Spirit or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118559:30"/>
law of the mind, that is, within. And though it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that to croſſe the Spirit, is not that which firſtly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the fact ſin: yet it is that which firſtly maketh this or that Chriſtian a ſinner. If thou wilt know, in the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, what is Rebellion, and what is ſin, conſult with the letter, or Law, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.4. But if thou wilt know in <hi>individuo,</hi> what is rebelling and ſinning, or who rebells and ſins, look within thine own heart, even now ſtanding out againſt ſome or other of the perſonal commands (which are alwayes legal) of Jeſus Chriſt our King and Lord; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, &amp;c. <hi>Rev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 3, 20. <hi>The words that I ſpeak are Spirit and life.</hi> John 6.63. If any ask, how ſhall Chriſtians know when to do this, and when that, or which of theſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is to be done. Firſt, muſt they ſet down the time themſelves, wherein they will perform ſuch and ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Shall they appoint aforehand ſuch an hour they will pray, and ſuch an houre they will mourne for ſinne, and ſuch an houre they will do acts of charity? &amp;c.

And as in reſpect of times and ſeaſons they are not to be enbonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or impoſed upon by others: ſo much leſſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: what hath any man to do to be his own Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker? By multiplying lawes, to multiply ſins? Or to bind himſelf in ſuch things, as theſe in which Chriſt hath left him at libertie? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. Sith ſecondly, It is clear that Chriſt never appointed any ſet times for his Diſciples, nor ordered them to appoint any for themſelves to perform ſuch and ſuch duties in, but left them free both as to the particular times to perform the duties in, and as to the particular duties to be performed in ſuch and ſuch times. He ſaid, <hi>When ye pray, pray thus:</hi> not, ye ſhall pray, then, and there, and this; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6, 7, 9. and in like manner, <hi>When ye give almes, and when ye fast, and as often as ye do this, do it, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 6.2, 3. Mat. 6.16.7. 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. Nay, where do the Apoſtles, throughout their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118559:31"/>
ever enjoyn any ſuch thing to Chriſtians, or ever reprove them for the neglect of any ſuch a duty. Thirdly, There is the ſame reaſon for Chriſtians to limit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto certain places, <hi>ſubpoena peccati,</hi> as unto certain times which yet none do, which know (in any meaſure,) what is meant by chriſtian liberty? Though nevertheleſſe, fourthly Chriſtians out of a conſideration of one anothers infirmities (while here in the fleſh) as well as for order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and conveniencies ſake, both may and ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point times and places for aſſembling themſelves together, to provoke unto love and to good works, and ſo much the more as they ſee the day approaching, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and are then in a ſpecial manner to ſtir up the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or gifts that are in them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. being ſtrengthened <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in, or by the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. Secondly, muſt Chriſtians wait for extraordinary impulſions of the Spirit? No; For firſt, though ſometimes, and upon ſome ſpecial occaſions, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be vehemently ſtirred or ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in Spirit,<note place="margin">Chriſtians may expect <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to forcibly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or born anew, as the Prophets. Though men may thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point dayes to worſhip God, yet they cannot ſtate any ſuch dayes, but only as Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence calls them to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therefore it were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſin, if a State ſhould appoint once every year to be a faſting-day in a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way; God did ſo, but men have no power to do ſo, the reaſon is this; becauſe they do not know, but God may call them to rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing upon that day, they have nor the liberty of the time, &amp;c. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in Hoſ. <hi>Lect.</hi> 8. <hi>pag</hi> 409.</note> as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.16. yet not alwayes. The work of the Spirit may be irreſiſtible in it ſelf, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly produce its effect in, or upon, and yet not work irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly as unto us. For ſecondly, our Spirits are not ſaid to be forced but freed, made free, or freely carried out to work by the Holy Ghoſt. He worketh in us to will. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Thy people ſhall be a willing people in the day of thy power, Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Thirdly, The Spirit ordinarily worketh us to, or in us, this or that by propoſing to us objects ſutable to the eye or eare, as appeareth from thoſe Ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt himſelf. And therefore thirdly, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (like the wiſe Virgins, <hi>With oyle in their veſſels, with their lamps:</hi> Matth. 25.4.) ſhould continually watch and wait for their Lord and Maſter Jeſus, to call them forth to all or any of theſe, either immediately by ſpiritual ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and heavenly impreſſion upon their hearts and minds, or mediately by providential objective admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations and occaſions; as, and when it ſhall ſeem good

Secondly, Chriſt adviſeth, <hi>Not to let the left hand know what the right hand doth.</hi> Mat. 6.3. And though he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118559:33"/>
himſelf be pleaſed in mercy to ſay, <hi>Well done thou good and faithful ſervant,</hi> Mat. 25.21. yet he teacheth us to ſay, (though we did all things that are commanded us) <hi>That we are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> Luke 17.10. Thirdly, The Phariſee is checked for preferring himſelf before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, (though he acknowledged all the diſtinguiſhing works to come from God) <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 14. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. And thoſe that pleaded, Lord, Lord, have not we &amp;c. ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering acquaintance with God from a recital of the more than ordinary works, which they had done in his name; Hear God profeſſing unto them. <hi>I never knew you, Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23.

Fifthly, Glorying in our own righteouſneſſe, and duties, or performances, argues a reſting and rejoycing in them, and ſeven of our eminent Divines (five now Commiſſioners appointed, &amp;c.) Aſſert; That Chriſtians when they abound in much doing, and well doing,<note place="margin">In an Epiſtle prefixed to Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> ſhould be ſtill as much afraid of reſting in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, as of committing ill. And be content to have all flowers withered, that refreſh them without Chriſt. And when after humiliation and caſting down for ſin, they begin to ſtand upright (as they think) upon the legs of their prayers, performances, inherent graces, and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, expreſſed in their lives and converſations. They may, yet notwithſtanding all this be brought, not to glory in themſelves, but in Jeſus Chriſt; and willingly come down from the throne of their own conceits, ſufficiencies, abilities, and lye at the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool and threſhold of Ieſus Chriſt. That ſeeing they know nothing; are nothing, have nothing, do nothing, they may be nothing in their own eyes, that Chriſt might do all their works in them and for them, and ſo may whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live upon Chriſt and to Chriſt, ſtill drawing vertue from him, ſeeing a need of Chriſt and nothing elſe, and finding a fulneſs and help in him, and nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:118559:33"/>Secondly, chriſtians when they glory, ſhould not glory in their gifts, whether inward or outward, For firſt, It is forbidden, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.29. Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches. Secondly, they are but common to the Reprobate and the Elect; No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1. See <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. Thirdly, who maketh thee to differ from another, and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doeſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gifts are beſtowed upon us by God as inſtrumental, to draw our hearts to glory in the mercy, bounty, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of him that gives, and that he is ours, though we, more unworthy than other men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10. and not in the enjoyment of the gifts themſelves, or that they are ours, and other men more unworthy than we. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. Thirdly, Chriſtians when they glory, ſhould not glory in their ſins. For firſt, chriſtians by their ſins grieve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, whereby they are ſealed to the day of Redemption <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. and therefore are they to grieve and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their ſins, (which is inconſiſtent with glorying in them) nay, even for the ſins of their brethren. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. And this godly ſorrow worketh repentance, not to be repented of; <hi>Scilicet,</hi> A deteſtation and renunciation of all ſins, I am troubled that I made you ſorry, and yet not, for what zeal, what revenge, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11? Secondly, Chriſtians ſhould be ſo far from glorying in, that they are, or ought to be aſhamed of their ſins: what fruit had you then in thoſe things, whereof you are now aſhamed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21? And the carnal earthly minded chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians glorying in the ſatisfaction of their luſts, are ſaid (as a thing moſt abominable) to glory in their ſhame. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. Thirdly, the Saints, as <hi>Iob, David, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently brought by God to loath and abhorre ſinne and themſelves, becauſe ſinners: but never either to glory in their ſins, or in themſelves, becauſe they had ſinned againſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118559:34"/>
that gracious God, <hi>Who doth neither behold iniquity in</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>nor ſeeth perverſeneſs in</hi> Iſrael. Numb. 23.17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer affirmatively, chriſtians, when they glory, ſhould glory in the Lord: For firſt, Chriſt of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſnes, Sanctification, and Redemption; that according, as it is written, <hi>He that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30, 31. Secondly, Glory is peculiar unto the Lord, <hi>My glory will I not give unto another,</hi> Iſa. 42.8. <hi>Thine is the Kingdome, Power, and Glory.</hi> Mat. 6.3. Thirdly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I will glory <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in mine infirmities, or in the weakenings, and diſenablings of my ſelf, (from attaining eaſe in the fleſh) by thoſe croſſes, pricks, or buffettings of Satans meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers; yet not ſimply in them as conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but becauſe he found them Inſtrumental (through the wiſe and merciful ordering of his God) to take away all occaſion of glorying in any fleſhly things, and to give occaſion to the grace and mercy of God, to appear as ſufficient for him, and to the power of God to be made perfect through thoſe his infirmities, and to reſt in and over him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. that ſo he might be brought to reſt, rejoice and glory (which is the true chriſtian ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batizing) only in the Lord. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>That the anſwer to the ſecond Querie may be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and clear, note firſt, chriſtians are either formal, ſuch only in outward profeſſion: or ſpiritual, ſuch alſo in deed and in truth. Secondly, The Pronoun (they) may relate either to theſe very Chriſtians meant in this paſsage, or to ſome others ſpoken of in a precedent, connected (though here omitted) diſcourſe. Thirdly, The quantity of the Praedicate is not to be ſupplyed with the adverb <hi>Semper,</hi> alwayes, or conſtantly, but with <hi>Maximâ ex parte,</hi> for the moſt part, or moſt commonly, or <hi>aliquando</hi> ſometimes, Fourthly, glorying is either inward in the heart, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in words, And then this either real, which is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, or a publick narration of our ſins accompanied with a conceit of an excellency in, and a delight ariſing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118559:34"/>
from them, or imagined; and ſuch only in the accompt of ſome ſort of men, being indeed nothing elſe but a publick confeſſion of our ſins, accompanied with a deteſtation of, &amp; an inward compunction for them. Fifthly, Sins are either of ignorance or knowledge, either ſuch as appear black and ugly, or ſuch as appear white &amp; beautiful in the eyes of men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Formal Chriſtians when they glory, do moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly glory both inwardly and outwardly in their ſeemingly beautiful, if not ugly ſins. For firſt, The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees (an embleme of ſuch) are ſaid to ſound Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2. and make their brags <hi>De ſplendidis peccatis,</hi> of their fair outſide ſins, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. which though high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed by men, yet are abomination in the ſight of God. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. Secondly, The falſe Diſciples are ſaid (as their common practice) to glory in appearance, or in the face, that is, in outward diſguiſing, and that coloured ſhew of mans wiſdom and eloquence. <hi>Engl. Annot.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. and the embondaging of others to the legal yoke. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.13. Thirdly, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That ſuch profeſſors as minded earthly things, gloried in their ſhame.</hi> Phil. 3.19 And is it not apparant, that many in theſe dayes do ordinarily boaſt of, and rejoyce in, fulfilling thoſe luſts which they, like ſlaves, are ſecretly making proviſion for; If not (I ſay) in fulfilling thoſe that are from-wards them, bringing ſhame abroad, and want at home; as drunkenneſſe, whoredom, ſwearing, and the like, yet in fulfilling thoſe that are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, bringing profit and worldly honour, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, pride, envy, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The moſt ſpiritual chriſtians, when they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, do in heart if not in words, ſometimes glory in their ſins, if not of knowledge, yet of ignorance, if not ſuch as appear ugly, yet ſuch as have a fairer ſhew in the fleſh.

                  </note> there is no Scripture that requireth them for that end, but calleth mens labouring with that intent, a ſeeking for righteouſneſſe, as it were, by the works of the Law, and not by faith. <hi>Rom</hi> 9.32.2. <hi>To him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4, So that if works were means to procure the new Covenant, Juſtification, we were not juſtified freely by grace, but of due and debt. It ſhould not be ſaid to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly <hi>His faith is counted for righteouſneſſe, but to him that doth work and meriteth, from him that juſtifieth the godly, his work is imputed, for it is righteouſneſſe.</hi> 3.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118559:39"/>
no promiſe thereof made to him that worketh or doth righteouſneſs. It is no where ſaid in Scripture, either ex. preſſely, or implicitely, that he that will work, or perform ſuch and ſuch duties, ſhall be juſtified by the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Nay, though we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>Whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth is juſtified,</hi> yet it is no where ſaid, <hi>He that will believe, ſhall be juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Righteouſneſſe or good works are not profitable to me or other Chriſtians: either as the way through which we come, as the means by which we ſhall get, or as the condition upon which we may ground our hope of eternal Glory.<note place="margin">It is onely Chriſt that opens heaven, it is onely Chriſt that is the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beſides him there is no way, no truth, no life. Mr. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> Not as the way: For firſt, not works, but Chriſt alone is in Scriptures called the way. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith unto him, <hi>Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way: Ieſus ſaith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by me,</hi> John 14.5, 6. <hi>He hath conſecrated for us a new and living way</hi> (in oppoſition to the old dead legal way) through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10.20.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Works cannot be the way, becauſe they are neither the truth; that is, the ſubſtance of the Law, and ceremonies; nor the life which was held forth in the promiſes, for they being not the truth; we who are unworthy, muſt not paſs that way, and they, not being the life, we who are ſold under ſinne, cannot paſſe: So that though works were granted to be a way in themſelves, yet it is impoſſible, that they ſhould be a way unto us. The Gulf is ſo great, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26. that there is no deſcending or aſcending, but by <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder which was put down by God, and not put up by men: and is of that length, that the top reacheth as high as God in heaven: and the foot as low as <hi>Iacob</hi> laid upon the ſtone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.13, 14.3. A way is a ſteady and immoveable thing mounted ſo high, that the waters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overflow it, and thence called a high-way: but works are ſandy and ſlippery, ſoon overflowed, and not able to bear us up in the time of Temptation: Though we know nothing by our ſelves, yet who dare ſtand upon this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118559:39"/>
ground; and plead not guilty before God. 4. Faith might more probably be called the way to heaven than works: Sith as the Apoſtle ſaith, by faith we ſtand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24, and have acceſſe by faith into the grace wherein we ſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 2. And yet is faith only ſaid to be a coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way, as <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.35. and never called the way it ſelf. Let therefore works be called (as they truly are) <hi>viae Regni,</hi> the wayes of the Kingdome: or motions of thoſe that are in the way, not upwards to God, for the good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but downwards to men for the good of others, or the going forth of Chriſtians from God (like the Angel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14.) to do ſervice for Chriſt in the world: and not their coming to God by Chriſt (as in faith and prayer) to wait upon and converſe with him in heaven. Not as a meanes. For firſt, The Scriptures hold them forth as ſuch. 2. If the works of Chriſtians be the means or inſtumental cauſe, then are Chriſtians themſelves conſtituted the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe: and conſequently the Authours of their own ſalvation. And then it ſhall not only be true that Chriſt is the Authour of eternal ſalvation to thoſe that obey him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. But that Chriſtians are the Authors of their own ſalvation by their obedience unto Chriſt. 3. Promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel that ſeem moſt legal, do not run like thoſe of the Law of <hi>Moſes, He that doth theſe things ſhall live by them, that is, by them as means of life:</hi> But ſimply thus, He that doth ſuch or ſuch things, ſhall live and be ſaved, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet,</hi> by the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Nor as conditions upon which we may ground our hope of glory. For firſt, <hi>It is not works, but Chriſt in us, that is the hope of glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. In all other grounds there is yea and nay, a doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uncertainty, which occcaſioned <hi>Bellarmines Tutiſſimum est, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore no ſure and ſtedfaſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage for the ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. But all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him <hi>Amen</hi> unto the Glory of God; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. And thence as there needeth not, ſo there is not any other ſure and ſtedfaſt ground of our future enjoying the things promiſed, but the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118559:40"/>
of Chriſt in the heart by faith. 2. As other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or ground of hope can no man lay than that is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, So the very attempting to lay another ground, is both an overturning of the Faith, and a turning back unto the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It being not the title and intereſt to the Kingdom, or the <hi>Ius ad rem:</hi> But the poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, or the <hi>Ius in Re,</hi> that was promiſed in the law, and to be hoped for by the <hi>Iewes</hi> in caſe they could obſerve it. 3. Let works be made the condition upon which (as ſome aſsert) Chriſtians muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsarily ground their hope of Glory, and there will be no ground of hope left for ſuch as walk in darkneſs, and have no light. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. or that cannot by a reflexe Act di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern themſelves actually, performing ſuch and ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Firſt, The admonition of the ſeven bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the forecited Epiſtle, <hi>Scilicet,</hi> there is a ſturdy ſtoutneſs and unyieldingneſs of ſpirit in men againſt the bleſsed truths of the Goſpel made known unto them, they muſt have peace, comfort, and aſsurance their own way, or elſe they reject all; They would find a principle of life and power within themſelves, and not go to Chriſt for it; they would bring ſomething to Chriſt, and not fetch all from Chriſt, not knowing that the way which all believers have gone (after much wearying of themſelves to find ſome thing in themſelves) hath been at laſt to rowle themſelves wholly upon the free grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing nothing in themſelves, yet giving glory to God by believing. And if they could bring their hearts ſo diſpoſed and qualified, yet they ſee the danger of reſting in what they are, have, and do. And if want of ſuch and ſuch conditions and qualifications, had ground enough to keep them from Chriſt, it might have hindred any that ever did caſt themſelves upon the free grace of God, becauſe they would ſtill have been at a loſſe, finding a defect in them.

That he that is born of God, may have the ſeed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, that he cannot ſin, and yet not always be able to bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe; at leaſt not always ſee himſelf ſo bringing forth, for that the being of grace in, doth not neceſſarily infer the ſeeing of grace by a chriſtian.

Secondly, they are profitable, &amp;c. to prevent Satans bringing believers into deſpaire, or ſhaking us on, though he cannot ſhake us from of the foundation of our faith. And hence doth <hi>Peter</hi> exhort Chriſtians to adde to their faith (through which they were already eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>Vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, &amp;c. and aſſureth them that if they do theſe things, they ſhall never faile.</hi> 1 Pet. 1, 10. Becauſe by the conſtant going on in theſe, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is taken from Satan of caſting ſtumbling-blocks in our way, which the committing of groſs, or diſcernably poyſonous ſins doth afford unto him, they being as it were Darts put into the devils hands, which he ſets on fire in hell, and ſhoots with terrour through the Canon of the Law, to batter down that ſpiritual Kingdom of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, peace and joy, which Chriſt hath erected in us. 3.
