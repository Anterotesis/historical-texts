         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. Grimſtons Speech, IN The Houſe of Commons, concerning the diſtempers between the King, and both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Maſter Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Would fain bring one ſtone to our building now in hand and it is but a caveat to the Maſter builders, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of thoſe who hinder the worke, and pull down by night, what is built up by day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> there are that ſpeake loudly to the King, and in agitating of all matters, ſeem very tender of him, but ſubſtances, and ſemblances, eſſences, and apparences, are oppoſite: <hi>Multa Videntur quae non ſunt,</hi> theſe would make us believe, that our redreſſing of ſome grievances, is the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of ſome flowers from the Crown, and hereby they caſt maine and intricate doubts, wherewith to retard and perplex our proceedings, and to lay an ill favoured imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us, as if we were regardleſſe of our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155780:3"/>
and theſe good men, the onely Battreſſes of his Royalty: by this they endeavour to endeare themſelves to the King, for their own advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have him guided by their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and to take off his affection from his beſt, and moſt Loyall Subjects, Aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Maſter Speaker, The King and his Subjects are Relatives, and we know that in Logicke; <hi>ne lato ſublato tollatur Correlatum,</hi> they that disjoynt the King and his People, doe neither better nor worſe but doe their utmoſt, to un-King him.</p>
            <p>M. Speaker, The King is the Parentthe Husband ſolemnly eſpouſed at his Coronation, the head of the Republike, as it is with the natural parent, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Head: So it is with the publike: the naturall parent beſtoweth on his Child, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and love, with all his fruites: the Child return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him filiall reverence with all due reſpects, and he that laboureth to breake this intercourſe, by poſſeſſeing the parent with an evill opinion of the Child, is equally an enemy to both.</p>
            <p>There is a ſweet eccho of conjugall affections
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155780:3"/>
between the married, and he that ſhall go about to interrupt it, is a hater of them both, and a ſubverter of their Family.</p>
            <p>In the naturall body, ſuch is the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Head, that a ſeparation is deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to both, where as otherwiſe, the head in the body, being the ſeate of the vitalls, and the brain in the Head, of the Animall Spirits, reciprocally communicating preſerve the whole: Our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soveraigne is the common parent, Husband, and Head, if therefore there ſhall be any found to be as undermining Pyoners envying to diſaffect our parent to us, to divorce us from this our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to divide us from our head.</p>
            <p>My juſt motion is, that upon a watchfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, whereon I would have every mans good intent, they may receive the extremity of ſeverity as they deſerve, and if any of them ſhall prove member of this Houſe, that the Furnace may be heated ten times hotter, for betraying the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them, by their County that ſent them hither.</p>

            <head>A Speech ſpoken in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by Sir BENIAMIN RUDYARD.</head>

               <salute>M. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the way we are, we have gone as far as words can ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie us: We have voted our own rights, and the Kings Duty: No doubt there is a Relative Duty between a King and Subjects; Obedience from a Subject to a King, Protection from a King to His People. The preſent unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py diſtance between His Majeſty and the Parliament, makes the whole Kingdome ſtand ama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d, in a fearfull expectation of diſmall calamities to fall upon it: It deeply and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably concerns this Houſe to compoſe and ſettle theſe threatning ruining diſtractions. M. Speaker, I am touch'd, I am pierc'd with an apprehenſion of the honour of the Houſe, and ſucceſſe of this Parliament. The beſt way to give ſtop to theſe deſperate imminent miſchiefs is, to make a fair way for the Kings return hither; it will likewiſe give beſt ſatisfaction to the people, and will be our beſt juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> That we may the better conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we are now in, let us ſet our ſelves three yeers back: If any man then could have credibly told us, that within three yeers the Queen ſhall be gone out of England into the Low-Countreys, for any cauſe whatſoever: The King ſhall remove from his Parliament, from London to York, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf not to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe here: That there ſhall be a totall Rebellion in Ireland, Such diſcords and diſtempers both in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155780:4"/>
Church and State here, as now we find; certainly we ſhould have trembled at the thought of it: wherefore it is fit we ſhould be ſenſible now we are in it.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if any man then could have credibly told us, That within three yeers ye ſhall have a Parliament, it would have been good Newes; That ſhip-money ſhall be taken away by an Act of Parliament, the reaſons and grounds of it ſo rooted out, as that neither it, nor any thing like it, can ever grow up again; That Monopolies, the High-Commiſſion Court, the Star-Chamber, the Biſhops Votes ſhall be taken away, the Councell Table regulated and reſtrained, the Forreſts bounded and limited; that ye ſhall have a trienniall Parliament; and more then that, a perpetuall Parliament, which none ſhall have power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve without yout ſelves, we ſhould have thought this a dream of happineſſe; yet now we are in the reall poſſeſſion of it, we do not enjoy it, although His Majeſty hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and publiſhed he will make all this good to us. We ſtand chiefly upon further ſecurity; whereas the very having of theſe things, is a convenient faire ſecurity, mutually ſecuring one another, there is more ſecurity offered, even in this laſt Anſwer of the Kings, by removing the perſonall Votes of Popiſh Lords, by the better education of Papiſts children, by ſupplying the defects of Lawes againſt Recuſants, beſides what elſe may be enlarged and improved by a ſelect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Houſes, named for that puapoſe. Wherefore Sir, let us beware we do not contend for ſuch a hrzardous unſafe ſecurity, as may endanger the loſſe of what we have already; let us not thinke we have nothing, becauſe we have not all we deſire, and though we had, yet we cannot make a Mathematicall ſecurity, all humane caution is Suſceptible
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155780:5"/>
of corruption and failing; Gods providence will not be bound, ſucceſſe muſt be his, he that obſerves the wind and rain, ſhall neither ſow nor reape, if he can do nothing till he can ſecure the weather, he will have but an ill harveſt.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> It now behoves us to call up all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we have about us, for wee are at the very brinke of Combuſtion and Confuſion: If blood (once more) begin to toueh blood, wee ſhall preſently fall into a certain miſery, and muſt attend an uncertain ſucceſſe, God knowes when, and God knowes what. Every man here is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to employ his uttermoſt endeavours to prevent the effuſion of bloud; blood is a crying Sinne, it pollutes a land: Let us ſave our Liberties and our Eſtates, as wee may ſave our Souls too. Now I have clearely delivered mine owne conſcience, I leave every man freely to his.</p>
