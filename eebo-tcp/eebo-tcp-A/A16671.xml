            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was moued by her friends to addresse her selfe for proceedings both more answerable to her Fortunes, more correspondent to the generall intentions of her friends, and more aequiualent to her yeeres, being now in the flower of her Time, and increase of estate. After a modest, yet halfe-assenting repugnance, shee condiscended to their request: leauing <hi>Vesta</hi> and her retired habitations, and now consecrating her laies and hymnes to <hi>Hymen,</hi> wishing no doubt, his furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to her otherwise affected disposition. It chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that (on a solemne festiuall day) when all shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards leauing their pastures, and making recourse to a Temple erected neere to the foresaid mountaine, they offered sacrifice to <hi>Pan</hi> (the shepheards God) that he would preserue their flockes, &amp; giue encrease vnto their heards, according to the custom of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the <hi>Lupercalia</hi> be solemnised by the mountaine <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi> the <hi>Parilia</hi> were kept in honour of <hi>Pales,</hi> for the preseruation of cattell: such were the feasts of these <hi>Arcadian</hi> shepherds. Now in the performance of their vowes to <hi>Pan,</hi> ere their solemnities were half finished, came in <hi>Eliza</hi> with other amiable maids, to see the order (as it seemed) of the shepheards in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their festiuals. The passionate shepheard <hi>Beril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who before had conceaued no little affection of the demure carriage, modest gate, and well-respected, &amp; reputed conuersation of <hi>Eliza,</hi> had no sooner fixed his eyes on her, then his sacrifice was ended, his deuotion cooled, and those many orisons which he made to <hi>Pan,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4897:6"/>
conuerted to the honour of his Saint &amp; shrine <hi>Eliza.</hi> Much loue he professed by his eye: for though <hi>Pan</hi> had his knees, yet that honour was but externall, <hi>Eliza</hi> had his heart, no lesse reuerencing her presence, then he did <hi>Pan</hi> with outward appearance. <hi>Eliza</hi> at last obserued (as what woman, if faire, knowes not her Beautie?) that irreuerberate fixing of his eyes, by the transparent characters of his lookes, measuring his loue, shee (not to dant the poore shepheard) gaue him a modest smile, which gaue no lesse content to <hi>Berillus,</hi> then if <hi>Pan</hi> had descended and confirmed their vowes with his presence.</p>
            <p>The sacrifice ended: yet the flame which appeared at the sacrifice not extinguished in the loue sicke shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards brest, continued his passions, not hopelesse, because resolued such Beauteous colors could not bee soiled with the blemish of a remorcelesse heart: but as the Syreus neuer portend more raine, then when their voice is most delightfull, nor the Crocodyle more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, then when feigned semblances shew her teares most remorcefull, so this bitter sweet, seemed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pittie, and to accept of the poore shepheards sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, registring his sobbes, sighs, and vnfained pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the Tablet of her heart: vowing acceptance if her parents assent confirmed her election. But see that generall vice (innate to her sex,) leuity of minde, estraunged her intentions, and made the forlorne shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard more wretched, in that his former hopes had made him blessed: shee contemnes his giftes, scornes his

suite, plaies vpon his simplicitie: so as the shepheard surprised with a sympathie of passions, in that his hopes and great expectances are made abortments: proined of their expected growth, and blasted in the prime of his affections, sits descanting of his discontents: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his pipe the surdon of his sorrow: to expresse his languishments more fully, in an abrupt straine of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords (as that harmonie best suites with his present fortunes) lying deiected on the ground (best repose for his declining hopes) thus intimates his owne miserie: shadowing (though couertly) womans inconstancie: shutting vp his ode with this conclusion: They are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, who haue seene (and by seeing) haue bene cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of a louers miserie, and womans obduracie, hating where they propound most euident and infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of their sincerest loue.</p>

            <p>The inuention of <hi>Lucian</hi> is pleasant: prosecuting his whole discourse with such apt and accommodate words, that I could not chuse but take a modest digression, to describe the powerfull effects of labour, the soueraigne remedies of good and vertuous studies against the obiections of such, who
