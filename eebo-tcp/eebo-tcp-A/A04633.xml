            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>INPRIMIS, It is couenanted and agreed, by and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the parties abouesaid, and the said <hi>Spectators,</hi> and <hi>Hearers,</hi> aswell the curious and enuious, as the fauouring and iudicious, as also the grounded Iudgements and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, doe for themselues seuerally Couenant, and agree to remaine in the places, their money or friends haue put them in, with patience, for the space of two houres and an halfe, and somewhat more. In which time the <hi>Author</hi> promiseth to present them by vs, with a new suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Play called BARTHOLMEW FAYRE, merry, and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none. Prouided they haue either, the wit or the honesty to thinke well of themselues.</p>
                     <p>It is further agreed that euery person here, haue his or their free-will of censure, to like or dislike at their owne charge, the <hi>Author</hi> hauing now departed with his right: It shall bee lawfull for any man to iudge his six pen'orth his twelue pen'orth, so to his eighteene pence, 2. shillings, halfe a crowne, to the value of his place: Prouided alwaies his place get not aboue his wit. And if he pay for halfe a

dozen, hee may censure for all them too, so that he will vndertake that they shall bee silent. Hee shall put in for <hi>Censures</hi> here, as they doe for <hi>lots</hi> at the <hi>lottery</hi>: mary if he drop but sixe pence at the doore, and will censure a crownes worth, it is thought there is no conscience, or iustice in that.</p>
                     <p>It is also agreed, that euery man heere, exercise his owne Iudgement, and not censure by <hi>Contagion,</hi> or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>trust,</hi> from anothers voice, or face, that sits by him, be he neuer so first, in the <hi>Commission of Wit</hi>: As also, that hee bee fixt and settled in his censure, that what hee approues, or not approues to day, hee will doe the same to morrow, and if to morrow, the next day, and so the next weeke (if neede be:) and not to be brought about by any that sits on the <hi>Bench</hi> with him, though they indite, and arraigne <hi>Playes</hi> daily. Hee that will sweare, <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> or <hi>Andronicus</hi> are the best playes, yet, shall passe vnexcepted at, heere, as a man whose Iudgement shewes it is constant, and hath stood still, these fiue and twentie, or thirtie yeeres. Though it be an <hi>Ignorance,</hi> it is a vertuous and stay'd ignorance; and next to <hi>truth,</hi> a confirm'd errour does well; such a one the <hi>Author</hi> knowes where to finde him.</p>
                     <p>It is further couenanted, concluded and agreed, that how great soeuer the expectation bee, no person here, is to expect more then hee knowes, or better ware then a <hi>Fayre</hi> will affoord: neyther to looke backe to the sword and buckler-age of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> but content himselfe with the present.

The husbandman ought not for one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful yeer, to forsake the plough; The Shepheard ought not, for one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not for one leake i'the poope, to quit the Helme; Nor the Alderman ought not for one custerd more, at a meale, to giue vp his cloake; The Constable ought not to breake his staffe, and forsweare the watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper o'the Parish (<hi>Vt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis componere magna solebam</hi>) to put vp his pipes, for one rainy Sunday. These are certaine knocking conclusions; out of which, I am resolu'd, come what come can, come beating, come imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discouer who I am, till my due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I said euer, in Iustice name, and the King's, and for the Common-wealth.</p>

Good Sir, heare mee, I am worth sixe thousand pound, my loue to you, is become my racke, I'll tell you all, and the truth: since you hate the hyporisie of the party-coloured brother-hood. These seuen yeeres, I haue beene a wilfull holy widdow, onely to draw feasts, and gifts from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled suitors: I am also by office, an assisting <hi>sister</hi> of the <hi>Deacons,</hi> and a deuourer, in stead of a distributer of the alms. I am a speciall maker of marriages for our decayed <hi>Brethren,</hi> with our rich <hi>wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi>; for a third part of their wealth, when they are marryed, for the reliefe of the poore <hi>elect:</hi> as also our poore handsome yong Virgins, with our wealthy Batchelors, or Widdowers; to make them steale from their husbands, when I haue confirmed them in the faith, and got all put into their custodies. And if I ha' not my bargaine, they may sooner turne a scolding drab, in to a silent <hi>Minister,</hi> then make me leaue pronouncing <hi>reprobation,</hi> and <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> vnto them. Our elder, <hi>Zeale-of-the-land,</hi> would haue had me, but I know him to be the capitall Knaue of the land, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rich, by being made <hi>Feoffee</hi> in trust to deceased <hi>Brethren,</hi> and coozning their <hi>heyres,</hi> by swearing the absolute gift of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. And thus hauing eas'd my conscience, and vtter'd my heart, with the tongue of my loue: enioy all my deceits together. I beseech you. I should not haue reuealed this to you, but that in time I thinke you are mad, and I hope you'll thinke mee so too, Sir?</p>
