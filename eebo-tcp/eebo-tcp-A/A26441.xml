         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ooking back to the perils that I
have paſſed, in my paſſage through
the boiſterous Sea of a troubleſome
world; being affected with my own
folly, and willing to witneſs my
affection to thee, I am forced to
ſhame my ſelf, to ſhew the courſe I ſteered, that
thou mayeſt ſteer another courſe. Let my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
excuſe thine; by me take thou warning;
I would not preſage a ſhipwrack, but prevent it;
out of doubt there will be ſtormes at Sea; when
thou ſeeſt the wracks upon the Rocks, ſteer ſo, as
to ſhun that which hath ſplit me; expect to meet
with croſſe and cruel blaſts; prepare thy tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for a tempeſt, leſt the Ship be over-ſet, or
come to ſhore too ſoon. Man is of few dayes, and
<pb facs="tcp:45844:3"/>
full of trouble; his ſtay ſhort, his ſorrows ſharp,
he is no other, but the Channel wherein the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Marah</hi> flow; what a variety of miſery at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
him? ſtill in a ſtate of ſorrow; one wave
comes upon the neck of another, and threatens to
drown him. It were as needleſſe as endleſs, to
give thee an account of the cares and croſſes he is
ſubject to; thou wilt know too much of this too
ſoon. It is my deſign to fit thee for the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that being fore-warned, thou mayeſt be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
that no force may foyl thee. I would
have thee to acquit thee bravely, to ſcorn either
to ſtagger or ſtartle. Promiſe not to thy ſelf a
happineſs that never any had; the decree is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
record, and there is no exemption, or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Look about thee, and tell me, if thou
canſt, the condition free from trouble! Roſes
have their prickles; there are motes in the Sun;
conveniences have their inconveniences, and
comforts their contraries; neither is the honey
worth the ſtinging: If thou attaineſt the thing
thou wiſhedſt for; thou wilt want what thou
didſt wiſh for in it: never any gave chaſe to
the creature, that came not home by Weeping
Croſſe; yet is it not ſo much the fate of moſt,
as their fault, that they ſuffer: a wiſe man
will miſſe the Mire, and ſhunne the Sloughs
<pb facs="tcp:45844:3"/>
wherein I have ſtuck. Take heed to thy
ſtanding; it is not the unevenneſſe of the
way, but careleſneſſe, that commonly occaſions
falling: I have known ſome come down on
plain ground, that have ſtood in a rugged
place. Let neither hand nor foot ſtirre, but
as thine eye directs them; manage thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
with diſcretion; if Providence hath
dealt thee an ill Game, mend it by thy play;
the beſt Gameſter uſually winnes. Create not
to thy ſelf croſses, and do nothing to deſerve
them: Why ſhouldſt thou purchaſe pain? or,
make any work for Repentance?</p>
            <p>When things go croſſe, make a vertue of
neceſſity, and be content, where thou canſt
not prevent: to ſit down and cry, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lighten thy burden, nor ſhorten thy jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Slight what thou canſt not ſhun; what
muſt be, why not willingly? Haſt thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar
to drink? make not thy draughts more
tart with thy tears. Take the ſowre with
the ſweet; what is not toothſome, may be
wholeſome; beſides, it becomes a Child to
drink of the cup his F<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap> gives him; he
knows beſt, what is beſt for thee. Why ſhouldſt thou
then be troubled at any thing? ſnarle not at the
ſtone, but learn to ſmart and ſmile. Every Bird
<pb facs="tcp:45844:4"/>
will ſing in the Sunne, and the Spring; Be
thou merry in a Winter's day; what falls out
without thy fault, concerns not thee to feel.
Be ſtill the ſame in every ſtate; imitate the
Cedar, not the Shrubb; move not with the
greateſt blaſts, and let not changes change
thee.</p>
            <p>It will be all alike e're long, whether thy
way hath been up hill or down, fair or foul,
when thou art at home: The Traveller for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
his weary ſteps, when he hath recovered
his Journey; what though it may blow hard?
a ſtorm may drive thee to thy Harbour; and
it matters not how much thou haſt been toſſed,
when thou art landed. The poor Mariner
thinks no more of the Sea, when arrived, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to make the Shore the ſweeter; and O the
pleaſant proſpect on Mount <hi>Zion!</hi> Let this
bear thee up, it ſhall be better in a little while;
ſuffering will not laſt long; afflictions will leave
thee, or thou them; it will clear up, or thou
get ſhelter; ſtorms will be ſpent, or elſe be paſt;
the Furnace is not to conſume, but refine; and
after thy tryals comes thy triumph. Have a
good heart, Heaven will make amends; one
hours being in glory, will requite all: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſweat, blood, and tears ſhould mix together,
<pb facs="tcp:45844:4"/>
and thou with pain ſhouldſt get the prize,
when what is wonne is worth it; Can a
Crown coſt too dear? look up, and hold out,
hoping but a while; what is in thine eye, ſhall
be in thine hand.</p>
            <p>Thus, thou ſeeſt what thou mayeſt expect,
and needeſt not be ſurprized. I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
fit thee for the worſt, and leave ſome
token of my love behind me, that thou may-learn
to live, when I am dead. I know
not how ſoon thou mayeſt be deprived of the
counſel of a Father, as thou wert too ſoon
of the care of a moſt tender Mother. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man loſt better Wife, nor ever had
Child greater loſſe: But ſhe needs not an
Encomium, and is above my praiſe; I
ſhall ſhew my love beſt to her, in my love
to him ſhe left me; this put me upon the
preſent, which (by accident) is become
publick, I am too conſcious of my own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to go about to teach the world wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
But as for thee, I am perſwaded
thou wilt not deſpiſe my Affection. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what I tell thee, when I am rotten, and
forgotten; thou art entering upon the Stage,
I am going off; ſo act thy part, that at
thy <hi>Exit,</hi> the Spectators may clap their hands;
<pb facs="tcp:45844:5"/>
do nothing unworthy of them or thy ſelf; In
a word, ſo live, that thou mayeſt never
be aſhamed to live, nor afraid to dye; to
thee to live, let it be Chriſt, and to dye
will be gain. The Lord guide thee with his
Counſels, and afterwards receive thee to
Glory.</p>
